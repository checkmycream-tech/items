    <ol>
            <li>Great DEAL!</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used - AND it doesn&#x27;t need a battery.  </li>
            <li>this a try, I can almost guarantee you will be impressed.</li>
            <li>I was impressed, however, after getting our of the shower, I started to see a ton of spots where it cut me.</li>
            <li>The shave of the Schick Hydro is that impressive.</li>
            <li>STRICTLY ONLINE provides superb customer service.  </li>
            <li>With 5 blades and a trimmer it has got to be one of the best razors ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>An excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>best thing\\&quot; a try.</li>
            <li>The best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>I did try with the hyrdro shave gel (which I also tried with the schick quattro) and I wasnt impressed.</li>
            <li>This razor is the BEST i&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>And no I do not miss the awesome marketing of vibration shaving</li>
            <li>As for the razor review, it&#x27;s the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I immediately hopped on Amazon and wrote this review about it.</li>
            <li>Best razor on the market, or so says my husband.</li>
            <li>best description I can come up with is \\&quot;beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Fusion user for years and have always thought it was the best shaver on the market.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, for a blade shave the Schick Hydro 5 is the best shave I ever had.</li>
            <li>I also do not care which manufacturer makes the best razor.</li>
            <li>Up until now, I&#x27;d start all my reviews for razors stating that women get the best razors.</li>
            <li>And the best part?</li>
            <li>With some trepidation i opened the Hydro and was impressed by the weight and the feel of the razor.  </li>
            <li>I even went out an purchased the Hydro shaving gel to compliment the razor and have had a wonderful experience using this razor.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>, I think you will be very happy.  </li>
            <li>If Schick had brought the blades closer in combination with the skin guards, the shaving experience would be superb ala Gillette Fusion Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and will recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this razor is awesome</li>
            <li>it gives an awesome shave it glides with ease over the skin with luborcating gel</li>
            <li>I get an equally excellent shave with both the Hydro and Fusion,</li>
            <li>Best razor on the market.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best razors I have ever owned and the replacement blades are not a stab in the gut.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever used and  </li>
            <li>provides a great close shave!</li>
            <li>impressed--</li>

            <li>It was the best head shave</li>

            <li>If you are a guy that shaves your chest, this blade is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good articuluo , curbio</li>
            <li>you want a good deal... try to find yourself a MACH 3!</li>
            <li>Good job Shick!</li>
            <li>GREAT razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman and have used the gillette fusion razors and have been happy with them.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Mach 3, and thought it was a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Looks great too.  </li>
            <li>and it felt great.</li>
            <li>Schick has made a great product that works.  </li>
            <li>and I gave my Wife this which she says works great on her legs.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 gives a great shave</li>
            <li>have been using gillette fusion power all my life (even before the power glide came out) and I had been happy with fusion.</li>
            <li>now I am working 4 or 5 days, the closeness and the feel after the shave is great.  </li>
            <li>With the 5 blades, it does a great job of slicing through my whiskers.  </li>
            <li>i gave it 5 stars because its a great razor.</li>
            <li>Leaves me with a great shave, close, comfortable...perfection.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>but it gave me a great shave.</li>
            <li>It is just a great experience in shaving.  </li>
            <li>Great razor and</li>
            <li>also the pivot feature of the blade is a great feature.</li>
            <li>you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;m going to try the dollar a month shave club, but this blades great.  </li>
            <li>Still, can&#x27;t complain about Schick, great product.</li>
            <li>These blades used to be a great shave</li>
            <li>The razor has a great life span, I bought this around November</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>There is a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>hey what more can you ask for?!?!?</li>
            <li>Used it a lot - it is very nice.</li>
            <li>the trim feature is very handy.  </li>
            <li>awesome product great razor works a million times better than gillete</li>
            <li>I took the razor off my legs and the song, along with the amazing way the razor felt against my leg, was gone!</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>The hydro system is OUTSTANDING and has given me one of the best shaves in quite some time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been to impressed by most Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>The cartridges are much better constructed and the flip-back lube bar is an excellent and functional solution that works well.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor you can buy period :)</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the Gillete Proglide when that came out, and I still think that&#x27;s a very good razor, but the Hydro 5 is more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, for the price.</li>
            <li>I figured since the marketing was so good to try out the Hydro 5 blade.  </li>
            <li>Comfort wise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it might be on part with the Gillette Mach3, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as good as the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>Sturdiness, precision, smoothness; these are the attributes I&#x27;m looking for in a good razor.</li>
            <li>I loved how well it hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li>, I can get almost as good a shave from the Hydro5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Gillette guy for years and figured Fusion was as good as it was gonna get.</li>
            <li>The Schick Quatro is a good example.</li>
            <li>I went on vacation and thought I didn&#x27;t want to take my good fusion blade</li>
            <li>I decided to try this Schick razor instead of the Gillette Fusion because of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just not as good as my Mach 3 with regards to the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>This razor is good for that job.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever and the vibration is good for a couple things.  </li>
            <li>This razor is good for that job.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well.</li>
            <li>I shave five days a week, and get 20 good shaves from the Hydro, compared to 15 from the Fusion.</li>
            <li>so although its a good close shave with the Proglide</li>
            <li>It seemed this was as good as it got...until Hydro 5 came along.</li>
            <li>a good blade for the money ..</li>
            <li>All were great products in their own times of release and always bettered the generational existence..</li>
            <li>Cartridge hinge was also not as good for me.</li>
            <li>Good luck if you decide to buy this.</li>
            <li>Good quality shave.</li>
            <li>this would be a superior razor.</li>
            <li>This could be a good razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the not so good:  </li>
            <li>It also shaves exceptionally well with one pass.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette cleaned everything to the skin with exceptional comfort.</li>
            <li>While not the best razors, I find the performance excellent for the price and quality of the shave - especially if you have semi-sensitive</li>
            <li>This razor is smooth, feels great, and does a really great job.</li>
            <li>Close Comfortable Razor With a Brilliant Design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember thinking how great the Gillette Sensor Excel was, and how it couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I did not pay for mine as I would have regretted the purchase.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will buy more blades.</li>
            <li>Let your skin recover over the weekend when you can; many women say they find the scruff attractive.</li>
            <li>Good purchase, nice razor.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the proglide soon to compare it against the hydro, but as of right now the hydro is the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good looking razor, it works really well and best of all the replacement blades are $3 cheaper than Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>When I felt my face I had the closest, best, and most irritation free shave I have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure that Bill would appreciate it!</li>
            <li>Love this razor!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the seller and the product!</li>
            <li>&quot; I love it!</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is the handle, the handle is very comfortable, ergonomic and cool</li>
            <li>Schick does the best body shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Solid handle and easy, smooth to move almost everywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li>I used this razor on my legs and it felt amazing.</li>
            <li>But since I use an amazing shave &#x27;gel&#x27; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>Schick Hydro 5 is amazing.</li>
            <li>The pack comes with a great case to store your shaver and comes with an additional cartridge to keep you smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor does amazing work and my face felt real smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Five blades and a lubrication bar might be great for a women&#x27;s legs but it cannot fit under the nose to shave a man&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>The five blades make it amazingly close.</li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth, impressively close and so comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Van der Hagen Deluxe soap</li>
            <li>Pick one up and give it a shot on your own.</li>
            <li>Nice - and way better than Good News.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one benefit is that it has that nice hydro gel feature.  </li>
            <li>Shick handle is well constructed, hefty and feels &amp;#34;substantial.&amp;#34; I liked the feel quite a bit.</li>
            <li>It was nice.</li>
            <li>Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade,  Mach 3 , Proglide and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li>I used the Hydro5 for 5 weeks straight, and it is the best blade shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I used to have the Gillete Fusion Proglide and I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Fusion Proglide so it was nice to see how this Schick Hydro 5 compares to the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>The one I now have was not shaving as close as I liked</li>
            <li>Shave after a warm shower and use a pre-shave oil to get two weeks of comfort out of a HYDRO 5 cartridge...</li>
            <li>I can feel the hydration from the Hydrating Gel Reservior and feel that it does a wonderful job of providing a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, it kind of pulls, as if I was using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This was also while using warm water and Barbasol shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Nice item, good price, one can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li>I liked this razor.</li>
            <li>Razor handle is made of  metal and plastic making for a nice feel.</li>
            <li>The head swivels nicely to avoid nicking knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I have to disagree.</li>
            <li>Awesome product....very smooth and comfortable when I shaved my beard.</li>
            <li>The soothing gel that is released is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Presumably you will also use shaving cream of some kind, but the gel has an aloe-like feel and seems to lotion the shaved surface after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>A week&#x27;s life is about all you can expect for effective use and even on sale</li>
            <li>I received these from a BzzAgent campaign and I can honestly say I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li>five bladed gem is excellent and smooth on skin, One thing I observed with schick razors is that they work smooth with the application of foam rather than gel.</li>
            <li>I tried the Hydro 5, and can honestly say I like it</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and feels well made.  </li>
            <li>I could never find an electric razor I liked.  </li>
            <li>quality, nice package.</li>
            <li>Still a great, clean, and close shave - just pulls a bit.</li>
            <li>but I use this to shave my head and it does a great job at giving me a clean cut.</li>
            <li>it my first impression of Hydro5 wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>but if I use a razor with too many blades it causes more harm than good</li>
            <li>Overall, I got a good shave, but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>looks pretty good to me!</li>
            <li>think the added 2 blades provided a much smoother shave than the Gillette, but there were two areas that did not seem to get a very good cut.  </li>
            <li>Good, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it with the old fashion shave soap and the results have been excellent.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the razors I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette Machs offers the best shave but are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the Schick Hydro® 5 Sensitive Razor and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>So far I am really impressed.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Barring that, it&#x27;s a much more effective blade for the price.</li>
            <li>Smoother shave and closer cut(I have sensitive skin too) and the trimmer works great too!.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, i don&#x27;t know how this razor got soo many 5 star ratings</li>
            <li>It just was not as good and effective as the Fusion because I had to use more strokes to get a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very good to be a runner-up blade but far from being as amazing as the Fusion.</li>
            <li>I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!!</li>
            <li>Shaving ease and comfort was outstanding, I&#x27;d go so far as to say the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The Best so far yay :)</li>
            <li>When I decided to upgrade from disposables, I wanted something that would be a good shave at a reasonable price, and the Schick Hydro 5 was a good choice.</li>
            <li>I have found the Hydro 5 knicks the skin very easily, and I have cut myself more times in two months than I ever did with the Proglide.</li>
            <li>Works great fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I found barbasol foam to be more suitable for this blades and longevity of blades increases with usages of foam over gel, Of-course</li>
            <li>The aloe solution gives a very comfortable feel on every pass.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and does not nick or pull at the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without using any creams or gels, the razor gave a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette Fusion Power for quite a while now and very comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who is looking for a super good razor.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the three blades razors but this was a great razor and I am not sure if it is the layout or size or good quality of the blades</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors including the Proglide,Sensor, Sensor Excel and Mach 3&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I actually got this as a gift, but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Way better than the quattro</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be a 4.5-5.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave -</li>
            <li>Both the handle and the cartridges themselves are plasticky and lack the satisfying heft, but also the sleekness, of the Fusions.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not a terrible razor</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the Hydro 5 more than the disposable.  </li>
            <li>but because two companies have a lock on the market, there aren&#x27;t really many alternatives.</li>
            <li>There are more options than Gillette out there.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro, however, is FAR superior to the Quatro and easily as good as the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I could see the lines where the hydro strip was going through the shaving cream and thought it was interfering with my shave more than anything.  </li>
            <li>I thought for $8, I&#x27;d give it a spin, and I thought 5 blades should do a much better job than 2,</li>
            <li>conclusion was that this would be ideal if you have a sensitive skin but does not offer a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a Mach 3 ever since going up from the Sensor XL many years ago.  </li>
            <li>The parts that did get shaved were nice and smooth but some how I seemed to miss areas (or the razor</li>
            <li>Most days I use a Braun electric, but I also use a blade to shave my head.</li>
            <li>but I would guess the fusion is still better.</li>
            <li>I would have to assume this has to do with the angle of the razor and also the cartridge that you can flip up on the top.  </li>
            <li>Also i love the gel lubricant.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I can actually say I look forward to shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they used better materials or sharpening methods or magic....</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind this inconvenience because this razor is that much better than the vibrator</li>
            <li>I like most readers did not do well with the quattro version of schick.</li>
            <li>I have been getting 4 weeks and more per blade doing this vs the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I switched to an electric to see if they have gotten better.</li>
            <li>(went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra.</li>
            <li>A lot of companies can&#x27;t figure out that part of the popularity of their product is the pricing aswell as the design.oved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3 (went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette has the multimillion dollar ad campaign, but Schick has the better product.</li>
            <li>How many blades will they add before the razor wars are over?</li>
            <li>and I feel as though I would have gotten a better shave with a piece of looseleaf paper....</li>
            <li>no matter how many days it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li>some of the reviews in youtube also said that this product is better than gillette fusion products.</li>
            <li>also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li>Holds up well and the flip top to reveal</li>
            <li>Been over 2 months and the same blades are still working perfectly.</li>
            <li>This razor does not shave any better for sure.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor out there.</li>
            <li>like many people I have now went backwards to a DE and</li>
            <li>-love- lathering up my cranium and razoring off strips of hair.</li>
            <li>I will recommend to others and buy more when it comes to replace...</li>
            <li>I have used an electric razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>, I just need to try better cream.</li>
            <li>but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I can get many, many shaves before replacing the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using  this for a month or more</li>
            <li>I think that you will find it to be a MUCH better shave than Gillette offers.(Can&#x27;t believe I just said that</li>
            <li>This happens even more, once the gel reservoirs start to sink.</li>
            <li>Well, let me start off by saying that I have been shaving for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the strip with the Aloe and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro is a bit more imprecise.</li>
            <li>IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.    </li>
            <li>Well this razor (Schick Hydro 5) is much better than anything I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>I thought most razors these days were gimmicks.</li>
            <li>Schick should improve the quality of their razor to be more metal than plastic</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro 5 is everything you could want in a razor, and more.</li>
            <li>I really love the comfort of the handle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s one of the best out there (especially for the price).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic, which is okay, since this avails one to buy and try rather than say \\&quot;BS\\&quot;; thus I bought Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>So, with 4 days of stubble on the noggin top, I attacked it, deciding to use a bit more pressure to see if it could instigate some razor burn.</li>
            <li>I had to find something better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and replacment cartridges are cheap as well!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>at all the blades, why are so many blades needed?  </li>
            <li>All they do is rake your face and cut way more than u need.  </li>
            <li>I realize everyone is different, but it is the best option I have found up to this point.  </li>
            <li>I am not quite sure how I feel about this razor compared to the juggernaut of the industry the Gillette Fusion Wizard Master Pro Slip and Slide Glide</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t quite make a determination as to which is better.</li>
            <li>I have many more ingrown hairs in my legs now since using these.</li>
            <li>If you use disposables, you will probably love how your face feels.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a milder razor than the fusion but infinitely better for the skin</li>
            <li>Dragging a razor across my face is more like sledding than a clear-cutting operation.</li>
            <li>It took me more time to shave and I had cuts all over my face.</li>
            <li>but I love Gillette.</li>
            <li>Shaving Man or Women doesn&#x27;t matter :)</li>
            <li>but I can tell you one thing for sure and</li>
            <li>The five blades do cut the hair thats for sure.  </li>
            <li>Gillette razors are better.</li>
            <li>&gt; The 5 blades mixed with the aloe holder make this product awesome.</li>
            <li>Plus, he said the cartridges for this cost so much more.  </li>
            <li>some reason, the blades for this razor have the lubrication strip on the top.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strips were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The shave was so close and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the razor and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks, I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>the lubricant reservoir that folds back to allow you to see and shave under the nose and edge the sideburns perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There may be another razor out there that can give a shave better than the Schick Hydro, but I know nothing about it.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor.</li>
            <li>switched to this after many years with Venus .</li>
            <li>I currently use a Mach 3 which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>in all, I think this is a good blade for the right face.</li>
            <li>One of their main guys, Bill, must be the most fair and honest businessmen that I have encountered in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>It is a very clean shave and the aloe strip</li>
            <li>Having tried multiple razors that have been on the market, the hydro is by far the best shave I have experienced.</li>
            <li>It gave a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>Before the Hydro 5 came along I was using the Gillette Fusion 5+1, which was pretty darn good since it didn&#x27;t scrape or cut.</li>
            <li>First the good:</li>
            <li>However, the head is too large and I found I needed to do more work with it to get a shave as good as the Quattro.</li>
            <li>i was able to shave this easily.</li>
            <li>I probably will pay more money for the Shick in order to get a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>My Sensor performs perfectly in this area, but this 5 blade is more bulky and harder to reach under the nose.</li>
            <li>The shave was outstanding but the razor burn was incredible, leaving my face feeling rubbery, tender, and sandblasted two days later.</li>
            <li>that this is not necessarily the most ideal blade for the face.  </li>
            <li>I liked it better right away.</li>
            <li>I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine</li>
            <li>Clean smooth shave, nice hydration from the hydrating gel reservoir.</li>
            <li>The shave was the most comfortable I have ever felt.  </li>
            <li>I can find much more important things to put my money towards.  </li>
            <li>in all I couldn&#x27;t possibly recommend this razor when I know how incredible the Fusion is.</li>
            <li>about 15-30 seconds makes the shave even more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love the construction of the Feather razor; but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close and as comfortably as the Proglide of the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>No doubt, this is the closest AND most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It is incredible the product is produced to last like this.</li>
            <li>After taking it out of its going to provide you the most hydrating and comfortable shave you can get.</li>
            <li>Make sure to give it a try by getting a free sample at BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>This is more comfortable than both of my electric razors and it shaves closer.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth of a shave I get.  </li>
            <li>I have used many disposables but I happened to get this from BzzAgent as a free sample.</li>
            <li>This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34;  As I was drying my wife turned on the light</li>
            <li>and it gets very close, and does a good job.</li>
            <li>&quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost mine, and was in a tight spot at the moment, I received this at a great price, and good timing.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and the great thing about this razor is that you can click back the lubricating reservoir away from the blades in order to trim a moustache or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They certainly have developed something GREAT with this razor!</li>
            <li>He replied within an hour, and said he would credit my account IN FULL for the purchase price!</li>
            <li>In each case, he has notified AMAZON and they have promised to revise his listing many times, but have never done so--even though they made the original listing error--</li>
            <li>then i did with my other Fusion razor and was very impressed by the experience.  </li>
            <li>I did not find the Hydro to clog easily, even with 2 days beard, but there was some resistance.  </li>
            <li>Great razor - I didn&#x27;t realize how good this is until a few weeks passed</li>
            <li>I have to clean it out more often.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was easy to</li>
            <li>The trimmer was easy to use.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Gillette ProGlide which was painless as well, but didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I think Hydro5 is better.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that it actually performed better for me than the Gillette I had been using, and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Save some money, and get a better shave, and shaving experience as everything about this razor is awesome from the razor to the heavy duty feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found its just as easily to irritate my skin with the Hydro 5 as it was with the Mach 4.  </li>
            <li>it feels good and the shave is excellent, not to mention the blades cost nearly half as much as the Fusions.</li>
            <li>razor is the real deal, and you&#x27;re getting a great bargain for the price it&#x27;s selling at right now.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, the cartridge design is better than most, and the hair just washed right out of the cartridge, instead of having to be convinced to come out (which takes the form of me banging the cartridge against the side of the side a bunch of times.</li>
            <li>I took it to India on a trip and in that hot, humid weather, I got amazing shaves every day.</li>
            <li>It does shave pretty close which is nice.</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 cuts pretty close with the grain and honestly, I dont have to shave against the grain (upwards).</li>
            <li>I did not expect to have a very good shave the first time considering I have sensitive skin and would be jumping from two blades to five.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro shaves fine, but not closer than the Quattro.</li>

            <li>Wonderful razor,  I usually get razor burn, no matter what I do, but with the Schick Hydro 5, it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li>a whole, a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I find the abnormal weight of it makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product so you too can enjoy such a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought because I was told it was a huge upgrade over the Mach 4.  </li>
            <li>(it just cant function with that clunky huge abomination of a head).</li>
            <li>I got this for free from cvs with a coupon.</li>

            <li>The price of the blades is fantastic for a cartridge.</li>
            <li>I had to finish the job with my Fusion for a truly smooth head.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I purchased this during a rebate promotion to get it free.</li>
            <li>I feel the Hydro is too light</li>
            <li>glide\\&quot; which is really, over hyped, but it does look nice.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a free add-on when I purchased some Edge shave gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used nothing but Gillette products for years and someone sent me this with a purchase as a free gift.</li>
            <li>so I took the free gift.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like 5 minutes vs 2 is a lot, but it was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get a closer shave than the Schick Quatro, and it doesn&#x27;t have the back-blade that was handy for edging my sideburns and beard.</li>

            <li>I get a smooth shave every time with no irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Schick Hydro 5 with me on business travel, bravely doing without my standard Gilette Mach 3 that I have been using for a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was happy with the Schick and probably will switch over to the Hydro 5 for my future disposable razor needs!</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver because I received a FREE voucher for one in the mail.  </li>

            <li>I find the shave to be as comfortable as any Gillette razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>Got the Schick Hydro 5 as a free sample;  tried it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have a styptic stick lying around.</li>
            <li>Nothing I have used has ever given me as comfortable and close of a shave as this does.  </li>
            <li>I can now safely say that it&#x27;s been well worth it.  </li>
            <li>close shave, comfortable .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Way better than the Fusion has a much smoother shave and is able to cut through a 10 day beard without any snags(grew</li>
            <li>Let me first say this has been the best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is obviously better than a disposable razor, but i cant say that 5 blades is really any better than 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Once I learned to use it, it has reduced my shaving time considerably and did a good job.</li>
            <li>They really need to take a look at their product because its garbage!!!</li>
            <li>The razor lasts forever, the blades are cheap, and you&#x27;ll always get a clean, comfortable shave with nothing to gunk it up.</li>
            <li>He switched shaving creams, foams, aftershave but the thing that seems to have worked the best was switching to an older style razor that only has 2 blades, and using a salicylic acid product like Bump Patrol or Club Mend.</li>
            <li>It makes it quick, easy and so smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product since the website also promised to give you a mail in rebate up to 10.99$ for you to try this product for free and</li>
            <li>The lubricant was adequate and the blades were super sharp, and it gave me the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>Clean, painless and comfortable shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as good a shave as I&#x27;ve ever had, and what&#x27;s better, the blade lasted quite a long while</li>
            <li>Given the price of replacement cartridges and the longevity of the blades, I can see myself saving a lot of money and enjoying my shaving experience much more with the new Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought it felt too bulky, but, after almost a month, I am a believer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, my original order for the razor NEVER ARRIVED.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>and I am still excited when I use it.</li>
            <li>this razor rocks and gillette products (even their original product) are over priced and over rated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro, especially when you factor in the cost of the cartridges.</li>
            <li>While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro, especially when you factor in the cost of the cartridges.</li>
            <li>I was pretty satisfied with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Until you rinse, you are actually raking your face with your own stubble!</li>
            <li>This razor gives a great, smooth shave- Thanks for such a great new product that I just stumbled upon - Thanks again~!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: The hydrating resoviour ran out really quick, but it is still a smooth shave, would i buy it again?</li>
            <li>Amazing product, it last so many shaves uses.</li>
            <li>Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that Schick was more interested in making something look cool than they were about function.</li>
            <li>The most important of which is that shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>This razor provides a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>does a good job of giving a close shave without red skin and all.it was free, to try and review from Schick.and from bzzagent who i am a member of.</li>
            <li>However, with razors becoming more and more fine-tuned, this razor is only average.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim (Wally world special razor, 5 heads and a gel for under $10).</li>
            <li>I have tried the oils, the special creams, the gels, you name it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I never end up loving the Shick razors nearly as much as Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>apparently, the more blades a razor has, the greater the chance it will cause bumps (barbae folliculitis).  </li>
            <li>the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve this level of closeness (at the expense of comfort I can assure you) and that was with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I dont have much facial hair which is a good thing I guess, but</li>
            <li>After shaving, I went digging in my trash to grab my tried and true Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the bathroom :-).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomics: I really wanted to like this thing as it looks quite innovative.</li>
            <li>This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin.</li>
            <li>This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin.</li>
            <li>in addition the blades of both seem to last a good three months.</li>
            <li>Good luck shaving your nooks and crannies - above your ears, under your nose, in your groin, wherever...</li>
            <li>Packaging was a bit much but not terrible.</li>
            <li>The blades last a good while.</li>
            <li>Overall a good shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It did get a good, close shave, but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this razor so much.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good try for a month or so, and then went back to the razors I was using.  </li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>point is obvious:  even though neither Bill nor his company were directly responsible for neither of these two episodes, STRICTLY ON LINE kept their promise of excellent customer service, and have earned their high AMAZON</li>
            <li>The blade head never pops off, like I&#x27;ve experienced with some other razors.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.</li>
            <li>it came with - super close, super comfy.  </li>
            <li>On a whim, I tried the following product, and have discovered the best aftershave I have ever tried (though it is not actually aftershave).  </li>
            <li>Super close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is the most over-engineered manual razor I have ever encountered and more of a nuisance than convenience in actual use.  </li>
            <li>Also, aesthetically, the fusion looks way better, and it comes with a better stand that actually stands up.</li>
            <li>My Mach 3 with only 3 blades cuts just as close with a more comfortable feel!  </li>
            <li>and I was lucky to get a maximum of 4 shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li>This way you have all 5 blades shaving without the top getting in the way, an absolutely brilliant idea on their behalf and in my opinion a testament to the talent behind shick5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And finally, a moisturizer delivery system that works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>For the first time, Schick has created a razor that is worthy of praise IMHO!</li>
            <li>I recently picked up a Hydro 5, and it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Zip Super Speed Power.... or</li>
            <li>I would prefer to use the same money to play the lottery, something I consider to be a more worthwhile endeavor.</li>
            <li>I jumped to quick to order this.</li>
            <li>This is a super shaver.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer was adequate.  </li>
            <li>While the Hydro does represent an improvement over the previously available Quattro, it&#x27;s nonetheless very much inferior to the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Schick Hydro 5 was through a free sample.</li>
            <li>They were good,much better than your normal razor cartridges.</li>
            <li>and it was just as comfortable of a shave as the first day.  </li>
            <li>First off, I am a BzzAgent and am reviewing this as a free</li>
            <li>This blade cuts it smooth first time, every time.</li>
            <li>and it still feels pretty smooth and creates a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette.</li>
            <li>if I am going out in the evening)After the great commercials, I decided to set my fusion down and give this a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was quite happy with the results, and how quick the blades cut through this tangled mess.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Not worse, but I don&#x27;t think I could give a terribly strong justification for one to switch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the razor as the blades last longer and is economical when compared to gillette.</li>
            <li>and I am amazed that this shave is as close as the first!</li>
            <li>only disadvantage that I have found with the Schick Hydro 5 is that the razor clogs up more easily than the Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>The glide on this razor hands down is better, and more smooth than Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I keep it clean by running hot water into it.</li>
            <li>I agree that you get a great shave with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion, or even its little brother, the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I got a free Hydro - thanks to the promo</li>
            <li>I actually use this on my junk (where the sun don&#x27;t shine), and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Honestly - I can only recall a handful of times</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot</li>
            <li>I liked the 5 blade feel versus the 3 blade razor I currently use, and the quality of the shave was acceptable as well.  </li>
            <li>so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>The thing that bothers me the most about this razor is shaving the area directly under my nose.</li>
            <li>All in all, the Hydro 5 gave me a nice shave, except for under the nose, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me switch.</li>
            <li>I want a razor that is simple and effective with no frills.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>B000142THM Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]].</li>
            <li>However, I felt the need to buy a razor, which was better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It actually works better than the than Precise Trimmer of the Fusion.</li>
            <li>Still, if you are looking for a razor, this is worth picking up.</li>
            <li>I got better results with a month old Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used with fresh blades)</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I contemplated trying an oldschool safety razor, but it&#x27;s clear to me that the people raving about them are mostly hipsters that collect them for nostalgia&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I was suddenly tired of trying to find the best price for Gillette blades and started looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li>The Proglide is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>would also recommend you rinse this razor more frequently than you do the Gillette fusion or even the Mach3.</li>
            <li>First thing I really like the Designed Handle and all  five blades because it makes it really easy to shave.</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro 5 is still bulky, and has one other tiny issue, but for me, this is the best razor aimed at men that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Like many, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for quite awhile, however, while in Vegas I checked into a high end spa, and when ready for cleaning up I asked if they had complimentary razors.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to be more realistic in how much they want to spend shaving.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I could right away tell the harsher shave.  </li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be disappointed.selling at right now.</li>
            <li>this powers right through it.  </li>
            <li>These were the sideburns and right under the nose.  </li>
            <li>For the past two weeks since it was put in use, the Schick Hydro has provided by far the best shaving experience of my life.  </li>
            <li>sure there&#x27;s a little bit of hair left, but it still feels smooth, looks good, and saves me time when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li>The Mach 3, being a simple cylindrical-shaped handle, is very easy to rotate no matter where your fingers are on the length of the handle.</li>
            <li>Good enough that I bought refill cartridges instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>The best parts are, the blades last longer and cost much less.</li>
            <li>also found that I receive many more cuts than my previous razor, Gilette&#x27;s Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to all shavers, especially people who have sensitive skin, this is the perfect razor for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this as I have to shave everyday for work!</li>
            <li>hmmm, sure, its a real money saver over time, depends on if you are willing to shell out the money for a new edition of \\&quot;Pro</li>
            <li>Like on Family Guy, more blades doesn&#x27;t really mean better shave!  </li>
            <li>However the head design on the Schick &#x27;floats&#x27; a little more to track the contours on your face better.  </li>
            <li>I received my new Schick Hydro 5 Razor over the weekend free of charge through a promotion.</li>
            <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, and by the end of my week&#x27;s hotel stay, found myself becoming more aware of how I needed to shave with the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The specs and concepts explained on Schick&#x27;s website looked interesting, and the current rebate deal made it worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going strong on 2 months now on one blade so far.</li>
            <li>Still hunting for something as good for less money.</li>
            <li>i can only tell you its worth giving this product a shot it does what it says it will do plus more.</li>
            <li>Does a good job for less cost.</li>
            <li>It also has a neat straight edge feature, which is important for the men - not so much for me.  </li>
            <li>The razor is great - the gel pad lays down a nice slick surface and the 5 blades shave very close &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>the razor is average and made out of plastic but the razor blades are awesome and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>(actually I think it might be more comfortable, but it&#x27;s at least as good) and from what I can tell it also lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>The head flexes back nicely to move with curves and it gives a real close shave when you flick back the top.</li>
            <li>my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li>Gillette prices are very high (very much worth after trying Schick).</li>
            <li>I also was able to engage the lubricating strip easily in order to shave in tight spots.  </li>
            <li>wow ,,,no bleeding.very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>First Aid Hurt-Free Antiseptic Wash</li>
            <li>only problem with this razor like many is the size of the head.  </li>
            <li>It is my first time</li>
            <li>Overall I give the first shave a 4.0, but once I get used to the razor a bit more</li>
            <li>- the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  </li>
            <li>This razor works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The second thing is that the shaving head is more flush with the handle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m handing this one off to my wife as I think the larger head and blade position will be better suited for her legs than my face.</li>
            <li>I have to flip the top open and leave it that way</li>
            <li>/&gt;More blades and lubricant do not necessarily make for a better shave.  </li>
            <li>In this case, they make for a mediocre shave at best.</li>
            <li>run it under hot water for</li>
            <li>Bought it yesterday at Costco and just used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>so you need more than necessary pressure to your face and even then I did not a receive and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>You get a closer shave than a  DE straight razor too!</li>
            <li>Compared to the Gillette Fusion, the hydro shaves alot smoother, with just hot water.</li>
            <li>First shave with the Hydro 5</li>
            <li>The 5th blade of the fusion isn&#x27;t better than the hydra&#x27;s flip of the gel strip feature, they seem to be about equal in that regard to feature and function.</li>
            <li>The big difference I can tell is that with the switch I can now afford to eat more than just ramen noodles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was only able to find it online.</li>
            <li>Now this is my first try at a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>I started shaving my legs with it for the first time and the song</li>
            <li>I have bought many others and he has chosen this to be his final choice.</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded from the Mach 3 to the Fusion Proglide, and no question the Fusion Proglide gave a smoother more comfortabl shave than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5</li>
            <li>And for that, the Mach 3 is still my first choice.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li>Schick HYDRO 5 offers a great shave and value for the average guy, who has to shave every day and is not falling for the Gillette/P&amp;G $3.75-a-cartridge hype.</li>
            <li>overall feel is solid with a bit more weight than most refillables.</li>
            <li>Well, I first bought the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Though I am only 22, I have been through many razors in my day.</li>
            <li>you will likely be satisfied with this blade as well.</li>
            <li>After my first shave I knew this was going to be a keeper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and got a real &amp;#34;five&amp;#34; pack!</li>
            <li>I do not have a lot of facial hair, mostly stubble, for which disposable Bic&#x27;s to the job.  </li>
            <li>Any way you shave it will accomadate it&#x27;s like having a barber travel with you anywhere also willing to work</li>
            <li>When I took my first shave</li>
            <li>But I did not want to dismiss this at the first look and was determined to try it out.</li>
            <li>and I am still on my first blade .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leave skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Will Recommend This To Anyone That Want Soft Smooth Skin After Finishing</li>
            <li>is the only razor I&#x27;ve been able to shave with consistently 3 days a week to avoid ALL of those problems.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this top notch would be to have a shower holder incorporated.</li>
            <li>This means that your first razor swipe is done without lubrication.</li>
            <li>It gave me my first blood-free shave.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>This razor works fantastic, it took me a shave or two to get accustomed to a new handle, but the shave itself was much nicer.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a extremely smooth shave, and i LOVE the skin guards which create less irritation and pull.</li>
            <li>Also the pivoting of the blades feels less smooth and agile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handle is sturdy, blades super sharp out of the package, and changing cartridges is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>your face is of a different makeup, you may have a more positive result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked fine, but I got the same results and wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>its smooth glide and unbelievable shave left my face happy and me smiling.</li>
            <li>I shave my balls every other day with the Schick Hydro without any kind of lubricant and its painless every time.</li>
            <li>The other nice feature is that in a week&#x27;s time, I had no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Long story short, the Hydro is simply the best razor I have yet to come across!  </li>
            <li>It is hugely quieter - the Quattro sometimes sounds like a Weedeater - but that also means that its electric vibro mode is much less energetic than the Quattro&#x27;s, hence much less effective, leaving me to wonder what the point is of the Hydro having a vibro mode at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shick was good about refunding my money and they are sending me a kit to return the supplies to them for analysis, but I have no reason to believe this is a defective product, since I tried three different cartridges that performed the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Sensor Excels (2 blades) for something like 20 years now and decided to finally update my shaving routine to the more modern 5 blades.</li>
            <li>Use your thumb to grab the top of the cartridge, and the aloe strip flip back to get a straight edge for trimming under the nostrils and side</li>
            <li>But I have never, ever liked the \\&quot;paddle effect\\&quot; of those blades, hinged at the bottom; I&#x27;ve always felt one step removed from complete control, especially pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>but IMO more blades doesn&#x27;t always mean a better razor.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I can get my money back with the rebate, if not, I would be so pissed right now.</li>
            <li>The green flip top allows you to precisely trim and can easily flip back up to shave.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving a long time, so over the years I have tried most blades from the cheapie plastic disposables to the high-end razors like this one.</li>
            <li>It just slides along my skin (or rather it FEELS like it is, because it cuts very well without pulling on the first stroke, in fact about as well as two or three strokes it would&#x27;ve taken the Quattro.)  </li>
            <li>I just used this razor for the first time, and frankly, I&#x27;m very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>The first couple of shaves is fine, but by the 5th time I shaved my head with it, I was getting all kinds of gunk left on my head.</li>
            <li>Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro.</li>
            <li>mad smooth and no cuts and leaves my face feeling wonderful and soft</li>
            <li>I saw this new razor and cream in a Wallyworld store and figured it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally I am super sensitive to shaving and have always been a Gillette guy.</li>
            <li>I go from major stubble to clean shave and</li>
            <li>The biggest difference though, is that I was able to use a single Hydro 5 blade for 2 weeks, shaving 5 times per week.</li>
            <li>blade is a bit large, but I did not have any problem shaving around my beard.  </li>
            <li>* Large plastic guard/border gets in the way of shaving curved areas</li>
            <li>The head of the razor is large compared with what I was using, so it took a bit of getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can move the lubricant side up and away to get a clean straight shave than flip it right back for a lubricated shave.</li>
            <li>Not cool, I&#x27;d deffinately look for a differend kind ext time</li>
            <li>One final recommendation: I have very sensitive skin, and most aftershave products do not work well for me.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 has proven to be much more skin friendly and the blades seem to stay sharper longer than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I always use to get some kind of razor burn.. now I never get it!</li>
            <li>great brand of razors, my bear is a hard one and no other brand of razors compares with this, incluiding electric razor, in my case nothing works as good and as long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of double edge razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Finally, the head on this thing is HUGE.</li>
            <li>The hydro 5 is a much smoother and closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I really shave?\\&quot; - a 4.5 -</li>
            <li>This one was very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve written too much already, so</li>
            <li>The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  </li>
            <li>The head is also very flexible and countours to the shape of your face.  </li>
            <li>Very underrated in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Schick should have done this much sooner with</li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>I was out of my straight blades</li>
            <li>], I don&#x27;t really need that feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gives a smooth shave after only one swipe.  </li>
            <li>I really dont like this razor..</li>
            <li>I used schick hydro and it hurt so much.</li>
            <li>the cost of blades really adds up compared to the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing left but smooth</li>
            <li>What used to take 25-30 minutes now only takes 12, and it&#x27;s a smooth experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair grows in a lot of different angles too, but I can have everything gone in around 12 minutes with my head being perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>get real: FIVE blades?</li>
            <li>in all I really like this razor</li>
            <li>It delivers a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro simply does not provide as smmoth, close or comfortable a shave as the Gillette Fusion and the blades&#x27; quality is rather flimsy.</li>
            <li>While using the trimmer, the five blades really do their job.</li>
            <li>I was also losing hope when the price of blades started going up and being put into theft proof boxes hahaha.</li>
            <li>Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li>The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li>But when I looked in the mirror I realized that it shaved everything very well.</li>
            <li>That being said I don&#x27;t see really any advantage over the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the gel reservoir was working.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion handle is much, much much easier to grip, particularily if you shave upward rather than downward.</li>
            <li>A comfortable close shave is a must, but I also need a razor that can last a while without gouging me with overpriced replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Absolutely none of the \\&quot;flamethrower to the face\\</li>
            <li>the Fusion has 5 blades, VERY close together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette blade user simply because I could never find anything that shaved as close and smooth.</li>
            <li>actually PREVENTS a smooth shave, if you can believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was done my shave was real patchy with a lot spots missed.  </li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t have to do his face much (hence the TWO</li>
            <li>Got one of these free as a same</li>
            <li>Smooth to start, than I got the the spot underneath your nose above your lip.</li>
            <li>really love(d)</li>
            <li>After I shave, this makes my beard really stand out.</li>
            <li>Much shorter life than quattro blades.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close with almost no effort.  </li>
            <li>I expected to love this razor based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>Overall the hydro function was nice when it actually shaved my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Hydro 5 for a week now and so far the shave is as close as my 2 blade, if only slightly better.</li>
            <li>Clearly everyone is different, but way too many nicks for me.</li>
            <li>The blades are sensibly hinged in the middle and, indeed, I get complete control and a noticeably better shave, faster, than I get from the Gillette products.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for more than 50 years, beginning with a classic Gillette single blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.th the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.    </li>
            <li>The first time I tried something new</li>
            <li>I did not have a positive experience with the Mach 3 Turbo and gave it away after my first use because it irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li>In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep</li>
            <li>The Quatro and this Hydro5 both suffer from the same problem the razor is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t shave very well if you have more than a 2day growth, and this is coming from a guy who has blonde fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>This razor hacks through my thicket of a beard with greater ease than any other razor I have used.</li>
            <li>While shaving with the grain, the Hydro 5 does a much better job than other razors in delivering a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was finding that in general the razors with three blades had hit the sweet spot and all the razors with more than three blades were just overkill and not worth the hype.</li>
            <li>I wish Shick would redesign this handle so it is more like the Fusion and every other razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>i love the five blade because i don&#x27;t have to used them every other day to shave my head.thanks schick.</li>
            <li>pull your hair like most of the other brand&#x27;s do &amp;#60;3&lt;</li>
            <li>The five blades make it awkward to use at best and having to flip the top down to get underneath my nose is a pain.  </li>
            <li>The blades seemed to dull after the first use and I never felt like I got the kind of shave I should have.  </li>
            <li>started first shaving with a norelco electric, moved to a mach 3 and used that for 7 years, tried the quattro and threw it out with my cats litter waste, moved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3</li>
            <li>Is it weird that I think it felt great the first time I used one of these?</li>
            <li>I have never gotten such a close, clean shave with no shave irritation.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion (it&#x27;s the vibrating kind) can&#x27;t even shave my face (which is arguably less sensitive of an area) without inflicting cuts and</li>
            <li>The blades last FOREVER and can easily be honed (not sharpened, google it) with an old pair of denim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also like that the lubrication area pulls back so that you can use the full blade for trimming and getting up under the nose area.  </li>
            <li>As an old school aside, do any of us really need 5 blades to shave?!?</li>
            <li>When I was 15 I started out with my dad&#x27;s old Sensor which worked pretty well</li>
            <li>razors I&#x27;ve used have been too bulky or big to really get everything without having to go over several more times.</li>
            <li>I did notice that this razor shaves better with the gel dispenser flipped down</li>
            <li>I prefer the one blade on the top rather than the flip down thing on the hydro 5 too.</li>
            <li>The conditioning strip can be a little too gooey when the blade is new, but the shaves are super smooth and the conditioner never dries out - even after extended use.</li>
            <li>have shaved several times with the new Schick and am still on the original blade.  </li>
            <li>Shaving other areas is just as good, even when I&#x27;m shaving dry.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the new Schick 5 Blade Hydro hoping they decided to change the blade spacing but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Less money, better razor.</li>
            <li>However, this razor I use for shaving the face as I do it more often and requires less cleaning time.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone getting a decent shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li>Even after flipping the cartridge out of the way you do not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>take in mind the bump gaurds they have on the blades keep it from being super close (close enough) but again I have not cut myself at all with these blades.</li>
            <li>The main areas I shave are my mustache, front of my neck, under arms, chest, stomach and</li>
            <li>The main reason for buying this was for my head, as I prefer being bald.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying these and don&#x27;t go by the older reviews.</li>
            <li>The main reason for me to try this one was refill cartridge price.</li>
            <li>I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 at first seems a little bulky, but after shaving it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li>I keep a bag of cheap single blade disposables for that task alone.</li>
            <li>The single trimmer blade found on Gillettes is a nice feature but much rougher than a disposable single</li>
            <li>So I often find that I have to go over the same spot 4 or 5 times, each time inching closer to my beard so as to avoid a very funny looking shaved</li>
            <li>My beard gets pretty thick sometimes, and I still can&#x27;t find something that will shave it off good enough.  </li>
            <li>The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>With annual razor blade expenses equivalent to a high end electric shaver, I resent the weekly $3 per blade expenditure.</li>
            <li>It is better than FUSION or any other brand/model as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I had used the Schick Quattro for many years, but decided to try a new razor after realizing that the quality of the blades was deteriorating.  </li>
            <li>Schick has a real winner here, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades themselves or the super slick gel that slowly oozes out of the holes in the top of the cartridge, but I just got the most comfortable shave of my life with this thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the life of a normal blade is for most people, but this seemed a little bit longer than the Gillete Mach 3 with the way I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of the blade also doesnt allow for much precision, such as the area right under the nose, or other detailed spots.  </li>
            <li>) If your hair is coarse, better to shave lightly twice than pressing too hard and bleeding.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>But considering the cost of the cartridge refills, not that much nicer than my old Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Blades are considerably cheaper was one bonus, but the real bonus is the shave itself.</li>
            <li>I used to think, along with expensive price, came a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it again for a few shaves and see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing it like a normal razor doesn&#x27;t even help.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Schick Quattro but my wife had a coupon and brought this one home</li>
            <li>You may not experience the same results, but still, it&#x27;s worth giving it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy these.</li>
            <li>I am a electric razor guy for the normal day to day shaving, and a Gillette guy for years.</li>
            <li>I normally use Gillettes products</li>
            <li>A did a few online searches for reviews, and decided it was a safe</li>
            <li>Though the feeling may change, shaving daily has become far more than a necessary drudgery....</li>
            <li>This was the first mens razor I tried after going through nearly ever razor developed for women to realize that obviously they were all made by men who want women to suffer through razor burn and having to shave every single day :).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    </li>
            <li>Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strip flips up so you can get right up next to the beard or sideburns.</li>
            <li>In particular, I have a place under my chin and along the neck that I&#x27;ve always had to attack several times, from several directions, to get smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, for half the price this razor system is definitely worth the money and a suitable alternative if you give your skin and face some time to adjust as you would have to with any other blade, even if you were moving from Bic to Gillette.</li>
            <li>now I just use the Fusion for that back blade that does the \\&quot;fine tuning\\&quot; on my beard and such.</li>
            <li>The extra blade and lubricating strip make this shaver much too large to get a close shave under my nose.</li>
            <li>With my old Gillette razors, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any razor cuts, but i&#x27;m a little more cautious using Schick.</li>
            <li>I went on a trip, and forgot my razor, and was given a new Hydro 5 at the hotel.  </li>
            <li>The new hydro strip does make for a smoother feel than the strip on the Quattro razors.</li>
            <li>However, I have two problems with the new design.</li>
            <li>That is a testament to the new blade.  </li>
            <li>He asked me to try this new razor he has been using, the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>Of course, that means a new razor is needed.</li>
            <li>As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades</li>
            <li>It arrived in new condition as stated.</li>
            <li>A guy I work with was bragging about his new razor, but I thought,</li>
            <li>I thought I just have to get used to the new design</li>
            <li>( I was that determined to try new razor).</li>
            <li>If close to the price of disposables, I will have found a new blade to use for some time to come.</li>
            <li>These nick me and seem like an old razor when still brand new!</li>
            <li>all serious though this razor feels amazing against your skin</li>
            <li>Glad I only spent $7 on this thing.</li>
            <li>The hydrating gel definitely helps, but this definitely makes you smooth.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a fantastic shaving experience with long lasting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to leave my long time standard 5 Blade and try other possibly greener pastures, but I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have switched razors in several years.  </li>
            <li>First, is five blades really necessary?</li>
            <li>By the way I am a female using this razor, as I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s for females or males, but I&#x27;m a convert for sure!</li>
            <li>introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>5 blades sounds like this schick will do its job, but I will update once I figure how many sharp months the blades will last before having to switch them out.</li>
            <li>That strip also helps keep your face soft and minimizes razor burn or breakouts!</li>
            <li>Like virtually every other Schick razor, the Hydro is most definitely inferior to comparable razors from archrival Gillette.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve bought a Schick and also will be the last.</li>
            <li>I gave this razor a try and was surprised how close the shave was without a thousand nicks or razor burn caused by a normal 5 blade.</li>
            <li>Same results as the first time and</li>
            <li>Aside from that the actual blades don&#x27;t seem to get close and leave stray hairs and stubble, this is one the FIRST use.</li>
            <li>That should have been my first clue to get away from Schick entirely, but I decided to give the Hydro a shot anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young, only 20, but the good Lord has cursed (or blessed) me with some ridiculously thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave, and I never once nicked myself, which is very rare, especially with a new razor.</li>
            <li>I want to like these and switch away from overpriced Gillette, but these simply have to cheap a feel to stick with over the long term.</li>
            <li>I typically shower without the light on.  </li>
            <li>Why would anyone waste their time shaving with a cartridge razor which gets easily gunked up</li>
            <li>have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I find it funny that the average star rating here is 4/5, but the average star rating for the replacement blade pack is better.</li>
            <li>If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li>You can expect a smooth and tight shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>I have a chubby face, sensitive skin and facial hair that is quick to grow (I have to shave daily), but not coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are so large, you can see the back of the razor.</li>
            <li>To properly evaluate the new Schick Hydro 5 razor, I decided to compare it to the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power.</li>
            <li>On 5 bladed razors the blades seem to get clogged to quickly probably due to the lack of space between each blade</li>
            <li>The five blades didn&#x27;t glide smoothly; it felt like it was more tugging that it was cutting.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when this miracle touched my face, i throw my gellit in the trash</li>
            <li>Energy (Eclipse)&lt;br /&gt;-King of Shaves Alpha Gel (Sensitive Skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Shick</li>
            <li>Hydro Sensitive Shave Gel&lt;br /&gt;-Vintage</li>
            <li>must be cleaned after nearly every swipe&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It shaved well when the slime bar was pushed back, exposing all five blades, but too much bother and</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t like the way the head tilts, but perhaps because I&#x27;m used to the fixed head of the Sensor.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>I cannot use an electric razor since they really don&#x27;t seem to work with my facial hair.  </li>

            <li>Unlike the old adage, \\&quot;fool me once, shame on you...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t complete one stroke before it clogged and pulled whiskers.  </li>
            <li>blade itself is about 2x larger than that of the Senor with 4 blades very close to one another.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin combined with a medium/heavy beard growth and have always had problems with irritation.</li>
            <li>Gillette sucks compared to these.these are better.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with it is that it goops up your face with so much gell that it constantly clogs the blade needing cleaning after each pass of the blade.  </li>
            <li>never feel burned or chaffed or sensitive after shaving</li>
            <li>/&gt;What wasn&#x27;t close though was how much longer the Hydro 5 blades last than the Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>while I get great shaves from it the time investment and the inevitable terrible cuts I give myself every now and then had me wanting to find a cartridge razor I liked.</li>
            <li>*cough* sensitive areas, and all the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive razor as part of a sponsored program.  </li>
            <li>So, if you have sensitive skin, give this razor a try</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to break out..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never have to buy a blade again as far</li>
            <li>I then even moved on to trying the old school way of shaving, you know, the soap, the mug, the brush, the shaving oil, safety razor, etc.</li>
            <li>Well the Hydro 5 really made me a believer and now will only shave with this.</li>
            <li>This razor helped me transition from my old electric razor to using hand razors.</li>
            <li>I got a free razor in the mail and so as not to let it go to waste</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; action is a bit sketchy..</li>
            <li>My skin in sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I love the Gillette Pro Glide and with this razor having 5 blades I thought it would at least be comparable.  </li>
            <li>I finally tried the Schick Hydro 5 (the power version)... and was REALLY</li>
            <li>sensitive skin hydro is basically latin for foolproof.</li>
            <li>Schick handles this by including the flip trimmer, and because of that, these disposables really do have everything I could hope for in such a product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The hydrating gel pad flips back to give sideburns a straight edge.  </li>
            <li>After shaving with the Hydro 5, I had to pull out my old razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hydrating gel kept my skin soft and supple and 5 blades eliminated any and all</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend, she uses those blades for several years and likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I can finally say my side burns are straight and not like a character from star trek.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick needs to promote this much more heavily, because if they can get a man to try this he&#x27;ll drop his Fusion in the trashcan and never look back.</li>
            <li>the blade spacing has not changed and to make things worse the top of the blade is covered so much</li>
            <li>I used the one blade the entire week and think it could have still done a few more shaves.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I think its worth a try and the price through Amazon, though not cheap, seems reasonable.</li>
            <li>This razor may be good if you have thin facial hair</li>
            <li>The blades are more spaced and the back of the razor is more open, but between the little metal &amp;#34;stabilizer rods&amp;#34; to keep the blades stiff that...</li>
            <li>The flip top back is a bit awkward and not as useful as the touch-up top blade on some other products.</li>
            <li>I must admit, this five bladed razor by Schick reminds me of a Saturday Night Live spoof when the first three bladed razors were introduced years ago.</li>
            <li>The strip on the hydro 5 is actually pretty cool because it puffs up creating a very slick gliding surface.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this razor was far worse, but then I gave it a couple of tries and noticed that It performed quite nicely.</li>
            <li>That is the exact reason the Fusion comes with a single blade on the end.  </li>
            <li>He also said that he has had many such complaints over the past year.  </li>
            <li>If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can usually get a Fusion blade to last out to two weeks because I shave after showering, but at that point the lubrication strip is gone and the blades are pulling more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>not only does it not seem to be competing to the older Gillette</li>
            <li>but ultimately I had to go back to my Quattro after the first shave (had to re-shave)</li>
            <li>The only thing I have issue with is the large area where they put the strip on top of the razor makes it tough to get close under my nose</li>
            <li>The Hydro has been going strong for two weeks now and is still cutting smooth and the lubrication area keeps on working as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 for the past 6 years, I  got this free today and used it...</li>
            <li>my opinion, manufacturing nowadays is frequently of much more uneven quality than years gone by; and 5 blades seems to me to mainly just raise the chances that one of the blades is slightly defective.....</li>
            <li>I usually get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>I typed this really fast at work, so excuse any grammatical errors.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from BzzAgent and have been using this blade exclusively for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning and did my usual routine and then got out of the shower to shave, the first pass with the grain was nothing special, but when I started the second pass against the grain it was like I had found shaving nirvana.</li>
            <li>The wider plastic border makes it tough to accurately line up the blades so that I don&#x27;t trim too much.  </li>
            <li>When developing a new product, sooner or later you have to shoot the design engineers and go into production.  </li>
            <li>that is this Shick Hydro 5 is my new one and only shaver now.  </li>
            <li>gave the extra blades to my partner, and even she couldn&#x27;t really use it properly on her legs.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only so much you can talk about with a standard razor without coming off as obsessive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently ordered 4 cartridges of the 3 blade version, as the handle is compatible with them (another plus) and will be testing to see if those five blades really are necessary, and hopefully cut some cost as well.</li>
            <li>I thought it had a total of five heads when it clearly said blades!</li>
            <li>was a fool for far, far, far too long.</li>
            <li>, the blades on the Hydro are slightly further apart and the lubricating strip is slightly higher than the Proglide, so what ends up happening is that I have to put additional pressure on the blades, and they are further apart, which ends up causing razor burn and knicks, especially under my nose</li>
            <li>Recommended for broad strokes, but not for detail work.</li>
            <li>I had some major nicks and bleeding incidents from these blades.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and hard to find in the brick and mortar places.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The flip top system for cutting under nose and sideburns is hands down no question way better than the Gillette fusion I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll easily use the same blade for months (usually 3 to 4ish).  </li>
            <li>Trying to spend less money and bought Shick hydro 5, right away I could tell a deference.  </li>
            <li>I usually have to spend a lot of time trying to get problem areas like around the jaw line clean, but not with this razor.</li>
            <li>the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor works very well for sensitive skin.i do not cut myself like i do with other razors.it</li>
            <li>The blades seemed to stay sharp with no tugging and the smooth feeling lasted longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clean and dry my razor after each use and a single mach 3 will last me 6 months, I throw it away as soon as it starts to cut me</li>
            <li>I would have given it 4 stars, but I have large hands and find razor slipping out of my hands some times.</li>
            <li>I think that the flip back top is NOT really useful and prefer that they put a single edge on the back but gave 5 stars anyway</li>
            <li>With this thing I can shave in less than half the time it used to take, plus the results are better, with NO</li>
            <li>All I could think was great for off-road vehicles, bad for close</li>
            <li>A simple run under the faucet and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even last long, it was very upsetting.</li>
            <li>I could barely feel it at all.</li>
            <li>I accidentally shaved over the sensitive area above your acheillies tendon</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that both razers perform almost identically despite the massive price difference.</li>
            <li>The massive skin guard/lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t allow for a precision shave, or anywhere near it.</li>
            <li>I have been a lifelong Gillette user who occasionally tries Shick products hoping for something cool.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you can still use the expensive Fusion you already own.</li>
            <li>And the Hydro 5 blades just feel more substantial against the skin than the thin Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Shaving preference are very individual, however, and you may find that you love the Shick which should allow you to save a little money over Gillette and other makes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can live with the larger head design in order for me to save a ton of money on the refills.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is due to the large gaps between the razors and the skin guards.</li>
            <li>I also dry shave because, outside of my goatee, I don&#x27;t have much of a beard.</li>
            <li>(If I was to be super picky and critical and had to choose a winner, I actually thought the Hydro 5 gave a slightly smoother closer shave than the</li>
            <li>It does release a gel, but it&#x27;s nothing noticeable, and ends up leaving your face much softer than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This blade works very well on my face while other cause rashes.</li>
            <li>the lotion really helped prevent any razor burn (those dull fusion blades would really tear into me).</li>
            <li>Not a single tug or pull.</li>
            <li>I really like the reservoir of super slick lubricant that these Hydro 5 have, but I would recommend you make it part of your routine to wet the razor right off the bat just to give it some time to hydrate; especially if you don&#x27;t use or only use little shaving gel/</li>
            <li>TWO cartridges will last me (light beard) about at least a year.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old brand, but wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>While I used these same razors in the UK under the brand name listed above, in the US the quality is far lower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys who normally buy a pack of disposables and use them too long, but this blade is a cut above those (pun intended!)</li>
            <li>This blade does not dry shave as well at all.</li>
            <li>5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always used Gillette razors, occasionally Schick would come out with a new razor</li>
            <li>This thing is not worth much of my time so here are the bullet</li>
            <li>Thank God, because once I tried it, I found that it provided a much smoother shave and was easier to maneuver than other &#x27;female&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first blade got so clogged with gunk that my third shave was a mess.</li>
            <li>First day I received the razor, I looked at its design and immediately disliked it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a Fusion user, do yourself a favor and try the Hydro5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still using the Hydro5, but I have cut myself a few times with it which is funny because I never cut myself with the Fusion.</li>
            <li>so i think the reason why i got razor bumps was because, i applied too much pressure and wasn&#x27;t going with the grain properly because, i only got razor burn below my jaw line since i&#x27;m a black young man with very coarse curly hair</li>
            <li>When everything was said and done, the shaving experience was not only a little smoother but absolutely zero razor burn!</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say about this razor is that it stays sharp enough to shave my face even after shaving my private regions.</li>
            <li>If you have only shaved your whole life with an electric not a big deal and a nice upgrade, but to try and go from razor to electric is painful.</li>
            <li>little pricey but much cheaper, higher quality, and takes up less space (both the razor body and the blade cartridge) compared to majority of &#x27;female&#x27; razors.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck, which is easily grazed with cheaper razors, and that requires that I shave very slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li>It sometimes takes a couple of tries to snag the new cart from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the most part I have had some pretty bad experiences.</li>
            <li>Sure, it probably makes things smoother, but it mades the head larger and made shaving above my lip very difficult -- too many blades for a small area.</li>
            <li>First off I shaved with my Feather razor with a Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Double Edge Blades (green package).</li>
            <li>It was very different filling from what I had with Mach3 for over 4 years now and my first thought was that Hydro5 was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Normally, frequent shaves have a tendency to create chafing or redness; though I do not use this every single day, there are times where I will touch up every couple days</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure Gillette could have engineered a Fusion blade that lasts much longer and is less expensive, but they didn&#x27;t because they decided to be greedy and make blades that need replacement often.</li>
            <li>At first it was hard to tell if there was a major upgrade.</li>
            <li>The blades are spaced a little farther apart on this razor than others so it doesn&#x27;t really clog.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, to the point I can only shave every other day.</li>
            <li>The good news is I find the shave about the same as the Fusion, the bad news is the head design on the Schick is a littler &#x27;taller&#x27;</li>

            <li> , I think you will be very happy.  </li>

            <li> Good job Shick!</li>
            <li> GREAT razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and have used the gillette fusion razors and have been happy with them.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mach 3, and thought it was a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Looks great too.  </li>
            <li> and it felt great.</li>
            <li> Schick has made a great product that works.  </li>
            <li> and I gave my Wife this which she says works great on her legs.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 gives a great shave</li>
            <li> have been using gillette fusion power all my life (even before the power glide came out) and I had been happy with fusion.</li>
            <li> now I am working 4 or 5 days, the closeness and the feel after the shave is great.  </li>
            <li> With the 5 blades, it does a great job of slicing through my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> i gave it 5 stars because its a great razor.</li>
            <li> Leaves me with a great shave, close, comfortable...perfection.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> but it gave me a great shave.</li>
            <li> It is just a great experience in shaving.  </li>
            <li> Great razor and</li>
            <li> also the pivot feature of the blade is a great feature.</li>
            <li> you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;m going to try the dollar a month shave club, but this blades great.  </li>
            <li> Still, can&#x27;t complain about Schick, great product.</li>
            <li> These blades used to be a great shave</li>
            <li> The razor has a great life span, I bought this around November</li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> There is a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> hey what more can you ask for?!?!?</li>
            <li> Used it a lot - it is very nice.</li>
            <li> the trim feature is very handy.  </li>
            <li> awesome product great razor works a million times better than gillete</li>
            <li> I took the razor off my legs and the song, along with the amazing way the razor felt against my leg, was gone!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> The hydro system is OUTSTANDING and has given me one of the best shaves in quite some time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been to impressed by most Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are much better constructed and the flip-back lube bar is an excellent and functional solution that works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor you can buy period :)</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the Gillete Proglide when that came out, and I still think that&#x27;s a very good razor, but the Hydro 5 is more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, for the price.</li>
            <li> I figured since the marketing was so good to try out the Hydro 5 blade.  </li>
            <li> Comfort wise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it might be on part with the Gillette Mach3, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as good as the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> Sturdiness, precision, smoothness; these are the attributes I&#x27;m looking for in a good razor.</li>
            <li> I loved how well it hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> , I can get almost as good a shave from the Hydro5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette guy for years and figured Fusion was as good as it was gonna get.</li>
            <li> The Schick Quatro is a good example.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation and thought I didn&#x27;t want to take my good fusion blade</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Schick razor instead of the Gillette Fusion because of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not as good as my Mach 3 with regards to the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for that job.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever and the vibration is good for a couple things.  </li>
            <li> This razor is good for that job.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well.</li>
            <li> I shave five days a week, and get 20 good shaves from the Hydro, compared to 15 from the Fusion.</li>
            <li> so although its a good close shave with the Proglide</li>
            <li> It seemed this was as good as it got...until Hydro 5 came along.</li>
            <li> a good blade for the money ..</li>
            <li> All were great products in their own times of release and always bettered the generational existence..</li>
            <li> Cartridge hinge was also not as good for me.</li>
            <li> Good luck if you decide to buy this.</li>
            <li> Good quality shave.</li>
            <li> this would be a superior razor.</li>
            <li> This could be a good razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the not so good:  </li>
            <li> It also shaves exceptionally well with one pass.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette cleaned everything to the skin with exceptional comfort.</li>
            <li> While not the best razors, I find the performance excellent for the price and quality of the shave - especially if you have semi-sensitive</li>
            <li> This razor is smooth, feels great, and does a really great job.</li>
            <li> Close Comfortable Razor With a Brilliant Design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember thinking how great the Gillette Sensor Excel was, and how it couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I did not pay for mine as I would have regretted the purchase.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will buy more blades.</li>
            <li> Let your skin recover over the weekend when you can; many women say they find the scruff attractive.</li>
            <li> Good purchase, nice razor.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the proglide soon to compare it against the hydro, but as of right now the hydro is the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good looking razor, it works really well and best of all the replacement blades are $3 cheaper than Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> When I felt my face I had the closest, best, and most irritation free shave I have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that Bill would appreciate it!</li>
            <li> Love this razor!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the seller and the product!</li>
            <li> &quot; I love it!</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is the handle, the handle is very comfortable, ergonomic and cool</li>
            <li> Schick does the best body shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Solid handle and easy, smooth to move almost everywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this razor on my legs and it felt amazing.</li>
            <li> But since I use an amazing shave &#x27;gel&#x27; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 is amazing.</li>
            <li> The pack comes with a great case to store your shaver and comes with an additional cartridge to keep you smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor does amazing work and my face felt real smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Five blades and a lubrication bar might be great for a women&#x27;s legs but it cannot fit under the nose to shave a man&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> The five blades make it amazingly close.</li>
            <li> Incredibly smooth, impressively close and so comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Van der Hagen Deluxe soap</li>
            <li> Pick one up and give it a shot on your own.</li>
            <li> Nice - and way better than Good News.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one benefit is that it has that nice hydro gel feature.  </li>
            <li> Shick handle is well constructed, hefty and feels &amp;#34;substantial.&amp;#34; I liked the feel quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It was nice.</li>
            <li> Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade,  Mach 3 , Proglide and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> I used the Hydro5 for 5 weeks straight, and it is the best blade shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I used to have the Gillete Fusion Proglide and I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Proglide so it was nice to see how this Schick Hydro 5 compares to the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> The one I now have was not shaving as close as I liked</li>
            <li> Shave after a warm shower and use a pre-shave oil to get two weeks of comfort out of a HYDRO 5 cartridge...</li>
            <li> I can feel the hydration from the Hydrating Gel Reservior and feel that it does a wonderful job of providing a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, it kind of pulls, as if I was using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This was also while using warm water and Barbasol shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Nice item, good price, one can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor.</li>
            <li> Razor handle is made of  metal and plastic making for a nice feel.</li>
            <li> The head swivels nicely to avoid nicking knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I have to disagree.</li>
            <li> Awesome product....very smooth and comfortable when I shaved my beard.</li>
            <li> The soothing gel that is released is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Presumably you will also use shaving cream of some kind, but the gel has an aloe-like feel and seems to lotion the shaved surface after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> A week&#x27;s life is about all you can expect for effective use and even on sale</li>
            <li> I received these from a BzzAgent campaign and I can honestly say I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> five bladed gem is excellent and smooth on skin, One thing I observed with schick razors is that they work smooth with the application of foam rather than gel.</li>
            <li> I tried the Hydro 5, and can honestly say I like it</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and feels well made.  </li>
            <li> I could never find an electric razor I liked.  </li>
            <li> quality, nice package.</li>
            <li> Still a great, clean, and close shave - just pulls a bit.</li>
            <li> but I use this to shave my head and it does a great job at giving me a clean cut.</li>
            <li> it my first impression of Hydro5 wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> but if I use a razor with too many blades it causes more harm than good</li>
            <li> Overall, I got a good shave, but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> looks pretty good to me!</li>
            <li> think the added 2 blades provided a much smoother shave than the Gillette, but there were two areas that did not seem to get a very good cut.  </li>
            <li> Good, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it with the old fashion shave soap and the results have been excellent.  </li>
            <li> Out of all the razors I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette Machs offers the best shave but are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the Schick Hydro® 5 Sensitive Razor and was very impressed.</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Barring that, it&#x27;s a much more effective blade for the price.</li>
            <li> Smoother shave and closer cut(I have sensitive skin too) and the trimmer works great too!.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, i don&#x27;t know how this razor got soo many 5 star ratings</li>
            <li> It just was not as good and effective as the Fusion because I had to use more strokes to get a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very good to be a runner-up blade but far from being as amazing as the Fusion.</li>
            <li> I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!!</li>
            <li> Shaving ease and comfort was outstanding, I&#x27;d go so far as to say the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The Best so far yay :)</li>
            <li> When I decided to upgrade from disposables, I wanted something that would be a good shave at a reasonable price, and the Schick Hydro 5 was a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have found the Hydro 5 knicks the skin very easily, and I have cut myself more times in two months than I ever did with the Proglide.</li>
            <li> Works great fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I found barbasol foam to be more suitable for this blades and longevity of blades increases with usages of foam over gel, Of-course</li>
            <li> The aloe solution gives a very comfortable feel on every pass.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and does not nick or pull at the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without using any creams or gels, the razor gave a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion Power for quite a while now and very comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who is looking for a super good razor.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the three blades razors but this was a great razor and I am not sure if it is the layout or size or good quality of the blades</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors including the Proglide,Sensor, Sensor Excel and Mach 3&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift, but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Way better than the quattro</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be a 4.5-5.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave -</li>
            <li> Both the handle and the cartridges themselves are plasticky and lack the satisfying heft, but also the sleekness, of the Fusions.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not a terrible razor</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Hydro 5 more than the disposable.  </li>
            <li> but because two companies have a lock on the market, there aren&#x27;t really many alternatives.</li>
            <li> There are more options than Gillette out there.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro, however, is FAR superior to the Quatro and easily as good as the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I could see the lines where the hydro strip was going through the shaving cream and thought it was interfering with my shave more than anything.  </li>
            <li> I thought for $8, I&#x27;d give it a spin, and I thought 5 blades should do a much better job than 2,</li>
            <li> conclusion was that this would be ideal if you have a sensitive skin but does not offer a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a Mach 3 ever since going up from the Sensor XL many years ago.  </li>
            <li> The parts that did get shaved were nice and smooth but some how I seemed to miss areas (or the razor</li>
            <li> Most days I use a Braun electric, but I also use a blade to shave my head.</li>
            <li> but I would guess the fusion is still better.</li>
            <li> I would have to assume this has to do with the angle of the razor and also the cartridge that you can flip up on the top.  </li>
            <li> Also i love the gel lubricant.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I can actually say I look forward to shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they used better materials or sharpening methods or magic....</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind this inconvenience because this razor is that much better than the vibrator</li>
            <li> I like most readers did not do well with the quattro version of schick.</li>
            <li> I have been getting 4 weeks and more per blade doing this vs the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric to see if they have gotten better.</li>
            <li> (went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra.</li>
            <li> A lot of companies can&#x27;t figure out that part of the popularity of their product is the pricing aswell as the design.oved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3 (went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette has the multimillion dollar ad campaign, but Schick has the better product.</li>
            <li> How many blades will they add before the razor wars are over?</li>
            <li> and I feel as though I would have gotten a better shave with a piece of looseleaf paper....</li>
            <li> no matter how many days it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li> some of the reviews in youtube also said that this product is better than gillette fusion products.</li>
            <li> also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li> Holds up well and the flip top to reveal</li>
            <li> Been over 2 months and the same blades are still working perfectly.</li>
            <li> This razor does not shave any better for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor out there.</li>
            <li> like many people I have now went backwards to a DE and</li>
            <li> -love- lathering up my cranium and razoring off strips of hair.</li>
            <li> I will recommend to others and buy more when it comes to replace...</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> , I just need to try better cream.</li>
            <li> but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I can get many, many shaves before replacing the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using  this for a month or more</li>
            <li> I think that you will find it to be a MUCH better shave than Gillette offers.(Can&#x27;t believe I just said that</li>
            <li> This happens even more, once the gel reservoirs start to sink.</li>
            <li> Well, let me start off by saying that I have been shaving for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the strip with the Aloe and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro is a bit more imprecise.</li>
            <li> IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.    </li>
            <li> Well this razor (Schick Hydro 5) is much better than anything I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> I thought most razors these days were gimmicks.</li>
            <li> Schick should improve the quality of their razor to be more metal than plastic</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is everything you could want in a razor, and more.</li>
            <li> I really love the comfort of the handle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s one of the best out there (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic, which is okay, since this avails one to buy and try rather than say \\&quot;BS\\&quot;; thus I bought Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> So, with 4 days of stubble on the noggin top, I attacked it, deciding to use a bit more pressure to see if it could instigate some razor burn.</li>
            <li> I had to find something better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and replacment cartridges are cheap as well!</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> at all the blades, why are so many blades needed?  </li>
            <li> All they do is rake your face and cut way more than u need.  </li>
            <li> I realize everyone is different, but it is the best option I have found up to this point.  </li>
            <li> I am not quite sure how I feel about this razor compared to the juggernaut of the industry the Gillette Fusion Wizard Master Pro Slip and Slide Glide</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t quite make a determination as to which is better.</li>
            <li> I have many more ingrown hairs in my legs now since using these.</li>
            <li> If you use disposables, you will probably love how your face feels.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a milder razor than the fusion but infinitely better for the skin</li>
            <li> Dragging a razor across my face is more like sledding than a clear-cutting operation.</li>
            <li> It took me more time to shave and I had cuts all over my face.</li>
            <li> but I love Gillette.</li>
            <li> Shaving Man or Women doesn&#x27;t matter :)</li>
            <li> but I can tell you one thing for sure and</li>
            <li> The five blades do cut the hair thats for sure.  </li>
            <li> Gillette razors are better.</li>
            <li> &gt; The 5 blades mixed with the aloe holder make this product awesome.</li>
            <li> Plus, he said the cartridges for this cost so much more.  </li>
            <li> some reason, the blades for this razor have the lubrication strip on the top.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strips were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The shave was so close and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the razor and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks, I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li> the lubricant reservoir that folds back to allow you to see and shave under the nose and edge the sideburns perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There may be another razor out there that can give a shave better than the Schick Hydro, but I know nothing about it.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor.</li>
            <li> switched to this after many years with Venus .</li>
            <li> I currently use a Mach 3 which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> in all, I think this is a good blade for the right face.</li>
            <li> One of their main guys, Bill, must be the most fair and honest businessmen that I have encountered in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> It is a very clean shave and the aloe strip</li>
            <li> Having tried multiple razors that have been on the market, the hydro is by far the best shave I have experienced.</li>
            <li> It gave a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> Before the Hydro 5 came along I was using the Gillette Fusion 5+1, which was pretty darn good since it didn&#x27;t scrape or cut.</li>
            <li> First the good:</li>
            <li> However, the head is too large and I found I needed to do more work with it to get a shave as good as the Quattro.</li>
            <li> i was able to shave this easily.</li>
            <li> I probably will pay more money for the Shick in order to get a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> My Sensor performs perfectly in this area, but this 5 blade is more bulky and harder to reach under the nose.</li>
            <li> The shave was outstanding but the razor burn was incredible, leaving my face feeling rubbery, tender, and sandblasted two days later.</li>
            <li> that this is not necessarily the most ideal blade for the face.  </li>
            <li> I liked it better right away.</li>
            <li> I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine</li>
            <li> Clean smooth shave, nice hydration from the hydrating gel reservoir.</li>
            <li> The shave was the most comfortable I have ever felt.  </li>
            <li> I can find much more important things to put my money towards.  </li>
            <li> in all I couldn&#x27;t possibly recommend this razor when I know how incredible the Fusion is.</li>
            <li> about 15-30 seconds makes the shave even more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love the construction of the Feather razor; but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close and as comfortably as the Proglide of the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> No doubt, this is the closest AND most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It is incredible the product is produced to last like this.</li>
            <li> After taking it out of its going to provide you the most hydrating and comfortable shave you can get.</li>
            <li> Make sure to give it a try by getting a free sample at BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This is more comfortable than both of my electric razors and it shaves closer.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth of a shave I get.  </li>
            <li> I have used many disposables but I happened to get this from BzzAgent as a free sample.</li>
            <li> This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34;  As I was drying my wife turned on the light</li>
            <li> and it gets very close, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> &quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost mine, and was in a tight spot at the moment, I received this at a great price, and good timing.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold and the great thing about this razor is that you can click back the lubricating reservoir away from the blades in order to trim a moustache or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They certainly have developed something GREAT with this razor!</li>
            <li> He replied within an hour, and said he would credit my account IN FULL for the purchase price!</li>
            <li> In each case, he has notified AMAZON and they have promised to revise his listing many times, but have never done so--even though they made the original listing error--</li>
            <li> then i did with my other Fusion razor and was very impressed by the experience.  </li>
            <li> I did not find the Hydro to clog easily, even with 2 days beard, but there was some resistance.  </li>
            <li> Great razor - I didn&#x27;t realize how good this is until a few weeks passed</li>
            <li> I have to clean it out more often.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was easy to</li>
            <li> The trimmer was easy to use.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Gillette ProGlide which was painless as well, but didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I think Hydro5 is better.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that it actually performed better for me than the Gillette I had been using, and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Save some money, and get a better shave, and shaving experience as everything about this razor is awesome from the razor to the heavy duty feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found its just as easily to irritate my skin with the Hydro 5 as it was with the Mach 4.  </li>
            <li> it feels good and the shave is excellent, not to mention the blades cost nearly half as much as the Fusions.</li>
            <li> razor is the real deal, and you&#x27;re getting a great bargain for the price it&#x27;s selling at right now.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the cartridge design is better than most, and the hair just washed right out of the cartridge, instead of having to be convinced to come out (which takes the form of me banging the cartridge against the side of the side a bunch of times.</li>
            <li> I took it to India on a trip and in that hot, humid weather, I got amazing shaves every day.</li>
            <li> It does shave pretty close which is nice.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 cuts pretty close with the grain and honestly, I dont have to shave against the grain (upwards).</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have a very good shave the first time considering I have sensitive skin and would be jumping from two blades to five.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro shaves fine, but not closer than the Quattro.</li>

            <li> Wonderful razor,  I usually get razor burn, no matter what I do, but with the Schick Hydro 5, it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li> a whole, a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I find the abnormal weight of it makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product so you too can enjoy such a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought because I was told it was a huge upgrade over the Mach 4.  </li>
            <li> (it just cant function with that clunky huge abomination of a head).</li>
            <li> I got this for free from cvs with a coupon.</li>

            <li> The price of the blades is fantastic for a cartridge.</li>

            <li> I received this razor as a free add-on when I purchased some Edge shave gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but Gillette products for years and someone sent me this with a purchase as a free gift.</li>
            <li> so I took the free gift.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound like 5 minutes vs 2 is a lot, but it was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get a closer shave than the Schick Quatro, and it doesn&#x27;t have the back-blade that was handy for edging my sideburns and beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap in any way (unlike the m5</li>

            <li> I did receive this Schick Hydro 5 free from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 delivers a smooth shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> The built in hydrating gel allows it to glide smoothly over my face and helps reduce razor burn.  </li>

            <li> Great overall razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Schick.</li>

            <li> Not as smooth as Gilette Pro-Glide Fusion, but ok.&lt;br /&gt;Ken&lt;br /&gt;Webmaster&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave every time with no irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Schick Hydro 5 with me on business travel, bravely doing without my standard Gilette Mach 3 that I have been using for a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was happy with the Schick and probably will switch over to the Hydro 5 for my future disposable razor needs!</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver because I received a FREE voucher for one in the mail.  </li>
            <li> makes it smooth.  </li>
            <li> When i shaved with this it felt really smooth gliding over my face with [[ASIN:B000HLYGP2</li>
            <li> Never used a manual razor before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve used it numerous times since and it works great.</li>
            <li> I find the shave to be as comfortable as any Gillette razor I have used.  </li>
            <li> Got the Schick Hydro 5 as a free sample;  tried it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have a styptic stick lying around.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have used has ever given me as comfortable and close of a shave as this does.  </li>
            <li> I can now safely say that it&#x27;s been well worth it.  </li>
            <li> close shave, comfortable .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Way better than the Fusion has a much smoother shave and is able to cut through a 10 day beard without any snags(grew</li>
            <li> Let me first say this has been the best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is obviously better than a disposable razor, but i cant say that 5 blades is really any better than 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Once I learned to use it, it has reduced my shaving time considerably and did a good job.</li>
            <li> They really need to take a look at their product because its garbage!!!</li>
            <li> The razor lasts forever, the blades are cheap, and you&#x27;ll always get a clean, comfortable shave with nothing to gunk it up.</li>
            <li> He switched shaving creams, foams, aftershave but the thing that seems to have worked the best was switching to an older style razor that only has 2 blades, and using a salicylic acid product like Bump Patrol or Club Mend.</li>
            <li> It makes it quick, easy and so smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product since the website also promised to give you a mail in rebate up to 10.99$ for you to try this product for free and</li>
            <li> The lubricant was adequate and the blades were super sharp, and it gave me the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Clean, painless and comfortable shaving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as good a shave as I&#x27;ve ever had, and what&#x27;s better, the blade lasted quite a long while</li>
            <li> Given the price of replacement cartridges and the longevity of the blades, I can see myself saving a lot of money and enjoying my shaving experience much more with the new Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought it felt too bulky, but, after almost a month, I am a believer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my original order for the razor NEVER ARRIVED.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li> and I am still excited when I use it.</li>
            <li> this razor rocks and gillette products (even their original product) are over priced and over rated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro, especially when you factor in the cost of the cartridges.</li>

            <li> I was pretty satisfied with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Until you rinse, you are actually raking your face with your own stubble!</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great, smooth shave- Thanks for such a great new product that I just stumbled upon - Thanks again~!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: The hydrating resoviour ran out really quick, but it is still a smooth shave, would i buy it again?</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it last so many shaves uses.</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that Schick was more interested in making something look cool than they were about function.</li>
            <li> The most important of which is that shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> This razor provides a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> does a good job of giving a close shave without red skin and all.it was free, to try and review from Schick.and from bzzagent who i am a member of.</li>
            <li> However, with razors becoming more and more fine-tuned, this razor is only average.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim (Wally world special razor, 5 heads and a gel for under $10).</li>
            <li> I have tried the oils, the special creams, the gels, you name it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I never end up loving the Shick razors nearly as much as Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> apparently, the more blades a razor has, the greater the chance it will cause bumps (barbae folliculitis).  </li>
            <li> the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve this level of closeness (at the expense of comfort I can assure you) and that was with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I dont have much facial hair which is a good thing I guess, but</li>
            <li> After shaving, I went digging in my trash to grab my tried and true Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the bathroom :-).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomics: I really wanted to like this thing as it looks quite innovative.</li>
            <li> This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin.</li>
            <li> This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin.</li>
            <li> in addition the blades of both seem to last a good three months.</li>
            <li> Good luck shaving your nooks and crannies - above your ears, under your nose, in your groin, wherever...</li>
            <li> Packaging was a bit much but not terrible.</li>
            <li> The blades last a good while.</li>
            <li> Overall a good shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It did get a good, close shave, but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this razor so much.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good try for a month or so, and then went back to the razors I was using.  </li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> point is obvious:  even though neither Bill nor his company were directly responsible for neither of these two episodes, STRICTLY ON LINE kept their promise of excellent customer service, and have earned their high AMAZON</li>
            <li> The blade head never pops off, like I&#x27;ve experienced with some other razors.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.</li>
            <li> it came with - super close, super comfy.  </li>
            <li> On a whim, I tried the following product, and have discovered the best aftershave I have ever tried (though it is not actually aftershave).  </li>
            <li> Super close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is the most over-engineered manual razor I have ever encountered and more of a nuisance than convenience in actual use.  </li>
            <li> Also, aesthetically, the fusion looks way better, and it comes with a better stand that actually stands up.</li>
            <li> My Mach 3 with only 3 blades cuts just as close with a more comfortable feel!  </li>
            <li> and I was lucky to get a maximum of 4 shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> This way you have all 5 blades shaving without the top getting in the way, an absolutely brilliant idea on their behalf and in my opinion a testament to the talent behind shick5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And finally, a moisturizer delivery system that works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> For the first time, Schick has created a razor that is worthy of praise IMHO!</li>
            <li> I recently picked up a Hydro 5, and it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Zip Super Speed Power.... or</li>
            <li> I would prefer to use the same money to play the lottery, something I consider to be a more worthwhile endeavor.</li>
            <li> I jumped to quick to order this.</li>
            <li> This is a super shaver.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer was adequate.  </li>
            <li> While the Hydro does represent an improvement over the previously available Quattro, it&#x27;s nonetheless very much inferior to the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Schick Hydro 5 was through a free sample.</li>
            <li> They were good,much better than your normal razor cartridges.</li>
            <li> and it was just as comfortable of a shave as the first day.  </li>
            <li> First off, I am a BzzAgent and am reviewing this as a free</li>
            <li> This blade cuts it smooth first time, every time.</li>
            <li> and it still feels pretty smooth and creates a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette.</li>
            <li> if I am going out in the evening)After the great commercials, I decided to set my fusion down and give this a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was quite happy with the results, and how quick the blades cut through this tangled mess.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Not worse, but I don&#x27;t think I could give a terribly strong justification for one to switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the razor as the blades last longer and is economical when compared to gillette.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed that this shave is as close as the first!</li>
            <li> only disadvantage that I have found with the Schick Hydro 5 is that the razor clogs up more easily than the Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> The glide on this razor hands down is better, and more smooth than Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I keep it clean by running hot water into it.</li>
            <li> I agree that you get a great shave with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion, or even its little brother, the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I got a free Hydro - thanks to the promo</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my junk (where the sun don&#x27;t shine), and it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Honestly - I can only recall a handful of times</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot</li>
            <li> I liked the 5 blade feel versus the 3 blade razor I currently use, and the quality of the shave was acceptable as well.  </li>
            <li> so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> The thing that bothers me the most about this razor is shaving the area directly under my nose.</li>
            <li> All in all, the Hydro 5 gave me a nice shave, except for under the nose, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me switch.</li>
            <li> I want a razor that is simple and effective with no frills.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> B000142THM Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]].</li>
            <li> However, I felt the need to buy a razor, which was better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It actually works better than the than Precise Trimmer of the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Still, if you are looking for a razor, this is worth picking up.</li>
            <li> I got better results with a month old Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used with fresh blades)</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I contemplated trying an oldschool safety razor, but it&#x27;s clear to me that the people raving about them are mostly hipsters that collect them for nostalgia&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I was suddenly tired of trying to find the best price for Gillette blades and started looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> The Proglide is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> would also recommend you rinse this razor more frequently than you do the Gillette fusion or even the Mach3.</li>
            <li> First thing I really like the Designed Handle and all  five blades because it makes it really easy to shave.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is still bulky, and has one other tiny issue, but for me, this is the best razor aimed at men that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Like many, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for quite awhile, however, while in Vegas I checked into a high end spa, and when ready for cleaning up I asked if they had complimentary razors.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to be more realistic in how much they want to spend shaving.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I could right away tell the harsher shave.  </li>
            <li> Price was right</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.selling at right now.</li>
            <li> this powers right through it.  </li>
            <li> These were the sideburns and right under the nose.  </li>
            <li> For the past two weeks since it was put in use, the Schick Hydro has provided by far the best shaving experience of my life.  </li>
            <li> sure there&#x27;s a little bit of hair left, but it still feels smooth, looks good, and saves me time when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li> The Mach 3, being a simple cylindrical-shaped handle, is very easy to rotate no matter where your fingers are on the length of the handle.</li>
            <li> Good enough that I bought refill cartridges instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> The best parts are, the blades last longer and cost much less.</li>
            <li> also found that I receive many more cuts than my previous razor, Gilette&#x27;s Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to all shavers, especially people who have sensitive skin, this is the perfect razor for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this as I have to shave everyday for work!</li>
            <li> hmmm, sure, its a real money saver over time, depends on if you are willing to shell out the money for a new edition of \\&quot;Pro</li>
            <li> Like on Family Guy, more blades doesn&#x27;t really mean better shave!  </li>
            <li> However the head design on the Schick &#x27;floats&#x27; a little more to track the contours on your face better.  </li>
            <li> I received my new Schick Hydro 5 Razor over the weekend free of charge through a promotion.</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, and by the end of my week&#x27;s hotel stay, found myself becoming more aware of how I needed to shave with the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The specs and concepts explained on Schick&#x27;s website looked interesting, and the current rebate deal made it worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going strong on 2 months now on one blade so far.</li>
            <li> Still hunting for something as good for less money.</li>
            <li> i can only tell you its worth giving this product a shot it does what it says it will do plus more.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for less cost.</li>
            <li> It also has a neat straight edge feature, which is important for the men - not so much for me.  </li>
            <li> The razor is great - the gel pad lays down a nice slick surface and the 5 blades shave very close &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> the razor is average and made out of plastic but the razor blades are awesome and lasts very long.</li>
            <li> (actually I think it might be more comfortable, but it&#x27;s at least as good) and from what I can tell it also lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> The head flexes back nicely to move with curves and it gives a real close shave when you flick back the top.</li>
            <li> my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li> Gillette prices are very high (very much worth after trying Schick).</li>
            <li> I also was able to engage the lubricating strip easily in order to shave in tight spots.  </li>
            <li> wow ,,,no bleeding.very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> First Aid Hurt-Free Antiseptic Wash</li>
            <li> only problem with this razor like many is the size of the head.  </li>
            <li> It is my first time</li>
            <li> Overall I give the first shave a 4.0, but once I get used to the razor a bit more</li>
            <li> - the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  </li>
            <li> This razor works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The second thing is that the shaving head is more flush with the handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m handing this one off to my wife as I think the larger head and blade position will be better suited for her legs than my face.</li>
            <li> I have to flip the top open and leave it that way</li>
            <li> /&gt;More blades and lubricant do not necessarily make for a better shave.  </li>
            <li> In this case, they make for a mediocre shave at best.</li>
            <li> run it under hot water for</li>
            <li> Bought it yesterday at Costco and just used it today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> so you need more than necessary pressure to your face and even then I did not a receive and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> You get a closer shave than a  DE straight razor too!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Gillette Fusion, the hydro shaves alot smoother, with just hot water.</li>
            <li> First shave with the Hydro 5</li>
            <li> The 5th blade of the fusion isn&#x27;t better than the hydra&#x27;s flip of the gel strip feature, they seem to be about equal in that regard to feature and function.</li>
            <li> The big difference I can tell is that with the switch I can now afford to eat more than just ramen noodles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was only able to find it online.</li>
            <li> Now this is my first try at a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my legs with it for the first time and the song</li>
            <li> I have bought many others and he has chosen this to be his final choice.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded from the Mach 3 to the Fusion Proglide, and no question the Fusion Proglide gave a smoother more comfortabl shave than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5</li>
            <li> And for that, the Mach 3 is still my first choice.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li> Schick HYDRO 5 offers a great shave and value for the average guy, who has to shave every day and is not falling for the Gillette/P&amp;G $3.75-a-cartridge hype.</li>
            <li> overall feel is solid with a bit more weight than most refillables.</li>
            <li> Well, I first bought the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Though I am only 22, I have been through many razors in my day.</li>
            <li> you will likely be satisfied with this blade as well.</li>
            <li> After my first shave I knew this was going to be a keeper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and got a real &amp;#34;five&amp;#34; pack!</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of facial hair, mostly stubble, for which disposable Bic&#x27;s to the job.  </li>
            <li> Any way you shave it will accomadate it&#x27;s like having a barber travel with you anywhere also willing to work</li>
            <li> When I took my first shave</li>
            <li> But I did not want to dismiss this at the first look and was determined to try it out.</li>
            <li> and I am still on my first blade .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Will Recommend This To Anyone That Want Soft Smooth Skin After Finishing</li>
            <li> is the only razor I&#x27;ve been able to shave with consistently 3 days a week to avoid ALL of those problems.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this top notch would be to have a shower holder incorporated.</li>
            <li> This means that your first razor swipe is done without lubrication.</li>
            <li> It gave me my first blood-free shave.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> This razor works fantastic, it took me a shave or two to get accustomed to a new handle, but the shave itself was much nicer.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a extremely smooth shave, and i LOVE the skin guards which create less irritation and pull.</li>
            <li> Also the pivoting of the blades feels less smooth and agile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The handle is sturdy, blades super sharp out of the package, and changing cartridges is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> your face is of a different makeup, you may have a more positive result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked fine, but I got the same results and wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> its smooth glide and unbelievable shave left my face happy and me smiling.</li>
            <li> I shave my balls every other day with the Schick Hydro without any kind of lubricant and its painless every time.</li>
            <li> The other nice feature is that in a week&#x27;s time, I had no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Long story short, the Hydro is simply the best razor I have yet to come across!  </li>
            <li> It is hugely quieter - the Quattro sometimes sounds like a Weedeater - but that also means that its electric vibro mode is much less energetic than the Quattro&#x27;s, hence much less effective, leaving me to wonder what the point is of the Hydro having a vibro mode at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shick was good about refunding my money and they are sending me a kit to return the supplies to them for analysis, but I have no reason to believe this is a defective product, since I tried three different cartridges that performed the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Sensor Excels (2 blades) for something like 20 years now and decided to finally update my shaving routine to the more modern 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Use your thumb to grab the top of the cartridge, and the aloe strip flip back to get a straight edge for trimming under the nostrils and side</li>
            <li> But I have never, ever liked the \\&quot;paddle effect\\&quot; of those blades, hinged at the bottom; I&#x27;ve always felt one step removed from complete control, especially pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> but IMO more blades doesn&#x27;t always mean a better razor.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I can get my money back with the rebate, if not, I would be so pissed right now.</li>
            <li> The green flip top allows you to precisely trim and can easily flip back up to shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving a long time, so over the years I have tried most blades from the cheapie plastic disposables to the high-end razors like this one.</li>
            <li> It just slides along my skin (or rather it FEELS like it is, because it cuts very well without pulling on the first stroke, in fact about as well as two or three strokes it would&#x27;ve taken the Quattro.)  </li>
            <li> I just used this razor for the first time, and frankly, I&#x27;m very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> The first couple of shaves is fine, but by the 5th time I shaved my head with it, I was getting all kinds of gunk left on my head.</li>
            <li> Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro.</li>
            <li> mad smooth and no cuts and leaves my face feeling wonderful and soft</li>
            <li> I saw this new razor and cream in a Wallyworld store and figured it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally I am super sensitive to shaving and have always been a Gillette guy.</li>
            <li> I go from major stubble to clean shave and</li>
            <li> The biggest difference though, is that I was able to use a single Hydro 5 blade for 2 weeks, shaving 5 times per week.</li>
            <li> blade is a bit large, but I did not have any problem shaving around my beard.  </li>
            <li> * Large plastic guard/border gets in the way of shaving curved areas</li>
            <li> The head of the razor is large compared with what I was using, so it took a bit of getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can move the lubricant side up and away to get a clean straight shave than flip it right back for a lubricated shave.</li>
            <li> Not cool, I&#x27;d deffinately look for a differend kind ext time</li>
            <li> One final recommendation: I have very sensitive skin, and most aftershave products do not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 has proven to be much more skin friendly and the blades seem to stay sharper longer than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I always use to get some kind of razor burn.. now I never get it!</li>
            <li> great brand of razors, my bear is a hard one and no other brand of razors compares with this, incluiding electric razor, in my case nothing works as good and as long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of double edge razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Finally, the head on this thing is HUGE.</li>
            <li> The hydro 5 is a much smoother and closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I really shave?\\&quot; - a 4.5 -</li>
            <li> This one was very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written too much already, so</li>
            <li> The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  </li>
            <li> The head is also very flexible and countours to the shape of your face.  </li>
            <li> Very underrated in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Schick should have done this much sooner with</li>
            <li> too much</li>
            <li> I was out of my straight blades</li>
            <li> ], I don&#x27;t really need that feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth shave after only one swipe.  </li>
            <li> I really dont like this razor..</li>
            <li> I used schick hydro and it hurt so much.</li>
            <li> the cost of blades really adds up compared to the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing left but smooth</li>
            <li> What used to take 25-30 minutes now only takes 12, and it&#x27;s a smooth experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair grows in a lot of different angles too, but I can have everything gone in around 12 minutes with my head being perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> get real: FIVE blades?</li>
            <li> in all I really like this razor</li>
            <li> It delivers a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro simply does not provide as smmoth, close or comfortable a shave as the Gillette Fusion and the blades&#x27; quality is rather flimsy.</li>
            <li> While using the trimmer, the five blades really do their job.</li>
            <li> I was also losing hope when the price of blades started going up and being put into theft proof boxes hahaha.</li>
            <li> Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li> The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li> But when I looked in the mirror I realized that it shaved everything very well.</li>
            <li> That being said I don&#x27;t see really any advantage over the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the gel reservoir was working.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion handle is much, much much easier to grip, particularily if you shave upward rather than downward.</li>
            <li> A comfortable close shave is a must, but I also need a razor that can last a while without gouging me with overpriced replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Absolutely none of the \\&quot;flamethrower to the face\\</li>
            <li> the Fusion has 5 blades, VERY close together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette blade user simply because I could never find anything that shaved as close and smooth.</li>
            <li> actually PREVENTS a smooth shave, if you can believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was done my shave was real patchy with a lot spots missed.  </li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t have to do his face much (hence the TWO</li>
            <li> Got one of these free as a same</li>
            <li> Smooth to start, than I got the the spot underneath your nose above your lip.</li>
            <li> really love(d)</li>
            <li> After I shave, this makes my beard really stand out.</li>
            <li> Much shorter life than quattro blades.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close with almost no effort.  </li>
            <li> I expected to love this razor based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> Overall the hydro function was nice when it actually shaved my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hydro 5 for a week now and so far the shave is as close as my 2 blade, if only slightly better.</li>
            <li> Clearly everyone is different, but way too many nicks for me.</li>
            <li> The blades are sensibly hinged in the middle and, indeed, I get complete control and a noticeably better shave, faster, than I get from the Gillette products.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for more than 50 years, beginning with a classic Gillette single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.th the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.    </li>
            <li> The first time I tried something new</li>
            <li> I did not have a positive experience with the Mach 3 Turbo and gave it away after my first use because it irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li> In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep</li>
            <li> The Quatro and this Hydro5 both suffer from the same problem the razor is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t shave very well if you have more than a 2day growth, and this is coming from a guy who has blonde fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> This razor hacks through my thicket of a beard with greater ease than any other razor I have used.</li>
            <li> While shaving with the grain, the Hydro 5 does a much better job than other razors in delivering a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I was finding that in general the razors with three blades had hit the sweet spot and all the razors with more than three blades were just overkill and not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> I wish Shick would redesign this handle so it is more like the Fusion and every other razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> i love the five blade because i don&#x27;t have to used them every other day to shave my head.thanks schick.</li>
            <li> pull your hair like most of the other brand&#x27;s do &amp;#60;3&lt;</li>
            <li> The five blades make it awkward to use at best and having to flip the top down to get underneath my nose is a pain.  </li>
            <li> The blades seemed to dull after the first use and I never felt like I got the kind of shave I should have.  </li>
            <li> started first shaving with a norelco electric, moved to a mach 3 and used that for 7 years, tried the quattro and threw it out with my cats litter waste, moved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3</li>
            <li> Is it weird that I think it felt great the first time I used one of these?</li>
            <li> I have never gotten such a close, clean shave with no shave irritation.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion (it&#x27;s the vibrating kind) can&#x27;t even shave my face (which is arguably less sensitive of an area) without inflicting cuts and</li>
            <li> The blades last FOREVER and can easily be honed (not sharpened, google it) with an old pair of denim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also like that the lubrication area pulls back so that you can use the full blade for trimming and getting up under the nose area.  </li>
            <li> As an old school aside, do any of us really need 5 blades to shave?!?</li>
            <li> When I was 15 I started out with my dad&#x27;s old Sensor which worked pretty well</li>
            <li> razors I&#x27;ve used have been too bulky or big to really get everything without having to go over several more times.</li>
            <li> I did notice that this razor shaves better with the gel dispenser flipped down</li>
            <li> I prefer the one blade on the top rather than the flip down thing on the hydro 5 too.</li>
            <li> The conditioning strip can be a little too gooey when the blade is new, but the shaves are super smooth and the conditioner never dries out - even after extended use.</li>
            <li> have shaved several times with the new Schick and am still on the original blade.  </li>
            <li> Shaving other areas is just as good, even when I&#x27;m shaving dry.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the new Schick 5 Blade Hydro hoping they decided to change the blade spacing but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> Less money, better razor.</li>
            <li> However, this razor I use for shaving the face as I do it more often and requires less cleaning time.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone getting a decent shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li> Even after flipping the cartridge out of the way you do not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> take in mind the bump gaurds they have on the blades keep it from being super close (close enough) but again I have not cut myself at all with these blades.</li>
            <li> The main areas I shave are my mustache, front of my neck, under arms, chest, stomach and</li>
            <li> The main reason for buying this was for my head, as I prefer being bald.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying these and don&#x27;t go by the older reviews.</li>
            <li> The main reason for me to try this one was refill cartridge price.</li>
            <li> I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 at first seems a little bulky, but after shaving it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li> I keep a bag of cheap single blade disposables for that task alone.</li>
            <li> The single trimmer blade found on Gillettes is a nice feature but much rougher than a disposable single</li>
            <li> So I often find that I have to go over the same spot 4 or 5 times, each time inching closer to my beard so as to avoid a very funny looking shaved</li>
            <li> My beard gets pretty thick sometimes, and I still can&#x27;t find something that will shave it off good enough.  </li>
            <li> The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> With annual razor blade expenses equivalent to a high end electric shaver, I resent the weekly $3 per blade expenditure.</li>
            <li> It is better than FUSION or any other brand/model as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I had used the Schick Quattro for many years, but decided to try a new razor after realizing that the quality of the blades was deteriorating.  </li>
            <li> Schick has a real winner here, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades themselves or the super slick gel that slowly oozes out of the holes in the top of the cartridge, but I just got the most comfortable shave of my life with this thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the life of a normal blade is for most people, but this seemed a little bit longer than the Gillete Mach 3 with the way I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of the blade also doesnt allow for much precision, such as the area right under the nose, or other detailed spots.  </li>
            <li> ) If your hair is coarse, better to shave lightly twice than pressing too hard and bleeding.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> But considering the cost of the cartridge refills, not that much nicer than my old Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Blades are considerably cheaper was one bonus, but the real bonus is the shave itself.</li>
            <li> I used to think, along with expensive price, came a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it again for a few shaves and see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing it like a normal razor doesn&#x27;t even help.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Schick Quattro but my wife had a coupon and brought this one home</li>
            <li> You may not experience the same results, but still, it&#x27;s worth giving it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy these.</li>
            <li> I am a electric razor guy for the normal day to day shaving, and a Gillette guy for years.</li>
            <li> I normally use Gillettes products</li>
            <li> A did a few online searches for reviews, and decided it was a safe</li>
            <li> Though the feeling may change, shaving daily has become far more than a necessary drudgery....</li>
            <li> This was the first mens razor I tried after going through nearly ever razor developed for women to realize that obviously they were all made by men who want women to suffer through razor burn and having to shave every single day :).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    </li>
            <li> Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip flips up so you can get right up next to the beard or sideburns.</li>
            <li> In particular, I have a place under my chin and along the neck that I&#x27;ve always had to attack several times, from several directions, to get smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, for half the price this razor system is definitely worth the money and a suitable alternative if you give your skin and face some time to adjust as you would have to with any other blade, even if you were moving from Bic to Gillette.</li>
            <li> now I just use the Fusion for that back blade that does the \\&quot;fine tuning\\&quot; on my beard and such.</li>
            <li> The extra blade and lubricating strip make this shaver much too large to get a close shave under my nose.</li>
            <li> With my old Gillette razors, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any razor cuts, but i&#x27;m a little more cautious using Schick.</li>
            <li> I went on a trip, and forgot my razor, and was given a new Hydro 5 at the hotel.  </li>
            <li> The new hydro strip does make for a smoother feel than the strip on the Quattro razors.</li>
            <li> However, I have two problems with the new design.</li>
            <li> That is a testament to the new blade.  </li>
            <li> He asked me to try this new razor he has been using, the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> Of course, that means a new razor is needed.</li>
            <li> As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades</li>
            <li> It arrived in new condition as stated.</li>
            <li> A guy I work with was bragging about his new razor, but I thought,</li>
            <li> I thought I just have to get used to the new design</li>
            <li> ( I was that determined to try new razor).</li>
            <li> If close to the price of disposables, I will have found a new blade to use for some time to come.</li>
            <li> These nick me and seem like an old razor when still brand new!</li>
            <li> all serious though this razor feels amazing against your skin</li>
            <li> Glad I only spent $7 on this thing.</li>
            <li> The hydrating gel definitely helps, but this definitely makes you smooth.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a fantastic shaving experience with long lasting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to leave my long time standard 5 Blade and try other possibly greener pastures, but I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have switched razors in several years.  </li>
            <li> First, is five blades really necessary?</li>
            <li> By the way I am a female using this razor, as I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s for females or males, but I&#x27;m a convert for sure!</li>
            <li> introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 5 blades sounds like this schick will do its job, but I will update once I figure how many sharp months the blades will last before having to switch them out.</li>
            <li> That strip also helps keep your face soft and minimizes razor burn or breakouts!</li>
            <li> Like virtually every other Schick razor, the Hydro is most definitely inferior to comparable razors from archrival Gillette.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve bought a Schick and also will be the last.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor a try and was surprised how close the shave was without a thousand nicks or razor burn caused by a normal 5 blade.</li>
            <li> Same results as the first time and</li>
            <li> Aside from that the actual blades don&#x27;t seem to get close and leave stray hairs and stubble, this is one the FIRST use.</li>
            <li> That should have been my first clue to get away from Schick entirely, but I decided to give the Hydro a shot anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young, only 20, but the good Lord has cursed (or blessed) me with some ridiculously thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave, and I never once nicked myself, which is very rare, especially with a new razor.</li>
            <li> I want to like these and switch away from overpriced Gillette, but these simply have to cheap a feel to stick with over the long term.</li>
            <li> I typically shower without the light on.  </li>
            <li> Why would anyone waste their time shaving with a cartridge razor which gets easily gunked up</li>
            <li> have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I find it funny that the average star rating here is 4/5, but the average star rating for the replacement blade pack is better.</li>
            <li> If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li> You can expect a smooth and tight shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> I have a chubby face, sensitive skin and facial hair that is quick to grow (I have to shave daily), but not coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so large, you can see the back of the razor.</li>
            <li> To properly evaluate the new Schick Hydro 5 razor, I decided to compare it to the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power.</li>
            <li> On 5 bladed razors the blades seem to get clogged to quickly probably due to the lack of space between each blade</li>
            <li> The five blades didn&#x27;t glide smoothly; it felt like it was more tugging that it was cutting.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this miracle touched my face, i throw my gellit in the trash</li>

            <li> must be cleaned after nearly every swipe&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It shaved well when the slime bar was pushed back, exposing all five blades, but too much bother and</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t like the way the head tilts, but perhaps because I&#x27;m used to the fixed head of the Sensor.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> I cannot use an electric razor since they really don&#x27;t seem to work with my facial hair.  </li>

            <li> Unlike the old adage, \\&quot;fool me once, shame on you...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t complete one stroke before it clogged and pulled whiskers.  </li>
            <li> blade itself is about 2x larger than that of the Senor with 4 blades very close to one another.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin combined with a medium/heavy beard growth and have always had problems with irritation.</li>
            <li> Gillette sucks compared to these.these are better.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with it is that it goops up your face with so much gell that it constantly clogs the blade needing cleaning after each pass of the blade.  </li>
            <li> never feel burned or chaffed or sensitive after shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;What wasn&#x27;t close though was how much longer the Hydro 5 blades last than the Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> while I get great shaves from it the time investment and the inevitable terrible cuts I give myself every now and then had me wanting to find a cartridge razor I liked.</li>
            <li> *cough* sensitive areas, and all the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive razor as part of a sponsored program.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have sensitive skin, give this razor a try</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to break out..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have to buy a blade again as far</li>
            <li> I then even moved on to trying the old school way of shaving, you know, the soap, the mug, the brush, the shaving oil, safety razor, etc.</li>
            <li> Well the Hydro 5 really made me a believer and now will only shave with this.</li>
            <li> This razor helped me transition from my old electric razor to using hand razors.</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail and so as not to let it go to waste</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; action is a bit sketchy..</li>
            <li> My skin in sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Pro Glide and with this razor having 5 blades I thought it would at least be comparable.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried the Schick Hydro 5 (the power version)... and was REALLY</li>
            <li> sensitive skin hydro is basically latin for foolproof.</li>
            <li> Schick handles this by including the flip trimmer, and because of that, these disposables really do have everything I could hope for in such a product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The hydrating gel pad flips back to give sideburns a straight edge.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with the Hydro 5, I had to pull out my old razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hydrating gel kept my skin soft and supple and 5 blades eliminated any and all</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, she uses those blades for several years and likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I can finally say my side burns are straight and not like a character from star trek.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick needs to promote this much more heavily, because if they can get a man to try this he&#x27;ll drop his Fusion in the trashcan and never look back.</li>
            <li> the blade spacing has not changed and to make things worse the top of the blade is covered so much</li>
            <li> I used the one blade the entire week and think it could have still done a few more shaves.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I think its worth a try and the price through Amazon, though not cheap, seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> This razor may be good if you have thin facial hair</li>
            <li> The blades are more spaced and the back of the razor is more open, but between the little metal &amp;#34;stabilizer rods&amp;#34; to keep the blades stiff that...</li>
            <li> The flip top back is a bit awkward and not as useful as the touch-up top blade on some other products.</li>
            <li> I must admit, this five bladed razor by Schick reminds me of a Saturday Night Live spoof when the first three bladed razors were introduced years ago.</li>
            <li> The strip on the hydro 5 is actually pretty cool because it puffs up creating a very slick gliding surface.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this razor was far worse, but then I gave it a couple of tries and noticed that It performed quite nicely.</li>
            <li> That is the exact reason the Fusion comes with a single blade on the end.  </li>
            <li> He also said that he has had many such complaints over the past year.  </li>
            <li> If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually get a Fusion blade to last out to two weeks because I shave after showering, but at that point the lubrication strip is gone and the blades are pulling more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> not only does it not seem to be competing to the older Gillette</li>
            <li> but ultimately I had to go back to my Quattro after the first shave (had to re-shave)</li>
            <li> The only thing I have issue with is the large area where they put the strip on top of the razor makes it tough to get close under my nose</li>
            <li> The Hydro has been going strong for two weeks now and is still cutting smooth and the lubrication area keeps on working as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 for the past 6 years, I  got this free today and used it...</li>
            <li> my opinion, manufacturing nowadays is frequently of much more uneven quality than years gone by; and 5 blades seems to me to mainly just raise the chances that one of the blades is slightly defective.....</li>
            <li> I usually get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I typed this really fast at work, so excuse any grammatical errors.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and have been using this blade exclusively for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning and did my usual routine and then got out of the shower to shave, the first pass with the grain was nothing special, but when I started the second pass against the grain it was like I had found shaving nirvana.</li>
            <li> The wider plastic border makes it tough to accurately line up the blades so that I don&#x27;t trim too much.  </li>
            <li> When developing a new product, sooner or later you have to shoot the design engineers and go into production.  </li>
            <li> that is this Shick Hydro 5 is my new one and only shaver now.  </li>
            <li> gave the extra blades to my partner, and even she couldn&#x27;t really use it properly on her legs.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so much you can talk about with a standard razor without coming off as obsessive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered 4 cartridges of the 3 blade version, as the handle is compatible with them (another plus) and will be testing to see if those five blades really are necessary, and hopefully cut some cost as well.</li>
            <li> I thought it had a total of five heads when it clearly said blades!</li>
            <li> was a fool for far, far, far too long.</li>
            <li> , the blades on the Hydro are slightly further apart and the lubricating strip is slightly higher than the Proglide, so what ends up happening is that I have to put additional pressure on the blades, and they are further apart, which ends up causing razor burn and knicks, especially under my nose</li>
            <li> Recommended for broad strokes, but not for detail work.</li>
            <li> I had some major nicks and bleeding incidents from these blades.  </li>
            <li> Works fine and hard to find in the brick and mortar places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flip top system for cutting under nose and sideburns is hands down no question way better than the Gillette fusion I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll easily use the same blade for months (usually 3 to 4ish).  </li>
            <li> Trying to spend less money and bought Shick hydro 5, right away I could tell a deference.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to spend a lot of time trying to get problem areas like around the jaw line clean, but not with this razor.</li>
            <li> the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor works very well for sensitive skin.i do not cut myself like i do with other razors.it</li>
            <li> The blades seemed to stay sharp with no tugging and the smooth feeling lasted longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clean and dry my razor after each use and a single mach 3 will last me 6 months, I throw it away as soon as it starts to cut me</li>
            <li> I would have given it 4 stars, but I have large hands and find razor slipping out of my hands some times.</li>
            <li> I think that the flip back top is NOT really useful and prefer that they put a single edge on the back but gave 5 stars anyway</li>
            <li> With this thing I can shave in less than half the time it used to take, plus the results are better, with NO</li>
            <li> All I could think was great for off-road vehicles, bad for close</li>
            <li> A simple run under the faucet and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even last long, it was very upsetting.</li>
            <li> I could barely feel it at all.</li>
            <li> I accidentally shaved over the sensitive area above your acheillies tendon</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that both razers perform almost identically despite the massive price difference.</li>
            <li> The massive skin guard/lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t allow for a precision shave, or anywhere near it.</li>
            <li> I have been a lifelong Gillette user who occasionally tries Shick products hoping for something cool.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you can still use the expensive Fusion you already own.</li>
            <li> And the Hydro 5 blades just feel more substantial against the skin than the thin Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Shaving preference are very individual, however, and you may find that you love the Shick which should allow you to save a little money over Gillette and other makes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I can live with the larger head design in order for me to save a ton of money on the refills.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is due to the large gaps between the razors and the skin guards.</li>
            <li> I also dry shave because, outside of my goatee, I don&#x27;t have much of a beard.</li>
            <li> (If I was to be super picky and critical and had to choose a winner, I actually thought the Hydro 5 gave a slightly smoother closer shave than the</li>
            <li> It does release a gel, but it&#x27;s nothing noticeable, and ends up leaving your face much softer than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This blade works very well on my face while other cause rashes.</li>
            <li> the lotion really helped prevent any razor burn (those dull fusion blades would really tear into me).</li>
            <li> Not a single tug or pull.</li>
            <li> I really like the reservoir of super slick lubricant that these Hydro 5 have, but I would recommend you make it part of your routine to wet the razor right off the bat just to give it some time to hydrate; especially if you don&#x27;t use or only use little shaving gel/</li>
            <li> TWO cartridges will last me (light beard) about at least a year.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old brand, but wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> While I used these same razors in the UK under the brand name listed above, in the US the quality is far lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who normally buy a pack of disposables and use them too long, but this blade is a cut above those (pun intended!)</li>
            <li> This blade does not dry shave as well at all.</li>
            <li> 5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always used Gillette razors, occasionally Schick would come out with a new razor</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth much of my time so here are the bullet</li>
            <li> Thank God, because once I tried it, I found that it provided a much smoother shave and was easier to maneuver than other &#x27;female&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first blade got so clogged with gunk that my third shave was a mess.</li>
            <li> First day I received the razor, I looked at its design and immediately disliked it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a Fusion user, do yourself a favor and try the Hydro5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still using the Hydro5, but I have cut myself a few times with it which is funny because I never cut myself with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> so i think the reason why i got razor bumps was because, i applied too much pressure and wasn&#x27;t going with the grain properly because, i only got razor burn below my jaw line since i&#x27;m a black young man with very coarse curly hair</li>
            <li> When everything was said and done, the shaving experience was not only a little smoother but absolutely zero razor burn!</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say about this razor is that it stays sharp enough to shave my face even after shaving my private regions.</li>
            <li> If you have only shaved your whole life with an electric not a big deal and a nice upgrade, but to try and go from razor to electric is painful.</li>
            <li> little pricey but much cheaper, higher quality, and takes up less space (both the razor body and the blade cartridge) compared to majority of &#x27;female&#x27; razors.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck, which is easily grazed with cheaper razors, and that requires that I shave very slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li> It sometimes takes a couple of tries to snag the new cart from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the most part I have had some pretty bad experiences.</li>
            <li> Sure, it probably makes things smoother, but it mades the head larger and made shaving above my lip very difficult -- too many blades for a small area.</li>
            <li> First off I shaved with my Feather razor with a Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Double Edge Blades (green package).</li>
            <li> It was very different filling from what I had with Mach3 for over 4 years now and my first thought was that Hydro5 was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Normally, frequent shaves have a tendency to create chafing or redness; though I do not use this every single day, there are times where I will touch up every couple days</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Gillette could have engineered a Fusion blade that lasts much longer and is less expensive, but they didn&#x27;t because they decided to be greedy and make blades that need replacement often.</li>
            <li> At first it was hard to tell if there was a major upgrade.</li>
            <li> The blades are spaced a little farther apart on this razor than others so it doesn&#x27;t really clog.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, to the point I can only shave every other day.</li>
            <li> The good news is I find the shave about the same as the Fusion, the bad news is the head design on the Schick is a littler &#x27;taller&#x27;</li>
            <li> Anytime time I&#x27;ve used a Gillette or other razor with multiple blades they would clog to the point where I would have to blow the clog out or pick at it with an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The placed small bars on the back of the blades and somehow the hair does not clog up near as bad and for the most part washes right out.</li>
            <li> I apply little pressure because of it and the 4 blades shave more hair with less irritation than a 3 blade but don&#x27;t clog like a 5 blade which can cause irritation from constant stopping and uneven shaving.</li>
            <li> The larger head took a few minutes to adjust to, particularly under the nose, around the mouth area, and over the Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a Merkur DE with Derby blades, because over the long run they are relatively inexpensive and I would not be tied into a specific brand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these blades are supposed to last, but I&#x27;ve been using the same one for approx 30-40 shaves, which is around 4 or 5 shaves per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried it several times and it still cuts me, although not as severely as the first time, if I use a really thick shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The only part I dislike is that it&#x27;s hard to get into tight spaces but definitely worth that trade off!</li>
            <li> The only point of that I can see is to not completely copy the Gillette series razors which Schick has tended to do over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed these blades seem to last longer (like twice as long).  </li>
            <li> The Fusion blades don&#x27;t last long for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about how long the cartridge will last, but with my Sensor I change its blade about every 30 days.</li>
            <li> I had to come back and get with my razor defeating the purpose) and it takes twice as long to shave in the morning vs with a razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these shick cartridges are going to last</li>
            <li> The slime attachment is just a mess, I had goop dripping down my cheek from the first tentative swipe.  </li>
            <li> The blades will also last a long time!</li>
            <li> But $13+ for four replacement blades that don&#x27;t really last very long?</li>
            <li> Through painful trial and error I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I have the most sensitive skin on the planet.</li>
            <li> The next problem is that, with those five blades, combined with the fact that the water flow is restricted from the back, it is difficult to clean the hair and gel from between the blades between strokes.</li>
            <li> Gillette really solved the problem of hair and skin clogging the spaces between the blades, which Schick has always had a really difficult time with before the Hydro line and still hasn&#x27;t really mastered.</li>
            <li> I guess a lot of people like this razor, but I want my back blade back, and I don&#x27;t need these bumper things that make this so wide.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and son who both walked out of the bathroom covered in toilet paper squares.</li>
            <li> The blades on the Hydro5 are gapped wide enough for the stubble to push out the back as you go.</li>
            <li> I use to get one shave out of an individual single- or double-blade razor that comes in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> thought the vibrating feature with the single AA battery was a gimmick, but it actually seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how long I can make one cartridge last by stropping and keeping the blades dry).</li>
            <li> One small complaint I have about the Hydro 5 is that the snap back trimmer pulls a little more compared to the Fusion, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for</li>
            <li> I first saw the ads for a razor with five blades, I thought, &#x27;this is getting ridiculous.&#x27;</li>
            <li> going back to the quattro or extreme 3, this is a total dud, all hype.</li>
            <li> Upon opening, I realized there was only a single spare head with three empty slots which would make a total of five.  </li>
            <li> It feels slick and fast, making long shaves in a single pass.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave that doesn&#x27;t burn, you have coarse whiskers and wear out blades like crazy, and don&#x27;t want to pay Gillette 2X the cost for their inferior products, then get the Schick Hydro5!&#x27;t want to pay Gillette 2X the cost for their inferior products, then get the Schick Hydro5!</li>
            <li> I was there but really find it hard to believe.</li>
            <li> Not only was there no razor drag, it was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Schick did was take the women&#x27;s shaver and molded it in blue instead of pink.  </li>
            <li> The blade cartridge is too wide (with 4 unneeded blades and 2 extra parts).  </li>
            <li> This blade lasts twice as long as the Sensor Excel and the discount coupons make it a steal.</li>
            <li> My brother is in the military, I am a Veteran.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the handle is a bit strange as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to get that section pulled back, but I find once that is done that using the main blade for those tasks is better than using the little trimming blade on the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use shaving strokes that make several passes in different directions across and up and down my face to try to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The Hydro took a lot longer too because I had to go over the same spot numerous times to get the job done whereas the Fusion would have gotten the job done with way less</li>
            <li> I prefer baby oil and then plain old shaving cream</li>
            <li> I have sensitive pale skin, that tends to be dry not oily.</li>
            <li> only complaint is it is difficult to get right up to my nose because of the large shaving head.</li>
            <li> I have not considered other &#x27;male&#x27; razors because I&#x27;m content with this one but maybe another day.</li>
            <li> I experimented with two other brands and left one of each in the shower for all 4 family members showers and neither</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor cut everywhere!</li>
            <li> To use the trimmer I had to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.</li>
            <li> To use the trimmer I had to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.</li>
            <li> The Hydro&#x27;s vibro mode has low-medium-high power selections, but since even on high it is hardly helpful, I don&#x27;t see the point of selectability at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A word of caution: after shaving, you must allow the razor to dry.  </li>
            <li> The blades on their razors are spaced to close together making them difficult to clean</li>
            <li> Electronic/dry-shaves cause break outs and ingrown hairs, shaving too often means ingrown hairs with razor burn, and too infrequently means breakouts and dry</li>
            <li> I would rather spend the extra money on a Fusion Pro Glide Power than to waste money on a Hydro5 because I have to just go back over my face with my Fusion anyways.</li>
            <li> it is harder than i expected to flip the lubricating part back but its a nifty concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also normally shaving right under your nose with a 5 blade is really impossible due to the size of the blade, by flipping back the moisturizing strip</li>
            <li> I think the extra large &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; on the razor makes it difficult to determine where you are going to shave (sideburns) or doesn&#x27;t allow you to get the razor close to your nose on your upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I knocked off a star because while they state that the moisturizing strip will last longer than other brands, I found that if it wasnt gone after one shave I could only get about another half of a shave out of it.</li>
            <li> so it is not your normal thick beard.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shake it vigorously for five minutes, you end up with gallons of shaving cream-saturated water cascading down your naked body.</li>
            <li> Overall, I guess it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> Paired with the new Hydro cream, I am using less cream, generating less irritation, and am using less blades all with the same results I would get from the other guy.  </li>
            <li> Also very difficult to shave under the nose with such a huge lubrication area.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Proglide line has been my sole razor for about the last 5 years, but the price for the cartridges is ridiculous, nevertheless the refills do last about 3 months each.</li>
            <li> With this razor it takes half the time to get rid of coarse under arm or bikini line hair and keeps it</li>
            <li> shaving ability: equal to, or less than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> both tests, the Hydro and the Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but not enough to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That razor required several passes to reach BBS, and penalized me with some gnarly razor burn about half the time.  </li>
            <li> have this on auto-subscription and get it for less than $7.00 each including 2 extra cartridges...hard to beat!</li>
            <li> I use the Schick Hydro 5 differently than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for next to nothing as part of the Black Friday deals.</li>
            <li> But I soon discovered that the Fusion blades wear out quickly (about 7-14 days max) and are expensive so</li>
            <li> The big plastic lube tip gets in the way of saving tight areas.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I use electric razors mainly, and have a hard time finding a conventional razor that does as well without shredding my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did a head to head comparison against the Fusion Proglide(shaving one half of my face with the Fusion and the other half with the Hydro 5) over several days and would rate their shave about equal.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought the Hydro blade casing might be a little too bulky but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product through a promotion and was a little scared to switch Razors, as a FUsion user i have never had any problems or discomfort from my razor and didnt want to start.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for 2 weeks now and it just started to lose a little bit of the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Likely the brand has little to do with it, but I happened to purchase this razor at Sam&#x27;s Club and that is all they had.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little harder to get between your nose and upper lip.</li>
            <li> However, the \\&quot;flip back top\\&quot; does not hold up to the percision trimmer on the back of the fusion as it is a bit hard to reach under the nose.</li>
            <li> 40, male, heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I was on another trip, and a put the wet razor in a baggie.  </li>
            <li> For &#x27;closeness&#x27; I judge a razor by how rough my face is by running my hand from neck to chin, so against the grain, after a shave - Like I never had hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a few weeks and changed the blades multiple times.  </li>
            <li> I used the Hydro 5 today and I had to go over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no razor burn, this thing contores to the shape of your face.</li>
            <li> The wide blades, made wider with that funky plastic border, really make it difficult in getting the curve at the back of the skull.  </li>
            <li> Never really had that issue with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And going against the grain on the neck area produced absolutely no razor burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Hydro is so wide that it&#x27;s like shaving with a finger-skateboard.</li>
            <li> Besides that, this thing is too wide and does not contour to my face at all.</li>
            <li> It is a neat concept, but not very efficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sightly easier to manipulate, but not much.</li>
            <li> i dont have to go over the same spot a few times to get the hair up.</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over, I would just stick with the Mach 4 and save myself the money I spent on this razor.</li>
            <li> the time I started using these blades, I noticed that the country of manufacture was Germany....which is what I expected for something of this quality, at that time.</li>
            <li> The aloe strip seems to last for a few shaves, then tapers off a bit.  </li>
            <li> The only solution until the Hydro 5 was taking short strokes and rinsing very often which is somewhat annoying now that I can practically shave my entire face with 2 or 3 day stubble and only rinse a couple times as opposed to rinsing after every stroke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and felt that double edge was just the way to go for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Though it usually takes 30 minutes to completely shave off the beard, it took me half the time with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps because the blades are so close together, it&#x27;s easy for them to get clogged and very difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dry my razor off after each shave and store it upside down</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Hydrating reservoir\\&quot; ended up making my face really slimy and unpleasant, and the blade head is so large that it makes shaving around tight spaces difficult (and the single blade option isn&#x27;t very helpful).</li>
            <li> It also seems that I have to press harder to get a close shave, as compared to my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no real reason other than I like variety, and during the summer I water my yard</li>
            <li> Other razors do this as well, but the lubrication strip is so large that it&#x27;s impossible for me to shave the area directly below my nose.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the high priced Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> The next day, I discovered that the gel reservoir had \\&quot;melted\\&quot; into uncontrollable \\&quot;alien</li>
            <li> I have a sharp jawline and pointy adams-apple.</li>
            <li> I have been using whatever I can find that is cheapest for the past ten or fifteen years.  </li>
            <li> Usually that means a Target brand two blade disposable that comes in a pack of ten for about two bucks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my Sensor while I experiment with other razors.</li>
            <li> shave my head every other day and trim around my beard every day.  </li>
            <li> I bought the razor at COSTCO and I continued to spend $42 for 16 refill blades every other month or so.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve managed to stretch one blade shaving every other day with shaving cream for 4 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I bought a package of shaving creme from Sam&#x27;s Club the other day with this razor included, which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li> The HYDRO 5 blades are sharp and well-suspended, so they do not chew your face up by Friday.</li>
            <li> only thing, which I do not like about this razor is it does not give that slick shave, which I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every other day and it still doesn&#x27;t do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit unwieldy when you first use it, and the refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> I was pretty bored of paying the exorbitant prices Gillette charges for refill cartridges, so decided to check out their competition.</li>
            <li> but that was probably due to my performance.</li>
            <li> and I was more disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to return to my other razor to finish up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sharp.  </li>
            <li> I am on Korean USA military base in Korea, and last week I received a free Schick 5 with my Edge.  </li>
            <li> The blade guides effortlessly across my skin and provides a close shave yet has yet to cause any nicks that other razors sometimes provide.  </li>
            <li> than other brands and will stick with this one for life.</li>
            <li> I wish I could link pictures, I would show everyone how badly this razor cut the back of my head open under normal wet shaving conditions.</li>
            <li> The hair on my face is not bear like at all, I have very minimal hair for a man.  </li>
            <li> It was a little awkward at first since it&#x27;s bigger than a disposable razor</li>
            <li> I have found that my current electric shaver works well (with a few spots that are difficult with a round razor - straight &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; for example) without anything</li>
            <li> Needless to say it went into the round file after the new blade on the second try</li>
            <li> However, in general, the price for razors is ridiculous and unjustified -</li>
            <li> But with sensitive skin and a tough beard, for me the Gillette Proglide out-shaved the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Creates less tension then my other razors.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s already getting slightly dull after only five uses.</li>
            <li> its makes it extra hard to rinse it out from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the savings.</li>
            <li> I see no compelling reason to give up what I am using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To understand the perspective of this review here are some facts about me: I have a beard that is thicker than the average man</li>
            <li> All of the above are secondary to the \\&quot;Yes,</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t understand if the blades were wrong or what.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable thorough whole</li>
            <li> Not a huge problem I guess, but when your forgetful like me it can be an incovenience to find a gooey razor in the morning.</li>
            <li> They need to put some better grips on the base.</li>
            <li> I shaved half my face with my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor and the other half with the Schick Hydro 5 and boy could I see, feel, and experience the difference.</li>
            <li> but the blades do get dull quickly which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get the spot right by your nose!</li>
            <li> When you flip it up, it stays up until you flip it down.  </li>
            <li> My dad was down for the holidays and happen to leave these.</li>
            <li> so water doesn&#x27;t run down and touch the blade part causing it to degrade faster.</li>
            <li> so it beats it hands down on price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I hate my hair growing back quickly, I can&#x27;t wait when the time comes to shave again</li>
            <li> The ability to flip down the moisturizing strip and trim my sideburns was an added plus.</li>
            <li> the whiskers, could shave twice a day and all the way down my neck too.  </li>
            <li> I got this razor to shave my head because of some reviews here and on a few other sites.</li>
            <li> The blades last longer, are less expensive and never leave the red rash and cuts that I received from Gilettes products.  </li>
            <li> I also get less irritation with the Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> I did feel slight pulling on some parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> I have always heard the typical \\&quot;shave with the grain\\&quot; in magazines and online.</li>
            <li> I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously used the fusion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of miserable shaves, I bought some expensive Gillette refills, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> A pack of Schick replacement blades is way less than half the price of Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Hydro 5 since it claims to have less irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is such an obvious fail.</li>
            <li> have to shaved for about a week and a half which is also a plus</li>
            <li> Blades are expensive, and I&#x27;m spending less money with traditional DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would choose the Schick Hydro above anything else in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less irritation and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I did not need to shave for a day and a half.  </li>
            <li> With this razor, I am finally able to shave back-to-back days when needed and without a bloody mess; I have a heavy beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but not least the Hydro 5 replacement blades are much less expensive than the Fusion replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also while the design of the case is convenient to keep the refills together with the razor, if you keep your razor in the shower like me, the moisturizing strip in the refills will melt and leave you with a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 blade lasts at least three or four times as long as the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Its a slime with alot of surface tension such that its not uncommon to have strings of it running from one side of your face to the other.  </li>
            <li> Only negative thing is that after 3-4 uses the blades gets dull and isn&#x27;t as sharp compared to Gillette fusion longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually when I slap on my after shave it burns due to nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> After a few confirming passes that had the blades coasting over the mess, I rinsed off and started over.  </li>
            <li> I purposely let my beard grow for 3 days, just to give it a little workout</li>
            <li> The Quattro would regularly get clogged so bad I would be forced to use a toothbrush to gently remove the logjam.</li>
            <li> for heavy beards</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> In the military, I was ordered to shave twice a day, once in the morning and once in the late afternoon.  </li>
            <li> It just seems that the slime bar is a waste</li>
            <li> At the moment I think I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> As a reference, I have fairly heavy growth and shave daily(twice</li>
            <li> The razors are quite a few dollars cheaper then the Fusion</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday.</li>
            <li> Besides, this gel is messy, as if you are putting slime on your face.</li>
            <li> but I could never get a close shave out of it without really irritating my face, next I went on to the Mach 3</li>
            <li> I have used  the Schick Quatrro Titanium for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Well, A few weeks ago, My wife was at the store,and she saw the Hydro 5, four blades and shaving cream for 9 dollars.</li>
            <li> MISSING A BLADE THAT TRIMS NOSE/EARS</li>
            <li> Totally a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you can handle the burn of 5-non-strategically placed blades, get this shaver; otherwise, this is a waste of time</li>
            <li> Schick Hyrdo 5 saves me approximately 5¢ per blade over competitors such as Fusion manual.</li>
            <li> The five blades give a ridiculously-close shave, though admittedly, they do make reaching some &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; (near the lips, edging of sideburn/hairline) difficult.</li>
            <li> waste your time with this one.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have to shave w/</li>
            <li> I shave everyday) and batteries once a week.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago it occurred to me that I was getting frankly crappy shaves.  </li>
            <li> There is no way this razor should receive less than four stars!</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that after rinsing out the blades, it is pretty much impossible to drain all the water from the blades.</li>
            <li> and I need to shave at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from my old trusty Gillette Mach 3 Turbo a few months back to the Schick Quattro Titanium, but was disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> these are long last lasting, close shaving, and kick the crap out of gillettes&#x27; blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very odd,</li>
            <li> The styling is a little clunky and doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as refined as the Gillette, but it&#x27;s a razor, right; most peoples&#x27; is disgusting and nasty anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A super blade gliding over the tough areas without cutting.  </li>
            <li> In both tests, the Hydro and the Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but not enough to be uncomfortable.    </li>
            <li> I also find that the blades become dull a lot quicker than other razors I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I just hated having to buy the refills so often and at such a high cost.  </li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s hit or miss.</li>
            <li> But, their constant price increases and insanely expensive refills made me change.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> But for the price of these, I usually just order one of them.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer/lubricant is excessive and makes my face feel like a squadron of slugs slimed their way across it.  </li>
            <li> With past razors (Fusion and even the Quattro)</li>
            <li> If the blades get even a small amount of hair in them, they don&#x27;t shave anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Power for the past year or so.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using the razor for the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not provide a close shave for me and missed several spots.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the expensive Feather razor worked as well as the Proglide--so it goes.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I probably would have given this razor at least 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The shave was close, usually I shave 3 or 4 days,</li>
            <li> That is unbelievable to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor.</li>
            <li> You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> the Wife Test, the Hydro side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a small</li>
            <li> In the Wife Test, the Hydro side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a small margin.    </li>
            <li> I usually get razor burn no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> No more burning sensation after finishing.</li>
            <li> A small touch-up, and</li>
            <li> I had tried Schick in the past and was not pleased, but I thought I&#x27;d give the Hydro 5 a try.</li>
            <li> Small cut</li>
            <li> - I think I bought the wrong one because he had to take to a local drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I love it more than Gillette, their prices are pathetic and outrageous.  </li>
            <li> when i have used disposables in the past, I would always get razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I usually check with my fingers when I shave  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor on an impulse because the store was out of my usual.  </li>
            <li> No more spending money on batteries.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not sure which way to shave below my jaw line</li>
            <li> Bought refills and they were no better.</li>
            <li> The blade has lasted about 6 months and is still going, shaving head usually about 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have a small face</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt having used both for a few weeks now that there is any benefit to 3 vice 5 blades.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, my cartridges usually break before they get dull.</li>
            <li> The razor just glided along like it wasn&#x27;t even cutting hair, and when I splashed on my aftershave it barely even burned.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because there a five blades and the dull slower or something.  </li>
            <li> I was getting 3 or 4 shaves and they would get dull.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Fusion Pro Glide, but those blades are dull after 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> The handle was bulky and hard to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> I grow a thick beard and could feel the Fusion blades getting dull after about 7 shaves.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to press hard, but use real shave cream and badger hair brush, not the aerosol crap and your fingers.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> They both complained of razor burn.</li>
            <li> At least the proceeds go to education.  </li>
            <li> but it sucks.</li>
            <li> My complaint is with the blades.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick stubble like I do, this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I gave it time, figuring it takes a while to adjust, but the blades wore out just as fast and the lingering burn was just too annoying</li>
            <li> I have a thick, course beard and am susceptible to ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed in this product in any way unless they have some hidden interest in one brand or another.....</li>
            <li> This one was very interesting to say the least, having 5 blades slide across your face at once is not very pleasant, but I have not experienced the horrible after pain as with the other razors and cartridges I have tried, so I guess this one is not too bad.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> This thing is the size of a small boat oar!  </li>
            <li> at twice as expensive the Gillette proglide does not exactly glide...</li>
            <li> This thing, on the other hand, is just plain awkward to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are the bad thing, they are pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, this review is based solely on the performance of the product, so if others mark it down for clogging or price of blades, I see those things as irrelevant.</li>
            <li> I like the flip-down feature that allows me to cut some serious detail on the side burns.  </li>
            <li> For the price and the comfort I cant see paying the ridiculous prices for Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> This was ridiculous and unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Schick is certainly less expensive, and it might well be the 5 blades rather than the brand causing</li>
            <li> bought this because it is supposed to be less expensive to operate than its competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Shick is less expensive to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve found blades to be very dull and uncomfortable past one week.</li>
            <li> Schick has an obviously inferior product to Gillette, and Gillette&#x27;s Fusion is a bad product to begin with.</li>
            <li> that fifth blade is no good.</li>
            <li> May upgrade after another use or two, but not much good going on with this razor for me.  </li>
            <li> This product is not good for men&#x27;s face shaving.</li>
            <li> That is not good.</li>
            <li> I use it second time, I was frustrated.</li>
            <li> Impossible to edge anything and worse yet, on my 3rd use</li>
            <li> But for me, the single worst aspect of this product was the amount of slimy goop that prevents a close shave, thereby, like some posters commented, requiring multiple passes, each time cleaning out the blade..</li>
            <li> (gel never impressed me, just alot of irritating fragrance and a waste if it falls off your skin onto the floor).</li>
            <li> I used shaving cream and sometimes it still did a minor cut there and there, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It also feels weak in your hands.</li>
            <li> At least try it for three days BEFORE you rate it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Gillette Fusion in the past, but stopped when I realized how expensive blades were and how comparable disposables were to the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get into the correct position.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to pinpoint where u want to shave so</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a great razor either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever had such a well working razor, and I usually hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I got tired of using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I was tired of wasting cash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like their prices, but it turns out they charge that much because their competition is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> This causes the razor burn, and it gets worse as the lube strip wears out.</li>
            <li> I ended up ditching my Gilette Proglide after growing tired of paying an arm and a leg for razors.</li>
            <li> Although the replacement blades for the Mach 3 are obscenely expensive, it at least gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Due to bad razor burn</li>
            <li> I was finding that the lube strip was half gone after one shave, and two or three shaves before the cartridges were too painful to use.</li>
            <li> Although the shave was average, I was disappointed in the life of each blade.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this razor just will not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The worst part about this razor is the tendency to leave multiple cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Schick Quattro and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I figured this razor was not perfect for shaving heads</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> , that shall remain nameless because that&#x27;s what that is compared to this.  </li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s are so expensive</li>
            <li> give four stars because I cannot believe that these cartridges need to be so expensive.</li>
            <li> Ill stick with my fusion power ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> I used to used Gillette products all my life, but the blades got too expensive.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and can&#x27;t go wrong with Schick.</li>
            <li> I started out using Gillette Fusion, but when I realized how expensive the replacement blades were, I started looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> I was using a Schick Quatro Titanium, prior to this purchase, which I horribly regret.</li>
            <li> Stupid Weak Blades.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use gillette with no worry of cutting myself up.</li>
            <li> that the Quattro, which for me made for a slightly awkward angle when holding the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results were disappointing.</li>
            <li> It glides over my face with ease with its movable cutting surface.  </li>
            <li> With Mach3 I could feel it cutting my hair, so I knew I was shaving.</li>
            <li> I just bought one of these horrible razors yesterday and had the absolute worst shaving experience in my life.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for at least 6 months and have to say the results are horrible.  </li>
            <li> razor isn&#x27;t all bad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a really bad razor, it is just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s a bad razor</li>
            <li> I did break out but not as bad..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it a lot - it is very nice.</li>
            <li> TWO cartridges will last me (light beard) about at least a year.  Great DEAL!</li>
            <li> This thing just took a slice out of my lip, have not done that for years.  I will stick with  the schick quatro (quatro means four in spanish) that fifth blade is no good.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to leave my long time standard 5 Blade and try other possibly greener pastures, but I am so happy I did.  This razor works fantastic, it took me a shave or two to get accustomed to a new handle, but the shave itself was much nicer.  The gel reservoir made me nervous since I don&#x27;t want a product to leave a film on me that I have to wash off, but it wasn&#x27;t like that at all. It does release a gel, but it&#x27;s nothing noticeable, and ends up leaving your face much softer than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  Part of this could be that the razors aren&#x27;t scratching against your skin because of the skin guards on the blades.  Whatever it is, I like it.</li>
            <li> 40, male, heavy beard.  GREAT razor.  I am 3 weeks on the blade it came with - super close, super comfy.  Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used - AND it doesn&#x27;t need a battery.  Big props to Schick.  I like the flip-down feature that allows me to cut some serious detail on the side burns.  Originally, I thought it felt too bulky, but, after almost a month, I am a believer.  Well done!</li>
            <li> Im 34 so I have shaved daily for a number of years.  I have tried many razors including the Proglide,Sensor, Sensor Excel and Mach 3&#x27;s and these don&#x27;t hold a candle to the close shave I get from my Hydro 5.  The blades last longer, are less expensive and never leave the red rash and cuts that I received from Gilettes products.  I also never have to touch up in the shower which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try, I can almost guarantee you will be impressed.</li>
            <li> I feel the razor should come with at lease 3 extra blades. It comes with no extra blades.</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift, but this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Period. I&#x27;m stick with this for life, never changing.  I get such a close shave with this, for the people that don&#x27;t..you&#x27;re using it wrong.  Don&#x27;t forget that thing flips back to get a even closer shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from cvs with a coupon. I was looking forward to trying it. I&#x27;m a woman and have used the gillette fusion razors and have been happy with them. I used this razor on my legs and it felt amazing. It literally glided over my legs and felt like it wasn&#x27;t a razor at all. I was impressed, however, after getting our of the shower, I started to see a ton of spots where it cut me. Have tried it several times and it still cuts me, although not as severely as the first time, if I use a really thick shaving cream. It does shave pretty close which is nice. I know its not made for women, so I gave it an extra star. I will continue to use gillette with no worry of cutting myself up.</li>
            <li> I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 for the past 6 years, I  got this free today and used it...wow ,,,no bleeding.very smooth shave.I&#x27;M SOLD</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this miracle touched my face, i throw my gellit in the trash there is no comparison, you will feel that you are holding a machine in your hand not a just razor!!&lt;br /&gt;very powerful and no one blood drop came out from my skin 100 over 10 :)</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mach 3, and thought it was a great shave.  I went on a trip, and forgot my razor, and was given a new Hydro 5 at the hotel.  WOW!  What a difference!  The hydro 5 is a much smoother and closer shave.  I also get less irritation with the Hydro 5.  A word of caution: after shaving, you must allow the razor to dry.  I was on another trip, and a put the wet razor in a baggie.  The next day, I discovered that the gel reservoir had \\&quot;melted\\&quot; into uncontrollable \\&quot;alien slime,\\&quot; and I had to discard the cartridge.  One final recommendation: I have very sensitive skin, and most aftershave products do not work well for me.  On a whim, I tried the following product, and have discovered the best aftershave I have ever tried (though it is not actually aftershave).  Give it a try--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!

            <li> For years I have bounced between Gillette and Schick. Through all the releases - 3, 4, and 5 blades. Up until today; I would alternate between the Schick Titanium and my Gillette Fusion Power in my travel bag. No more! I am contemplating buying another Hydro for my travel bag. The shave of the Schick Hydro is that impressive. Incredibly smooth, impressively close and so comfortable. The flip trimmer works well both allowing me to get under my nose and for making sideburns trimming a breeze. Razors are a very personal thing. Everyone will experience something different, and everyone has different expectations. From my experience: On a post shave scale of 1 to 5 - 1 being \\&quot;did I mistake my belt sander for my razor again?\\&quot; 5 being \\&quot;did I really shave?\\&quot; - a 4.5 - I know I shaved I was there but really find it hard to believe. For shaving, ease of use, comfort and closeness; on a scale of 1 to 5 - 5 all around. For &#x27;closeness&#x27; I judge a razor by how rough my face is by running my hand from neck to chin, so against the grain, after a shave - Like I never had hair. Honestly - I can only recall a handful of times I was able to achieve this level of closeness (at the expense of comfort I can assure you) and that was with a straight razor. The tag line says it all - Schick Hydro - a Winner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so mixed on a product. Usually it&#x27;s hit or miss. This one was very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I want to list all the products i&#x27;ve worked with and own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors:&lt;br /&gt;-Parker 60R (DE)&lt;br /&gt;-Parker SR1 (Straight)&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Power&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Proglide power&lt;br /&gt;-Shick Quattro titanium&lt;br /&gt;-Shick Hydro 5 blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;-Derby (Straight)&lt;br /&gt;-Shark (Straight)&lt;br /&gt;-Derby (DE)&lt;br /&gt;-Shark (DE)&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Power&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Proglide power&lt;br /&gt;-Shick Quattro titanium&lt;br /&gt;-Shick Hydro 5 blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gels/Creams/Soaps:&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Hydra Gel (Ultra Sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;-Gillete Fusion Hydra Gel (Moisturizing)&lt;br /&gt;-Edge Energy (Eclipse)&lt;br /&gt;-King of Shaves Alpha Gel (Sensitive Skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Shick Hydro Sensitive Shave Gel&lt;br /&gt;-Vintage Blades Shaving Cream&lt;br /&gt;-Col.

This is just not the razor you want to get caught in your hand on a speedy morning or a rushed time. It&#x27;s alright for a weekend shave or as a travel razor. Not by any means for a daily shaver. The price of the blades is fantastic for a cartridge. Way better than the quattro titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 Stars. It&#x27;s good, for the price. Pick one up and give it a shot on your own.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have switched razors in several years.  The first time I tried something new I went from a two blade Gillette disposable to the three blade Mach 3 Turbo when that came out.  I did not have a positive experience with the Mach 3 Turbo and gave it away after my first use because it irritated my sensitive skin.  Since than I have been using two blade disposable razors for the last 5 or 6 years.  I dont have much facial hair which is a good thing I guess, but I figured since the marketing was so good to try out the Hydro 5 blade.  I was torn between the fushion pro glide and this razor.  What ultimately made me try out the hydro 5 was the price difference and also the difference in the lubricating strip.  The strip on the hydro 5 is actually pretty cool because it puffs up creating a very slick gliding surface.  I did not expect to have a very good shave the first time considering I have sensitive skin and would be jumping from two blades to five.  I was completely wrong.  The shave was the most comfortable I have ever felt.  I&#x27;m sitting here typing this after shaving and it does not feel like I shaved at all.  Usually when I slap on my after shave it burns due to nicks and cuts.  I felt barley any burn after shaving and using after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this razor like many is the size of the head.  It is my first time so I am not used to it yet, but it did an awful job on my mustache area and also close to my mouth.  I went to use the trimmer which flips back and that was a pain in the neck.  The only point of that I can see is to not completely copy the Gillette series razors which Schick has tended to do over the years.  Overall I give the first shave a 4.0, but once I get used to the razor a bit more I&#x27;m sure it will be a 4.5-5.  Comfort wise it is a 4.5.  I did feel slight pulling on some parts of my face.  For the price and the comfort I cant see paying the ridiculous prices for Gillette razors. I can find much more important things to put my money towards.  Go with the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor!ings to put my money towards.  Go with the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor!</li>
            <li> I used to be a Gillette-only guy. But, their constant price increases and insanely expensive refills made me change. Gillette overcharges for mediocrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ignoring Schick - not anymore. The Slim Twin was given to me on a business class flight to Taiwan. Nice - and way better than Good News.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried a disposable Quattro. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got a free Hydro - thanks to the promo site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe I was shaving. Super close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave with Schick - and Kiss My Face or Neutrogena shave lotions.</li>
            <li> STRICTLY ONLINE provides superb customer service.  One of their main guys, Bill, must be the most fair and honest businessmen that I have encountered in my lifetime.  One can not tell the quality a seller provides until a problem arises.  In my case, buying the Schick Hydro 5-Blade, there were TWO such problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my original order for the razor NEVER ARRIVED. Bill sent me a replacement at NO CHARGE, and sent that one via PRIORITY MAIL.  It arrived in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I opened the replacement package, I noticed that it included ONLY ONE BLADE, NOT TWO AS ADVERTISED on Amazon&#x27;s web site.  I sent an email to Bill about this additional problem.  He replied within an hour, and said he would credit my account IN FULL for the purchase price! Wow.  He also said that he has had many such complaints over the past year.  In each case, he has notified AMAZON and they have promised to revise his listing many times, but have never done so--even though they made the original listing error--not strictlyonline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is obvious:  even though neither Bill nor his company were directly responsible for neither of these two episodes, STRICTLY ON LINE kept their promise of excellent customer service, and have earned their high AMAZON rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the Shick Razor itself:  JUST BUY ONE! It is better than FUSION or any other brand/model as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I&#x27;ve written too much already, so I&#x27;ll leave it there.  I don&#x27;t care if you buy it at the grocery store or on-line (see strictlyoneline&#x27;s Amazon web site at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;marketplaceID&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;me&#x3D;A2OTAK1P3FF2EH ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that Bill would appreciate it! {:  Just remember: it DOES NOT come with two blades at ANY website I have viewed, but they ALL say it DOES. The problem is with AMAZON&#x27;S stock listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry Brown</li>
            <li> I tried the Hydro 5 and was disappointed.  I thought the 5-blade would make it a close shave, but this razor just does not work for me.  The hydro-portion, the moisturizing bar, creates too much of a glide, feeling like you aren&#x27;t shaving close at all.  That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it worked well, but it doesn&#x27;t.  No matter how many times I go over parts of my neck, it just will not get a close shave - and some parts simply won&#x27;t shave at all.  Unfortunately, this razor just will not work for me.  If you are wanting this one, try it out first before buying extra blades because you may experience the same as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - the Schick Quattro is my favorite overall razor for shave and value.  I use the Fusion most of the time, it works fine but the blades do get dull quickly which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, but I thought I would give this Schick razor a try after seeing the commercials.  I was highly disappointed with this purchase.  The worst part about this razor is the tendency to leave multiple cuts. I&#x27;ve given it a few weeks and changed the blades multiple times.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion for almost a year now but decided to give this a try because the blade refills are cheaper. It&#x27;s not worth the savings. :/ I used the Hydro 5 today and I had to go over the same spot a few times. Stupid Weak Blades. The Hydro doesn&#x27;t have that one blade in the back that is using for lining up your cut or trimming extra nose hairs. It also feels weak in your hands. It does that the same like strip that tells you when to change the blade. I would avoid this razor.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this razor, and let me tell you it beats the fusion, and pro glide combined. It gives me a extremely smooth shave, and i LOVE the skin guards which create less irritation and pull. I definitely recommend this to all shavers, especially people who have sensitive skin, this is the perfect razor for you. With 5 blades and a trimmer it has got to be one of the best razors ever. The price is extremely low only $5.45 for the razor which comes with an additional 2 replacement razor blades. If you are looking for a low-cost efficient razor, look no further, because the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor is a MUST BUY!!</li>
            <li> I want to like these and switch away from overpriced Gillette, but these simply have to cheap a feel to stick with over the long term. Both the handle and the cartridges themselves are plasticky and lack the satisfying heft, but also the sleekness, of the Fusions. Also the pivoting of the blades feels less smooth and agile. I always have the feeling I am going to miss a spot.</li>
            <li> This razor works pretty well.  Creates less tension then my other razors.  Looks great too.  Blades are the bad thing, they are pretty expensive.  My beard gets pretty thick sometimes, and I still can&#x27;t find something that will shave it off good enough.  But for the price of these, I usually just order one of them.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Schick Quattro and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.  I&#x27;d say it might be on part with the Gillette Mach3, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as good as the Gillette Fusion. The Schick Hydro is a big step up.  It has the comfort and utility of the Fusion (actually I think it might be more comfortable, but it&#x27;s at least as good) and from what I can tell it also lasts longer.  I can usually get a Fusion blade to last out to two weeks because I shave after showering, but at that point the lubrication strip is gone and the blades are pulling more than I&#x27;d like.  The Hydro has been going strong for two weeks now and is still cutting smooth and the lubrication area keeps on working as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the lubrication area pulls back so that you can use the full blade for trimming and getting up under the nose area.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to get that section pulled back, but I find once that is done that using the main blade for those tasks is better than using the little trimming blade on the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a winner for Schick.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive pale skin, that tends to be dry not oily. I have a sharp jawline and pointy adams-apple. I went from a Mac3 to a Quatro to a Fusion to a Fusion Pro Glide Power and now I tried this just for the hell of it. The Quatro and this Hydro5 both suffer from the same problem the razor is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t shave very well if you have more than a 2day growth, and this is coming from a guy who has blonde fine facial hair. So it&#x27;s not a terrible razor but it&#x27;s not a great razor either. I would rather spend the extra money on a Fusion Pro Glide Power than to waste money on a Hydro5 because I have to just go back over my face with my Fusion anyways. Glad I only spent $7 on this thing. It was worth a shot but IMO more blades doesn&#x27;t always mean a better razor. Sturdiness, precision, smoothness; these are the attributes I&#x27;m looking for in a good razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out and see how it compared to the Fusion.  I like the feel and for some reason, the blades seem to last a lot longer than Fusion.  Good, smooth shave.  The problem is that it is a bulky razor with 5 blades and you can&#x27;t get close around the nose / moustache area.  That is the exact reason the Fusion comes with a single blade on the end.  That is a must have and something Schick missed out on.  Because of, I&#x27;ll not be buying anymore Hydro&#x27;s . . .</li>
            <li> This is a better 5 blade razor than the Gillette Fusion, it does not leave your skin as irritated as the Fusion razor, gives a smoother shave and the blades last a lot longer and are not as expensive.  The blades do not pull your facial hair because of the lip above the edge and the moistureizing stirp actually does what the commercial describes as it does glide effortlessly when the strip touches the water.  The head is also very flexible and countours to the shape of your face.  I have been using it with the old fashion shave soap and the results have been excellent.  An excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> (3.5 stars) I have been a lifelong Gillette user who occasionally tries Shick products hoping for something cool. Unfortunately, I never end up loving the Shick razors nearly as much as Gillette&#x27;s. The story is the same for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I tested the razor out while shaving my head. There were some spots that the razor would not get the hair all the way off. I had to finish the job with my Fusion for a truly smooth head. This was ridiculous and unacceptable. The Hydro took a lot longer too because I had to go over the same spot numerous times to get the job done whereas the Fusion would have gotten the job done with way less strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I figured this razor was not perfect for shaving heads so I moved on to my face. Same story. It just was not as good and effective as the Fusion because I had to use more strokes to get a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t all bad. I loved how well it hydrated my skin. It actually felt like I was smothering lotion on my head and face while shaving and it felt great. They got that part down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I couldn&#x27;t possibly recommend this razor when I know how incredible the Fusion is. If price is an issue, these are indeed cheaper. They are very good to be a runner-up blade but far from being as amazing as the Fusion. Fortunately I purchased this during a rebate promotion to get it free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently a Schick Quattro user and thought I&#x27;d give this \\&quot;next best thing\\&quot; a try. The specs and concepts explained on Schick&#x27;s website looked interesting, and the current rebate deal made it worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, a nice smooth shave. The new hydro strip does make for a smoother feel than the strip on the Quattro razors. However, I have two problems with the new design. First, is five blades really necessary? Sure, it probably makes things smoother, but it mades the head larger and made shaving above my lip very difficult -- too many blades for a small area. The second thing is that the shaving head is more flush with the handle that the Quattro, which for me made for a slightly awkward angle when holding the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m handing this one off to my wife as I think the larger head and blade position will be better suited for her legs than my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using whatever I can find that is cheapest for the past ten or fifteen years.  Usually that means a Target brand two blade disposable that comes in a pack of ten for about two bucks.  Shaving&#x27;s been a bit painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try something different.  I was going to buy a Merkur DE with Derby blades, because over the long run they are relatively inexpensive and I would not be tied into a specific brand.  However, while shopping at a local drug store, I ran across the Hydro and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read everyone&#x27;s comments and complaints.  I have a heavy beard.  In the military, I was ordered to shave twice a day, once in the morning and once in the late afternoon.  I did not find the Hydro to clog easily, even with 2 days beard, but there was some resistance.  Also, I tend to rinse between each stroke anyway, because of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is a bit large, but I did not have any problem shaving around my beard.  I also was able to engage the lubricating strip easily in order to shave in tight spots.  When you flip it up, it stays up until you flip it down.  It was not difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was close.  I also used Gillette shaving gel when I was shaving.  I enjoyed using the Hydro 5 more than the disposable.  I probably will pay more money for the Shick in order to get a closer and more comfortable shave.  However, in general, the price for razors is ridiculous and unjustified - but because two companies have a lock on the market, there aren&#x27;t really many alternatives.</li>
            <li> Love this razor!  Very underrated in my opinion.  There are more options than Gillette out there.  Give this one a try!  I did about 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.  In fact, I prefer this to Gillette, cost difference aside.</li>
            <li> When developing a new product, sooner or later you have to shoot the design engineers and go into production.  Schick should have done this much sooner with the Hydro5 - it is the most over-engineered manual razor I have ever encountered and more of a nuisance than convenience in actual use.  The five blades make it awkward to use at best and having to flip the top down to get underneath my nose is a pain.  The moisturizer/lubricant is excessive and makes my face feel like a squadron of slugs slimed their way across it.  I find that to actually use it I have to flip the top open and leave it that way, otherwise the blades just slip over the slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I work at it, I can get almost as good a shave from the Hydro5 as I can from the two-blade Gillette CustomPlus Pivot.  But I do have to work at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More blades and lubricant do not necessarily make for a better shave.  In this case, they make for a mediocre shave at best.</li>
            <li> Like many, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for quite awhile, however, while in Vegas I checked into a high end spa, and when ready for cleaning up I asked if they had complimentary razors. hey did, and I was handed a Hydro 5. It&#x27;s about as good a shave as I&#x27;ve ever had, and what&#x27;s better, the blade lasted quite a long while once I got home. After I threw the blade away I went back to my old brand, but wasn&#x27;t the same. The aloe solution gives a very comfortable feel on every pass. I&#x27;m definitely now sticking with the Hydro.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Schick Hydro 5 was through a free sample. Thank God, because once I tried it, I found that it provided a much smoother shave and was easier to maneuver than other &#x27;female&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but much cheaper, higher quality, and takes up less space (both the razor body and the blade cartridge) compared to majority of &#x27;female&#x27; razors. I have been using these bad boys since. I have not considered other &#x27;male&#x27; razors because I&#x27;m content with this one but maybe another day.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving since I was 15.  Out of all the razors I&#x27;ve used, this one is by far the best.  NO razor burn on my neckline area even when I shave up and against the grain.  It also shaves exceptionally well with one pass.  Schick has made a great product that works.  TIP: run it under hot water for about 15-30 seconds makes the shave even more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Proglide line has been my sole razor for about the last 5 years, but the price for the cartridges is ridiculous, nevertheless the refills do last about 3 months each. Looking for a lower-cost alternative, I selected the Hydro 5. My experience has caused me to revert to the Proglide. I have a chubby face, sensitive skin and facial hair that is quick to grow (I have to shave daily), but not coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the problem with the Hydro 5: compared to the Proglide, the blades on the Hydro are slightly further apart and the lubricating strip is slightly higher than the Proglide, so what ends up happening is that I have to put additional pressure on the blades, and they are further apart, which ends up causing razor burn and knicks, especially under my nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shick was good about refunding my money and they are sending me a kit to return the supplies to them for analysis, but I have no reason to believe this is a defective product, since I tried three different cartridges that performed the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your face is of a different makeup, you may have a more positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Proglide is the \\&quot;gold standard\\&quot;, but I wish the oost didn&#x27;t seem like it was made of solid gold!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Took it back after a week.  It shaved well when the slime bar was pushed back, exposing all five blades, but too much bother and too much slime.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST REVIEW: May upgrade after another use or two, but not much good going on with this razor for me.  Bought it yesterday at Costco and just used it today for the first time.  The slime attachment is just a mess, I had goop dripping down my cheek from the first tentative swipe.  After a few confirming passes that had the blades coasting over the mess, I rinsed off and started over.  Still sliming and the slime attachment seemed to keep the blades away from the whiskers they are intended to cut off.  I rinsed off again and pushed the slime bar back out of the way and continued shaving with just the blades.  That wasn&#x27;t too bad. I liked the 5 blade feel versus the 3 blade razor I currently use, and the quality of the shave was acceptable as well.  It just seems that the slime bar is a waste and it also keeps the plane of the blade edges away from the face.  At the moment I think I wasted my money.  I&#x27;ll try it again for a few shaves and see if it gets better.  Will also update this review afterward.</li>
            <li> not only does it not seem to be competing to the older Gillette I used to use, but it scratches my skin with its corners. Not cool, I&#x27;d deffinately look for a differend kind ext time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette guy for years and figured Fusion was as good as it was gonna get. The downside, obviously, has been the cost of replacement blades and of course that&#x27;s how they get you. But $13+ for four replacement blades that don&#x27;t really last very long? Ouch..... So today I was in Target to pick up said replacement blades when I saw the Schick Hydro 5. I have to admit I&#x27;ve NEVER been a Schick fan at all. I don&#x27;t know what the difference in blades is (aside from number of blades) but shaving with a Schick always felt like trying to shave with a rusty butter knife. The Schick Quatro is a good example. I tried the Quatro in an effort to save money but knew after one shave it wasn&#x27;t going to work out. The Hydro, however, is FAR superior to the Quatro and easily as good as the Gillette Fusion. Initially I thought the Hydro blade casing might be a little too bulky but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case. It&#x27;s a good looking razor, it works really well and best of all the replacement blades are $3 cheaper than Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I have a medium type of facial hair growth, I need to shave every day but if I use a razor with too many blades it causes more harm than good so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  I&#x27;ve been through a Mach 3, Fusion, Schick Quattro and now the Hydro.  First off I feel the Hydro is too light so you need more than necessary pressure to your face and even then I did not a receive and consistent shave.  I could see the lines where the hydro strip was going through the shaving cream and thought it was interfering with my shave more than anything.  On 5 bladed razors the blades seem to get clogged to quickly probably due to the lack of space between each blade but I like the trim feature yet I would rather have the blade that gets under your nose but they&#x27;ve taken that away.  Overall the hydro function was nice when it actually shaved my face but ultimately I had to go back to my Quattro after the first shave (had to re-shave) and I gave my Wife this which she says works great on her legs.  The Quattro is a 4 bladed razor with the one blade for your nose and I find the abnormal weight of it makes a huge difference.  I apply little pressure because of it and the 4 blades shave more hair with less irritation than a 3 blade but don&#x27;t clog like a 5 blade which can cause irritation from constant stopping and uneven shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Sensor Excels (2 blades) for something like 20 years now and decided to finally update my shaving routine to the more modern 5 blades. I picked up this Schick Hydro after seeing a TV commercial. I thought for $8, I&#x27;d give it a spin, and I thought 5 blades should do a much better job than 2, right? The commercial promised me a close shave with \\&quot;less\\&quot; irritation. I&#x27;ve been using the Hydro 5 for a week now and so far the shave is as close as my 2 blade, if only slightly better. The same irritation is there, however, in the same spots. Perhaps that&#x27;s my shaving cream? The thing that bothers me the most about this razor is shaving the area directly under my nose. My Sensor performs perfectly in this area, but this 5 blade is more bulky and harder to reach under the nose. In fact, I had to bust out my Sensor just to finish the job. Also, I don&#x27;t like the way the head tilts, but perhaps because I&#x27;m used to the fixed head of the Sensor. All in all, the Hydro 5 gave me a nice shave, except for under the nose, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me switch. I&#x27;m keeping my Sensor while I experiment with other razors.</li>
            <li> Having tried multiple razors that have been on the market, the hydro is by far the best shave I have experienced. I will be buying the proglide soon to compare it against the hydro, but as of right now the hydro is the best shave I have ever had. Combine it w/ Proraso shave cream / soap  and you will have the closest shave out you can get........</li>
            <li> Razor performs well and gives me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal thickness facial hair, but it grows fast and I need to shave at least every other day.  Here is what I have found to be the best part of this razor so far... I have noticed these blades seem to last longer (like twice as long).  Perhaps it is because there a five blades and the dull slower or something.  With past razors (Fusion and even the Quattro) I was getting 3 or 4 shaves and they would get dull.  I an getting 8-9 shave out of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice not having to buy new blades at the previous rate.</li>
            <li> Due to bad razor burn I had to switch to a DE Safety blade. They were good,much better than your normal razor cartridges.My dad was down for the holidays and happen to leave these.I was out of my straight blades so I gave it a shot. WOW just wow. The best shave of my life. Absolutely no razor burn, this thing contores to the shape of your face. I will never go back to another razor in my life. You get a closer shave than a  DE straight razor too! I&#x27;m so happy to have found this as I have to shave everyday for work!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Gillette Fusion, the hydro shaves alot smoother, with just hot water. However, the \\&quot;flip back top\\&quot; does not hold up to the percision trimmer on the back of the fusion as it is a bit hard to reach under the nose. Also, aesthetically, the fusion looks way better, and it comes with a better stand that actually stands up. Yet, if one was to look for performence and economy (hydro 5 blades are cheaper i think) then go with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______&lt;br /&gt;Update: The hydrating resoviour ran out really quick, but it is still a smooth shave, would i buy it again? hmmm, sure, its a real money saver over time, depends on if you are willing to shell out the money for a new edition of \\&quot;Pro glide\\&quot; which is really, over hyped, but it does look nice.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to save some money as Gillette blades are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion was that this would be ideal if you have a sensitive skin but does not offer a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Machs offers the best shave but are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am switching back to Gillette&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This razor hacks through my thicket of a beard with greater ease than any other razor I have used. At the same time, its five blades make it ungainly to maneuver. Recommended for broad strokes, but not for detail work. I have personally returned to a razor with fewer blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and the refill blades on sale.  Silly me.  I have been using a Mach 3 ever since going up from the Sensor XL many years ago.  Now here is why I cannot use this blade:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head every other day and trim around my beard every day.  I cannot use an electric razor since they really don&#x27;t seem to work with my facial hair.  And electric razors just cannot shave a head properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a close shave.  The plastic guard gets in the way of a close shave.  This becomes very obvious when shaving the back of my head.  The wide blades, made wider with that funky plastic border, really make it difficult in getting the curve at the back of the skull.  I had some major nicks and bleeding incidents from these blades.  Never really had that issue with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when shaving around my beard.  The wider plastic border makes it tough to accurately line up the blades so that I don&#x27;t trim too much.  So I often find that I have to go over the same spot 4 or 5 times, each time inching closer to my beard so as to avoid a very funny looking shaved place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one benefit is that it has that nice hydro gel feature.  But since I use an amazing shave &#x27;gel&#x27; [[ASIN:B001QVG90C King of Shaves AlphaGel Shave Gel Sensitive - 5 oz.]], I don&#x27;t really need that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the extra blades to my partner, and even she couldn&#x27;t really use it properly on her legs.  She went back to the men&#x27;s Schick Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 System]].  Like on Family Guy, more blades doesn&#x27;t really mean better shave!  So in summation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Large plastic guard/border gets in the way of shaving curved areas ***</li>
            <li> I have used various Schick shavers for the last thirty years and have had no reason to complain.  However, I recently purchased the Hydro 5 shaver thinking it had five razor heads in the package.  Through the packaging it is obvious one razor head is attached to the razor.  However, it \\&quot;appears\\&quot; as though the included cartridge holds four additional heads...only one which is visible through the packaging.  Upon opening, I realized there was only a single spare head with three empty slots which would make a total of five.  Unlike the old adage, \\&quot;fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me\\&quot;  I will not be made a fool and intend to spend my money with a different company.  The Hydro 5 gives a great shave but I have no patients for deceitful marketing.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth shave after only one swipe.  It is very smooth and does not nick or pull at the skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first mens razor I tried after going through nearly ever razor developed for women to realize that obviously they were all made by men who want women to suffer through razor burn and having to shave every single day :). With this razor it takes half the time to get rid of coarse under arm or bikini line hair and keeps it gone for longer. The head flexes back nicely to move with curves and it gives a real close shave when you flick back the top. I&#x27;ve tried using on my legs with so-so results. The parts that did get shaved were nice and smooth but some how I seemed to miss areas (or the razor just didnt get them all) either way, this razor is meant for smaller areas and smaller strokes. I did try with the hyrdro shave gel (which I also tried with the schick quattro) and I wasnt impressed. Seemed to work as well as walmart brand for 99cents. I prefer baby oil and then plain old shaving cream (gel never impressed me, just alot of irritating fragrance and a waste if it falls off your skin onto the floor). I knocked off a star because while they state that the moisturizing strip will last longer than other brands, I found that if it wasnt gone after one shave I could only get about another half of a shave out of it. Also while the design of the case is convenient to keep the refills together with the razor, if you keep your razor in the shower like me, the moisturizing strip in the refills will melt and leave you with a gooey mess. I experimented with two other brands and left one of each in the shower for all 4 family members showers and neither had the same result as these. Not a huge problem I guess, but when your forgetful like me it can be an incovenience to find a gooey razor in the morning.</li>
            <li> I shave daily for my job. Most days I use a Braun electric, but I also use a blade to shave my head. I saw this new razor and cream in a Wallyworld store and figured it was worth trying. Who isn&#x27;t fed up with the unjustifiably outrageous Fusion cartridge prices? I have tried Schick before, but was always put off by their safety wires that were intended prevent nicks and cuts.  Who doesn&#x27;t remember their advertising campaign that involved a guy driving an off-road vehicle with a safety cage.  All I could think was great for off-road vehicles, bad for close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have digressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved several times with the new Schick and am still on the original blade.  That is a testament to the new blade.  The Fusion blades don&#x27;t last long for me at all. Paired with the new Hydro cream, I am using less cream, generating less irritation, and am using less blades all with the same results I would get from the other guy.  Given the price of replacement cartridges and the longevity of the blades, I can see myself saving a lot of money and enjoying my shaving experience much more with the new Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out.  what do you have to lose?  If you like it you have a cheaper alternative.  If you don&#x27;t, you can still use the expensive Fusion you already own.</li>
            <li> As a reference, I have fairly heavy growth and shave daily(twice if I am going out in the evening)After the great commercials, I decided to set my fusion down and give this a try.  I shave immediately after a shower to help soften things up but this razor was not up to the task.  I couldn&#x27;t complete one stroke before it clogged and pulled whiskers.  Also very difficult to shave under the nose with such a huge lubrication area.  Needless to say it went into the round file after the new blade on the second try and I will continue to use the fusion.  This razor may be good if you have thin facial hair but I would guess the fusion is still better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette guy for years, but with the me being a starving student, i chose to turn to a cheaper alternative with the same features as its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;So I went into Target today to find replacement blades for my Gillette fusion, but I was lured in by Schick&#x27;s value; about $11 for a pack of 6 compared to $16 for 4 blades of Gillette.  Schick&#x27;s Hydro is similar to Gillettes Pro Glide with its 5 blades and pivoting head, but cheaper.  I decided to try it out.  I got home and immediatly dumped my Gillette Mach 3 and Fusion in the trash; opened up the Schick and tried it out.  I could right away tell the harsher shave.  During the second pass I cut myself!  With my old Gillette razors, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any razor cuts, but i&#x27;m a little more cautious using Schick. My Mach 3 with only 3 blades cuts just as close with a more comfortable feel!  After shaving, I went digging in my trash to grab my tried and true Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good deal... try to find yourself a MACH 3!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a free add-on when I purchased some Edge shave gel. Thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My current razor is a Gillette Sensor Excel, so comparisons are to that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shick handle is well constructed, hefty and feels &amp;#34;substantial.&amp;#34; I liked the feel quite a bit. The handle surface is non-slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade itself is about 2x larger than that of the Senor with 4 blades very close to one another. The head pivots so that as you shave the blades stay in contact with the skin. The larger head took a few minutes to adjust to, particularly under the nose, around the mouth area, and over the Adam&#x27;s apple. I use shaving strokes that make several passes in different directions across and up and down my face to try to get a close shave. I used the razor for one week using the blade that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were disappointing. No closer than I get with my Sensor, a 25-year-old technology. I have no idea about how long the cartridge will last, but with my Sensor I change its blade about every 30 days. (A friend of mine changes his every 4 days! You mileage may vary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum I see no compelling reason to give up what I am using. Shaving preference are very individual, however, and you may find that you love the Shick which should allow you to save a little money over Gillette and other makes.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for at least 6 months and have to say the results are horrible.  I have no idea where these 5 star reviews are coming from but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone getting a decent shave from this razor.  The hair on my face is not bear like at all, I have very minimal hair for a man.  I use this razor in the shower with the Hydro 5 gel and I am always going back over my face/neck twice because the razor just misses hair.  I would have to assume this has to do with the angle of the razor and also the cartridge that you can flip up on the top.  Even after flipping the cartridge out of the way you do not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is the BEST i&#x27;ve ever come across. It GLIDES on your skin, no hair pulling or tugging ever! Also i love the gel lubricant. It really makes your skin soft. I don&#x27;t use the trimmer on the back but all in all this razor is gold.</li>
            <li> If the blades get even a small amount of hair in them, they don&#x27;t shave anything. Rinsing it like a normal razor doesn&#x27;t even help. The hair just stays where it is. You have to either dig it out with your fingers or throw it away. Worthless.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Power for the past year or so.  I bought the razor at COSTCO and I continued to spend $42 for 16 refill blades every other month or so. Although the shave was average, I was disappointed in the life of each blade.  I have a very heavy beard and I was lucky to get a maximum of 4 shaves out of each blade.  After 3 or 4 shaves, the lubricating strip would disintegrate therefore leaving the blade useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was visiting my son and happened to complain to him about the cost of blades. He asked me to try this new razor he has been using, the Schick Hydro 5.  Well, I picked up the razor and I have been using the razor for the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, THANK YOU SCHICK!!! This is a wonderful product and I can actually say I look forward to shaving with this razor. Today was my 7th shave with the same blade and I am amazed that this shave is as close as the first! Absolutely amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lubricating reservoir on this razor (instead of lubricating strip which dissolves) continually dispenses a gel with each stroke which causes the razor to glide effortlessly.  It is very comfortable to hold and the great thing about this razor is that you can click back the lubricating reservoir away from the blades in order to trim a moustache or sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a fantastic shaving experience with long lasting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER, EVER go back to Gillette!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but Gillette products for years and someone sent me this with a purchase as a free gift. I went on vacation and thought I didn&#x27;t want to take my good fusion blade so I took the free gift.First shave with the Hydro 5 and I&#x27;m now a Schick user!! Closer shave,longer lasting blades....hey what more can you ask for?!?!?</li>
            <li> The blades are spaced a little farther apart on this razor than others so it doesn&#x27;t really clog. A simple run under the faucet and it&#x27;s clear. Anytime time I&#x27;ve used a Gillette or other razor with multiple blades they would clog to the point where I would have to blow the clog out or pick at it with an old toothbrush. The only solution until the Hydro 5 was taking short strokes and rinsing very often which is somewhat annoying now that I can practically shave my entire face with 2 or 3 day stubble and only rinse a couple times as opposed to rinsing after every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin combined with a medium/heavy beard growth and have always had problems with irritation. The Hydro 5 has proven to be much more skin friendly and the blades seem to stay sharper longer than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve used in the past. I don&#x27;t know if they used better materials or sharpening methods or magic....but I&#x27;ve managed to stretch one blade shaving every other day with shaving cream for 4 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it is difficult to get right up to my nose because of the large shaving head. I keep a bag of cheap single blade disposables for that task alone. The single trimmer blade found on Gillettes is a nice feature but much rougher than a disposable single so I don&#x27;t mind this inconvenience because this razor is that much better than the vibrator razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your hairy like an animal this blade is the king at removing body hair for summertime.</li>
            <li> I have used the Mach 3 and Fusion razors. I like most readers did not do well with the quattro version of schick. I switched to the Hydra to try it out and have not looked back. At first it was hard to tell if there was a major upgrade. The Schick is not as close but close enough of a shave that it doesn&#x27;t take a layer of skin off and removes enough to get you through the day. I dry my razor off after each shave and store it upside down so water doesn&#x27;t run down and touch the blade part causing it to degrade faster. I have been getting 4 weeks and more per blade doing this vs the Gillette razors. The comfort is still there. I am going strong on 2 months now on one blade so far. And no I do not miss the awesome marketing of vibration shaving cannot tell a difference without it. The 5th blade of the fusion isn&#x27;t better than the hydra&#x27;s flip of the gel strip feature, they seem to be about equal in that regard to feature and function. The big difference I can tell is that with the switch I can now afford to eat more than just ramen noodles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now take in mind the bump gaurds they have on the blades keep it from being super close (close enough) but again I have not cut myself at all with these blades. If you try though you can cut your self just as with any razor. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to be more realistic in how much they want to spend shaving. I switched to an electric to see if they have gotten better. They have but always missed a couple of hairs(that I had to come back and get with my razor defeating the purpose) and it takes twice as long to shave in the morning vs with a razor. If you have only shaved your whole life with an electric not a big deal and a nice upgrade, but to try and go from razor to electric is painful. It doesn&#x27;t sound like 5 minutes vs 2 is a lot, but it was for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started first shaving with a norelco electric, moved to a mach 3 and used that for 7 years, tried the quattro and threw it out with my cats litter waste, moved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3 (went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra. If the price jumps for no reason then I will aswell. A lot of companies can&#x27;t figure out that part of the popularity of their product is the pricing aswell as the design.oved to the fusion and did not like it any better than the mach 3 (went back to the mach 3) and have now settled very happily with the hydra. If the price jumps for no reason then I will aswell. A lot of companies can&#x27;t figure out that part of the popularity of their product is the pricing aswell as the design.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a 5 blade razor. I was still using a 3 blade Mach 3. So, I decided to buy a Gillette Proglide Power razor. It was nice. But considering the cost of the cartridge refills, not that much nicer than my old Mach 3. Then a friend of mine raved about the Schick Hydro 5. Blades are considerably cheaper was one bonus, but the real bonus is the shave itself. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 years and always bought Gillette, but I&#x27;ve now been converted. Schick has a real winner here, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades themselves or the super slick gel that slowly oozes out of the holes in the top of the cartridge, but I just got the most comfortable shave of my life with this thing. I purposely let my beard grow for 3 days, just to give it a little workout and boy did it perform. Not only was there no razor drag, it was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I usually have to spend a lot of time trying to get problem areas like around the jaw line clean, but not with this razor. And going against the grain on the neck area produced absolutely no razor burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has the multimillion dollar ad campaign, but Schick has the better product. I hate the Schick ads on TV for this razor, but don&#x27;t let that stop you. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you should get them if you hate hair. especially on your face. or stomach. or nipples. or anywhere you hate hair. these are long last lasting, close shaving, and kick the crap out of gillettes&#x27; blades. Gillette sucks compared to these.these are better. buy these.</li>
            <li> How many blades will they add before the razor wars are over? This Hydro is so wide that it&#x27;s like shaving with a finger-skateboard. It doesn&#x27;t really get a closer shave than the Schick Quatro, and it doesn&#x27;t have the back-blade that was handy for edging my sideburns and beard. I don&#x27;t know what the hell the gel bumper thing is supposed to do, but it&#x27;s stupid. The only positive thing I can say about this razor is that it stays sharp enough to shave my face even after shaving my private regions. Besides that, this thing is too wide and does not contour to my face at all. I guess a lot of people like this razor, but I want my back blade back, and I don&#x27;t need these bumper things that make this so wide. Boo!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the seller and the product! It arrived in a timely manor and in a well packaged box, as always with Amazon. As for the razor review, it&#x27;s the best razor I have ever used. It was sold out everywhere (stores that is) and I was only able to find it online. I was so excited to use it and I am still excited when I use it. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had such a well working razor, and I usually hate shaving. I will definitely continue to use this razor from now on. By the way I am a female using this razor, as I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s for females or males, but I&#x27;m a convert for sure!</li>
            <li> I have used this razor and its refills for 4 months. Clearly everyone is different, but way too many nicks for me. No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now this is my first try at a 5 blade razor. Schick is certainly less expensive, and it might well be the 5 blades rather than the brand causing my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As an old school aside, do any of us really need 5 blades to shave?!? Will this edge expansion multidecade marketing binge eventually lead to razors the size of John Henry&#x27;s hammer???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, manufacturing nowadays is frequently of much more uneven quality than years gone by; and 5 blades seems to me to mainly just raise the chances that one of the blades is slightly defective.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not saying this is a really bad razor, it is just not the one for me. Moving On.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Schick razor instead of the Gillette Fusion because of the good reviews.  Unfortunately, it did not provide a close shave for me and missed several spots.  I tried it for a month and then switched back to Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> great brand of razors, my bear is a hard one and no other brand of razors compares with this, incluiding electric razor, in my case nothing works as good and as long lasting. Amazing product, it last so many shaves uses.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor at store with a coupon I had and I feel as though I would have gotten a better shave with a piece of looseleaf paper....ended up throwing away</li>
            <li> This morning I did a shaving comparison between the Schick Hydro 5 and the Gillette Proglide [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]] (manual razors). First off I shaved with my Feather razor with a Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Double Edge Blades (green package). I love the construction of the Feather razor; but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close and as comfortably as the Proglide of the Hydro 5. So, after shaving with the double-edge razor, I rinsed, relathered, and had at it with the Hydro 5; I did feel a bit of pulling, even on the remaining stubble. It cleaned only some stubble left by the double edge shave. But, I still felt a lot of stubble, the shave was not skin close. Then I rinsed, relathered and had at it with the Proglide. The Gillette cleaned everything to the skin with exceptional comfort. I had to try the Schick after reading these reviews, but for me, and shaving is a matter of personal preference, I know. But with sensitive skin and a tough beard, for me the Gillette Proglide out-shaved the Hydro 5. For the record, I use a badger brush, mug with Williams shave soap, and a preshave cream. I only wish the expensive Feather razor worked as well as the Proglide--so it goes. I&#x27;m submitting this as one guy&#x27;s experience and opinion--perhaps it will help.</li>
            <li> So I bought a package of shaving creme from Sam&#x27;s Club the other day with this razor included, which is why I tried it. I started shaving my legs with it for the first time and the song \\&quot;I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight\\&quot; by Cutting Crew started playing out of nowhere! I took the razor off my legs and the song, along with the amazing way the razor felt against my leg, was gone! So I started shaving again and realized it was the razor making the music!&lt;br /&gt;In all serious though this razor feels amazing against your skin I could barely feel it at all. When I was shaving my legs I accidentally shaved over the sensitive area above your acheillies tendon and it didn&#x27;t even cut me. I was so impressed that I immediately hopped on Amazon and wrote this review about it.</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market, or so says my husband. I have bought many others and he has chosen this to be his final choice.</li>
            <li> I really dont like this razor.. The problem I have with it is that it goops up your face with so much gell that it constantly clogs the blade needing cleaning after each pass of the blade.  And the goop is really disgusting.. Its a slime with alot of surface tension such that its not uncommon to have strings of it running from one side of your face to the other.  The size of the blade also doesnt allow for much precision, such as the area right under the nose, or other detailed spots.  But for me, the single worst aspect of this product was the amount of slimy goop that prevents a close shave, thereby, like some posters commented, requiring multiple passes, each time cleaning out the blade.. Pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Close Comfortable Razor With a Brilliant Design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way better than the Fusion has a much smoother shave and is able to cut through a 10 day beard without any snags(grew it for testing). The razors are quite a few dollars cheaper then the Fusion so it beats it hands down on price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict was this razor rocks and gillette products (even their original product) are over priced and over rated. That&#x27;s what I get I guess for shelling out money to a company that spends everything on marketing rather than product all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap in any way (unlike the m5 i tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip top system for cutting under nose and sideburns is hands down no question way better than the Gillette fusion I had. This way you have all 5 blades shaving without the top getting in the way, an absolutely brilliant idea on their behalf and in my opinion a testament to the talent behind shick5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never feel burned or chaffed or sensitive after shaving and I never feel any snags or hang ups no matter how many days it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing the ad about this schick hydro and decided to try it myself. I used to think, along with expensive price, came a great product. I regretted to doubt this concept even for a second. I was so excited to try this product since the website also promised to give you a mail in rebate up to 10.99$ for you to try this product for free and some of the reviews in youtube also said that this product is better than gillette fusion products. I bought it and tried it. It hurts like hell and cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using gillette fusion power all my life (even before the power glide came out) and I had been happy with fusion. I used shaving cream and sometimes it still did a minor cut there and there, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I used schick hydro and it hurt so much. It&#x27;s a minor cut everywhere! I am not happy at all with this product. Fortunately I can get my money back with the rebate, if not, I would be so pissed right now. I would go back to my gillette fusion and would try power glide later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but Gillette razors my entire shaving life (30 years). I recently upgraded from the Mach 3 to the Fusion Proglide, and no question the Fusion Proglide gave a smoother more comfortabl shave than the Mach 3. But I soon discovered that the Fusion blades wear out quickly (about 7-14 days max) and are expensive so the cost of blades really adds up compared to the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the Schick Hydro 5 with 2 blades on sale for $7.95 while grocery shopping and purchased them on an impulse. I did a head to head comparison against the Fusion Proglide(shaving one half of my face with the Fusion and the other half with the Hydro 5) over several days and would rate their shave about equal. (If I was to be super picky and critical and had to choose a winner, I actually thought the Hydro 5 gave a slightly smoother closer shave than the Fusion Proglide.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What wasn&#x27;t close though was how much longer the Hydro 5 blades last than the Fusion blades. I grow a thick beard and could feel the Fusion blades getting dull after about 7 shaves. After 14 shaves the Fusion is unusable. The Hydro 5 blade lasts at least three or four times as long as the Fusion. My Hydro 5 blades lasts about a month of daily shaving. And the Hydro 5 blades just feel more substantial against the skin than the thin Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least the Hydro 5 replacement blades are much less expensive than the Fusion replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Gillette could have engineered a Fusion blade that lasts much longer and is less expensive, but they didn&#x27;t because they decided to be greedy and make blades that need replacement often. Judging by the number of longtime Gillette users defecting to the Schick Hydro 5, I&#x27;d say that plan has deservedly backfired on them.</li>
            <li> Good purchase, nice razor. Would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the flip bracket to do detail shaving. It is a neat concept, but not very efficient.</li>
            <li> When I first picked up the Schick Hydro 5 I thought it was a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introductory price made it a better deal than my usual Schick Quattro disposable, so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro 5 is amazing. It&#x27;s almost unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best description I can come up with is \\&quot;beard eraser.\\&quot; One pass along the beard grain, one pass against the beard grain and the stubble is erased...Nothing left but smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning time savings is a plus. With the Quattro I would spend 3-4 minutes shaving, feeling for residual stubble, and shaving again to get those missed spots. With the Hydro 5, I&#x27;ve learned not to even bother checking after two passes...Baby smooth shave in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shave my head, and the Hydro 5 works much better than the Quattro on my dome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 is much more forgiving of the phrenological topology of my scalp than the Quattro, and is able to clear those \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; in 2-3 passes instead of 4-5 with the Quattro...The latter giving me razor burn, cuts and scabs in the more difficult places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 also has the advantage of being much easier to clean and clear of beard/hair than the Quattro. The Quattro would regularly get clogged so bad I would be forced to use a toothbrush to gently remove the logjam. Not so with the Hydro 5...Holding it up to the shower head is enough to clear it out quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, as another reviewer has mentioned, the Hydro 5 cartridges curiously last 2x-4x longer than the Quattro. Even when Schick discontinues that Hydro 5 \\&quot;introductory price,\\&quot; it may still be a more economical choice than the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only functional disadvantage of the Schick Hydro 5 is that it has a pretty broad cartridge head, so there&#x27;s a little bit of an learning/experience curve to deal with so you don&#x27;t accidentally shave too deeply into your established beard/mustache/sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The Hydro 5 is now my razor of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Schick: Please keep the introductory prices for the Hydro 5 indefinitely and just dump the sucky Quattro product line entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Please stop the \\&quot;Blade Wars.\\&quot; The Hydro 5 is chunky enough.introductory prices for the Hydro 5 indefinitely and just dump the sucky Quattro product line entirely.    PS.

            <li> looks pretty good to me! Price was right so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. 5 blades sounds like this schick will do its job, but I will update once I figure how many sharp months the blades will last before having to switch them out.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Schick Quattro but my wife had a coupon and brought this one home instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the razor to be extremely comfortable. However, the head is too large and I found I needed to do more work with it to get a shave as good as the Quattro. The extra blade and lubricating strip make this shaver much too large to get a close shave under my nose. It also seems that I have to press harder to get a close shave, as compared to my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the Quattro.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Fusion user for years and have always thought it was the best shaver on the market.  I just hated having to buy the refills so often and at such a high cost.  I decided to try out the Schick Hydro 5 for a month to see how it compares.  The good news is I find the shave about the same as the Fusion, the bad news is the head design on the Schick is a littler &#x27;taller&#x27; so it&#x27;s a little harder to get between your nose and upper lip. However the head design on the Schick &#x27;floats&#x27; a little more to track the contours on your face better.  The grip to me is about the same although maybe a tad bit heavier.  Overall, I can live with the larger head design in order for me to save a ton of money on the refills.  I have a medium to course beard so I go through a refill every 2 weeks, 1 week is preferable but who can afford that.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday. I have done this for MANY years. If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving. Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade,  Mach 3 , Proglide and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors. I have also used Braun, Norelco and Panasonic electrics. I usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....no real reason other than I like variety, and during the summer I water my yard so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the bathroom :-). I have also used shaving powder, cream, gel and oil. Bottom line, for a blade shave the Schick Hydro 5 is the best shave I ever had. Close, and SMOOOOTH!. Not a single tug or pull. It&#x27;s like the Hydro5 erases your beard as it glides across your face and scalp. And finally, a moisturizer delivery system that works exceptionally well.The blades also seem to last longer than any Gillette blade I have ever used.  I used the Hydro5 for 5 weeks straight, and it is the best blade shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great razor - I didn&#x27;t realize how good this is until a few weeks passed and it was just as comfortable of a shave as the first day.  Holds up well and the flip top to reveal the trim feature is very handy.  Been over 2 months and the same blades are still working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Let me cut to the chase - I shave my balls every other day with the Schick Hydro without any kind of lubricant and its painless every time. The Gillette Fusion (it&#x27;s the vibrating kind) can&#x27;t even shave my face (which is arguably less sensitive of an area) without inflicting cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I just use the Fusion for that back blade that does the \\&quot;fine tuning\\&quot; on my beard and such.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving a long time, so over the years I have tried most blades from the cheapie plastic disposables to the high-end razors like this one. I remember thinking how great the Gillette Sensor Excel was, and how it couldn&#x27;t get any better. Then the Mach III came out and I was blown away at the improvement over the Sensor. That was 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the ads for a razor with five blades, I thought, &#x27;this is getting ridiculous.&#x27; But then I received a coupon in the mail for a free Hydro 5. No doubt, this is the closest AND most comfortable shave I have ever had. I have a very sensitive neck, which is easily grazed with cheaper razors, and that requires that I shave very slowly and carefully. With this thing I can shave in less than half the time it used to take, plus the results are better, with NO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, so I never have issues with clogged blades. Also, this review is based solely on the performance of the product, so if others mark it down for clogging or price of blades, I see those things as irrelevant. I don&#x27;t know how long these blades are supposed to last, but I&#x27;ve been using the same one for approx 30-40 shaves, which is around 4 or 5 shaves per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I find it funny that the average star rating here is 4/5, but the average star rating for the replacement blade pack is better. I would think that the performance of the blade is what people are reviewing, so one would think that the averages would be the same. Maybe some people don&#x27;t like the handle?</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I probably would have given this razor at least 4 stars. However, with razors becoming more and more fine-tuned, this razor is only average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand the perspective of this review here are some facts about me: I have a beard that is thicker than the average man and I have been shaving with a Mach 3 for several years. I also do not care which manufacturer makes the best razor. I will buy whatever works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my comparison to the Mach 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade shaving ability: equal to, or less than the Mach 3. This razor does not shave any better for sure. I did notice that this razor shaves better with the gel dispenser flipped down (no gel). The gel, in my opinion, is only a gimmick which reduces the closeness of the shave. I truly do not understand why a razor needs a built-in lubricant when you already have it on your face in the form of shaving cream. Besides, this gel is messy, as if you are putting slime on your face. I don&#x27;t need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics: I really wanted to like this thing as it looks quite innovative. However, after using the simple-shaped handle of the Mach 3 for several years, there is no comparison in this category. The Mach 3, being a simple cylindrical-shaped handle, is very easy to rotate no matter where your fingers are on the length of the handle. This thing, on the other hand, is just plain awkward to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Schick was more interested in making something look cool than they were about function. I suppose that&#x27;s what sells. Not for me. I am very glad that I did not pay for mine as I would have regretted the purchase. Not that it&#x27;s a bad razor, it&#x27;s just not as good as my Mach 3 with regards to the feel of the handle. I want a razor that is simple and effective with no frills. And for that, the Mach 3 is still my first choice. Still hunting for something as good for less money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor out there. It cuts so well, even if you haven&#x27;t shaved in days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young, only 20, but the good Lord has cursed (or blessed) me with some ridiculously thick facial hair. When I was 15 I started out with my dad&#x27;s old Sensor which worked pretty well but I could never get a close shave out of it without really irritating my face, next I went on to the Mach 3 and I had the same problem, the Fusion was an improvement but not enough to justify the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So like many people I have now went backwards to a DE and while I get great shaves from it the time investment and the inevitable terrible cuts I give myself every now and then had me wanting to find a cartridge razor I liked. So I went to Walmart and looked around the shaving aisle, and then it dawned on me \\&quot;I had never tried anything Schick has ever made\\&quot;, growing up Gillette was all any of my family ever used grandpa, dad, uncle, cousins, everyone. If I asked my mom to get me replacement blades at the store when I was younger she just needed to know the blade number and would come home with a Gillette product to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I took the plunge and bought the Hydro 5, figuring I may as well go for broke. I woke up the next morning and did my usual routine and then got out of the shower to shave, the first pass with the grain was nothing special, but when I started the second pass against the grain it was like I had found shaving nirvana. The razor just glided along like it wasn&#x27;t even cutting hair, and when I splashed on my aftershave it barely even burned. When I felt my face I had the closest, best, and most irritation free shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick needs to promote this much more heavily, because if they can get a man to try this he&#x27;ll drop his Fusion in the trashcan and never look back.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, to the point I can only shave every other day. With this razor, I am finally able to shave back-to-back days when needed and without a bloody mess; I have a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the blade lasts for literally months! It is incredible the product is produced to last like this. It&#x27;s supposed to be a consumable and yet I replace the blade every four months or so.</li>
            <li> First of all even without taking it out of the package, the Schick Hydro packaging is as slick as the shave that it provides. After taking it out of its going to provide you the most hydrating and comfortable shave you can get. The pack comes with a great case to store your shaver and comes with an additional cartridge to keep you smooth. The green flip top allows you to precisely trim and can easily flip back up to shave. Make sure to give it a try by getting a free sample at BzzAgent. #GotItFree.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get the spot right by your nose! It also tears up my skin. I&#x27;m buying something else!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I&#x27;d start all my reviews for razors stating that women get the best razors. The main areas I shave are my mustache, front of my neck, under arms, chest, stomach and *cough* sensitive areas, and all the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; razors I&#x27;ve used have been too bulky or big to really get everything without having to go over several more times. The Schick Hydro 5 is still bulky, and has one other tiny issue, but for me, this is the best razor aimed at men that I&#x27;ve ever used. And the best part? When it comes to shaving my head, this is the one I&#x27;ll be going to from now on. What used to take 25-30 minutes now only takes 12, and it&#x27;s a smooth experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy, blades super sharp out of the package, and changing cartridges is quick and easy. There&#x27;s only so much you can talk about with a standard razor without coming off as obsessive. I -love- lathering up my cranium and razoring off strips of hair. Is it weird that I think it felt great the first time I used one of these? As much as I hate my hair growing back quickly, I can&#x27;t wait when the time comes to shave again just so I get to use the Hydro 5 again. My hair grows in a lot of different angles too, but I can have everything gone in around 12 minutes with my head being perfectly smooth. Shaving other areas is just as good, even when I&#x27;m shaving dry. My skin isn&#x27;t irritated either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how big the razor is (which, let&#x27;s face it, is just how it has to be designed what with there being 5 razors), the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lubrication gel. The first couple of shaves is fine, but by the 5th time I shaved my head with it, I was getting all kinds of gunk left on my head. There&#x27;s a lot packed into one cartridge too! It&#x27;s not that big of an issue, since you just wipe it off and it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t get how disposable women&#x27;s razors like the Soleil series never have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is the real deal, and you&#x27;re getting a great bargain for the price it&#x27;s selling at right now. Give it a try- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.selling at right now. Give it a try- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s already getting slightly dull after only five uses. Still a great, clean, and close shave - just pulls a bit. Considering the price, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will buy more blades.</li>
            <li> Schick does the best body shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Solid handle and easy, smooth to move almost everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I will recommend to others and buy more when it comes to replace...</li>
            <li> I have used  the Schick Quatrro Titanium for a few years now. It&#x27;s a 4-blade, powered blade razor, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Hydro a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using the Quattro, thank you. The Hydro shaves fine, but not closer than the Quattro. It&#x27;s sightly easier to manipulate, but not much. It is hugely quieter - the Quattro sometimes sounds like a Weedeater - but that also means that its electric vibro mode is much less energetic than the Quattro&#x27;s, hence much less effective, leaving me to wonder what the point is of the Hydro having a vibro mode at all. The Hydro&#x27;s vibro mode has low-medium-high power selections, but since even on high it is hardly helpful, I don&#x27;t see the point of selectability at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I won&#x27;t be buying refills for the Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And get real: FIVE blades? Give me a break.</li>
            <li> I used to have the Gillete Fusion Proglide and I liked it a lot. It was sleek, battery powered, and smooth. But the replacement blades cost a lot so I decided to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 at first seems a little bulky, but after shaving it&#x27;s really easy. It provides me with a smoother shave and the gel doesn&#x27;t leave a sort of sticky residue on my face like the Fusion did. One small complaint I have about the Hydro 5 is that the snap back trimmer pulls a little more compared to the Fusion, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like this razor and I will continue using it, as I&#x27;ve abandoned my Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> I have received this item as a test with a marketing campaign BzzAgent.  The shave was close, usually I shave 3 or 4 days, now I am working 4 or 5 days, the closeness and the feel after the shave is great.  I have always used another brand, that shall remain nameless because that&#x27;s what that is compared to this.  This razor is good for that job. I like the skin guards on the blades. This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin. The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product through a promotion and was a little scared to switch Razors, as a FUsion user i have never had any problems or discomfort from my razor and didnt want to start.  With some trepidation i opened the Hydro and was impressed by the weight and the feel of the razor.  After shaving i felt like i had a closer shave then i did with my other Fusion razor and was very impressed by the experience.  I even went out an purchased the Hydro shaving gel to compliment the razor and have had a wonderful experience using this razor.  I give it 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Proglide so it was nice to see how this Schick Hydro 5 compares to the Gillette Fusion. After trying the Schick Hydro 5 razor for a week, I find that the Schick razor gives me a smoother shave than the Gillette. The other nice feature is that in a week&#x27;s time, I had no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage that I have found with the Schick Hydro 5 is that the razor clogs up more easily than the Gillette razor. I have to clean it out more often. I did receive this Schick Hydro 5 free from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for many years.  The one I now have was not shaving as close as I liked so I thought I would try something else.  The Schick Hydro Five works for me.  It shaves close and the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever and the vibration is good for a couple things.  The most important of which is that shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  I go from major stubble to clean shave and this powers right through it.  Also the vibration shakes out the shavings under the water.  It&#x27;s that which I believe gives the blades their longevity.  I&#x27;ll easily use the same blade for months (usually 3 to 4ish).  This is more comfortable than both of my electric razors and it shaves closer.  There you go, your minds made up</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  Schick HYDRO 5 offers a great shave and value for the average guy, who has to shave every day and is not falling for the Gillette/P&amp;G $3.75-a-cartridge hype. The HYDRO 5 blades are sharp and well-suspended, so they do not chew your face up by Friday. Use your thumb to grab the top of the cartridge, and the aloe strip flip back to get a straight edge for trimming under the nostrils and side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE MAN-TO-MAN TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;1.) You don&#x27;t have to press hard, but use real shave cream and badger hair brush, not the aerosol crap and your fingers. Shave like a grown up.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Always use after shave lotion with some sort of oil or aloe to help rebuild the skin layers you have scraped off. Amazon has them all for sale, cheap.&lt;br /&gt;3.) If your hair is coarse, better to shave lightly twice than pressing too hard and bleeding. Invest three extra minutes in your face.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Shave after a warm shower and use a pre-shave oil to get two weeks of comfort out of a HYDRO 5 cartridge...this softens the beard enough to get 8-10 shaves out of a cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;5.) Let your skin recover over the weekend when you can; many women say they find the scruff attractive. Just ask them.</li>
            <li> Like it! The blade head never pops off, like I&#x27;ve experienced with some other razors. Expect it to last.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 delivers a smooth shaving experience.  The built in hydrating gel allows it to glide smoothly over my face and helps reduce razor burn.  With the 5 blades, it does a great job of slicing through my whiskers.  While shaving with the grain, the Hydro 5 does a much better job than other razors in delivering a close shave.  I use electric razors mainly, and have a hard time finding a conventional razor that does as well without shredding my skin.  The Hydro 5 gives me that close shave.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would. I bought these for my husband and son who both walked out of the bathroom covered in toilet paper squares. My sick looked like a crime scene. They both complained of razor burn. I tried it on my legs and I took a chunk out of my legs. I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving since I was 14. They really need to take a look at their product because its garbage!!!</li>
            <li> i gave it 5 stars because its a great razor. i dont have to go over the same spot a few times to get the hair up. its a close shave. no nicks in between. give me a smooth look. i will def recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> First off, I am a BzzAgent and am reviewing this as a free trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall feel is solid with a bit more weight than most refillables. This razor does amazing work and my face felt real smooth afterwards. Great overall razor.</li>
            <li> You can expect a smooth and tight shave with this razor. It has 5 blades that get you close to the skin without having to go over the same area time and time again. The moisturizing strip flips up so you can get right up next to the beard or sideburns. That strip also helps keep your face soft and minimizes razor burn or breakouts!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Leaves me with a great shave, close, comfortable...perfection.  I would recommend this product so you too can enjoy such a great shave.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I got to try this Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive razor as part of a sponsored program.  Let me first say this has been the best shave I have had in a long time.  I love how smooth of a shave I get.  I can feel the hydration from the Hydrating Gel Reservior and feel that it does a wonderful job of providing a smooth, comfortable shave.  However, if I skip a day of shaving, it does not do as well through my thicker stubble.  I also find that the blades become dull a lot quicker than other razors I have used in the past.  So, if you have sensitive skin, give this razor a try, I think you will be very happy.  If you have thick stubble like I do, this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I have sensitive skin and tend to break out.. I did break out but not as bad.. This is worth every penny., I just need to try better cream. I usually get the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Schick. This razor provides a clean, close shave. The handle is light and comfortable. I shave against the grain for a closer shave and these blades provide relief from irritation and the hydrating gel leaves my skin smooth. The blades are also a lot cheaper than Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used the Schick Hydro® 5 Sensitive Razor and was very impressed. I was finding that in general the razors with three blades had hit the sweet spot and all the razors with more than three blades were just overkill and not worth the hype. I was happy with the three blades razors but this was a great razor and I am not sure if it is the layout or size or good quality of the blades but it gave me a great shave. The only thing I have issue with is the large area where they put the strip on top of the razor makes it tough to get close under my nose but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It glides over my face with ease with its movable cutting surface.  I can get many, many shaves before replacing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;  A super blade gliding over the tough areas without cutting.  It is just a great experience in shaving.  And, the low cost is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Altman</li>
            <li> I use to get one shave out of an individual single- or double-blade razor that comes in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it is supposed to be less expensive to operate than its competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been amazed with this razor,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m known for my wire bird but I&#x27;ve been using  this for a month or more and I am still using the same blade! That is unbelievable to me. And I bought the refill pack too. I&#x27;ll never have to buy a blade again as far as I and my cardiologist can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I keep it clean by running hot water into it. I keep it in the neat case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand razor for years.  It delivers a very close shave.  However, I recommend using Prorasso Shave Soap with it to enhance your shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted a Schick Quatro but my wife brought this one home instead.  Five blades and a lubrication bar might be great for a women&#x27;s legs but it cannot fit under the nose to shave a man&#x27;s face.  This thing is the size of a small boat oar!  I had to buy a smaller razor just to get the whiskers that this one cannot reach. The lube bar prevents the blades from getting close under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Schick did was take the women&#x27;s shaver and molded it in blue instead of pink.  Don&#x27;t let the color fool you.  This product is not good for men&#x27;s face shaving.</li>
            <li> Like virtually every other Schick razor, the Hydro is most definitely inferior to comparable razors from archrival Gillette. The Hydro simply does not provide as smmoth, close or comfortable a shave as the Gillette Fusion and the blades&#x27; quality is rather flimsy. While the Hydro does represent an improvement over the previously available Quattro, it&#x27;s nonetheless very much inferior to the Gillette Fusion. Schick razors have always left plenty to be desired in comparison to Gillette&#x27;s--and the Hydro is no exception.</li>
            <li> They certainly have developed something GREAT with this razor! I HATED Schick razors! I HATED THEM! I am a HUGE fan of double edge razor shaving. I have thick, coarse hair and felt that double edge was just the way to go for my hair and skin. For the first time, Schick has created a razor that is worthy of praise IMHO! There is no way this razor should receive less than four stars! I think that the flip back top is NOT really useful and prefer that they put a single edge on the back but gave 5 stars anyway b/c of the quality shave that I have received from the razor. I will probably go with the 3 blade refill instead of 5. The 5 blades may be overkill. The hydro system is OUTSTANDING and has given me one of the best shaves in quite some time. At least try it for three days BEFORE you rate it! Give it a try! I think that you will find it to be a MUCH better shave than Gillette offers.(Can&#x27;t believe I just said that but, it&#x27;s true!)TRY IT!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I got tired of using [[ASIN:B000142THM Soft Sheen Carson Magic Fragrant Shaving Powder]]. It gave a close shave, but I wanted a quicker and traditional shave. Well, I first bought the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]]. It gave a pretty good shave. However, I felt the need to buy a razor, which was better for sensitive skin. This razor is good for that job. I like the skin guards on the blades. This helps reduce irritation by keeping the full blades away from the skin. The Vitamin E and aloe reservoir is a good combination, as well. The end result of shaving will leave the skin feeling smooth and oily. Despite what people say, the Flip Trimmer is not a gimmick. It actually works better than the than Precise Trimmer of the Fusion. While using the trimmer, the five blades really do their job. Another bonus is the razors are cheaper than the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, which I do not like about this razor is it does not give that slick shave, which I would prefer. Sometimes, it kind of pulls, as if I was using an electric shaver. I feel somewhat of a burning sensation. This happens even more, once the gel reservoirs start to sink. Of course, that means a new razor is needed. Also, the razors do not shave as close as the Fusion. I believe this is due to the large gaps between the razors and the skin guards. They are so large, you can see the back of the razor. That is not good. If Schick had brought the blades closer in combination with the skin guards, the shaving experience would be superb ala Gillette Fusion Pro Glide. Still, if you are looking for a razor, this is worth picking up.</li>
            <li> Well, let me start off by saying that I have been shaving for many years. Though I am only 22, I have been through many razors in my day. I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette fan. I&#x27;ve had the Mach3, the Fusion and the Mach3 turbo. Overall, I got a good shave, but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest. I then even moved on to trying the old school way of shaving, you know, the soap, the mug, the brush, the shaving oil, safety razor, etc. It worked fine, but I got the same results and wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle. I was also losing hope when the price of blades started going up and being put into theft proof boxes hahaha. Gillette&#x27;s are so expensive and I was tired of wasting cash. They didn&#x27;t even last long, it was very upsetting. Well, A few weeks ago, My wife was at the store,and she saw the Hydro 5, four blades and shaving cream for 9 dollars. I tried the Quattro at one point, and HATED it. Well, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try the Hydro 5 out. She bought it for me and said to give it a go. So far I am really impressed. I have always heard the typical \\&quot;shave with the grain\\&quot; in magazines and online. Over the years, if I just shaved with the grain I would be left with an enormous amount of stubble; even when using the fusion or safety razors. The Hydro 5 cuts pretty close with the grain and honestly, I dont have to shave against the grain (upwards). It&#x27;s very odd, sure there&#x27;s a little bit of hair left, but it still feels smooth, looks good, and saves me time when I am in a rush. I have tried it against the grain as well and it gets very close, and does a good job. Blades are cheaper too. I love the strip with the Aloe and Vitamin E. This thing kills my Mach3 and Fusion. Give this razor a try, you got nothing to lose. You may not experience the same results, but still, it&#x27;s worth giving it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I typed this really fast at work, so excuse any grammatical errors.</li>
            <li> To properly evaluate the new Schick Hydro 5 razor, I decided to compare it to the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been to impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProGlide vs. Hydro 5&lt;br /&gt;Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette&#x27;s as a travel holder with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. Gillette assumes you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro&#x27;s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \\&quot;suspension\\&quot; for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. It sometimes takes a couple of tries to snag the new cart from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On initial \\&quot;hefting\\&quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave Test: All of the above are secondary to the \\&quot;Yes, But How Does It Shave\\&quot; test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck. (I haven&#x27;t received razor burn from any razor in years!) To use the trimmer I had to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other. IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \\&quot;dried\\&quot; she still said the Gillette side was smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydro 5 vs Quattro&lt;br /&gt;Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both tests, the Hydro and the Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but not enough to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Wife Test, the Hydro side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a small margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro, especially when you factor in the cost of the cartridges. I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.th the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.    Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)  The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.    The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck. (I haven&#x27;t received razor burn from any razor in years!) To use the trimmer I had to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other. IMO, the flip-top is more of a gimmick.    Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.    The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \\&quot;dried\\&quot; she still said the Gillette side was smoother.    Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)  The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.    Hydro 5 vs Quattro  Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the Hydro 5 and a Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    In both tests, the Hydro and the Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but not enough to be uncomfortable.    In the Wife Test, the Hydro side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a small margin.    While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro, especially when you factor in the cost of the cartridges. I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough with the Hydro 5 to make the switch, either, as long as Quattro cartridges are available.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim (Wally world special razor, 5 heads and a gel for under $10). Generally I am super sensitive to shaving and have always been a Gillette guy. I usually get razor burn no matter what I do. I have tried the oils, the special creams, the gels, you name it. I was pretty satisfied with my Mach 3. Well this razor (Schick Hydro 5) is much better than anything I have ever used before. It puts my trusty Mach 3 to shame. I bought the Fusion and hated it. Now the the Hydro 5 is the king of razors in my opinion. The best parts are, the blades last longer and cost much less. I thought most razors these days were gimmicks. Well the Hydro 5 really made me a believer and now will only shave with this. Good-bye Gillette hello Schick.</li>
            <li> I switched from Gillette Mach3 and it my first impression of Hydro5 wasn&#x27;t very good. With Mach3 I could feel it cutting my hair, so I knew I was shaving. With Hydro5 I didn&#x27;t feel almost anything, it didn&#x27;t pull my hair, so I thought it didn&#x27;t cut them too. It was very different filling from what I had with Mach3 for over 4 years now and my first thought was that Hydro5 was a waste of money. But when I looked in the mirror I realized that it shaved everything very well. Clean, painless and comfortable shaving, I didn&#x27;t know that it come that close to that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and will recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve also tried Gillette ProGlide which was painless as well, but didn&#x27;t feel as clean, so I think Hydro5 is better.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve bought a Schick and also will be the last. I have to shave every other day and it still doesn&#x27;t do a thorough job. I got better results with a month old Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> I like it. That being said I don&#x27;t see really any advantage over the Mach 3. Not worse, but I don&#x27;t think I could give a terribly strong justification for one to switch. If you like the Mach 3 (and how could you not?) you will likely be satisfied with this blade as well.</li>
            <li> I must admit, this five bladed razor by Schick reminds me of a Saturday Night Live spoof when the first three bladed razors were introduced years ago. It&#x27;s a bit unwieldy when you first use it, and the refills are expensive. But, it works. Probably the easiest and cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor works very well for sensitive skin.i do not cut myself like i do with other razors.it does a good job of giving a close shave without red skin and all.it was free, to try and review from Schick.and from bzzagent who i am a member of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this day Gillette has a competitor now this razor is awesome it gives an awesome shave it glides with ease over the skin with luborcating gel it has it helps it not irritate the skin at all i can only tell you its worth giving this product a shot it does what it says it will do plus more.</li>
            <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 as a part of a promotional campaign and thought I would give it a try.  You can really tell the gel reservoir was working.  I have never gotten such a close, clean shave with no shave irritation.  The blades seemed to stay sharp with no tugging and the smooth feeling lasted longer than I expected.  Great razor and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> the razor is average and made out of plastic but the razor blades are awesome and lasts very long. Schick should improve the quality of their razor to be more metal than plastic but that would increase the price of the product. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the razor as the blades last longer and is economical when compared to gillette. I definitely recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t want to spend money buying gillette blades</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is everything you could want in a razor, and more. It was a smooth, effortless shave that always got the job done. After I was done shaving I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> I really love the comfort of the handle. also the pivot feature of the blade is a great feature.</li>
            <li> This razor helped me transition from my old electric razor to using hand razors. It was a little awkward at first since it&#x27;s bigger than a disposable razor but man it does wonders. The only part I dislike is that it&#x27;s hard to get into tight spaces but definitely worth that trade off! No more burning sensation after finishing. I received this razor free after promotion but it&#x27;s one of the best out there (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> This is one of the lightest feeling razors I have ever used. It feels slick and fast, making long shaves in a single pass. The flip top back is a bit awkward and not as useful as the touch-up top blade on some other products. I find I like to use the Hydro for regular shaving and a razor with the 5+1 system for those tighter areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if there was a trimming blade.</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail and so as not to let it go to waste I&#x27;ve put my mach 3 on the shelf and tried it.  This is a bad product.  The blade cartridge is too wide (with 4 unneeded blades and 2 extra parts).  Impossible to edge anything and worse yet, on my 3rd use it cut me 3 times.  I&#x27;m clean and dry my razor after each use and a single mach 3 will last me 6 months, I throw it away as soon as it starts to cut me (see Clark Howard for drying and life span expectations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea, bad design, bad everything.&lt;br /&gt;Andre</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always used Gillette razors, occasionally Schick would come out with a new razor and I&#x27;d give it a try each time I&#x27;d end up going back to Gillette for 1 simple reason.  The blades on their razors are spaced to close together making them difficult to clean/rinse off.  I just purchased the new Schick 5 Blade Hydro hoping they decided to change the blade spacing but much to my surprise the blade spacing has not changed and to make things worse the top of the blade is covered so much its makes it extra hard to rinse it out from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I think I&#x27;ll be going back to my Gillette blades until Schick figures out the spacing issue.</li>
            <li> I agree that you get a great shave with Gillette&#x27;s Fusion, or even its little brother, the Mach 3. But I have never, ever liked the \\&quot;paddle effect\\&quot; of those blades, hinged at the bottom; I&#x27;ve always felt one step removed from complete control, especially pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes Schick Hydro 5, and problem solved. The blades are sensibly hinged in the middle and, indeed, I get complete control and a noticeably better shave, faster, than I get from the Gillette products. In particular, I have a place under my chin and along the neck that I&#x27;ve always had to attack several times, from several directions, to get smooth. This blade cuts it smooth first time, every time. A small touch-up, and I move on. To me, that says something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade lasts longer, too. I shave five days a week, and get 20 good shaves from the Hydro, compared to 15 from the Fusion. The flip-down lube reservoir atop the cartridge allows close shaving beneath the nose and at sideburns, and the result is equal to Gillette&#x27;s one blade on the back of the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give four stars because I cannot believe that these cartridges need to be so expensive. I&#x27;m waiting for coupons.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette since I was 16, in fact considering my grandfather&#x27;s monogrammed brass Gillette razor(which I have used with fresh blades) I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!! The Hydro gave me my smoothest shave ever.... at twice as expensive the Gillette proglide does not exactly glide...so although its a good close shave with the Proglide it is nowhere as comfortable as the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;If you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time. As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades well I simply dont feel like using them and have given the to my gf for her legs etc</li>
            <li> I upgraded from my old trusty Gillette Mach 3 Turbo a few months back to the Schick Quattro Titanium, but was disappointed with it.  That razor required several passes to reach BBS, and penalized me with some gnarly razor burn about half the time.  I found the Hydro in Wally World and decided I&#x27;d try it (I&#x27;ve always been suspicious of those 5 bladed razors, but it was only about $8 so I thought what the heck, might as well!)  Long story short, the Hydro is simply the best razor I have yet to come across!  It just slides along my skin (or rather it FEELS like it is, because it cuts very well without pulling on the first stroke, in fact about as well as two or three strokes it would&#x27;ve taken the Quattro.)  I&#x27;ve recently ordered 4 cartridges of the 3 blade version, as the handle is compatible with them (another plus) and will be testing to see if those five blades really are necessary, and hopefully cut some cost as well.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t shave my face, I do trim it and shave excess fuzz off the neck and cheeks. The main reason for buying this was for my head, as I prefer being bald. Before the Hydro 5 came along I was using the Gillette Fusion 5+1, which was pretty darn good since it didn&#x27;t scrape or cut. The trade-off was some annoying razor burn for a day. It seemed this was as good as it got...until Hydro 5 came along. They advertised its virtues: 5 blades for a close shave, depth-regulators on each blade to gauge blade depth, the lubricant strip and the flip-head for fine-trimming. I&#x27;m a skeptic, which is okay, since this avails one to buy and try rather than say \\&quot;BS\\&quot;; thus I bought Hydro 5. So, with 4 days of stubble on the noggin top, I attacked it, deciding to use a bit more pressure to see if it could instigate some razor burn. When everything was said and done, the shaving experience was not only a little smoother but absolutely zero razor burn! And no nicks or cuts! This was also while using warm water and Barbasol shaving cream. Would I recommend this product? By all means! Without reservation.</li>
            <li> awesome product great razor works a million times better than gillete mad smooth and no cuts and leaves my face feeling wonderful and soft</li>
            <li> I recently picked up a Hydro 5, and it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I was impressed with the Gillete Proglide when that came out, and I still think that&#x27;s a very good razor, but the Hydro 5 is more comfortable for me. The biggest difference though, is that I was able to use a single Hydro 5 blade for 2 weeks, shaving 5 times per week. In the past, I&#x27;ve found blades to be very dull and uncomfortable past one week. Bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is worth a try. You may end up a convert like me!</li>
            <li> I went to a big box store and got a terrific deal on this razor and blades. I previously used the fusion. I get an equally excellent shave with both the Hydro and Fusion, in addition the blades of both seem to last a good three months. What I do not like is the Hydro handle. It bulges in the toward the end of the razor and if you hold the handle in this region your fingers are bound to slip off. The Fusion handle is much, much much easier to grip, particularily if you shave upward rather than downward. I wish Shick would redesign this handle so it is more like the Fusion and every other razor I have owned. I guess Shick wanted to make a design statement.</li>
            <li> For my son - he likes it</li>
            <li> I was pretty bored of paying the exorbitant prices Gillette charges for refill cartridges, so decided to check out their competition. I noticed immediately that after rinsing out the blades, it is pretty much impossible to drain all the water from the blades. If you don&#x27;t shake it vigorously for five minutes, you end up with gallons of shaving cream-saturated water cascading down your naked body. The next problem is that, with those five blades, combined with the fact that the water flow is restricted from the back, it is difficult to clean the hair and gel from between the blades between strokes. Finally, the head on this thing is HUGE. Good luck shaving your nooks and crannies - above your ears, under your nose, in your groin, wherever... It&#x27;s like trying to shave with a textbook, not going to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of miserable shaves, I bought some expensive Gillette refills, and it was awesome. Can&#x27;t wait to shave again tomorrow. I don&#x27;t like their prices, but it turns out they charge that much because their competition is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> My whiskers are coarse. Like \\&quot;shaving toothbrush bristles\\&quot; coarse. A comfortable close shave is a must, but I also need a razor that can last a while without gouging me with overpriced replacement cartridges. I was using Gillette Mach 3 for years. I was finding that the lube strip was half gone after one shave, and two or three shaves before the cartridges were too painful to use. I had to find something better. Recently I tried a Gillette Fusion sample. The shave was outstanding but the razor burn was incredible, leaving my face feeling rubbery, tender, and sandblasted two days later. I gave it time, figuring it takes a while to adjust, but the blades wore out just as fast and the lingering burn was just too annoying so I went back to the Mach 3. I contemplated trying an oldschool safety razor, but it&#x27;s clear to me that the people raving about them are mostly hipsters that collect them for nostalgia&#x27;s sake. And hipsters have beards, so what do they know about close shaves? So... I tried the Schick Hydro 5.  After my first shave I knew this was going to be a keeper. Shaving ease and comfort was outstanding, I&#x27;d go so far as to say the best I&#x27;ve ever had. And there was NO razor burn. Absolutely none of the \\&quot;flamethrower to the face\\&quot; feeling of the Fusion. The reason is this... the Fusion has 5 blades, VERY close together. What happens is, stubble collects in the gap between the blades &amp; doesn&#x27;t push out the back as you go. Until you rinse, you are actually raking your face with your own stubble! This causes the razor burn, and it gets worse as the lube strip wears out. The blades on the Hydro5 are gapped wide enough for the stubble to push out the back as you go. No stubble-drag, no razor burn - simple as that. The cartridges are much better constructed and the flip-back lube bar is an excellent and functional solution that works well. Bottom line - if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave that doesn&#x27;t burn, you have coarse whiskers and wear out blades like crazy, and don&#x27;t want to pay Gillette 2X the cost for their inferior products, then get the Schick Hydro5!&#x27;t want to pay Gillette 2X the cost for their inferior products, then get the Schick Hydro5!</li>
            <li> Nice item, good price, one can&#x27;t ask for much more than that. It arrived in new condition as stated.Not as smooth as Gilette Pro-Glide Fusion, but ok.&lt;br /&gt;Ken&lt;br /&gt;Webmaster&lt;br /&gt;About Facts Net</li>
            <li> Of all the 5 blade razors, this one has the cheapest refills.  Does a good job for less cost.</li>
            <li> a good blade for the money ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette blade user simply because I could never find anything that shaved as close and smooth. When I used up the two blades that came with my Gillette Fushion Proglide Power Razor system, I went shopping for some replacement blades. For some reason, I was suddenly tired of trying to find the best price for Gillette blades and started looking for alternatives. I had tried Schick in the past and was not pleased, but I thought I&#x27;d give the Hydro 5 a try. I am happy to say that it actually performed better for me than the Gillette I had been using, and at a cheaper price. A pack of Schick replacement blades is way less than half the price of Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have ever owned and the replacement blades are not a stab in the gut. If you thinking about getting this razor I would do it.  The placed small bars on the back of the blades and somehow the hair does not clog up near as bad and for the most part washes right out.</li>
            <li> I like how this comes with a holder that can be attached to the wall.</li>
            <li> I have been a Mach 3 person forever but I tried this when on a cruise and I love it. I still use the Mach 3 for my face but I use this to shave my head and it does a great job at giving me a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor. I don&#x27;t normally buy these. I use an electric and just trim. Bought I got this for my neck to get a closer shave. It did the trick. Small cut but that was probably due to my performance.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a bit much but not terrible. Razor handle is made of  metal and plastic making for a nice feel. The &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; action is a bit sketchy.. it is harder than i expected to flip the lubricating part back but its a nifty concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obviously better than a disposable razor, but i cant say that 5 blades is really any better than 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First thing I really like the Designed Handle and all  five blades because it makes it really easy to shave. It makes it quick, easy and so smooth shave. This is the best razor I have ever used and  YES! I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> provides a great close shave!</li>
            <li> A guy I work with was bragging about his new razor, but I thought, yeah - how does it stand up to shaving legs? The razor is great - the gel pad lays down a nice slick surface and the 5 blades shave very close &amp; smooth.  The head swivels nicely to avoid nicking knees and ankles.  It also has a neat straight edge feature, which is important for the men - not so much for me.  I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for 2 weeks now and it just started to lose a little bit of the closeness of the shave.  This blade lasts twice as long as the Sensor Excel and the discount coupons make it a steal.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used. I have a thick, course beard and am susceptible to ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I have gone through countless manual and electronic versions and this one works well for me. I get a smooth shave every time with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Less money, better razor. The glide on this razor hands down is better, and more smooth than Gillette&#x27;s. Save some money, and get a better shave, and shaving experience as everything about this razor is awesome from the razor to the heavy duty feel of the handle. It&#x27;s premium built. Good job Shick! You finally outdid your competetion.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I always use to get some kind of razor burn.. now I never get it! and replacment cartridges are cheap as well! You can get them from amazon here: [...]</li>
            <li> I bought because I was told it was a huge upgrade over the Mach 4.  Honestly, I have to disagree. It works about the same.  My skin in sensitive.  I&#x27;ve found its just as easily to irritate my skin with the Hydro 5 as it was with the Mach 4.  If I had it to do over, I would just stick with the Mach 4 and save myself the money I spent on this razor.</li>
            <li> From my husband:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To caveat this post, I will state that I shave in the shower without any shaving cream, gel, or lotions.  I have found that my current electric shaver works well (with a few spots that are difficult with a round razor - straight &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; for example) without anything and this is what I am comparing it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Schick Hydro 5 with me on business travel, bravely doing without my standard Gilette Mach 3 that I have been using for a while.  While not the best razors, I find the performance excellent for the price and quality of the shave - especially if you have semi-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the added 2 blades provided a much smoother shave than the Gillette, but there were two areas that did not seem to get a very good cut.  These were the sideburns and right under the nose.  I think the extra large &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; on the razor makes it difficult to determine where you are going to shave (sideburns) or doesn&#x27;t allow you to get the razor close to your nose on your upper lip.  I found myself having to touch up these areas after close inspection.  This could just be because I was used to using a different razor.  It definitely isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, and by the end of my week&#x27;s hotel stay, found myself becoming more aware of how I needed to shave with the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without using any creams or gels, the razor gave a very smooth shave.  I used the one blade the entire week and think it could have still done a few more shaves.  I don&#x27;t know what the life of a normal blade is for most people, but this seemed a little bit longer than the Gillete Mach 3 with the way I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was happy with the Schick and probably will switch over to the Hydro 5 for my future disposable razor needs!</li>
            <li> Solid and well built. Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> okay - I think I bought the wrong one because he had to take to a local drugstore.  I really didn&#x27;t understand if the blades were wrong or what.</li>
            <li> MISSING A BLADE THAT TRIMS NOSE/EARS</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and was very disappointed.  I love the Gillette Pro Glide and with this razor having 5 blades I thought it would at least be comparable.  It doesn&#x27;t even compare. The blades seemed to dull after the first use and I never felt like I got the kind of shave I should have.  The Proglide is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor for my face. But to shave my head, I need a blade. I used to use Fusion Pro Glide, but those blades are dull after 3-4 uses. Totally a waste of money.  I finally tried the Schick Hydro 5 (the power version)... and was REALLY impressed-- the lotion really helped prevent any razor burn (those dull fusion blades would really tear into me). The blades last a good while. I only shave my head every 4-5 days, but I can get over 2 months on 1 cartridge!</li>
            <li> I ended up ditching my Gilette Proglide after growing tired of paying an arm and a leg for razors. In comparison, the Hydro 5&#x27;s blades are about 50% the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find that both razers perform almost identically despite the massive price difference. It isn&#x27;t all sunshine, though. I have found the Hydro 5 knicks the skin very easily, and I have cut myself more times in two months than I ever did with the Proglide. Barring that, it&#x27;s a much more effective blade for the price.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;m going to try the dollar a month shave club, but this blades great.  I love it more than Gillette, their prices are pathetic and outrageous.  My brother is in the military, I am a Veteran.  He says check out the Dollar Shave Club, so I will.  Still, can&#x27;t complain about Schick, great product.</li>
            <li> I am a electric razor guy for the normal day to day shaving, and a Gillette guy for years. I gave this razor a try and was surprised how close the shave was without a thousand nicks or razor burn caused by a normal 5 blade. The ability to flip down the moisturizing strip and trim my sideburns was an added plus. Also normally shaving right under your nose with a 5 blade is really impossible due to the size of the blade, by flipping back the moisturizing strip i was able to shave this easily. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome product....very smooth and comfortable when I shaved my beard.</li>
            <li> This blade works very well on my face while other cause rashes. of course that is MY FACE your face might be diffent,  NOTE the number &amp;#34;FIVE&amp;#34; printed on the cover tricked me into thinking there was 5 blades in the package,  there was only one! and for the price i paid on line, i could have bought local, saved money!&lt;br /&gt;and got a real &amp;#34;five&amp;#34; pack!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver because I received a FREE voucher for one in the mail.  The best thing about it is the handle, the handle is very comfortable, ergonomic and cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the head, it is so big and obtrusive.  It&#x27;s very hard to get into the correct position.  It&#x27;s very hard to pinpoint where u want to shave so u wind up over or under shaving.  I cut my cheek with this beast.  The head pivots but doesn&#x27;t flex, it&#x27;s like running a jagged sanding block all over your face &amp; neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at all the blades, why are so many blades needed?  All they do is rake your face and cut way more than u need.  My face is still burning 2 days later.  If you can handle the burn of 5-non-strategically placed blades, get this shaver; otherwise, this is a waste of time and/or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the quattro or extreme 3, this is a total dud, all hype.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best razor I have used.  I thought that 5 blades was total overkill, but this one actually does seem engineered to make it work in your benefit.  The soothing gel that is released is a nice feature.  Presumably you will also use shaving cream of some kind, but the gel has an aloe-like feel and seems to lotion the shaved surface after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is not necessarily the most ideal blade for the face.  I do not have a lot of facial hair, mostly stubble, for which disposable Bic&#x27;s to the job.  I actually use this on my junk (where the sun don&#x27;t shine), and it works amazingly well.  Normally, frequent shaves have a tendency to create chafing or redness; though I do not use this every single day, there are times where I will touch up every couple days and it still feels pretty smooth and creates a close shave.  The hydrating gel definitely helps, but this definitely makes you smooth.  I realize everyone is different, but it is the best option I have found up to this point.  The blades will also last a long time!</li>
            <li> This works well for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;this comes with some coupons, so I purchased extra blades in the target with discount.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure how I feel about this razor compared to the juggernaut of the industry the Gillette Fusion Wizard Master Pro Slip and Slide Glide Zip Super Speed Power.... or whatever they&#x27;re calling it now.  The styling is a little clunky and doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as refined as the Gillette, but it&#x27;s a razor, right; most peoples&#x27; is disgusting and nasty anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the shave, I can&#x27;t quite make a determination as to which is better. I have noticed that it seems to take some time for your face to get used to the difference in razor though. At first I thought this razor was far worse, but then I gave it a couple of tries and noticed that It performed quite nicely. I really like the reservoir of super slick lubricant that these Hydro 5 have, but I would recommend you make it part of your routine to wet the razor right off the bat just to give it some time to hydrate; especially if you don&#x27;t use or only use little shaving gel/cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend you rinse this razor more frequently than you do the Gillette fusion or even the Mach3. Gillette really solved the problem of hair and skin clogging the spaces between the blades, which Schick has always had a really difficult time with before the Hydro line and still hasn&#x27;t really mastered. The blades are more spaced and the back of the razor is more open, but between the little metal &amp;#34;stabilizer rods&amp;#34; to keep the blades stiff that...they claim...keep the shave smoother (probably because the had to space the blades to prevent clogging or couldn&#x27;t master production difficulties) can also contribute to some clogging issues if you don&#x27;t rinse the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, for half the price this razor system is definitely worth the money and a suitable alternative if you give your skin and face some time to adjust as you would have to with any other blade, even if you were moving from Bic to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got these because I had a coupon and the Gillette Fusion razors weren&#x27;t on sale. It works, but not as well as the Gillette, so I switched back to the Fusion when those went on sale again. Tip for razor burn, regardless of what product you&#x27;re using. Get a spray bottle like this: [[ASIN:B000NIY7QM Fantasea Fine Mist Spray Bottle]] and put some [[ASIN:B000GCLU4W Hibiclens antimicrobial and antiseptic skin cleanser liquid]] in it. Spray your razors before each time you use them. Razor burn is caused by a staph infection and the Hibiclens kills the bacteria.</li>
            <li> These nick me and seem like an old razor when still brand new! I have many more ingrown hairs in my legs now since using these.</li>
            <li> i love the five blade because i don&#x27;t have to used them every other day to shave my head.thanks schick.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for about 9 years.  when i have used disposables in the past, I would always get razor burn.  I decided to try the Hydro 5 since it claims to have less irritation.  Overall a good shave and no irritation.  If you use disposables, you will probably love how your face feels.</li>
            <li> Vendor is legitimate and delivers as promised. If you have used the razors purchase with confidence and stop reading. Unfamiliar with these razors? Read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin hydro is basically latin for foolproof. Any way you shave it will accomadate it&#x27;s like having a barber travel with you anywhere also willing to work all hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s a milder razor than the fusion but infinitely better for the skin and you can use multiple passes without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only knocks are longevity and price. A week&#x27;s life is about all you can expect for effective use and even on sale it&#x27;s well over ten times the cost of my go-to bic sensitives.</li>
            <li> Brilliant seller, exactly as advertised, thank you!</li>
            <li> Daily shaving is not a chore. Dragging a razor across my face is more like sledding than a clear-cutting operation. Unlike hirsute individuals, I am not one of those men whose hair grows continuously from the tops of their heads to the bottoms of their feet. Schick Hydro 5 works well on my punim (Yiddish for “face”). With annual razor blade expenses equivalent to a high end electric shaver, I resent the weekly $3 per blade expenditure. That’s almost the price of a gallon of gasoline in NJ. I would prefer to use the same money to play the lottery, something I consider to be a more worthwhile endeavor. At least the proceeds go to education.  I will hunt for the cheapest gasoline price. Why not do the same for razor blades? Economists call that practice “arbitrage.” Schick Hyrdo 5 saves me approximately 5¢ per blade over competitors such as Fusion manual. I’ll stick to Schick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying these and don&#x27;t go by the older reviews. These blades used to be a great shave but now they just grab my skin and the lubricant actually PREVENTS a smooth shave, if you can believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I started using these blades, I noticed that the country of manufacture was Germany....which is what I expected for something of this quality, at that time. The lubricant was adequate and the blades were super sharp, and it gave me the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough after I have been using them for several months and as soon as I noticed a change in performance, I read the label again--just out of curiosity--and they are now being made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are garbage.</li>
            <li> I received these from a BzzAgent campaign and I can honestly say I&#x27;m a fan. The five blades give a ridiculously-close shave, though admittedly, they do make reaching some &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; (near the lips, edging of sideburn/hairline) difficult. Schick handles this by including the flip trimmer, and because of that, these disposables really do have everything I could hope for in such a product.</li>
            <li> Works great fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I got tired of the high priced Gillette Fusion so I thought I would give this a try.  This thing is not worth much of my time so here are the bullet points.&lt;br /&gt;1. Left a slim all over my face.  I could not even tell if I got all my beard because when I rubbed my fingers across my face all I felt was slim. So, I had to wash off the slim in between every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle is way to big.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The big plastic lube tip gets in the way of saving tight areas.&lt;br /&gt;4.  When I was done my shave was real patchy with a lot spots missed.  I usually check with my fingers when I shave  but all the slim must have covered up the missed areas.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It feels disgusting while shaving and you can not tell where the blades even are.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.</li>
            <li> I just used this razor for the first time, and frankly, I&#x27;m very unimpressed. The five blades didn&#x27;t glide smoothly; it felt like it was more tugging that it was cutting. The \\&quot;Hydrating reservoir\\&quot; ended up making my face really slimy and unpleasant, and the blade head is so large that it makes shaving around tight spaces difficult (and the single blade option isn&#x27;t very helpful). It did get a good, close shave, but the overall experience wasn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on an impulse because the store was out of my usual.  When I took my first shave I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a very clean shave and the aloe strip makes it smooth.  The aloe strip seems to last for a few shaves, then tapers off a bit.  But, I tend to stretch the number of uses I get out of refills, so this is understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the vibrating feature with the single AA battery was a gimmick, but it actually seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the razors/refills of this type, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using Schick Quattro Titanium for almost 3 years and prior to that Schick Xtreme-3. All were great products in their own times of release and always bettered the generational existence..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This five bladed gem is excellent and smooth on skin, One thing I observed with schick razors is that they work smooth with the application of foam rather than gel. I found barbasol foam to be more suitable for this blades and longevity of blades increases with usages of foam over gel, Of-course this is an observation on my skin, I cannot  generalize this...</li>
            <li> I lost mine, and was in a tight spot at the moment, I received this at a great price, and good timing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a second razor and as a change to my daily razor. I have been using Gillette Fusion Power for quite a while now and very comfortable with it. The main reason for me to try this one was refill cartridge price. Gillette prices are very high (very much worth after trying Schick). First day I received the razor, I looked at its design and immediately disliked it. The razor handle has that flimsy feel and does not seem sturdy. Cartridge hinge was also not as good for me. But I did not want to dismiss this at the first look and was determined to try it out. I tried it out and I was more disappointed. It took me more time to shave and I had cuts all over my face. I thought I just have to get used to the new design ( I was that determined to try new razor). I use it second time, I was frustrated. Same results as the first time and uncomfortable thorough whole shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now its sitting in the cabinet and I don&#x27;t feel like using it. I may try again sometime but I love Gillette. May be this is not for me.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. This razor has yet to irritate my skin.The razor has a great life span, I bought this around November and I am still on my first blade . I give this product an A+, I will continue to purchase it. This razor can be used by both man and woman, trust me you will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> The overly massive skin guard/lubricating strip does not allow you to get into the nooks and cranny&#x27;s like under your nose (it just cant function with that clunky huge abomination of a head). The massive skin guard/lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t allow for a precision shave, or anywhere near it. Have points on your goatee/beard/stache you need to maintain? NOT with this item, it has the precision of a man with no hands trying to solve a rubix cube.  Aside from that the actual blades don&#x27;t seem to get close and leave stray hairs and stubble, this is one the FIRST use. I simply cant believe a company would create and sell such a non intuitive product, whats next a heated refrigerator? Ill stick with my fusion power ProGlide.</li>
            <li> My son and I fight over this. I buy two so we each have one, but in the days later one gets lost.  The five blades make it amazingly close. I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs as often and he doesn&#x27;t have to do his face much (hence the TWO razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have this on auto-subscription and get it for less than $7.00 each including 2 extra cartridges...hard to beat!</li>
            <li> While I used these same razors in the UK under the brand name listed above, in the US the quality is far lower. The shave is not as close as the Gillette Pivot one-time use razors (the ones I use for shaving my head). However, this razor I use for shaving the face as I do it more often and requires less cleaning time.</li>
            <li> I jumped to quick to order this. I thought it had a total of five heads when it clearly said blades!</li>
            <li> Good product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this razor so much. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who is looking for a super good razor.</li>
            <li> This is such an obvious fail. Got one of these free as a same so I decided to try it. Smooth to start, than I got the the spot underneath your nose above your lip. Fail. Cannot get underneath your nose. The desin is too big. Must have been designed by a woman. Also not a close shave at all. I had to return to my other razor to finish up. Threw this one in the trash. Good luck if you decide to buy this.</li>

            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m fed up with cartridge shaving. Blades are expensive, and I&#x27;m spending less money with traditional DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I would choose the Schick Hydro above anything else in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sharp.  The hydrating gel pad flips back to give sideburns a straight edge.  This razor was built for compatibility with the end user in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love(d) it and I know for a fact that you will too (that is if traditional shaving isn&#x27;t for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> The best razor I have found. I switched to men&#x27;s razors years ago. Less irritation and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Trying to spend less money and bought Shick hydro 5, right away I could tell a deference.  Smoother shave and closer cut(I have sensitive skin too) and the trimmer works great too!.  I have a heavy beard and have to shave w/the whiskers, could shave twice a day and all the way down my neck too.  I have the Gillete Fusion battery powered model; seemed like I was going through cartridges twice a week(if I shave everyday) and batteries once a week.  I don&#x27;t know how long these shick cartridges are going to last but I can tell you one thing for sure and that is this Shick Hydro 5 is my new one and only shaver now.  No more spending money on batteries.  Shick is less expensive to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Shick!</li>
            <li> Through painful trial and error I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I have the most sensitive skin on the planet. Electronic/dry-shaves cause break outs and ingrown hairs, shaving too often means ingrown hairs with razor burn, and too infrequently means breakouts and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only razor I&#x27;ve been able to shave with consistently 3 days a week to avoid ALL of those problems. The blades last FOREVER and can easily be honed (not sharpened, google it) with an old pair of denim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is the highest quality blade money can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people still buy this crap. Schick has an obviously inferior product to Gillette, and Gillette&#x27;s Fusion is a bad product to begin with. Why would anyone waste their time shaving with a cartridge razor which gets easily gunked up and you have to replace time after time after time after time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a fool for far, far, far too long. I shaved with cartridges for over 11 years and only now am I learning just what a dupe I was. I should have gone for the gold to begin with. Double edged safety razor. The razor lasts forever, the blades are cheap, and you&#x27;ll always get a clean, comfortable shave with nothing to gunk it up.</li>
            <li> I am used to shaving with a double edge safety razor. I have recently started shopping around for a cartridge or disposable razor because I am going to Basic Training soon and for some reason the Air Force does not allow safety razors. For the most part I have had some pretty bad experiences. This one was very interesting to say the least, having 5 blades slide across your face at once is not very pleasant, but I have not experienced the horrible after pain as with the other razors and cartridges I have tried, so I guess this one is not too bad.</li>
            <li> The five blades do cut the hair thats for sure.  I do not like the way it does not contour to your skin.The angle of the handle is a bit strange as well.  I found myself having to shave at different angles then I&#x27;m used to.  I normally use Gillettes products but I was trying to save some dollars.  After this I&#x27;m going back to Gillette.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i don&#x27;t know how this razor got soo many 5 star ratings but it sucks. Gillette razors are better. Schick razors are awful (not just the hydro 5, i forgot to mention that this razor always cuts me and it tugs on my hair. not once did i ever cut myself with Gillette.</li>
            <li> I used to used Gillette products all my life, but the blades got too expensive. This razor is great. I would have given it 4 stars, but I have large hands and find razor slipping out of my hands some times. They need to put some better grips on the base. Aside from that the shave is the best ever with this razor.</li>
            <li> I use the Schick Hydro 5 differently than my previous razor. Once I learned to use it, it has reduced my shaving time considerably and did a good job.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great, smooth shave- Thanks for such a great new product that I just stumbled upon - Thanks again~!</li>
            <li> Having a beard 90% of the time, I decided to shave it for the summer. Though it usually takes 30 minutes to completely shave off the beard, it took me half the time with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite happy with the results, and how quick the blades cut through this tangled mess.</li>
            <li> I just received my sample from the brand as a brand sponsored program and i can tell you i made the best choice ever!&lt;br /&gt; The 5 blades mixed with the aloe holder make this product awesome. I have yet to have a smoother shave. After I shave, this makes my beard really stand out. I keep my sides low so it is not your normal thick beard. The skin under my neck has never been smoother. The only thing that would make this top notch would be to have a shower holder incorporated. I know of some female products that have a shower holder that comes with their product. Great product Schick!</li>
            <li> I always used Gillette 5 with Edge sensative skin.  I am on Korean USA military base in Korea, and last week I received a free Schick 5 with my Edge.  I could not believe the difference.  This is a super shaver.  With Gillette, I would have two weeks of comfortable/efficient shaving.  I am now on my fifth week of comfortable/efficient with Schick 5; who knows where it will end. Now I have an answer when someone says \\&quot;who gives a Schick.\\&quot; I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for next to nothing as part of the Black Friday deals. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and can&#x27;t go wrong with Schick.</li>
            <li> When i shaved with this it felt really smooth gliding over my face with [[ASIN:B000HLYGP2 Shaving Cream - Lemon Essential Oil ( For All Skin Types ) - The Art Of Shaving - Day Care - 150g/5.3oz]] on it so i think the reason why i got razor bumps was because, i applied too much pressure and wasn&#x27;t going with the grain properly because, i only got razor burn below my jaw line since i&#x27;m a black young man with very coarse curly hair and i&#x27;m not sure which way to shave below my jaw line</li>
            <li> When I decided to upgrade from disposables, I wanted something that would be a good shave at a reasonable price, and the Schick Hydro 5 was a good choice. The conditioning strip can be a little too gooey when the blade is new, but the shaves are super smooth and the conditioner never dries out - even after extended use. I shave my legs and underarms 4 or 5 times a week and this blade lasts about a month. However, I do take the razor out of the shower when not in use to prevent overexposure to water &amp; rusty blades. Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality shave. Good enough that I bought refill cartridges instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Never used a manual razor before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve used it numerous times since and it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He doesn&#x27;t like it as well as the one he currently uses.  Plus, he said the cartridges for this cost so much more.  My son tried it and he didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this razor because of the low cost of replacement blades. A did a few online searches for reviews, and decided it was a safe bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the blades for this razor have the lubrication strip on the top. This means that your first razor swipe is done without lubrication. Other razors do this as well, but the lubrication strip is so large that it&#x27;s impossible for me to shave the area directly below my nose. After shaving with the Hydro 5, I had to pull out my old razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first blade got so clogged with gunk that my third shave was a mess. Perhaps because the blades are so close together, it&#x27;s easy for them to get clogged and very difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that I receive many more cuts than my previous razor, Gilette&#x27;s Mach 3. Although the replacement blades for the Mach 3 are obscenely expensive, it at least gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the fusion proglide to compare, and I think the proglide gives a smoother shave and has the extra edging blade. However, this one is cheaper and the cartridges are also cheaper. Overall, I guess it comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Bent metal corners actually scratch my face. Bought refills and they were no better. Much shorter life than quattro blades.</li>
            <li> I only use razors to shave my head, so I can&#x27;t comment on face shaving. I started out using Gillette Fusion, but when I realized how expensive the replacement blades were, I started looking for alternatives. I tried the Hydro 5, and can honestly say I like it a lot- it feels good and the shave is excellent, not to mention the blades cost nearly half as much as the Fusions. And I&#x27;ve heard the blades last a lot longer too, though I can&#x27;t confirm yet. If you&#x27;re a Fusion user, do yourself a favor and try the Hydro5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still using the Hydro5, but I have cut myself a few times with it which is funny because I never cut myself with the Fusion. Still sticking with it, though. The blade has lasted about 6 months and is still going, shaving head usually about 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I find the shave to be as comfortable as any Gillette razor I have used.  The moisturizing strips were outstanding.  The handle was bulky and hard to maneuver.  The trimmer was adequate.  I feel with a different handle this would be a superior razor.</li>
            <li> My son did not like this razor--apparently, the more blades a razor has, the greater the chance it will cause bumps (barbae folliculitis).  He switched shaving creams, foams, aftershave but the thing that seems to have worked the best was switching to an older style razor that only has 2 blades, and using a salicylic acid product like Bump Patrol or Club Mend.</li>
            <li> I received my new Schick Hydro 5 Razor over the weekend free of charge through a promotion. I shaved half my face with my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor and the other half with the Schick Hydro 5 and boy could I see, feel, and experience the difference. The Schick Hydro 5 cut through my stubble like butter, I had no snags or any pulling sensations with the Schick Hydro. The shave was so close and smooth! This razor is perfect for me. I love the razor and will continue to use it. The Pro Glide went out with Mondays trash.</li>
            <li> This product did not disappoint!  It gave me my first blood-free shave.  And boy was it close!  I did not need to shave for a day and a half.  its smooth glide and unbelievable shave left my face happy and me smiling.</li>
            <li> Got the Schick Hydro 5 as a free sample;  tried it and it&#x27;s fabulous.  I have a trimmed beard, but still have to shave my neck &amp;  shape the beard.  This razor is smooth, feels great, and does a really great job.</li>
            <li> As a girl, I&#x27;ve been using this razor for leg shaving and will not go back to a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; razor ever again.</li>
            <li> This could be a good razor.  The handle is nice and feels well made.  My complaint is with the blades.  Whats with the excess amount of slimy stuff coming from the lubricant strip? When you shave with it, it just smears all over your face.  I will stick to the fusion pro glide.  There is a great shave.  I prefer the one blade on the top rather than the flip down thing on the hydro 5 too.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for more than 50 years, beginning with a classic Gillette single blade razor.  (This was the razor that lead to the mass production of the styptic pencil.)  Over the years I tried various razors.  I could never find an electric razor I liked.  When the latest razors became so expensive, especially for replacement blade cartridges, I began buying bulk, store-brand disposable razors.  A few months ago it occurred to me that I was getting frankly crappy shaves.  I began looking for an alternative and the Schick Hydro 5 was what I settled on.  After about two weeks, I am well satisfied.  The shave is very close with almost no effort.  No nicks or cuts at all.  The head of the razor is large compared with what I was using, so it took a bit of getting used to.  I am still learning how to shave around my moustache.  All in all, I think its worth a try and the price through Amazon, though not cheap, seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> I got this razor to shave my head because of some reviews here and on a few other sites. I used it for the first time this morning. It was the best head shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave, and I never once nicked myself, which is very rare, especially with a new razor. As an added bonus, the cartridge design is better than most, and the hair just washed right out of the cartridge, instead of having to be convinced to come out (which takes the form of me banging the cartridge against the side of the side a bunch of times. Because of this, my cartridges usually break before they get dull. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how long I can make one cartridge last by stropping and keeping the blades dry).</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the build and quality of this product</li>
            <li> Very good articuluo , curbio my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was using a Schick Quatro Titanium, prior to this purchase, which I horribly regret. The Quatro Titanium uses blades made by Wilkerson Sword in Germany. They are the best blades I have ever used in a cartridge razor. On a whim I picked this up at a local drug store. What a piece of garbage. In 20+ years of shaving I haven&#x27;t had a cartridge rip my face up like these. I have had some wounds so deep that I considered going to the hospital. Fortunately, I have a styptic stick lying around. I notice the blades in the Hydro are assembled in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from these or you will be a walking bandage and buying styptic sticks by the case load. Back to the GERMAN made Quatro Titanium for me. Schick can shove their Chinese garbage.</li>
            <li> I expected to love this razor based on reviews.  However, I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I was left with razor burn (something I never get), and a shave that wasn&#x27;t close.  I gave it a good try for a month or so, and then went back to the razors I was using.  Just not for me.</li>
            <li> based on my 50 years of shaving.  Likely the brand has little to do with it, but I happened to purchase this razor at Sam&#x27;s Club and that is all they had.  Nothing I have used has ever given me as comfortable and close of a shave as this does.  There is no close second!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the lubricant reservoir that folds back to allow you to see and shave under the nose and edge the sideburns perfectly.  Any razor that does not have this feature cannot allow you coverage under the nose like this.  Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed in this product in any way unless they have some hidden interest in one brand or another.....and I promise I do not.  Likely, Gillette makes a similar product that does just as well.  For the past two weeks since it was put in use, the Schick Hydro has provided by far the best shaving experience of my life.  Though the feeling may change, shaving daily has become far more than a necessary drudgery....something I never imagined could happen!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be another razor out there that can give a shave better than the Schick Hydro, but I know nothing about it.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and have been using this blade exclusively for the past 2 months.  I can now safely say that it&#x27;s been well worth it.  The blade guides effortlessly across my skin and provides a close shave yet has yet to cause any nicks that other razors sometimes provide.  I&#x27;m one of those guys who normally buy a pack of disposables and use them too long, but this blade is a cut above those (pun intended!) and was noticed on day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Gillette Fusion in the past, but stopped when I realized how expensive blades were and how comparable disposables were to the quality of the shave.  I have yet to buy another blade for this razor, though the time draws nigh.  If close to the price of disposables, I will have found a new blade to use for some time to come.</li>
            <li> I have used many disposables but I happened to get this from BzzAgent as a free sample. I took it to India on a trip and in that hot, humid weather, I got amazing shaves every day. The hydrating gel kept my skin soft and supple and 5 blades eliminated any and all growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than other brands and will stick with this one for life.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor. Blades are a bit more expensive, but it shaves well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, she uses those blades for several years and likes them very much.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, nice package.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor. I will be buying the refills. I definitely recommended this product. My dad loves it also!</li>
            <li> My God, what a garbage product!  I just bought one of these horrible razors yesterday and had the absolute worst shaving experience in my life.  I have been shaving my head for 20 years now, so its not like one day I woke up and totally forgot how to shave or use a safety razor.  Besides that, I have never used a razor that cut and tore me the way this monstrosity did.  They talk about a gel resevoir...what gel? Where? It released nothing after wetting it.  The blades grabbed my skin and dug in. I wish I could link pictures, I would show everyone how badly this razor cut the back of my head open under normal wet shaving conditions. If the gel did anything at all, it numbed the pain and prevented me from realizing that I was flaying myself.  Previously, I had used the Schick Quattro for many years, but decided to try a new razor after realizing that the quality of the blades was deteriorating.  That should have been my first clue to get away from Schick entirely, but I decided to give the Hydro a shot anyway.  That was a painful mistake that the scars on my head are going to remind me of the rest of my life.  Stay away from this junk product.</li>
            <li> switched to this after many years with Venus . I liked it better right away. close shave, comfortable .</li>
            <li> Works fine and hard to find in the brick and mortar places.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I like the fact that you can move the lubricant side up and away to get a clean straight shave than flip it right back for a lubricated shave. Only negative thing is that after 3-4 uses the blades gets dull and isn&#x27;t as sharp compared to Gillette fusion longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the up side I can finally say my side burns are straight and not like a character from star trek.</li>
            <li> I typically shower without the light on.  One morning having grabbed the &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor&amp;#34; I hopped in the shower and shaved and thought &amp;#34;Wow!  This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34;  As I was drying my wife turned on the light and I had used the 3 Blade Razor.  I seriously doubt having used both for a few weeks now that there is any benefit to 3 vice 5 blades.  The 3 Blade Razor has a heavier handle which I prefer but they cut the same.</li>
            <li> Schick and Gillette... Hydro vs. Fusion.  I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\&quot; is very different between the 2 brands.  Prices are comparable.  I&#x27;m a big fan of both and the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor,  I usually get razor burn, no matter what I do, but with the Schick Hydro 5, it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li> First the good: Clean smooth shave, nice hydration from the hydrating gel reservoir. No irritation after shave. If you are a guy that shaves your chest, this blade is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the not so good:  I have a small face and I found this razor to be too big for me. I currently use a Mach 3 which is perfect for me. I also dry shave because, outside of my goatee, I don&#x27;t have much of a beard. This blade does not dry shave as well at all. I didn&#x27;t like the flip trimmer at all. I found no use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a good blade for the right face.</li>
