    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I tested mine a couple of times and was very happy that it worked the way the manual said it should work.</li>
            <li>Although, I must admit, I&#x27;m probably not doing it correctly, but the results are great!  </li>
            <li>The body and fullness it gives is EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for longer hair.</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>However the curler works great.</li>
            <li>: I liked that the gadget has very good safety features.</li>
            <li>I like a &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; on top of my head and this product does a wonderful job of creating just that!  </li>
            <li>and I liked the way my hair turned out after using...big, and bouncy!</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea...</li>
            <li>a good mix&lt;br /&gt;Barely</li>
            <li>She loved that it gave volume and curl to her hair.</li>
            <li>I requested this product because I was intrigued, but was delighted when it came in handy just a week after arrival.  </li>
            <li>But I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I liked how it worked with putting them in like a curling iron and then warming up</li>
            <li>The curlers are coated in some kind of velcro grabby fabric-stuff that I guess is supposed to hold the curlers in place without pins or anything.</li>
            <li>So I really liked knowing this device has them.</li>
            <li>; - they&#x27;re nice Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li>The sectioning  finger is a nice feature, as is the swivel</li>
            <li>I will definitely be happy to use this for a special event where I have the time to walk around in curlers before I go out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great device for a revamped look at the hot curlers your sister used to do.</li>
            <li>Remington is a favorite manufacturer of hair styling gadgets, and I&#x27;ve favored this company by purchasing their hot curlers for years.</li>
            <li>Eh, ok if you have help</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to use this more to get a better idea of things.</li>
            <li>and then most of your curl disappears.</li>
            <li>Just need more rollers.</li>
            <li>I love the curls.</li>
            <li>She does wish that it came with more curlers and it should have come with clips for the curlers.</li>
            <li>I would have like to see about twice as many rollers, at minimum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty handy with them.</li>
            <li>I think I would have liked this product if the rollers included (there are three each in two large sizes)</li>
            <li>With the roller on the device, it&#x27;s a huge thing to manipulate through hair.</li>
            <li>This was a Vine offering and came to me free.  </li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>so you really have to brush it out to make it look nice</li>
            <li>This is a great curler for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li>The wand was lightweight, but it felt like cheap plastic which would break</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, and this would easily take me an hour to get full curls using this.</li>
            <li>She finds it quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy as a good curling Iron, but longer lasting results.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that from the reviews I&#x27;ve read and from my own experiments, the hair really needs to be mostly or fully dry before using this product effectively.</li>
            <li>This was a great way to try out the wet set and get the results immediately.  </li>
            <li>Also, the device assumes you have a full menagerie of hair products like pins and clamps and</li>
            <li>The rollers then have to cool before you remove them.</li>
            <li>Not a bad idea at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the hairstyle for three shows now and get pretty consistent results every time, which is impressive since I have really no idea what I&#x27;m doing!  </li>
            <li>(I did put in some hair gel first before using the device and used spray, but I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product in my hair and this manual really suggested using a lot more than I&#x27;m comfortable with).</li>
            <li>(I did put in some hair gel first before using the device and used spray, but I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product in my hair and this manual really suggested using a lot more than I&#x27;m comfortable with).</li>
            <li>Ultimate Stylist Big and Bouncy is not the best hair curler we have used.</li>
            <li>I liked the design, but, for one reason or another, this didn&#x27;t work well with my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It would work much better on longer hair, although probably much more time consuming than either hot rollers or an actual curling iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I can see this working if you have hair that dries really quickly, and that isn&#x27;t cut a number of different lengths, some of which don&#x27;t play nice with the rest once subjected to a wind tunnel...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much product since I have fine hair, so my hair was simply freshly washed and conditioned.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I think it might be easier to get some tin cans and big bobby pins than to use this.</li>
            <li>but I think they just didn&#x27;t get warm enough.</li>
            <li>No Space taking box, and easy self application as well as high temperature.</li>
            <li>My wife has never used a curler before, so was pleasantly surprised with how quickly the curler warmed up and how easy to use it was.  </li>
            <li>When we tried, it detached right away when we tried to put it in our hair.</li>
            <li>On her hair it made nice big and loose curls which gave her hair volume, which she liked.  </li>
            <li>Velcro rollers also have a tendency to get tangled in hair, especially my fine hair, and after only a couple of uses, I can see several strands in the Velcro.</li>
            <li>Even with my relatively short, fine hair it seemed to take forever!</li>
            <li>I also tried placing the roller first and then inserting the dryer wand.</li>
            <li>I missed the detail about the hot air hair dryer (one swatch at a time).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to update later once I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many types of hot rollers over the decades, but never a product that only heated ONE curler at a time.</li>
            <li>I found it way too cumbersome to wrap the rollers around my hair while they&#x27;re harpooned on the wand, so I placed the rollers first then inserted the wand and turned on the heat.</li>
            <li>Stick to hot rollers if you are looking for curl.</li>
            <li>hot air blows OUT and away from your hair,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this product is suppose to be useful, efficient, or reasonable.</li>
            <li>first thing that struck me about the AS7500 was that it had two sizes of rollers-3 of each size.</li>
            <li>And even better, it totally worked!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Below are some thoughts that prevented me from giving this product a higher rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions that came with it weren&#x27;t very useful or clear.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think I get a lot better results from just blow-drying my hair in traditional pink foam curlers!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think I get a lot better results from just blow-drying my hair in traditional pink foam curlers!</li>
            <li>you have fine hair, and spritz it with a little hairspray, it might work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine hair</li>
            <li>The heating device does produce a good amount of heat at the higher setting, and dried the hair fairly quickly, but no advantage over a blow dryer and round brush, and much more troublesome and time-consuming.</li>
            <li>I think that with some patience and practice, I might be able to produce more satisfying results, but it&#x27;s just not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>But I note that the hot curlers and curling wands I purchased in the 70&#x27;s (when I had even more hair, much longer) were much sturdier than the things I&#x27;ve bought in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers lock one by one onto the central core of the device itself and you turn it on to get hot air blowing up through the center of the curlers, which presumably makes the curling power of the curlers more potent.</li>
            <li>rollers work well enough, but the way they are heated by a blast of hot air makes my (fairly fine, addmittedly) hair blow all over the place before it even has a chance of setting the wave.</li>
            <li>Having only one curler at a time means this would take forever even if it did work, it would have been nice to have several curlers and be able to move between them rather than having to do each section individually.  </li>
            <li>I have chin-length hair and tried this, but the rollers were too large for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; comes with 6 Velcro rollers - 3 large and 3 jumbo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are blessed with smooth hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily or if you can typically use velcro rollers without distress, then these may work great for you (although you may want a few extra rollers).</li>
            <li>If you want added body or very loose curls you can achieve that look faster and much more easily by buying some inexpensive Velcro rollers at the drugstore, curling big sections of your hair around the rollers and using your hair dryer for just a minute or two to heat them up.</li>
            <li>(I could, but it wasn&#x27;t very curly).</li>
            <li>spent the better part of a morning trying to make this work</li>
            <li>The curlers locked very well on the device core thing as well, just as it promised they should.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this thing, but as it is, it&#x27;s just not going to be something I ever use again now that this review is done.se, and I don&#x27;t, so</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this thing, but as it is, it&#x27;s just not going to be something I ever use again now that this review is done.</li>
            <li>she was in tears by the time they were all out and instead of having curls, she had a rat&#x27;s nest and STILL had straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The technique is more time consuming than traditional hot rollers, because you have hold each roller in place 15-20 seconds and allow the hot air to flow through before you release the roller and load the next one.  </li>
            <li>It comes with various size rollers, which while nice, aren&#x27;t sufficient enough for all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought that the product might be handy for travel and eliminate the need for a blow dryer, but the space required to pack all the rollers and heating unit (which does break down into 2 pieces) would likely take up more room than a dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many options out there -- hot rollers, curling irons, blow drying with a round brush -- that I don&#x27;t see any reason to choose this item.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to use it on damp hair, clip the big or not as big roller on the tip, roll your hair up in it and hold it with the warm air blowing over the whole thing, until, presumably it is set or nearly set.  </li>
            <li>Then you have the option of either leaving the roller in for the hair to finish drying, or let it dry completely and then move on to some more hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on my fine, wavy hair, which was fully dry but frizzy from air-drying and being in braids.  </li>
            <li>The direction of the airflow on the stylist points directly to the scalp, so while my head was uncomfortably hot my hair did not dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But mainly it just doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my own rollers on that patented wand.</li>
            <li>The air generated didn&#x27;t seem like it got very hot, but that might just be because it didn&#x27;t need to with application so close to the individual</li>
            <li>The curl really didn&#x27;t stay and I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>the curl that was there, went flat right</li>
            <li>I think a few more smaller ones and maybe another large one would have done the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the idea sounded really worth a try, the results from this styling tool were less than spectacular--unless you like a hot mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional Hair/makeup stylist in LA, and within minutes of demo on clients, 2 went onto Amazon and bought them!  </li>
            <li>There were not enough rollers included in the package (three large and three small) to really create a full head of layered waves, and this product seems to require a certain type of roller</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife thinking she&#x27;d really like a way to make quick easy curls in her hair, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>Overall it works more or less like</li>
            <li>The resulting curls were  fine, but not substantially different than the usual heat up all together hot curlers.  </li>
            <li>You get two sizes; one is fairly large and the other is extremely large.</li>
            <li>I never got far with it.</li>
            <li>I really like the Ultimate Stylist</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I occasionally style my hair with a blow dryer and round brush and thought this product might produce better results.</li>
            <li>Basically you take barely damp hair and wrap them around these velcro type rollers and turn on a hair dryer of sorts and stand there...holding it until you think you got the roller hot enough to curl the hair</li>
            <li>Jumbo hot rollers or a large barrel curling iron will also give you the look in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s a blow dryer with a central core that fits in the center of special curlers.</li>
            <li>People with shorter hair who just want to do one or two quick small areas, or who have all the tools needed to use this thing, might be better off with it, but even then I have trouble imagining why they&#x27;d use this product when other products do the job better and in way less time than this would.</li>

            <li>: First, it&#x27;s way louder than you&#x27;d expect and the core thingie got way hotter than I expected too.</li>
            <li>It is clearly not meant to do a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>It is clearly not meant to do a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>I felt this tool takes too much time to use on a daily basis, and the lack of a storage bag makes having a two part wand and 6 rollers to keep together a big nuisance.</li>
            <li>As is, if I could manage to get it to work properly, I&#x27;d imagine the whole &#x27;big and bouncy&#x27; mess would collapse as soon as I walked outdoors in my hot and humid neighborhood.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad little gadget to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I were a young teen with lots of time to fiddle with it, it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>(it was in the heat of summer, I could barely handle the heat at all)</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and not much talent for hair styling, so this seemed like it might be for me.</li>
            <li>It took my daughter&#x27;s long, smooth straight hair and after using it step by step as they describe and spraying on hair spray for some extra hold like they said, I waited for the rollers to cool down and tried to get them out of my poor daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hot air that seemed to blow out through the roller, instead blows out the end of the stying tool, in fact, it reminds me a little of something I saw someone using at the craft store to fast dry glue.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter with very long naturally straight hair who likes big bouncy waves sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Second, it really takes forrrreverrrr to dry hair.</li>
            <li>And the results were less than stellar.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned hot rollers, which would also do the job a lot faster and with way less tangles and snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned hot rollers, which would also do the job a lot faster and with way less tangles and snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i think this could only work for someone with thin hair, that isn&#x27;t too long to be effective.</li>
            <li>If you are tired of the over straitened look and want to go back to a more feminine glamorous look with minimum work, this could be the device for you.</li>
            <li>The Product works as advertised, but my hair is too short for it to have any real effect other than making it into poof-y &amp;#34;newscaster&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>Even so, it took a long time to get the rollers and air wand working as instructed and a longer time to get the hair anywhere near drying.  </li>
            <li>The rollers got stuck in her hair, ripped some hair our of her head, the hair didn&#x27;t dry completely and</li>
            <li>My hair is not long enough to test it (nor would I do so!)</li>
            <li>So if you previously blew your hair dry, the additional hot air blasts on the hair and scalp seem like overkill, leading to damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a problem for really long hair, or fine hair, but - no matter how careful I am - my hair still gets snagged up in the curlers.</li>

            <li> Another thing is that from the reviews I&#x27;ve read and from my own experiments, the hair really needs to be mostly or fully dry before using this product effectively.</li>
            <li> This was a great way to try out the wet set and get the results immediately.  </li>
            <li> Also, the device assumes you have a full menagerie of hair products like pins and clamps and</li>
            <li> The rollers then have to cool before you remove them.</li>
            <li> Not a bad idea at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the hairstyle for three shows now and get pretty consistent results every time, which is impressive since I have really no idea what I&#x27;m doing!  </li>
            <li> (I did put in some hair gel first before using the device and used spray, but I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product in my hair and this manual really suggested using a lot more than I&#x27;m comfortable with).</li>

            <li> Ultimate Stylist Big and Bouncy is not the best hair curler we have used.</li>
            <li> I liked the design, but, for one reason or another, this didn&#x27;t work well with my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It would work much better on longer hair, although probably much more time consuming than either hot rollers or an actual curling iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can see this working if you have hair that dries really quickly, and that isn&#x27;t cut a number of different lengths, some of which don&#x27;t play nice with the rest once subjected to a wind tunnel...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much product since I have fine hair, so my hair was simply freshly washed and conditioned.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I think it might be easier to get some tin cans and big bobby pins than to use this.</li>
            <li> but I think they just didn&#x27;t get warm enough.</li>
            <li> No Space taking box, and easy self application as well as high temperature.</li>
            <li> My wife has never used a curler before, so was pleasantly surprised with how quickly the curler warmed up and how easy to use it was.  </li>
            <li> When we tried, it detached right away when we tried to put it in our hair.</li>
            <li> On her hair it made nice big and loose curls which gave her hair volume, which she liked.  </li>
            <li> Velcro rollers also have a tendency to get tangled in hair, especially my fine hair, and after only a couple of uses, I can see several strands in the Velcro.</li>
            <li> Even with my relatively short, fine hair it seemed to take forever!</li>
            <li> I also tried placing the roller first and then inserting the dryer wand.</li>
            <li> I missed the detail about the hot air hair dryer (one swatch at a time).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update later once I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of hot rollers over the decades, but never a product that only heated ONE curler at a time.</li>
            <li> I found it way too cumbersome to wrap the rollers around my hair while they&#x27;re harpooned on the wand, so I placed the rollers first then inserted the wand and turned on the heat.</li>
            <li> Stick to hot rollers if you are looking for curl.</li>
            <li> hot air blows OUT and away from your hair,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product is suppose to be useful, efficient, or reasonable.</li>
            <li> first thing that struck me about the AS7500 was that it had two sizes of rollers-3 of each size.</li>
            <li> And even better, it totally worked!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Below are some thoughts that prevented me from giving this product a higher rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with it weren&#x27;t very useful or clear.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think I get a lot better results from just blow-drying my hair in traditional pink foam curlers!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think I get a lot better results from just blow-drying my hair in traditional pink foam curlers!</li>
            <li> you have fine hair, and spritz it with a little hairspray, it might work better for you.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine hair</li>
            <li> The heating device does produce a good amount of heat at the higher setting, and dried the hair fairly quickly, but no advantage over a blow dryer and round brush, and much more troublesome and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I think that with some patience and practice, I might be able to produce more satisfying results, but it&#x27;s just not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> But I note that the hot curlers and curling wands I purchased in the 70&#x27;s (when I had even more hair, much longer) were much sturdier than the things I&#x27;ve bought in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curlers lock one by one onto the central core of the device itself and you turn it on to get hot air blowing up through the center of the curlers, which presumably makes the curling power of the curlers more potent.</li>
            <li> rollers work well enough, but the way they are heated by a blast of hot air makes my (fairly fine, addmittedly) hair blow all over the place before it even has a chance of setting the wave.</li>
            <li> Having only one curler at a time means this would take forever even if it did work, it would have been nice to have several curlers and be able to move between them rather than having to do each section individually.  </li>
            <li> I have chin-length hair and tried this, but the rollers were too large for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; comes with 6 Velcro rollers - 3 large and 3 jumbo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are blessed with smooth hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily or if you can typically use velcro rollers without distress, then these may work great for you (although you may want a few extra rollers).</li>
            <li> If you want added body or very loose curls you can achieve that look faster and much more easily by buying some inexpensive Velcro rollers at the drugstore, curling big sections of your hair around the rollers and using your hair dryer for just a minute or two to heat them up.</li>
            <li> (I could, but it wasn&#x27;t very curly).</li>
            <li> spent the better part of a morning trying to make this work</li>
            <li> The curlers locked very well on the device core thing as well, just as it promised they should.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing, but as it is, it&#x27;s just not going to be something I ever use again now that this review is done.se, and I don&#x27;t, so</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this thing, but as it is, it&#x27;s just not going to be something I ever use again now that this review is done.</li>
            <li> she was in tears by the time they were all out and instead of having curls, she had a rat&#x27;s nest and STILL had straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The technique is more time consuming than traditional hot rollers, because you have hold each roller in place 15-20 seconds and allow the hot air to flow through before you release the roller and load the next one.  </li>
            <li> It comes with various size rollers, which while nice, aren&#x27;t sufficient enough for all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought that the product might be handy for travel and eliminate the need for a blow dryer, but the space required to pack all the rollers and heating unit (which does break down into 2 pieces) would likely take up more room than a dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many options out there -- hot rollers, curling irons, blow drying with a round brush -- that I don&#x27;t see any reason to choose this item.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use it on damp hair, clip the big or not as big roller on the tip, roll your hair up in it and hold it with the warm air blowing over the whole thing, until, presumably it is set or nearly set.  </li>
            <li> Then you have the option of either leaving the roller in for the hair to finish drying, or let it dry completely and then move on to some more hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried this on my fine, wavy hair, which was fully dry but frizzy from air-drying and being in braids.  </li>
            <li> The direction of the airflow on the stylist points directly to the scalp, so while my head was uncomfortably hot my hair did not dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But mainly it just doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my own rollers on that patented wand.</li>
            <li> The air generated didn&#x27;t seem like it got very hot, but that might just be because it didn&#x27;t need to with application so close to the individual</li>
            <li> The curl really didn&#x27;t stay and I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> the curl that was there, went flat right</li>
            <li> I think a few more smaller ones and maybe another large one would have done the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the idea sounded really worth a try, the results from this styling tool were less than spectacular--unless you like a hot mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional Hair/makeup stylist in LA, and within minutes of demo on clients, 2 went onto Amazon and bought them!  </li>
            <li> There were not enough rollers included in the package (three large and three small) to really create a full head of layered waves, and this product seems to require a certain type of roller</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife thinking she&#x27;d really like a way to make quick easy curls in her hair, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Overall it works more or less like</li>
            <li> The resulting curls were  fine, but not substantially different than the usual heat up all together hot curlers.  </li>
            <li> You get two sizes; one is fairly large and the other is extremely large.</li>
            <li> I never got far with it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Ultimate Stylist</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I occasionally style my hair with a blow dryer and round brush and thought this product might produce better results.</li>
            <li> Basically you take barely damp hair and wrap them around these velcro type rollers and turn on a hair dryer of sorts and stand there...holding it until you think you got the roller hot enough to curl the hair</li>
            <li> Jumbo hot rollers or a large barrel curling iron will also give you the look in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s a blow dryer with a central core that fits in the center of special curlers.</li>
            <li> People with shorter hair who just want to do one or two quick small areas, or who have all the tools needed to use this thing, might be better off with it, but even then I have trouble imagining why they&#x27;d use this product when other products do the job better and in way less time than this would.</li>

            <li> : First, it&#x27;s way louder than you&#x27;d expect and the core thingie got way hotter than I expected too.</li>
            <li> It is clearly not meant to do a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> It is clearly not meant to do a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> I felt this tool takes too much time to use on a daily basis, and the lack of a storage bag makes having a two part wand and 6 rollers to keep together a big nuisance.</li>
            <li> As is, if I could manage to get it to work properly, I&#x27;d imagine the whole &#x27;big and bouncy&#x27; mess would collapse as soon as I walked outdoors in my hot and humid neighborhood.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad little gadget to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I were a young teen with lots of time to fiddle with it, it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> (it was in the heat of summer, I could barely handle the heat at all)</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and not much talent for hair styling, so this seemed like it might be for me.</li>
            <li> It took my daughter&#x27;s long, smooth straight hair and after using it step by step as they describe and spraying on hair spray for some extra hold like they said, I waited for the rollers to cool down and tried to get them out of my poor daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hot air that seemed to blow out through the roller, instead blows out the end of the stying tool, in fact, it reminds me a little of something I saw someone using at the craft store to fast dry glue.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter with very long naturally straight hair who likes big bouncy waves sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Second, it really takes forrrreverrrr to dry hair.</li>
            <li> And the results were less than stellar.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned hot rollers, which would also do the job a lot faster and with way less tangles and snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned hot rollers, which would also do the job a lot faster and with way less tangles and snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think this could only work for someone with thin hair, that isn&#x27;t too long to be effective.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of the over straitened look and want to go back to a more feminine glamorous look with minimum work, this could be the device for you.</li>
            <li> The Product works as advertised, but my hair is too short for it to have any real effect other than making it into poof-y &amp;#34;newscaster&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Even so, it took a long time to get the rollers and air wand working as instructed and a longer time to get the hair anywhere near drying.  </li>
            <li> The rollers got stuck in her hair, ripped some hair our of her head, the hair didn&#x27;t dry completely and</li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough to test it (nor would I do so!)</li>
            <li> So if you previously blew your hair dry, the additional hot air blasts on the hair and scalp seem like overkill, leading to damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a problem for really long hair, or fine hair, but - no matter how careful I am - my hair still gets snagged up in the curlers.</li>
            <li> I may not have left it warming long enough</li>
            <li> Curling irons, flat irons, electric rollers, Velcro...</li>
            <li> BUT, my wife and daughter both have long blonde hair (below their shoulders), and here is what they say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was flat and lacked any bounce or volume.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the stylist on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The curler also has a blow dryer to dry as it curls, which is the only part that works.</li>
            <li> As I have coarse, porous hair, and limited patience, this did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so far, all I got was flat and a little bit staticky</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it to style my hair, I’m not sure what the advantage of the Remington hot air tool has over other styling options.</li>
            <li> even gave it a wave on my hair with a tiny, tiny little section which then needs to be brushed because of the tangles &#x3D;</li>
            <li> NOT for long of tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> You can only use the heat and drying capacity of the device itself on ONE curler at a time--rather than the wide application of both you get with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> You can only use the heat and drying capacity of the device itself on ONE curler at a time--rather than the wide application of both you get with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> it just takes too long.</li>
            <li> unless this thing came with 15 rollers, its going to take way too long to use.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on three in the center and one on each side.  </li>
            <li> Once I got the two pieces of the wand together, I then discovered that when I tried to affix the  roller to the wand,  the sectioning tool on the end kept going into the side vent holes on the end of the roller instead of the larger center hole for which it was intended.  </li>
            <li> Someone with long hair has to curl their hair in sections, step by step making it a long process.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a great product for hair since the air was neither hot enough nor focused on the hair but on the air around your head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers are either too big or too small, and there are not enough in the package to roll up an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time or patience dry and style my hair section by section.</li>
            <li> you stick a roller on the end, roll your hair up, let it heat your hair to dry it, then let it set...</li>
            <li> The large rollers are really big and useless in my chin-length hair, so there are only three that I can use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of hair I have and how slowly the unit dried my actual hair when in the curlers, it would take me all morning to get just dry hair, leaving aside the whole question of curls/waves.</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of hair I have and how slowly the unit dried my actual hair when in the curlers, it would take me all morning to get just dry hair, leaving aside the whole question of curls/waves.</li>
            <li> Lastly, there&#x27;s just the fact that this is, in the end, just a fancier way of putting your hair in curlers, which we might have already done with less time involved, making the product a bit redundant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With her very long and thick hair she can get the soft curls</li>
            <li> Lots of pictures of how it is meant to work, but not much instruction.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got my hair out of the curler, whatever limp sort-of-waves I might have gotten were gone--I was left with frizzy tangles that took forever to unsnarl.</li>
            <li> Also, it gives you just a few curlers, like 3 of each size (and you can&#x27;t use regular curlers or hot-rollers with it, so</li>
            <li> Also, it gives you just a few curlers, like 3 of each size (and you can&#x27;t use regular curlers or hot-rollers with it, so</li>
            <li> loud and SLOW and obnoxious&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I had blown my hair about 95% dry; it was slightly damp at the roots.</li>
            <li> Our experience is that it always just resulted in straight hair with a little bit of a weak curl and a flippy end.</li>
            <li> For rollers on the side, the hot air was really uncomfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> There are a small number of the rollers, but they&#x27;re BIG.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have problems with frizz or getting the rollers stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> She was reluctant to even try it until the review for the vine was due.</li>
            <li> Uneven, no real curl to speak of, takes forever, just a not very well designed and tested product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but I assumed it would be faster and involve less time with blood draining to my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward, and you don&#x27;t have enough rollers included, the result is...not impressive, and (worst of all)</li>
            <li> They did add a bit of volume to my hair, but to me the results were not worth the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all done around her head in less than 45min.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair a mess of tangles&lt;</li>
            <li> Hot air blowing through the end of the want helped mold the wave, and the cold air helps set it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve blown up a few hair dryers in my day and it is scary sometimes to start using a new one!</li>
            <li> My luck with wet sets in the past has been poor, and it&#x27;s such a commitment to find out it doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> What a waste of two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me another few minutes to figure how to lock the roller on to the wand so that it would work as intended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble rolling up my hair, using the heating device or unrolling the hair, but the results were not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> That said, the product does perform as promised and is lightweight enough so your arm/hand doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> I found that this was really hard to use and not worth the time and trouble.</li>
            <li> This just plain didn&#x27;t work, and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter the condition of the hair.  </li>
            <li> all that work and not one curl, maybe a VERY slight wave</li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to get the hang of inserting and releasing the rollers, and was a little awkward gathering the ends of my hair onto the roller, but WOW.  </li>
            <li> Even if you can get a slight wave out of it with VERY small sections of hair (think 2 hours of curling miniscule little sections), it also gets tangled up</li>
            <li> Maybe I was coming into it with the wrong expectations, especially given that I now don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to do 100% of a person&#x27;s hair.</li>

            <li> Since I do not have an asymmetrical hair style, I was not sure how to distribute them on my head.</li>
            <li> It dried our hair, but did not curl our hair at all!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who would use it or why!&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I heat up the rollers, place them onto the crown of my head, leave them there for a very few minutes and then remove them.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time product, I can&#x27;t believe someone at Remington got the greenlight to go ahead with this ridiculous contraption.</li>
            <li> chief complaint is, it came with rather sketchy instructions.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this contraption is awkward to use and manages to complicate what should be a simple process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> NOT for long of tangle prone hair. Velcro rollers are, once again, a big &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; for hair that tangles easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is allllllll kinds of wrong.  It&#x27;s awkward, and you don&#x27;t have enough rollers included, the result is...not impressive, and (worst of all) I can almost guarantee it will get stuck in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are blessed with smooth hair that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily or if you can typically use velcro rollers without distress, then these may work great for you (although you may want a few extra rollers).</li>
            <li> This was weird to me and complicated. It&#x27;s a newer version of the heated electric rollers... Eh, ok if you have help</li>
            <li> I found that this was really hard to use and not worth the time and trouble. With the roller on the device, it&#x27;s a huge thing to manipulate through hair. Then your thumb has to find the on/off and release switches, too. UGH! I also tried placing the roller first and then inserting the dryer wand. That was just as difficult since it was hard to align the end with the hole in the roller and, of course, looking in the mirror didn&#x27;t help. For rollers on the side, the hot air was really uncomfortable on my face. I don&#x27;t use much product since I have fine hair, so my hair was simply freshly washed and conditioned. The curl really didn&#x27;t stay and I have naturally curly hair. Velcro rollers also have a tendency to get tangled in hair, especially my fine hair, and after only a couple of uses, I can see several strands in the Velcro. The large rollers are really big and useless in my chin-length hair, so there are only three that I can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many options out there -- hot rollers, curling irons, blow drying with a round brush -- that I don&#x27;t see any reason to choose this item.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I&#x27;m hoping some of the problems with this gizmo are my problems.  But honestly, I think it might be easier to get some tin cans and big bobby pins than to use this. It comes with synthetic versions of the tin cans we used to us for &#x27;big and bouncy hair.&#x27;  But the weirdest aspect of this product is it&#x27;s forced air feature.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it on damp hair, clip the big or not as big roller on the tip, roll your hair up in it and hold it with the warm air blowing over the whole thing, until, presumably it is set or nearly set.  Then you have the option of either leaving the roller in for the hair to finish drying, or let it dry completely and then move on to some more hair.  There are a small number of the rollers, but they&#x27;re BIG.  Even so, it took a long time to get the rollers and air wand working as instructed and a longer time to get the hair anywhere near drying.  As I have coarse, porous hair, and limited patience, this did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, and spritz it with a little hairspray, it might work better for you.  Remington is a favorite manufacturer of hair styling gadgets, and I&#x27;ve favored this company by purchasing their hot curlers for years. But I note that the hot curlers and curling wands I purchased in the 70&#x27;s (when I had even more hair, much longer) were much sturdier than the things I&#x27;ve bought in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chief complaint is, it came with rather sketchy instructions.  Lots of pictures of how it is meant to work, but not much instruction.  This was a Vine offering and came to me free.  I missed the detail about the hot air hair dryer (one swatch at a time).  Had I bought this, I would have returned it.  I don&#x27;t have time or patience dry and style my hair section by section. Maybe if I were a young teen with lots of time to fiddle with it, it would work for me.  As is, if I could manage to get it to work properly, I&#x27;d imagine the whole &#x27;big and bouncy&#x27; mess would collapse as soon as I walked outdoors in my hot and humid neighborhood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of rollers because it makes the curls last longer (and they are tighter) but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel like the curls lasted longer at all with this. In fact, my husband said that he couldn&#x27;t tell I&#x27;d curled it (I could, but it wasn&#x27;t very curly). I liked how it worked with putting them in like a curling iron and then warming up but I think they just didn&#x27;t get warm enough. I may not have left it warming long enough (it was in the heat of summer, I could barely handle the heat at all) so I&#x27;ll take some blame. I&#x27;ll have to use this more to get a better idea of things. You definitely want to use product to help though, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. I&#x27;ll try to update later once I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why they decided to move forward with the development of this product. I&#x27;ve used many types of hot rollers over the decades, but never a product that only heated ONE curler at a time. Seriously? Even with my relatively short, fine hair it seemed to take forever! And the results were less than stellar. Pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for longer hair. I have chin-length hair and tried this, but the rollers were too large for me.  I passed it along to a friend with shoulder-length hair and she loves it! I think I would have liked this product if the rollers included (there are three each in two large sizes) had been just a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> What a waste of two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the better part of a morning trying to make this work and so far, all I got was flat and a little bit staticky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot air that seemed to blow out through the roller, instead blows out the end of the stying tool, in fact, it reminds me a little of something I saw someone using at the craft store to fast dry glue.  Definitely not a great product for hair since the air was neither hot enough nor focused on the hair but on the air around your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours of fussing, trying to get this to work I threw my hands up in frustration.  What a waste of time product, I can&#x27;t believe someone at Remington got the greenlight to go ahead with this ridiculous contraption.</li>
            <li> Not a bad idea at all. Basically it&#x27;s a blow dryer with a central core that fits in the center of special curlers. You get two sizes; one is fairly large and the other is extremely large. But it&#x27;s supposed to make big curls/waves, so I&#x27;m not considering the curler size a problem for review purposes. The curlers are coated in some kind of velcro grabby fabric-stuff that I guess is supposed to hold the curlers in place without pins or anything.The curlers lock one by one onto the central core of the device itself and you turn it on to get hot air blowing up through the center of the curlers, which presumably makes the curling power of the curlers more potent. Then you take the curlers out and have bouncy waves, in theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: I liked that the gadget has very good safety features. I&#x27;ve blown up a few hair dryers in my day and it is scary sometimes to start using a new one! So I really liked knowing this device has them. I tested mine a couple of times and was very happy that it worked the way the manual said it should work. The curlers locked very well on the device core thing as well, just as it promised they should. Overall it works more or less like the manual says it should. The air generated didn&#x27;t seem like it got very hot, but that might just be because it didn&#x27;t need to with application so close to the individual curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: First, it&#x27;s way louder than you&#x27;d expect and the core thingie got way hotter than I expected too. Second, it really takes forrrreverrrr to dry hair. But mainly it just doesn&#x27;t do what it promises. I have very long, very fine hair and when I tried to use the curlers, my hair snarled all over their velcro-like covering. I never got far with it. By the time I got my hair out of the curler, whatever limp sort-of-waves I might have gotten were gone--I was left with frizzy tangles that took forever to unsnarl. Also, the device assumes you have a full menagerie of hair products like pins and clamps and whatever else, and I don&#x27;t, so maybe that was part of the problem (I did put in some hair gel first before using the device and used spray, but I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product in my hair and this manual really suggested using a lot more than I&#x27;m comfortable with). Honestly, I think I get a lot better results from just blow-drying my hair in traditional pink foam curlers! Also, it gives you just a few curlers, like 3 of each size (and you can&#x27;t use regular curlers or hot-rollers with it, so if you lose them or break them, that&#x27;s it). Considering the amount of hair I have and how slowly the unit dried my actual hair when in the curlers, it would take me all morning to get just dry hair, leaving aside the whole question of curls/waves. It is clearly not meant to do a whole head of hair. You can only use the heat and drying capacity of the device itself on ONE curler at a time--rather than the wide application of both you get with a blow dryer. Others have mentioned hot rollers, which would also do the job a lot faster and with way less tangles and snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad idea, but such a terrible execution. Maybe I was coming into it with the wrong expectations, especially given that I now don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to do 100% of a person&#x27;s hair. People with shorter hair who just want to do one or two quick small areas, or who have all the tools needed to use this thing, might be better off with it, but even then I have trouble imagining why they&#x27;d use this product when other products do the job better and in way less time than this would. I really wanted to like this thing, but as it is, it&#x27;s just not going to be something I ever use again now that this review is done.se, and I don&#x27;t, so maybe that was part of the problem (I did put in some hair gel first before using the device and used spray, but I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product in my hair and this manual really suggested using a lot more than I&#x27;m comfortable with).

            <li> Great device for a revamped look at the hot curlers your sister used to do. No Space taking box, and easy self application as well as high temperature. Not as easy as a good curling Iron, but longer lasting results. If you are tired of the over straitened look and want to go back to a more feminine glamorous look with minimum work, this could be the device for you.</li>
            <li> I like to experiment with hair styling tools and I&#x27;m pretty handy with them. Curling irons, flat irons, electric rollers, Velcro...you name it, I&#x27;ve used it. That being said, this contraption is awkward to use and manages to complicate what should be a simple process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; comes with 6 Velcro rollers - 3 large and 3 jumbo. I found it way too cumbersome to wrap the rollers around my hair while they&#x27;re harpooned on the wand, so I placed the rollers first then inserted the wand and turned on the heat. Even though my hair is thick, the rollers didn&#x27;t stay in place so I had to shore them up with some clips I had on hand. Once the rollers cooled I removed them. They did add a bit of volume to my hair, but to me the results were not worth the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions you can use this on damp hair, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case at all. I had blown my hair about 95% dry; it was slightly damp at the roots. The direction of the airflow on the stylist points directly to the scalp, so while my head was uncomfortably hot my hair did not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. If you want added body or very loose curls you can achieve that look faster and much more easily by buying some inexpensive Velcro rollers at the drugstore, curling big sections of your hair around the rollers and using your hair dryer for just a minute or two to heat them up. Jumbo hot rollers or a large barrel curling iron will also give you the look in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because the rollers can be used (with roller clips) without the &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34; - they&#x27;re nice Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> I really like the Ultimate Stylist Big and Bouncy.  Although, I must admit, I&#x27;m probably not doing it correctly, but the results are great!  I like a &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; on top of my head and this product does a wonderful job of creating just that!  I heat up the rollers, place them onto the crown of my head, leave them there for a very few minutes and then remove them.  It&#x27;s quite easy.  Hair is smooth and silky.  I have only tried the stylist on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a problem for really long hair, or fine hair, but - no matter how careful I am - my hair still gets snagged up in the curlers. It&#x27;s a good idea...I liked the design, but, for one reason or another, this didn&#x27;t work well with my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This just plain didn&#x27;t work, and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter the condition of the hair.  Having only one curler at a time means this would take forever even if it did work, it would have been nice to have several curlers and be able to move between them rather than having to do each section individually.  Our experience is that it always just resulted in straight hair with a little bit of a weak curl and a flippy end. Uneven, no real curl to speak of, takes forever, just a not very well designed and tested product. Really disappointing overall.</li>
            <li> Well, this did not work for me.  It is awkward to use and does not product the curl that is promised.  Stick to hot rollers if you are looking for curl.</li>
            <li> My wife has never used a curler before, so was pleasantly surprised with how quickly the curler warmed up and how easy to use it was.  On her hair it made nice big and loose curls which gave her hair volume, which she liked.  Considering the low price it the volumizing effect was noticeable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this curler went through any testing before selling it. I just can&#x27;t fathom WHAT they were thinking.  It took my daughter&#x27;s long, smooth straight hair and after using it step by step as they describe and spraying on hair spray for some extra hold like they said, I waited for the rollers to cool down and tried to get them out of my poor daughter&#x27;s hair. I was so mad... she was in tears by the time they were all out and instead of having curls, she had a rat&#x27;s nest and STILL had straight hair.  The biggest problem is the curlers... they are made up of the fishhook velcro hooks and I should have thought of that before putting in my daughter&#x27;s hair. But even then it doesn&#x27;t work! I couldnt&#x27; believe it... all that work and not one curl, maybe a VERY slight wave and that was it!  I think this was invented by some man who has a deep anger at women! LOL  Even if you can get a slight wave out of it with VERY small sections of hair (think 2 hours of curling miniscule little sections), it also gets tangled up so you really have to brush it out to make it look nice and then most of your curl disappears. HORRIBLE and I&#x27;m MAD they put my daughter through that. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good gift for the woman in your life that you HATE and want to punish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair a mess of tangles&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t curl... hot air blows OUT and away from your hair, stupid design&lt;br /&gt;Velcro hook and long women&#x27;s hair... not a good mix&lt;br /&gt;Barely even gave it a wave on my hair with a tiny, tiny little section which then needs to be brushed because of the tangles &#x3D; no wave&lt;br /&gt;Super loud and SLOW and obnoxious&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS FOR YOUR LIFE!</li>
            <li> You have to have SKILLS to work this machine.. But I LOVE IT! I&#x27;m a professional Hair/makeup stylist in LA, and within minutes of demo on clients, 2 went onto Amazon and bought them!  The body and fullness it gives is EXCELLENT!! Just need more rollers. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> It took my awhile to work with it well.I love the curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t understand how this product is suppose to be useful, efficient, or reasonable. I have a lot of hair, and this would easily take me an hour to get full curls using this. you stick a roller on the end, roll your hair up, let it heat your hair to dry it, then let it set...it just takes too long. unless this thing came with 15 rollers, its going to take way too long to use. i think this could only work for someone with thin hair, that isn&#x27;t too long to be effective. not me basically.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by Lynn Holland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me about the AS7500 was that it had two sizes of rollers-3 of each size. Since I do not have an asymmetrical hair style, I was not sure how to distribute them on my head. I finally settled on three in the center and one on each side.  Once I got the two pieces of the wand together, I then discovered that when I tried to affix the  roller to the wand,  the sectioning tool on the end kept going into the side vent holes on the end of the roller instead of the larger center hole for which it was intended.  It took me another few minutes to figure how to lock the roller on to the wand so that it would work as intended. The sectioning  finger is a nice feature, as is the swivel cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it to style my hair, I’m not sure what the advantage of the Remington hot air tool has over other styling options. The technique is more time consuming than traditional hot rollers, because you have hold each roller in place 15-20 seconds and allow the hot air to flow through before you release the roller and load the next one.  The rollers then have to cool before you remove them. Since the 6 rollers weren’t enough to curl all my hair at one time, the process had to be repeated. The resulting curls were  fine, but not substantially different than the usual heat up all together hot curlers.  I felt this tool takes too much time to use on a daily basis, and the lack of a storage bag makes having a two part wand and 6 rollers to keep together a big nuisance.</li>
            <li> I requested this product because I was intrigued, but was delighted when it came in handy just a week after arrival.  I am doing a play set in 1969 and needed a vintage big-hair wet-set look.  My luck with wet sets in the past has been poor, and it&#x27;s such a commitment to find out it doesn&#x27;t work!  This was a great way to try out the wet set and get the results immediately.  And even better, it totally worked!  I&#x27;ve done the hairstyle for three shows now and get pretty consistent results every time, which is impressive since I have really no idea what I&#x27;m doing!  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what else I can do with this, and will definitely consider purchasing additional size rollers if that is an option.</li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough to test it (nor would I do so!) - BUT, my wife and daughter both have long blonde hair (below their shoulders), and here is what they say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Stylist Big and Bouncy is not the best hair curler we have used. When we tried, it detached right away when we tried to put it in our hair. The curlers do not stay in the hair at all (they fall out as soon as you put them in). The curler also has a blow dryer to dry as it curls, which is the only part that works. It dried our hair, but did not curl our hair at all!  This hair curler did not work at all for us.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I occasionally style my hair with a blow dryer and round brush and thought this product might produce better results. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. The rollers are either too big or too small, and there are not enough in the package to roll up an entire head of hair. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble rolling up my hair, using the heating device or unrolling the hair, but the results were not satisfactory. My hair was flat and lacked any bounce or volume. The heating device does produce a good amount of heat at the higher setting, and dried the hair fairly quickly, but no advantage over a blow dryer and round brush, and much more troublesome and time-consuming. Initially, I thought that the product might be handy for travel and eliminate the need for a blow dryer, but the space required to pack all the rollers and heating unit (which does break down into 2 pieces) would likely take up more room than a dryer and brush. Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have problems with frizz or getting the rollers stuck in my hair. I think that with some patience and practice, I might be able to produce more satisfying results, but it&#x27;s just not worth the trouble. Save your money.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this item for its quality. She loved that it gave volume and curl to her hair. She does wish that it came with more curlers and it should have come with clips for the curlers. This is a great curler for someone with short hair. Someone with long hair has to curl their hair in sections, step by step making it a long process. However the curler works great.</li>
            <li> The Product works as advertised, but my hair is too short for it to have any real effect other than making it into poof-y &amp;#34;newscaster&amp;#34; hair. (my hair is just above my shoulders) It would work much better on longer hair, although probably much more time consuming than either hot rollers or an actual curling iron.</li>
            <li> While the idea sounded really worth a try, the results from this styling tool were less than spectacular--unless you like a hot mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers work well enough, but the way they are heated by a blast of hot air makes my (fairly fine, addmittedly) hair blow all over the place before it even has a chance of setting the wave. Also, it&#x27;s really tiresome holding that thing up there to heat the hair on the roller. I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but I assumed it would be faster and involve less time with blood draining to my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can see this working if you have hair that dries really quickly, and that isn&#x27;t cut a number of different lengths, some of which don&#x27;t play nice with the rest once subjected to a wind tunnel... I&#x27;ll stick with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter with very long naturally straight hair who likes big bouncy waves sometimes.  She finds it quick and easy to use.  With her very long and thick hair she can get the soft curls all done around her head in less than 45min.  It hasn&#x27;t caused damage to her hair and she likes using it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife thinking she&#x27;d really like a way to make quick easy curls in her hair, boy was I wrong. She was reluctant to even try it until the review for the vine was due. The instructions that came with it weren&#x27;t very useful or clear. Basically you take barely damp hair and wrap them around these velcro type rollers and turn on a hair dryer of sorts and stand there...holding it until you think you got the roller hot enough to curl the hair then you &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; the curler and it supposedly stays in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;What happened to my wife was she rolled the curlers, stood there holding the thing, then let the curlers in her hair for another 10 minutes before trying to take them out. The rollers got stuck in her hair, ripped some hair our of her head, the hair didn&#x27;t dry completely and the curl that was there, went flat right away.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a nightmare! I&#x27;m not sure who would use it or why!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and not much talent for hair styling, so this seemed like it might be for me. It comes with various size rollers, which while nice, aren&#x27;t sufficient enough for all of my hair. I would have like to see about twice as many rollers, at minimum. That said, the product does perform as promised and is lightweight enough so your arm/hand doesn&#x27;t get tired. Overall not a bad little gadget to have on hand.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend helped with this product review. I tried this on my fine, wavy hair, which was fully dry but frizzy from air-drying and being in braids.  It took me a few minutes to get the hang of inserting and releasing the rollers, and was a little awkward gathering the ends of my hair onto the roller, but WOW.  Hot air blowing through the end of the want helped mold the wave, and the cold air helps set it.  I will definitely be happy to use this for a special event where I have the time to walk around in curlers before I go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Below are some thoughts that prevented me from giving this product a higher rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1) The wand was lightweight, but it felt like cheap plastic which would break easily.&lt;br /&gt; 2) There were not enough rollers included in the package (three large and three small) to really create a full head of layered waves, and this product seems to require a certain type of roller so I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use my own rollers on that patented wand. I think a few more smaller ones and maybe another large one would have done the trick.&lt;br /&gt; 3) Another thing is that from the reviews I&#x27;ve read and from my own experiments, the hair really needs to be mostly or fully dry before using this product effectively. So if you previously blew your hair dry, the additional hot air blasts on the hair and scalp seem like overkill, leading to damage. 4) Lastly, there&#x27;s just the fact that this is, in the end, just a fancier way of putting your hair in curlers, which we might have already done with less time involved, making the product a bit redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The end result, however, is that this product worked as advertised and I liked the way my hair turned out after using...big, and bouncy!</li>
