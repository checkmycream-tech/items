            <li>Seems to hold up pretty decently.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these a few times and have liked the way they shave.</li>
            <li>Only wish I could buy just the blades as the razor is made strong and comfortable for the had that there really is no reason to replace it.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an older razor.  </li>
            <li>But so far HE LOVES THIS!!  </li>

            <li>I will use them as long as they stay a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>First, I only bought this one because the white one I got for my wife only included four blades, and there is literally no way to buy extra blades for it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely decent and worth it for the 12 blades, seriously.</li>
            <li>i first heard of emjoi when my husband ordered it for himself few years back.</li>

            <li> These exquisite razor is out of production. I buy all I can find, and will continue to do so. Don&#x27;t buy them up from me,</li>
            <li> Does a terrible job, cuts face at every stroke. Burns. Not precise. Awkward shape. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Year&#x27;s worth of goodies. Spits in the face of the over-indulgent five-blade crowd.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing beard and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg!</li>
            <li> Good price and this razor gives me a very nice shave.  I think it&#x27;s as good as the top brand razors.  :0)</li>
            <li> Works well, nice item!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery afordable price very pleased</li>
            <li> This is a unique razor, that is both comfortable and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was outstanding, and the product well protected.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I am both pleased and satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these quite a while now. They do the job for me and much more reasonable than your name brand blades. I think they last just as long and do as good as any that I&#x27;ve tried. I will use them as long as they stay a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for several months, alternately with my other name brand changable-blade products. I can convey the results now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between this one [and the others] I notice the build of the blade holder allows for a closer, smoother shave. The other blades sometimes leave a red scrape due to be overly exposed - along with me being half asleep. This is perfect for travel for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Compact and durable holder can take a beating. The blade rack holds the replacements firm. 2) The shave is consistently clean and safe. 3) When in that hotel room in another town, you need to be clean shaven for that interview and not bleeding from the face at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have is this razor and some shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are doing fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older razor.  Outstanding!</li>
            <li> I love this razor and blades. Been using it for a few years now. Only wish I could buy just the blades as the razor is made strong and comfortable for the had that there really is no reason to replace it. Please start selling replacement blades by themselves.</li>
            <li> I received my razor and everything seems to be in working order. Shaves better than my cheap throw aways. Handle has a nice weight to it and fits nicely in my hand. Seems to hold up pretty decently. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks now...still sharp. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no issues with any reactions to using this razor. Definitely decent and worth it for the 12 blades, seriously. Those bad boys are expensive in the store for name brand companies.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as product arrived a few days after ordering. I have ordered these a few times and have liked the way they shave. This last batch of blades does not seem to last as long and feels dull after a few uses. They use to last me two weeks shaving every two days head &amp; beard-now its a week maybe...Hopefully these blades were just a bad batch. I will order once more to see if was just a bad batch...</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for nearly ten years and they are superb.  Getting them was convenient and speedy.</li>
            <li> i first heard of emjoi when my husband ordered it for himself few years back. BUt i was the one who eneded up using them and now i cant live without them. I have sensitive skin and dont wax and end up shaving. These razors are the BEST! i never get a cut or a razor burn and seriously have zero complaints about this product. I was so sad to hear they dont sell them anymore and therefore, super excited i can still get them on amazon. Will def order more :)</li>
            <li> First, I only bought this one because the white one I got for my wife only included four blades, and there is literally no way to buy extra blades for it.  So I purchased this one, intending to just give her the blades. I ended up using it to shave my head and beard and got the closest, most pain free shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem, again, is there is no way to buy spare blades.  You have to buy the razor and 12 blades again, every time you run out of blades.  Otherwise, great razor.</li>
            <li> These are great razor blades and the weighted handle is awesome. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when my razor hear slips out of the handle sometimes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend.  He has tried many other brands and is very fussy!! But so far HE LOVES THIS!!  Other reviews helped my decision to buy...would recommend to anyone!</li>
