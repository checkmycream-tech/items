    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best (one time we did run out</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s best for oily skin.)  </li>
            <li>best feature I like about Coalface,</li>
            <li>I find it to be a great skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is for everyone but great for those with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I loved this soap, it gave my face a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; sort of feeling.</li>
            <li>so I loved that this bar was a cleanser and scrub in one,</li>
            <li>but it works surprising well.</li>
            <li>I think this soap is good for a person is having acne problems and a blemish skin.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!!!  </li>
            <li>... love that one).  </li>
            <li>then we dash off to get some more</li>
            <li>My husband has very oily skin and this soap is great for him.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great, it also gently exfoliates.      </li>
            <li>Bottom line, If i had no sense of smell, i would love this soap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this soap.  </li>
            <li>If the scent bothers you then I have found that some \\&quot;Sexy</li>
            <li>The coal does an excellent job at absorbing any and all oil on the skin, but it&#x27;s so gentle that I never have a problem with dryness or stripping.</li>
            <li>At first I was very pleased and felt that my skin appeared firmer and</li>
            <li>The smell took some getting used to, but it isn&#x27;t strong or lingering.</li>
            <li>I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface.</li>
            <li>The smell kind of turned me off at first, but I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>If you have regular acne, this is probably a great product for you.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean feel that I get after using Coalface and I like the smell too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Clinique customer for many years and this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;m willing to switch over for.</li>
            <li>Most lush products are just good since they smell nice look pretty and are fun to use but this one actually has something to it.</li>
            <li>and my skin still feels awesome and isn&#x27;t the least bit grimy or shiny.  </li>
            <li>my face is more clear than it&#x27;s been for ages!  </li>
            <li>I bought this and fresh farmacy, and I find that this soap works wonders on problem skin for your body.</li>
            <li>So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me.</li>
            <li>friend uses Coalface religiously, and it cleared up her skin and keeps it glowing and nice without the need for toner or prescription treatments.   </li>
            <li>-the kind of skin that needed washed multiple times a day in the summertime, but since I&#x27;ve started using this I can go all day</li>
            <li>Peel\\&quot; soap will get rid of it if you use it right after you&#x27;ve scrubbed with Coal Face.</li>
            <li>if you want to see the result right away then you should not buy this.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptically at first, but now my skin is all soft and pimple free!</li>
            <li>I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>Get a sample first if you can and make sure it&#x27;s right for your skin before buying a big bar.  </li>
            <li>The coal in the soap is pretty neat - you dont see that every day.</li>
            <li>very \\&quot;motor oil-ish\\&quot; which made me VERY sceptical to use it at first</li>
            <li>After applying large amounts of cake makeup to myself, I took COALFACE and washed.  </li>
            <li>It works as an AWESOME exfoliator and, though previous review state that it&#x27;s harsh, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li>After just TWO days of washing my face with this, I see a very noticable difference.  </li>
            <li>This is for VERY oily skin - not combination skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not the big selling point of this soap as it is with many lush products - it&#x27;s the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they tout themselves as this obsessively natural outfit yet still use a fair amount of harsh products.  </li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s not so extreme and smells better.</li>
            <li>I use it when I run out of other products, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite for me.</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin, neither oily or dry, and I love LUSH&#x27;s Coalface.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap a couple of times and it left my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for a first time Lush buyer over the internet.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of coalface with my last order, and I was excited to try this new style of exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also good for troubled skin that needs soothing because it also has ingredients like sandalwood oil that helps to calm any irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>After using it to clean my face, my skin feels a little tighter because of the rosewood in it, but not overly powerful.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using it though, my complexion wasn&#x27;t any better than before I started using it and in fact, I began to break out a little.</li>
            <li>My pre-teen daughter started using this and within days her face was clear again, it absolutely works on acne.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out and leaves his face clean and mosturized.  </li>
            <li>, it dried out my skin, which made it produce even more oil to make up for the dryness.</li>
            <li>I alternate nightly with both of these face washes (see my Fresh Farmacy review also).</li>
            <li>but when I first got it I washed my whole face with it and it made my cheeks which are not oily very flaky and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the quest to find the miracle soap that will clear my face of acne forever!</li>
            <li>I seem to break out more now, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just part of the process of drawing out impurities in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells good (a lot like black licorce) and she likes the black lather too.  </li>
            <li>It feels the same even after a long run: your skin has been toned and firmed, plus it&#x27;s clean and smells better than some of LUSH&#x27;s other facial products.  </li>
            <li>I am COMPLETELY hooked on this face soap-as a matter of fact, I have another bar coming to me in another Lush shipment soon!  </li>
            <li>Her face stays clear until she runs out</li>
            <li>Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF.</li>
            <li>He told me that his face has never been so soft in his life.</li>
            <li>the only problem that I had was that it didnt help much with my breakouts and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of Coalface with another Lush product that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>You can almost feel it really going to town on cleaning your skin and getting shot of that deep seated muck!</li>
            <li>Ask for a sample if you have a store near you.</li>
            <li>So I decided to change my cleanser to Lush coalface.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh on my face, but find that it works better on my back after a work out.</li>
            <li>If your skin is heavily troubled, in both breakouts and irritation, LUSH&#x27;s Fresh Farmacy may be a better choice for you.  </li>
            <li>It has very tiny pieces of coal and liquorice that both do a great job at exfoliating dead, dull skin.  </li>
            <li>it will be calm your skin down.   </li>
            <li>OVerall, this soap does as advertised - leaches the skin of impurities and still keeps it moist and retainable (thats at least worth two stars right there).</li>
            <li>My skin is combination, and I find the dry spots don&#x27;t do well wtih this soap, but it really helps with the oily bits.  </li>
            <li>Be warned however, that I wouldn&#x27;t let this bar anywhere near my normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed some of the reviews mentioning the scratchy bits and just to be clear, there are tiny tiny bits and my daughter rubs the coalface between her hands and then washes her face with no scratchy feeling and we all know how soft skin is at that age.</li>
            <li>am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil.</li>
            <li>but this one leaves skin really soft and doesnt have a gross film.</li>
            <li>If you just need an exfoliant, try Angels on Bare Skin (or Ocean Salt if you want to splurge).</li>
            <li>have tried a lot of Lush products and find them to be OVERRATED and OVERPRICED (except Big Blue Ballistic</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get the whole bar wet, but recently have started rubbing the bar in my hands then applying to face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty messy to use.  </li>
            <li>The smell takes a little getting used to, (don&#x27;t be tempted to toss it), but the effects are little less than magic!</li>

            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to, (don&#x27;t be tempted to toss it), but the effects are little less than magic!</li>
            <li> felt the rough charcoal granules and some ingredient that burned my skin, my skin tingled and burned, and I was only able to exfoliate bits of my face due to the hard edges of the bar, which didn&#x27;t align with my facial curves.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, the cool factor increases due to the fact that it is jet black and in fact has tiny sparklies in it (earning yet another star and a half).</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it really dries skin, but to me, it did not dry THAT much.(I have a complex skin)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, but I only use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, my face felt sore and dry, and I had a breakout the next day.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the little pieces are to jagged  for the sensitive skin on your face</li>
            <li> Previously, the only thing that worked for me were regular facials to slough them off.  </li>
            <li> I did have to be a bit careful with the drying factor and used it only once a day or every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting down to the last of my bar</li>
            <li> Though you can smell the faint enticing licorice smell, it is quickly over powered by the smell of a dream coming to an abrupt halt.     </li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a great job exfoliating and keeping those nasty blackheads away.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> and you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> My skin was never too oily, but after a long day wearing makeup it makes your face feel refreshed and tight.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my brother who has excessively oily skin, prone to blackheads. He loves it! He told me that his face has never been so soft in his life. It seems to be doing a great job exfoliating and keeping those nasty blackheads away. Be warned however, that I wouldn&#x27;t let this bar anywhere near my normal to dry skin. This is for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap, it gave my face a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; sort of feeling. I use a lot of facial scrubs so I loved that this bar was a cleanser and scrub in one, the only problem that I had was that it didnt help much with my breakouts and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Coalface with another Lush product that I ordered.  The smell kind of turned me off at first, but I figured I would give it a try.  This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!!!  Just five days of using it and my face is more clear than it&#x27;s been for ages!  I&#x27;m also a lot less oily, so my makeup stays on longer.  I will be using this cleanser exclusively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think twice before ordering this soap.  It made my skin overly tight and the chunks of charcoal were quite unpleasant and scratchy. I assume the tightness is a sign of cleanliness, but I&#x27;ll keep my Korres face cleanser -- it&#x27;s not so extreme and smells better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of Lush products and find them to be OVERRATED and OVERPRICED (except Big Blue Ballistic... love that one).  Plus, they tout themselves as this obsessively natural outfit yet still use a fair amount of harsh products.  I won&#x27;t use their cleansers again until they eliminate the moisture-stripping Sodium Lauryl Sulfates.</li>
            <li> You can almost feel it really going to town on cleaning your skin and getting shot of that deep seated muck!</li>
            <li> I used this soap a couple of times and it left my face feeling clean. But the ash like sent made me gag so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> My pre-teen daughter started using this and within days her face was clear again, it absolutely works on acne.  Her face stays clear until she runs out then we dash off to get some more, it&#x27;s the best (one time we did run out and she used my face soap and brokeout so we know it&#x27;s the coalface working)!  It smells good (a lot like black licorce) and she likes the black lather too.  I noticed some of the reviews mentioning the scratchy bits and just to be clear, there are tiny tiny bits and my daughter rubs the coalface between her hands and then washes her face with no scratchy feeling and we all know how soft skin is at that age.</li>
            <li> My husband has very oily skin and this soap is great for him.  It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out and leaves his face clean and mosturized.  He also says, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t smell girly.\\&quot;  It can be messy and leave black bits in the sink, so rinse well and don&#x27;t use white towels with it.  It is a bit expensive but lasts a very long time.  My skin is combination, and I find the dry spots don&#x27;t do well wtih this soap, but it really helps with the oily bits.  I use it when I run out of other products, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this and fresh farmacy, and I find that this soap works wonders on problem skin for your body. It&#x27;s not too harsh on my face, but find that it works better on my back after a work out.</li>
            <li> I like the clean feel that I get after using Coalface and I like the smell too.  It&#x27;s pretty messy to use.  I was breaking off pieces so I didn&#x27;t get the whole bar wet, but recently have started rubbing the bar in my hands then applying to face.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, but I only use it once a day.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help with my acne except the blackheads on my nose have shrunk.  I seem to break out more now, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just part of the process of drawing out impurities in my skin.  I use Clinique at night and CF in the morning. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again...I&#x27;m on the quest to find the miracle soap that will clear my face of acne forever!</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  After just TWO days of washing my face with this, I see a very noticable difference.  My skin is clearing up and the ever-present chin pimples (ugh) are going away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in a couple of these.  The smell takes a little getting used to, (don&#x27;t be tempted to toss it), but the effects are little less than magic!</li>
            <li> Wowzers! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. It&#x27;s so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. A week ago I bought a bar of Coalface out of curiosity. I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a try!</li>
            <li> This bar smells a little weird but it works surprising well. All cleaners I&#x27;ve tried remove makeup and dirt ok but this one leaves skin really soft and doesnt have a gross film. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the little pieces are to jagged  for the sensitive skin on your face and you have to be careful. Most lush products are just good since they smell nice look pretty and are fun to use but this one actually has something to it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I absolutely love this product!  I was a bit skeptically at first, but now my skin is all soft and pimple free! (It&#x27;s best for oily skin.)  This stuff is really great, it also gently exfoliates.      I was using neutrogena before, but I DON&#x27;T recomend that, it dried out my skin, which made it produce even more oil to make up for the dryness.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this soap along with an order I placed and decided to give it a try. The smell took some getting used to, but it isn&#x27;t strong or lingering. At first I was very pleased and felt that my skin appeared firmer and my make-up seemed to go on smoother and last longer throughout the day. After about a week of using it though, my complexion wasn&#x27;t any better than before I started using it and in fact, I began to break out a little. I&#x27;ve been a loyal Clinique customer for many years and this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;m willing to switch over for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an exfoliant junkie; I&#x27;ve become addicted to the sensation of dead skin being sloughed away.  I got a sample of coalface with my last order, and I was excited to try this new style of exfoliant.  Now, I should note that, as an exfoliant afficionado, I have skin that is used to a little scrubbing.  Coalface was not for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I felt the rough charcoal granules and some ingredient that burned my skin, my skin tingled and burned, and I was only able to exfoliate bits of my face due to the hard edges of the bar, which didn&#x27;t align with my facial curves.  After rinsing, my face felt sore and dry, and I had a breakout the next day.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My friend uses Coalface religiously, and it cleared up her skin and keeps it glowing and nice without the need for toner or prescription treatments.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion is that this works for some people, but not for others.  If you have regular acne, this is probably a great product for you.  If you just need an exfoliant, try Angels on Bare Skin (or Ocean Salt if you want to splurge).</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for a first time Lush buyer over the internet.  Get a sample first if you can and make sure it&#x27;s right for your skin before buying a big bar.  The smell is not the big selling point of this soap as it is with many lush products - it&#x27;s the effectiveness.  This is for VERY oily skin - not combination skin.  It worked great for me and shrank those annoying blackheads on my nose but when I first got it I washed my whole face with it and it made my cheeks which are not oily very flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> I recieved a couple different soap bars after ordering some DREAM CREAM, and gave this a spin.  I did 2 tests: makeup removal and afterworkout cleansing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I&#x27;m in the middle of doing test shots for a short film.  After applying large amounts of cake makeup to myself, I took COALFACE and washed.  I never had to wash my face twice - this did the job well enough and will continue to buy these scraps for my makeup kit to give to the actors after shooting.  It feels the same even after a long run: your skin has been toned and firmed, plus it&#x27;s clean and smells better than some of LUSH&#x27;s other facial products.  Easiest little piece of glycerin I&#x27;ve ever laid my hands on.</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin, neither oily or dry, and I love LUSH&#x27;s Coalface.  It has very tiny pieces of coal and liquorice that both do a great job at exfoliating dead, dull skin.  The coal does an excellent job at absorbing any and all oil on the skin, but it&#x27;s so gentle that I never have a problem with dryness or stripping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best feature I like about Coalface, the toning affect it has on my skin.  After using it to clean my face, my skin feels a little tighter because of the rosewood in it, but not overly powerful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for troubled skin that needs soothing because it also has ingredients like sandalwood oil that helps to calm any irritated skin.  If your skin is heavily troubled, in both breakouts and irritation, LUSH&#x27;s Fresh Farmacy may be a better choice for you.  I alternate nightly with both of these face washes (see my Fresh Farmacy review also).</li>
            <li> OVerall, this soap does as advertised - leaches the skin of impurities and still keeps it moist and retainable (thats at least worth two stars right there). The coal in the soap is pretty neat - you dont see that every day. Not to mention, the cool factor increases due to the fact that it is jet black and in fact has tiny sparklies in it (earning yet another star and a half). However, its functionality and pleasurable countenance is counteracted by its horrid olfactoriness (in short, it smells like truck tires, giving it a flaming two star reduction). Though you can smell the faint enticing licorice smell, it is quickly over powered by the smell of a dream coming to an abrupt halt.     Bottom line, If i had no sense of smell, i would love this soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap.  My skin was never too oily, but after a long day wearing makeup it makes your face feel refreshed and tight. The smell is fantastic.  I&#x27;m getting down to the last of my bar and I wish that the scrubby pieces would last longer, but i haven&#x27;t had any problem with them until now. Occasionally it made my face red and blotchy when it was very cold and windy out, so you must use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite oily especially the T-zone area and my face suffers from those pesky small whiteheads around my nose and mouth.  Previously, the only thing that worked for me were regular facials to slough them off.  Not anymore...Within two days of using it, my face is much cleaner and no more visible dirty pores.  I did have to be a bit careful with the drying factor and used it only once a day or every other day.  I don&#x27;t think this is for everyone but great for those with oily skin.  Ask for a sample if you have a store near you.</li>
            <li> I am COMPLETELY hooked on this face soap-as a matter of fact, I have another bar coming to me in another Lush shipment soon!  Before I had EXTREMELY oily skin-the kind of skin that needed washed multiple times a day in the summertime, but since I&#x27;ve started using this I can go all day and my skin still feels awesome and isn&#x27;t the least bit grimy or shiny.  It works as an AWESOME exfoliator and, though previous review state that it&#x27;s harsh, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all.  My biggest issue with this is that the smell reminds me of a \\&quot;machine\\&quot; shop...very \\&quot;motor oil-ish\\&quot; which made me VERY sceptical to use it at first but now I can&#x27;t go with it.  Actually I forgot this item at a friend&#x27;s house for one weekend and had to go back to using my store bought stuff and my skin was SOOOO oily-I got 8 breakouts in just that one weekend!  I will NEVER NEVER use anything else other than this on my skin again!  If the scent bothers you then I have found that some \\&quot;Sexy Peel\\&quot; soap will get rid of it if you use it right after you&#x27;ve scrubbed with Coal Face.</li>
            <li> My skin started breaking out about a month or two.  So I decided to change my cleanser to Lush coalface.  Some reviews said it really dries skin, but to me, it did not dry THAT much.(I have a complex skin) the bottom line; This soap does work!!!! it will be calm your skin down.   but it works really slowly!!! if you want to see the result right away then you should not buy this.  I think this soap is good for a person is having acne problems and a blemish skin.</li>
