    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was greatly impressed with it on my hair when it was used once by a hair designer.</li>
            <li>This has to be the best moisturizing shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This brand is perfect for my 3c-4a culry hair.  </li>
            <li>excellent shampoo!</li>
            <li>oh so pleasant!  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find Elucence on Amazon - thank you!</li>
            <li>I noticed it has improved the dryness that my hair has experienced since going lighter.</li>
            <li>The smell is great also.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This is really a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is a wonderful sulfate free product!</li>
            <li>and was thrilled with the results!   </li>
            <li>This is a really good shampoo along with moisture benefits</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the sulfate Elucence Moisture Benefits is good shampoo to have.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, it lathers very well and smells delicious!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling equally amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing non-detergent product.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this shampoo because I heard some good reviews, I love that a lot is not needed for good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that kind of reminds me of baby asprin and makes my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Overall this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>The color also seems to look better since using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo with a passion.</li>
            <li>I also love the peachy scent.</li>
            <li>I, for one, am thrilled to see this product is available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>lovely.   </li>
            <li>I notice my hair looking shinier and more moist than ever.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with sulfate than give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li>but my hair feels 10 times better and feels</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I discovered this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love using this and the conditioner together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more pleased with the ingredients than anything.</li>
            <li>I also bought the conditioner and both work great to keep my hair strong, soft, and healthy!</li>
            <li>odor is fine.</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard lots of great things about this shampoo but figured what difference could there be among different shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is truly free of those chemicals and still leaves my hair feeling clean when I wash it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has my hair feeling so clean</li>
            <li>My 4B hair felt clean yet moisturized.</li>
            <li>now it makes my hair hard and dry.the best thing about this product is the smell (peaches).</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My natural hair style is so loving this shampoo</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo and feels like a professional shampoo.</li>
            <li>I found I can now use half as much shampoo to get the perfect amount of coverage for my hair.</li>
            <li>The mild scent wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user for 6 years...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Unlike many shampoos it doesn&#x27;t lather much but shampoos with more natural ingridients don&#x27;t lather much anyways</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate free shampoos and this truly has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot of product to produce a rich lather.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this shampoo does exactly what I want it to and is definitely worth the money (plus shipping).</li>
            <li>Rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and slidy, no tangles, no knots, no sticking-out ends.</li>
            <li>Despite the higher price, I can tell this shampoo will stick around much longer than the large, cheap shampoo brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But after the first wash my hair felt stripped so I read the ingredients</li>
            <li>Finally found a shampoo that i truly pleased with.</li>
            <li>Ok so this is the only thing I have changed in my hair washing routine.</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo is fabulous and it does add moisture - however after using it I was beginning to feel my natural hair drying a bit.  </li>
            <li>noticed the difference as soon as I poured the first dollop in my hand.</li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t say enough about sulfate free shampoos, they really make a difference and this one is at the top!</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is about 2 feet long, and I use a little more than a quarter size and also get good lather.</li>
            <li>After using it my hair is clean and manageable without that stripped of all natural oils feeling.</li>
            <li>you should visit the naturally curly.com site where they give you tips and what not on how to go natural and love your locks</li>
            <li>It lathers quickly with just a tiny bit of shampoo, washes away product and leaves a clean scalp without having to rinse and repeat</li>
            <li>I am a woman of color and usually after washing, our hair can feel very dry but after using this, mine and my daughters hair felt wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Even then, I have to smooth some shampoo over the section first, rinse, then apply the palmful of shampoo to actually wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Conditioner.it is condensed so much is not needed to get the job done, which I like about it.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it cleanses very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I used to think the shampoo I used didn&#x27;t make a difference, but this really enhances my wavy/curly  hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been forever since my hair felt like real hair</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s changed the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing. ..</li>
            <li>Smells slightly fruity, but just enough so that I&#x27;m sniffing trying to figure out what fruit smells so good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone with dry/curly hair who&#x27;s looking for a moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use just about a nickel size amount for my thick hair, and the lather is amazing.</li>
            <li>It rinses away cleanly, without leaving any residue and without leaving my hair brittle and dry, even before I move on to conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, if I can only find a good conditioner (I don&#x27;t like the conditioner usually used with this).</li>
            <li>The shampoo didnt make the hair feel dried out and its one of my favorite shampoos</li>
            <li>They all use about the same ingredients, right?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for those who are natural.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming and pleasant but not really noticeable to the point I would buy this just for the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Even before conditioning, our hair was soft and not feeling stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>Soo far it&#x27;s just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>an d moisturized, but no heavy nor greasy.  </li>
            <li>one of my favorites on relaxed and natural haier  l</li>
            <li>and you are wanting to go natural</li>
            <li>It has done wonders for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really used it consistenly enough to give it time to work.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and this is the only shampoo that has not dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li>and it left my hair very soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I used Elucence on one side of my hair since I wanted to finish up the last of my Aloe Vera Shampoo by Jason&#x27;s Natural.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair 4b, and it made my curls pop!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type that wants a slight perfume/scent to follow you throughout the day, you should probably keep looking.</li>
            <li>I have thick, medium curly (lots of mid-size and loose ringlets), but slightly fine hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and sweet.</li>

            <li> one of my favorites on relaxed and natural haier  l</li>
            <li> and you are wanting to go natural</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really used it consistenly enough to give it time to work.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and this is the only shampoo that has not dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> and it left my hair very soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I used Elucence on one side of my hair since I wanted to finish up the last of my Aloe Vera Shampoo by Jason&#x27;s Natural.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair 4b, and it made my curls pop!</li>

            <li> I have thick, medium curly (lots of mid-size and loose ringlets), but slightly fine hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But recommend this highly for anyone looking to get moisturize their hair without it being heavy or overbearing.</li>
            <li> You need very little for it to gently cleanse your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from cheap drug store shampoo - Suave - to mid range shampoos - Jason Naturals - to expensive salon shampoos - Matrix - yet this shampoo beats them all.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like the product though I haven&#x27;t used it for long.  </li>
            <li> I have since switched to Living Proof products and they are been miracle workers on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Looking forward for the long term effects.</li>
            <li> A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also use the conditioner and it does not weigh my hair down, which is currently in the process of returning to blonde from brunette.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been cleaner and softer, I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> so you have nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually very, very dry.</li>
            <li> I definitely needed to use a clarifying shampoo every few weeks as the oils in this shampoo will build up on your roots.</li>
            <li> With Elucence, I just wet my hair thoroughly, squeezed out about 1/3 capful of the shampoo</li>
            <li> [this is usually a chore for me since I tend to be heavy-handed with my hair products], and does not dry out hair.</li>
            <li> I used the same conditioners (I used Joico and Aussie 3 minute miracle afterwards as I usually do because of my dryf, damaged hair)</li>
            <li> have weird wavy/curly-ish hair and it looked pretty with no buildup feel.</li>
            <li> I find the other shampoos dried my hair out even though other stated no sulfate.  </li>
            <li> It does have quite a few proteins, so I have to rotate this with other shampoos or else my hair becomes stringy.</li>
            <li> I have slightly texturized 3b/3c curls and my girlfriend recommended the condtioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair moisturized without it being heavy.</li>
            <li> I began using Elucence after my salon recommended it, and had used it over the past four years.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was from the shampoo or not</li>
            <li> Usually, I need a palmful of shampoo to wash one of the four sections of hair</li>
            <li> Even the expensive, salon shampoos always fall short.</li>

            <li> This is a really good shampoo along with moisture benefits Conditioner.it is condensed so much is not needed to get the job done, which I like about it. Unlike many shampoos it doesn&#x27;t lather much but shampoos with more natural ingridients don&#x27;t lather much anyways which many fail to understand.Overall this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a wonderful sulfate free product! It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling equally amazing. I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate free shampoos and this truly has become my favorite. I also use the conditioner and it does not weigh my hair down, which is currently in the process of returning to blonde from brunette. I noticed it has improved the dryness that my hair has experienced since going lighter. The color also seems to look better since using this shampoo. I simply can&#x27;t say enough about sulfate free shampoos, they really make a difference and this one is at the top!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo with a passion. You need very little for it to gently cleanse your hair. It leaves your hair moisturized without it being heavy. It does have quite a few proteins, so I have to rotate this with other shampoos or else my hair becomes stringy. But recommend this highly for anyone looking to get moisturize their hair without it being heavy or overbearing. I also love the peachy scent. 5 solid stars!</li>
            <li> I, for one, am thrilled to see this product is available on Amazon.  I&#x27;m also amazed at how inexpensive it is.    I walked into my therapy room one day to see gift samples of this product.  I washed mine and my daughters hair with it and was thrilled with the results!   I am a woman of color and usually after washing, our hair can feel very dry but after using this, mine and my daughters hair felt wonderful!  Even before conditioning, our hair was soft and not feeling stripped of moisture. And the aroma...lovely.   I am so glad to have found this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I like the copious amounts of lather it produces. It&#x27;s very concentrated, so a little goes a long way. I do find that it can be drying. Besides that, it cleanses very well. I would highly recommend for those who are natural.</li>
            <li> I like the product though I haven&#x27;t used it for long.  I was greatly impressed with it on my hair when it was used once by a hair designer.</li>
            <li> I definitely needed to use a clarifying shampoo every few weeks as the oils in this shampoo will build up on your roots. It works and it&#x27;s cheap so you have nothing to loose. I have since switched to Living Proof products and they are been miracle workers on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo. After using it my hair is clean and manageable without that stripped of all natural oils feeling. I began using Elucence after my salon recommended it, and had used it over the past four years. Lately the salon stopped stocking it and now sells a very expensive shampoo instead. I was delighted to find Elucence on Amazon - thank you! I plan to never be without this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium curly (lots of mid-size and loose ringlets), but slightly fine hair. My hair is usually very, very dry. This shampoo made my hair feel like straw. When it was in my hair, I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair because it made all my hair stick together. Definitely NOT helpful with the inevitable knots in curly hair. Would not recommend to curly-haired girls.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best moisturizing shampoo I have ever used! I have natural African American hair 4b, and it made my curls pop! I use just about a nickel size amount for my thick hair, and the lather is amazing. The smell is great also. I have used it on my daughters hair 3a/b hair also, and it works wonderfully. My daughters hair is about 2 feet long, and I use a little more than a quarter size and also get good lather.</li>
            <li> Soo far it&#x27;s just what I needed.  I notice my hair looking shinier and more moist than ever.  Looking forward for the long term effects.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, it lathers very well and smells delicious! My hair has never been cleaner and softer, I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this shampoo because I heard some good reviews, I love that a lot is not needed for good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after the first wash my hair felt stripped so I read the ingredients and unfortunately it contains sulfate. Sulfate is not good for hair, at least mine anyway. It can still be used if a pre wash is added with coconut oil but I don&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the sulfate Elucence Moisture Benefits is good shampoo to have. If you&#x27;re okay with sulfate than give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has my hair feeling so clean an d moisturized, but no heavy nor greasy.  Can&#x27;t hardly wait until it is time to wash my hair again. My natural hair style is so loving this shampoo and it smells oh so pleasant!  Finally found a shampoo that i truly pleased with. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Iam cosmetologist ..one of my favorites on relaxed and natural haier  l</li>
            <li> I used to think the shampoo I used didn&#x27;t make a difference, but this really enhances my wavy/curly  hair. Now, if I can only find a good conditioner (I don&#x27;t like the conditioner usually used with this).</li>
            <li> This brand is perfect for my 3c-4a culry hair.  If you have no idea what that means and you are wanting to go natural you should visit the naturally curly.com site where they give you tips and what not on how to go natural and love your locks lol. This shampoo is truly free of those chemicals and still leaves my hair feeling clean when I wash it. I also bought the conditioner and both work great to keep my hair strong, soft, and healthy!</li>
            <li> this produt use to work on my 4b hair. now it makes my hair hard and dry.the best thing about this product is the smell (peaches).</li>
            <li> This is an amazing non-detergent product. It is thick, slippery, and doesn&#x27;t even makes bubbles, let alone suds. Rinses out easily and leaves my hair soft and slidy, no tangles, no knots, no sticking-out ends. Smells slightly fruity, but just enough so that I&#x27;m sniffing trying to figure out what fruit smells so good. Anyone with hair that needs TLC might want to try this.</li>
            <li> Received product on time and product is as described in the description</li>
            <li> Ok so this is the only thing I have changed in my hair washing routine. I used the same conditioners (I used Joico and Aussie 3 minute miracle afterwards as I usually do because of my dryf, damaged hair) but my hair feels 10 times better and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weird wavy/curly-ish hair and it looked pretty with no buildup feel. It&#x27;s been forever since my hair felt like real hair lol. I didn&#x27;t even use any product, but could have used a dab on my flyaways from breakage.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is fabulous and it does add moisture - however after using it I was beginning to feel my natural hair drying a bit.  Not sure if it was from the shampoo or not</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeeeeeee it! Nice shampoo and feels like a professional shampoo. The shampoo didnt make the hair feel dried out and its one of my favorite shampoos</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I discovered this shampoo. It has done wonders for my naturally curly hair. It has a pleasant scent that kind of reminds me of baby asprin and makes my hair very manageable. I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have slightly texturized 3b/3c curls and my girlfriend recommended the condtioner. Well i went ahead and bought the shampoo as well and it left my hair very soft and managable. I love using this and the conditioner together.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and this is the only shampoo that has not dried my hair out.  I find the other shampoos dried my hair out even though other stated no sulfate.  This shampoo really does moisturize my hair.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard lots of great things about this shampoo but figured what difference could there be among different shampoos. They all use about the same ingredients, right? For some reason, this shampoo does exactly what I want it to and is definitely worth the money (plus shipping). I&#x27;ve used everything from cheap drug store shampoo - Suave - to mid range shampoos - Jason Naturals - to expensive salon shampoos - Matrix - yet this shampoo beats them all. It lathers quickly with just a tiny bit of shampoo, washes away product and leaves a clean scalp without having to rinse and repeat [this is usually a chore for me since I tend to be heavy-handed with my hair products], and does not dry out hair. I used Elucence on one side of my hair since I wanted to finish up the last of my Aloe Vera Shampoo by Jason&#x27;s Natural. Usually, I need a palmful of shampoo to wash one of the four sections of hair I pre-seperate before washing. Even then, I have to smooth some shampoo over the section first, rinse, then apply the palmful of shampoo to actually wash my hair. With Elucence, I just wet my hair thoroughly, squeezed out about 1/3 capful of the shampoo and it immediately did the trick. My 4B hair felt clean yet moisturized. No squeaky cleanness at all. Despite the higher price, I can tell this shampoo will stick around much longer than the large, cheap shampoo brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works so well I&#x27;m tempted to try the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is fine. Not overwhelming and pleasant but not really noticeable to the point I would buy this just for the fragrance. If you&#x27;re the type that wants a slight perfume/scent to follow you throughout the day, you should probably keep looking. The mild scent wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a lot of product to produce a rich lather. The smell is subtle and sweet. I can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s changed the texture of my hair. I&#x27;m more pleased with the ingredients than anything. I&#x27;ve been wearing braids so I haven&#x27;t really used it consistenly enough to give it time to work. I have faith in this product tho.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and coarse, curly hair. Finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy and straw-like has been nearly impossible. Even the expensive, salon shampoos always fall short. When I saw the reviews for this shampoo I was skeptical, to say the least. A shampoo that can moisturize curly hair that I don&#x27;t have to sell a kidney to afford? I figured, what did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference as soon as I poured the first dollop in my hand. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being thick and pasty. I found I can now use half as much shampoo to get the perfect amount of coverage for my hair. It rinses away cleanly, without leaving any residue and without leaving my hair brittle and dry, even before I move on to conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry/curly hair who&#x27;s looking for a moisturizing shampoo. No salon product I&#x27;ve tried has even come close to working as well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user for 6 years...excellent shampoo! It is very moisturizing. .. A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is really a great shampoo.  It makes your hair soft and moisturized.  It does what it says it does.  No frizz !!!</li>
