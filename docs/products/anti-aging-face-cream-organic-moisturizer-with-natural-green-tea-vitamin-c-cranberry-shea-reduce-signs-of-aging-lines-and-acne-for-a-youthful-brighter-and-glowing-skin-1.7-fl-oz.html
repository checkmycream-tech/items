            <li>I have a sensitive skin and not every cream is ok to use on it.</li>
            <li>I love any product that helps keeping me looking young.</li>
            <li>There are many ingredients listed and complete instructions of how to use.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny paid.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fumbling in my big bag of samples for some kind of moisturizer, I grabbed this stuff.</li>
            <li>You will get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>but--middle of the night, right?</li>
            <li>made my skin feel RIGHT, balanced.</li>
            <li>My face has been more dry this winter than ever before and this INSTANTLY hydrated my face and stopped the dry flaking skin which is a huge plus in a Northern winter!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this cream based in the reviews, it&#x27;s such a good one very light texture,after a few applications you could see a difference .</li>
            <li>It is very different yet equally appealing.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset!,,,,</li>
            <li>I feel like I dont need to moisturize as much as before!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is now the second product purchased from Maroc100 to appear in our home and my wife is in love with it too.</li>
            <li>However, it is a pretty scent and it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>, I really anticipate seeing the results of continuous use of this product, and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li>First class ticket to improved, healthier skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just the first night I used it.  </li>
            <li>I applied it the first night I received it.  </li>
            <li>Moist, not greasy, not fake or temporary.</li>
            <li>I first tried it on my face and neck and after just one application I could see and feel the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better about myself by feeling and looking younger.</li>
            <li>The cream comes in a perfect container not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and soft it makes my skin feel plus the fact that my face seems to have a new glow to it that it hasn&#x27;t in a long time!  </li>
            <li>This really makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I really could see that it made my skin look plumper even after just one use and its very hydrating but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recomand it !</li>
            <li>I an not a fan of creams that leave you feeling very greasy</li>
            <li>This cream has really helped improve the look and feel of my face.</li>
            <li>So perhaps if you have all over oily skin, this might be a bit much for you, or maybe powdered make up would help?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not oily, soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost finished up this jar of Maroc 100 and really like this product.  </li>
            <li>stuff needs to be much cheaper</li>
            <li>The skin absorb it very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have only utilized it for a short time but can already see nice changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li>but there is a lot packed into this jar, and  by the way the jar is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like most other creams do.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this product a five is because the smell is slightly strong for me at first, it does soften up shortly after you apply it though.</li>
            <li>Mine are quickly looking younger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more fluffy than other creams and also has a very rich smell.</li>
            <li>Why is this product rated so high?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Was a lot more runny than I thought it would be and a little oily.</li>
            <li>but I prefer other creams over this one because the scent was too strong for my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for about 4 days and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I could tell within a few uses that my skin looked more plump and even-toned.  </li>
            <li>so I went in search of a new face cream when I saw this one at Amazon ....</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and even my husband noticed.  </li>
            <li>it feels so soft!</li>
            <li>My biggest area of concern is crows feet (the area near my eyes!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The smell is little strong.</li>
            <li>that was surprising but sort of comforting in a way because it doesn&#x27;t smell like a fake, perfumed type of product you normally get these days.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have a finer texture and feels soft and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I am also 43yrs old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dehydrated lately and my skin feels much better and plumper.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Too soon to say any anti-aging, as it is far too soon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and has a ton of anti-oxidants in it.</li>
            <li>it felt youthful and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>This would work well with those with sensitive skin ( like mine) .</li>
            <li>Instantly soft skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy either.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so incredibly soft and looks radiant, plump, replenished,</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now too.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and there is a visible improvement.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and I have noticed the wrinkles lighten up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>It helps tremendously in removing puffiness, which truly does diminish the appearance of dark</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and have found my main problem is the dry skin that needs exfoliation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my skin so soft, pliable, moist and smooth, that I could feel the tiny hairs that tend to go unnoticed and end up in-grown.</li>
            <li>This cream not only tackles wrinkles but it also restores your skins natural radiance.</li>
            <li>use it as soon as I open the package.the cream is soft, like velvet, it feels that you dont need to use a ything else......</li>
            <li>Many have told me that I look younger and want my secret.</li>
            <li>At first she was a little hesitant thinking it would cause her to break out like</li>
            <li>I scooped about half a teaspoon full &amp; carefully spread it on my face, clenching in anticipation of the burn.&lt;br /&gt;No burn.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night, due to the fact that I wear foundation during the day, and my face gets very greasy if I wear anything under my foundation.</li>
            <li>The first few days of using it I had to get over the smell which reminds me of walking through a forest after it rains.  </li>
            <li>Extremely dry, sensitive, fragile skin is.</li>

            <li> I like how think and quickly it absorbs into my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice rich cream with a mild to moderate scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I generally equate that kind of viscosity with efficacy</li>
            <li> I hope to see really good long term results with this creme.</li>
            <li> Did I mention it actually smells pretty good.</li>

            <li> I have to admit it does leave her skin feeling very smooth and soft, and not oily.</li>

            <li> such this one is amazing</li>
            <li> I now believe this is more appropriate for the more delicate skin of the face.  </li>
            <li> /this is a surprisingly effective facial moisturizer to help hydrate and nourish your face.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and not every cream is ok to use on it.</li>
            <li> I love any product that helps keeping me looking young.</li>
            <li> There are many ingredients listed and complete instructions of how to use.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny paid.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fumbling in my big bag of samples for some kind of moisturizer, I grabbed this stuff.</li>
            <li> You will get your monies worth.</li>
            <li> but--middle of the night, right?</li>
            <li> made my skin feel RIGHT, balanced.</li>
            <li> My face has been more dry this winter than ever before and this INSTANTLY hydrated my face and stopped the dry flaking skin which is a huge plus in a Northern winter!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream based in the reviews, it&#x27;s such a good one very light texture,after a few applications you could see a difference .</li>
            <li> It is very different yet equally appealing.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset!,,,,</li>
            <li> I feel like I dont need to moisturize as much as before!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is now the second product purchased from Maroc100 to appear in our home and my wife is in love with it too.</li>
            <li> However, it is a pretty scent and it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> , I really anticipate seeing the results of continuous use of this product, and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> First class ticket to improved, healthier skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just the first night I used it.  </li>
            <li> I applied it the first night I received it.  </li>
            <li> Moist, not greasy, not fake or temporary.</li>
            <li> I first tried it on my face and neck and after just one application I could see and feel the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better about myself by feeling and looking younger.</li>
            <li> The cream comes in a perfect container not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and soft it makes my skin feel plus the fact that my face seems to have a new glow to it that it hasn&#x27;t in a long time!  </li>
            <li> This really makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I really could see that it made my skin look plumper even after just one use and its very hydrating but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recomand it !</li>
            <li> I an not a fan of creams that leave you feeling very greasy</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped improve the look and feel of my face.</li>
            <li> So perhaps if you have all over oily skin, this might be a bit much for you, or maybe powdered make up would help?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not oily, soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished up this jar of Maroc 100 and really like this product.  </li>
            <li> stuff needs to be much cheaper</li>
            <li> The skin absorb it very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have only utilized it for a short time but can already see nice changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> but there is a lot packed into this jar, and  by the way the jar is nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like most other creams do.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this product a five is because the smell is slightly strong for me at first, it does soften up shortly after you apply it though.</li>
            <li> Mine are quickly looking younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more fluffy than other creams and also has a very rich smell.</li>
            <li> Why is this product rated so high?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was a lot more runny than I thought it would be and a little oily.</li>
            <li> but I prefer other creams over this one because the scent was too strong for my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 4 days and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I could tell within a few uses that my skin looked more plump and even-toned.  </li>
            <li> so I went in search of a new face cream when I saw this one at Amazon ....</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and even my husband noticed.  </li>
            <li> it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> My biggest area of concern is crows feet (the area near my eyes!)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The smell is little strong.</li>
            <li> that was surprising but sort of comforting in a way because it doesn&#x27;t smell like a fake, perfumed type of product you normally get these days.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have a finer texture and feels soft and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I am also 43yrs old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dehydrated lately and my skin feels much better and plumper.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say any anti-aging, as it is far too soon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and has a ton of anti-oxidants in it.</li>
            <li> it felt youthful and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> This would work well with those with sensitive skin ( like mine) .</li>
            <li> Instantly soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy either.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so incredibly soft and looks radiant, plump, replenished,</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now too.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and there is a visible improvement.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and I have noticed the wrinkles lighten up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> It helps tremendously in removing puffiness, which truly does diminish the appearance of dark</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and have found my main problem is the dry skin that needs exfoliation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made my skin so soft, pliable, moist and smooth, that I could feel the tiny hairs that tend to go unnoticed and end up in-grown.</li>
            <li> This cream not only tackles wrinkles but it also restores your skins natural radiance.</li>
            <li> use it as soon as I open the package.the cream is soft, like velvet, it feels that you dont need to use a ything else......</li>
            <li> Many have told me that I look younger and want my secret.</li>
            <li> At first she was a little hesitant thinking it would cause her to break out like</li>
            <li> I scooped about half a teaspoon full &amp; carefully spread it on my face, clenching in anticipation of the burn.&lt;br /&gt;No burn.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night, due to the fact that I wear foundation during the day, and my face gets very greasy if I wear anything under my foundation.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using it I had to get over the smell which reminds me of walking through a forest after it rains.  </li>
            <li> Extremely dry, sensitive, fragile skin is.</li>
            <li> I especially like that when I apply it near my eyes, if I have gotten too close my eyes do not tear, as they often seem to with other cremes.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest if you&#x27;re like me and have bags under your eyes: apply just two small dabs, one under each eye, and gently rub the lotion in with a swinging lateral motion, back and forth for half a minute.</li>
            <li> you dont use much and theres no overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was a little leery to order this</li>
            <li> I have dry skin all over my face, especially this time of year, and since I started using it</li>
            <li> The smell faded quickly, and I added another thin coat since I started out in such a dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face extremely soft like a thicker moisturizer does, without the greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Green tea seems to agree with me even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the result of using this on long terms.</li>
            <li> The results are long term.</li>
            <li> Yet it moisturizes dry skin quite well.  </li>
            <li> This will last you quite a long while since you only need a small amount to apply all over your face and neck.</li>
            <li> in combination with the serum is the secret to a younger, sipple,  vibrant skin.....</li>
            <li> (Dry &amp; crispy is not unusual for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely works well as a moisturizer, a little on the &amp;#34;greasy feeling&amp;#34; end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> other night I was awakened by the pain of a split lip and the aching of the dry skin around my eyes, which felt like it would shatter and flake off if I touched it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 4 or 5 organic ingredient face creams within a plus or minus $10 range of this product, and out of them all: this is the leader of the pack.</li>
            <li> Beyond anything I would&#x27;ve expected.  </li>
            <li> I only used it a few times</li>
            <li> So I really liked the creme, but I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> The Maroc 100skin rescue cocktail is a little different that any other creams I used or I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It requires very little to do the job so it will even last me longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> circles----I&#x27;ve never had any other lotion possessing that ability.</li>
            <li> other creams did.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream for someone who had dry skin but dislikes heavy, greasy cream on their face and who doesn&#x27;t mind an earthy type of scent on their face.</li>
            <li> i have dark blotches on my jaw line, i am seeing a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> , This cream will slowly bring back my youthful look at my age.</li>
            <li> about half an hour after I&#x27;ve applied this lotion because it makes me shine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have the worst skin in the world, but it&#x27;s finicky.... dry in some places, even peeling, then decently greasy in others (mainly my T-zone, of course.)</li>
            <li> It seems to hydrate my skin well, without feeling heavy or mask-like.</li>
            <li> Killed the delicate, irritated feeling on the spot &amp; seemed to slightly plump up the thin-feeling areas.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that with it being a cream, it would be far too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a night shift nurse, mom of a toddler and gets very little sleep.</li>
            <li> It is a lot of cream &amp; takes very little.  </li>
            <li> so I was anxious to try their Flight Creme.  </li>
            <li> I have have been using it for the past 5 days; in the morning and at bedtime.</li>
            <li> SO NOT SURE YET</li>
            <li> , I just splashed some water, rather than clean &amp; moisturize, and it lasted all day, even though I am sick and dehydrated!</li>
            <li> The Body Creme has a thick sumptuous quality.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little weird but not off putting, it does seem to hydrate well</li>
            <li> I do not like that it leaves my face very greasy and the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I got this anti-aging moisturizing creme to try since I have noticed my skin looks tired.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look as tired looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a desperate, coupon-frenzied quest trying stuff from $2 to $50, and I&#x27;ve been sick &amp; dehydrated, allergies going wild with heat indoors &amp; cold</li>
            <li> It seems to plump up the skin, and doesn&#x27;t break me out like I was afraid it might.</li>
            <li> But the smell is unpleasant to me, though not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This didn&#x27;t have that super-rich, luxurious spa feeling that some beauty products have, that super-moist, dewy, impossible, and often greasy feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in your purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels good going on, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to my Philosophy.</li>
            <li> I have used Maroc100&#x27;s Argan Oil and Rose Body Creme and been very pleased it so I was anxious to try their Flight Creme.  It is very different yet equally appealing.  The Body Creme has a thick sumptuous quality.  I generally equate that kind of viscosity with efficacy so I was initially unsure about the lightness of the Flight Creme.  I now believe this is more appropriate for the more delicate skin of the face.  I have only utilized it for a short time but can already see nice changes in my skin.  It seems to have a finer texture and feels soft and smoother.  I am very happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> This really makes my skin super soft. Did I mention it actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a very light face cream and has a floral like scent, but does not linger on the skin. I like how think and quickly it absorbs into my face. It leaves my face extremely soft like a thicker moisturizer does, without the greasy or heavy feeling. I use this as part of my morning moisturizer and under my facial primer and it seems to help keep my makeup application smoother as well. This will last you quite a long while since you only need a small amount to apply all over your face and neck. /this is a surprisingly effective facial moisturizer to help hydrate and nourish your face.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  I am a night shift nurse, mom of a toddler and gets very little sleep. I am also 43yrs old. I put this on before bed and even after only 4-5 hrs sleep I&#x27;m shocked at how good my face looks when I wake up.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week but I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> After trying many face creams this has been my favorite thus far. It dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky or with residue on it. I also wear this under my make up. My skin looks alot healthier than before bi started using it. I did get this at a discounted price in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> My order was not in original box and at all that cream was used before! I am very upset!,,,,</li>
            <li> I love this cream! The smell is amazing. Lightly sweet and fruity, but not overpowering. Green tea seems to agree with me even though I have sensitive skin. I love anything cranberry so that&#x27;s another bonus.  I&#x27;ve been dehydrated lately and my skin feels much better and plumper. It didn&#x27;t leave me too greasy or cause break outs. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and not every cream is ok to use on it. This one is great...it has a very pleasant scent and is very light with no greasy feel. My skin feels very soft and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Just started using this, and Im already noticing a difference! I have dry skin all over my face, especially this time of year, and since I started using it I feel like I dont need to moisturize as much as before! I love all of the natural ingredients, and the smell is wonderful! Cant wait to see the effects after using it for a while!  I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic face cream ! I love it ! It&#x27;s really great on sensitive after using it for a while now I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are smaller and my completion has been better !! I love the mild scent and the container it&#x27;s in looks like a million bucks!&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this to anyone !  I used the quarter in my pics so u can have an idea of the size .</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and how smooth it is. Makes my skin soft and youthful looking. I love any product that helps keeping me looking young. My face didnt turn red or breakout.  My skin feels smooth and soft. My husband also likes using these kinds of cream and i think i got him hooked on this one. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely! The jar is lovely! The product is LOVELY!!!</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. This is now the second product purchased from Maroc100 to appear in our home and my wife is in love with it too. I have to admit it does leave her skin feeling very smooth and soft, and not oily. Keep doing what your doing, you have a completely satisfied lifetime customer in my house.</li>
            <li> A very lovely product, have been using this for a year now. It was cheaper buying this on Amazon compared to my Dermatologist office..</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price.  Thicker than most cremes, but that&#x27;s what I need.</li>
            <li> The Marco 100 Flight Cream is a great product to boost, plump and revitalize your face.  It is a Skin Rescue Cocktail with organic acid, organic argan oil and many other wonderful ingredients.  The jar is really pretty that is done in a great silver.  There are many ingredients listed and complete instructions of how to use. The Marco 100 came in 1.7 oz jar. Love this cocktail!</li>
            <li> This is really a great moisturizer i t love the way it makes my skin feel and look more smooth. I really could see that it made my skin look plumper even after just one use and its very hydrating but not greasy. I recieved this product for review purposes these are my honest and true opinions</li>
            <li> absolutely loved this cream .... had been using HORMETA for years but was told that the company had been sold so I went in search of a new face cream when I saw this one at Amazon .... it did everything it claimed to do - especially &amp;#34;plumbing&amp;#34; the skin .... just love it !  HORMETA lost a customer - and not to mention I was paying $125/jar for it and this was $30/jar !</li>
            <li> If you want to look younger then this is a great product to try. My face feels amazingly smooth after apolying this and I am beginning to feel much more confident about the appearance of my skin. i have dark blotches on my jaw line, i am seeing a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream based in the reviews, it&#x27;s such a good one very light texture,after a few applications you could see a difference . Highly recomand it !</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft. Used twice a day. Too soon to say any anti-aging, as it is far too soon</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> So I really liked the creme, but I hate the packaging. Never purchased it again because of that. They need to put it in a package with a pump.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird but not off putting, it does seem to hydrate well but I think my forehead lines are coming back? I might need something stronger.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer! Applies smoothly!</li>
            <li> Good product, nice smell and light consistency.</li>
            <li> I an not a fan of creams that leave you feeling very greasy and this is one of those creams. I don&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> I do not like that it leaves my face very greasy and the smell is awful. Why is this product rated so high?</li>
            <li> Solid moisturizer, keeps my skin hydrated while tightening skin</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!  ILove the feel of this product and the fact that there isn&#x27;t a scent. &#x27;&#x27; I have dry/normal aging skin and use this product twice a day.</li>
            <li> Anything that tightens I am all for it. This is a great cr&amp;egrave;me to wear at night before bed. I have oily skin so I can&#x27;t wear during the day. The cr&amp;egrave;me is almost scentless which I approve of. Most cr&amp;egrave;mes like this smell of powder or roses. This is a nice change and no chemical smells either. Can&#x27;t wait to see my brighter skin!</li>
            <li> This cream has really helped improve the look and feel of my face. It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like most other creams do. It requires very little to do the job so it will even last me longer than I thought it would. 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> No make difference in my face.</li>
            <li> This cream not only tackles wrinkles but it also restores your skins natural radiance. Skin feel softer, smoother and has a youthful glow. It&#x27;s all natural and has a ton of anti-oxidants in it. Visibly plumps, brightens, smoothes and restores the radiance of naturally healthy, hydrated skin. It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works good and great moisturiser.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this product a five is because the smell is slightly strong for me at first, it does soften up shortly after you apply it though. However, it is a pretty scent and it is not overpowering. If you use it as directed you will notice a difference in the way your skin feels almost immediately. It leaves it almost silky it feels so soft! In just a couple days I can already feel a difference and see almost like a glow to my skin. My biggest area of concern is crows feet (the area near my eyes!), I really anticipate seeing the results of continuous use of this product, and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing. There is nothing else I would rather use to fight wrinkles and still feel clean after using it</li>
            <li> OMG! I am totally in love with this product. Smells so nice, it&#x27;s not greasy and works great! I recommend this product to everyone who&#x27;s looking for this type of cream.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with results</li>
            <li> product helped to smooth my skin it felt youthful and soft. I love how it made may skin feel. Product also lighted my wrinkles, they weren&#x27;t as noticeable. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 4 days and so far I really like it. It is organic, made from all natural ingredients and has a nice smell to it. After using it my face feels smoother and it looks really good. It goes on smoothly and does not leave a sticky or greasy feeling on your face. So far it is working great at hydrating my skin and I cant wait to continue seeing the results from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme in place of my regular go to moisturizer for over a week now. I can safely say that this creme works, and smells lovely. My skin feels hydrated and soft. I especially like that when I apply it near my eyes, if I have gotten too close my eyes do not tear, as they often seem to with other cremes. This would work well with those with sensitive skin ( like mine) . Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so I fear using moisturizer on the oilier parts of my face. I&#x27;m a big fan of coconut oil though. I use it for cooking and in my hair. This concoction seems to balance my skin out. It&#x27;s excellent to use on your hands as well. Mine are quickly looking younger. The jar is beautiful but what&#x27;s inside is incredible. It has a light scent and a silky smooth texture. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s more economical than you think. I&#x27;ve been using Avon for years. It kept my skin hydrated but it never improved it like this product does. It&#x27;s a face lift in a jar. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 4 or 5 organic ingredient face creams within a plus or minus $10 range of this product, and out of them all: this is the leader of the pack. I can&#x27;t say I have the worst skin in the world, but it&#x27;s finicky.... dry in some places, even peeling, then decently greasy in others (mainly my T-zone, of course.) Most important thing about this lotion is that it really does not take a lot to cover your whole face and it honestly lasts the whole day. Never irritates my skin or makes me peel. Didn&#x27;t even make me break out, which is miraculous for me! I will say, I do find myself wiping my oily T-zone about half an hour after I&#x27;ve applied this lotion because it makes me shine. But after that one dab, I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day. So perhaps if you have all over oily skin, this might be a bit much for you, or maybe powdered make up would help? I highly suggest if you&#x27;re like me and have bags under your eyes: apply just two small dabs, one under each eye, and gently rub the lotion in with a swinging lateral motion, back and forth for half a minute. It helps tremendously in removing puffiness, which truly does diminish the appearance of dark circles----I&#x27;ve never had any other lotion possessing that ability. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First class ticket to improved, healthier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice rich cream with a mild to moderate scent that is not overpowering. It definitely works well as a moisturizer, a little on the &amp;#34;greasy feeling&amp;#34; end of the spectrum. The list of ingredients is impressive, I won&#x27;t repeat them here but there is a lot packed into this jar, and  by the way the jar is nice and heavy. Sample provided for honest review.</li>
            <li> great product !! love it   been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream. Instantly soft skin. Not oily, soaks in fast. Hasn&#x27;t made a drastic change in my fine lines yet. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days so far, I will update this review after 1-2 weeks. My face has been more dry this winter than ever before and this INSTANTLY hydrated my face and stopped the dry flaking skin which is a huge plus in a Northern winter!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished up this jar of Maroc 100 and really like this product.  The first few days of using it I had to get over the smell which reminds me of walking through a forest after it rains.  There is an earthy/woodsy kind of scent to it that was surprising but sort of comforting in a way because it doesn&#x27;t smell like a fake, perfumed type of product you normally get these days.  I&#x27;m totally used to the smell now and actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is very light in texture and hydrates well without leaving a greasy film on the skin.  Yet it moisturizes dry skin quite well.  I can use this product under makeup once it soaks into my skin.  Apply.  Let it soak in and then apply foundation and set with powder.  It makes my skin very soft and even my husband noticed.  I recommend this cream for someone who had dry skin but dislikes heavy, greasy cream on their face and who doesn&#x27;t mind an earthy type of scent on their face.</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING!!!  Beyond anything I would&#x27;ve expected.  NOT greasy..absorbs immediately.  You do not get up in the morning greasy, or become greasy during the day.  It gave amazing results after just the first night I used it.  Skin looks great....can put make-up over it w/no problems.  After 1 week my complexion has totally improved &amp; will not be w/o this product &amp; will be ordering another so I don&#x27;t run out.  Do not think that will happen too soon.  It is a lot of cream &amp; takes very little.  Well worth every penny paid.  Would recommend.  Thanx Amazon</li>
            <li> use it as soon as I open the package.the cream is soft, like velvet, it feels that you dont need to use a ything else......in combination with the serum is the secret to a younger, sipple,  vibrant skin.....trust me I am ver pick with creams and such this one is amazing</li>
            <li> This is one wonderful face cream.  There are so many out there that say they do things and don&#x27;t.  This creme does wonders.  I applied it the first night I received it.  The smell is so heavenly.  So fresh and so light.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like most.  It&#x27;s not heavy either.  You can almost feel it start to work as soon as you put it on.  It has this great tightening feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made with organic anti aging antioxidant ingredients.  It also has marine and botanical extracts.  All these work together to give your face a rescue cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it si made with such great high quality ingredients.  I know that using this my face will thank me.  I hope to see really good long term results with this creme.</li>
            <li> The Maroc 100skin rescue cocktail is a little different that any other creams I used or I&#x27;m using. It&#x27;s more fluffy than other creams and also has a very rich smell. I like it but I prefer other creams over this one because the scent was too strong for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m so happy I was able to purchase this at a discount in order to try it out and share my experience with it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are not my problem. Extremely dry, sensitive, fragile skin is. I&#x27;m on a desperate, coupon-frenzied quest trying stuff from $2 to $50, and I&#x27;ve been sick &amp; dehydrated, allergies going wild with heat indoors &amp; cold outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other night I was awakened by the pain of a split lip and the aching of the dry skin around my eyes, which felt like it would shatter and flake off if I touched it. (Dry &amp; crispy is not unusual for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fumbling in my big bag of samples for some kind of moisturizer, I grabbed this stuff. I hesitated because beauty products often burn my facial skin, but I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to wash and tone before stuff like this but--middle of the night, right? I scooped about half a teaspoon full &amp; carefully spread it on my face, clenching in anticipation of the burn.&lt;br /&gt;No burn. Just blessed relief. But the smell is unpleasant to me, though not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t have that super-rich, luxurious spa feeling that some beauty products have, that super-moist, dewy, impossible, and often greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;This feels more like an \\&quot;equalizer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin feel RIGHT, balanced. Moist, not greasy, not fake or temporary. Killed the delicate, irritated feeling on the spot &amp; seemed to slightly plump up the thin-feeling areas. The smell faded quickly, and I added another thin coat since I started out in such a dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin so soft, pliable, moist and smooth, that I could feel the tiny hairs that tend to go unnoticed and end up in-grown. I slept well.&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly, when I woke up, the healthy, moist, good sensations were still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test it, I just splashed some water, rather than clean &amp; moisturize, and it lasted all day, even though I am sick and dehydrated! This is well-nigh miraculous! Even my sore, cracked lips &amp; nose are smooth, pain-free, and in no danger of splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff needs to be much cheaper so I can slather it all over my body, have one in each room, a stash in my purse, and give it as gifts!&lt;br /&gt;My freaking *insurance* should cover it, because it works TONS better than that over-priced prescription stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m using it like it&#x27;s supposed to be used, and it works EVEN BETTER!&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.gifts!   My freaking *insurance* should cover it, because it works TONS better than that over-priced prescription stuff!  Now, I&#x27;m using it like it&#x27;s supposed to be used, and it works EVEN BETTER!   Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream, it&#x27;s light, rich and thick with a lovely light scent and boy oh boy does it work! I&#x27;m very impressed. I have have been using it for the past 5 days; in the morning and at bedtime. I first tried it on my face and neck and after just one application I could see and feel the difference in my skin so I tried it on my décolleté and the back of my hands and I am truly impressed. My skin feels so incredibly soft and looks radiant, plump, replenished, like I gave it a drink of water. I see an absolute reduction of fine lines already. The cream absorbs very quickly into my skin  A little bit goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to use too much which makes it a great value as well. I give this product my highest recommendation to anyone wanting to improve the look and feel of their face, neck, décolleté or even hands</li>
            <li> Good for combination skin. The skin absorb it very well. It does not make you feel putting grease on your face. My skin breakout easy and this make me skin clearer. Last but not least, i love the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and one of a kind. You will not be disappointed in your purchase. All you need to do is apply and work into your skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it is lightly scented. You will get your monies worth.</li>
            <li> I got this anti-aging moisturizing creme to try since I have noticed my skin looks tired.  I really like it.  It has a pleasant smell, is very light feeling and tingles so you know its working.  I put it on in a circular motion and massage my skin per the instructions for about 30 seconds.  It a very easy routine to do every morning before going out.  I have noticed more smoother, tighter and prettier skin.  I don&#x27;t look as tired looking.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times but I already can tell the changes on my skin. It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see the result of using this on long terms. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  I could tell within a few uses that my skin looked more plump and even-toned.  The ingredients are top-notch and it did not irritate my skin at all, and most products do.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order. I got this for my mom and just ordered this one for myself. I love the creamy smooth of this</li>
            <li> This is one totally great item. I have been using it since I recieved it. I have a routine with this product. I get my baths at night time and after I do I use this on my face. I am so impressed and so are my friends since I started using this. I have had friends say why are you starting to look different and about 5 to 7 years younger now. I feel so much better about myself by feeling and looking younger. My skin is so soft now too. Thanks for making a great item.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! My face feels so soft and there is a visible improvement. I truly appreciate you letting me have the opportunity to review this product. I feel like the youthful appearance has been restores and so does everyone I see. Thank You!</li>
            <li> This is my first from Maroc, and I must say I am quite pleased with it. I was afraid that with it being a cream, it would be far too heavy for my skin. I only use it at night, due to the fact that I wear foundation during the day, and my face gets very greasy if I wear anything under my foundation. It seems to hydrate my skin well, without feeling heavy or mask-like. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks refreshed and I&#x27;m noticing less fine lines and wrinkles. It seems to plump up the skin, and doesn&#x27;t break me out like I was afraid it might.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this. At first she was a little hesitant thinking it would cause her to break out like other creams did. But it was nice ans creamy with no issues. She says it really works and would recommend to everyone!!</li>

            <li> I used this product the night I received it. The smell is amazingly wonderful. I love how smooth it goes on as well, This cream will slowly bring back my youthful look at my age. The cream comes in a perfect container not to big and not to small. If I were to describe this cream, I would call it HEAVEN IN A JAR between the smell and the way it goes on.</li>

            <li> This is great cream which works for wrinkles and lines on the face. It has great packaging.  The smell is little strong. It feels great on the skin. It does not leave the skin greasy after applying. It is light on the skin and absorb quickly. I started using it the day I received it in the mail. I was so impressed and surprised how fast it started working. I can see a glow on my face. I am using it twice a day. I look more youthful and fresh. This is great product it is anti aging and moisturizer as well. The results are long term. I am so thankful for this amazing product.</li>
