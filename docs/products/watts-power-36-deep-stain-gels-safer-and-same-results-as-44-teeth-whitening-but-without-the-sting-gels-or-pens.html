            <li>I used to use whitening gel from Opalescence, but when it ran out, I decided to give Watts a try, since it was cheaper and seemed like a good value.</li>

            <li>Has a great price point and is very comparable to the stuff you can get from your dentist.</li>
            <li>It is mild but effective.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my dentist made me my own dental tray</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and the two large size containers of the gel is a good purchase.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for coffee drinkers to keep a brilliant smile.</li>
            <li>A great product for beginners and or those with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really believe that the strips that you can buy OTC are just as good.  </li>

            <li>It is fast and effective.</li>
            <li>We kept the solution on our teeth for up to two hours at a time without significant sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I am a smoker, and originally my teeth ranked an 8 out of 10.</li>
            <li>Dn&#x27;t hesitate to get this, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>product from dentist was much stronger (could feel more on gums) and worked.</li>
            <li>No stinging, no bad taste, and no sensitivity afterwards - just whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>My smile is bright white</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The syringe was filled with so many bubbles that I think there was closer to 3-4cc of actual product in the syringe.</li>
            <li>They advertise that their product comes in huge 10cc syringes, but behold - a larger syringe does NOT mean more product!</li>
            <li>I also use the Watts Dental Super Thin Thermo Trays for a great teeth whitening experience that is equal to or superior than that you would get from a dentist.</li>

            <li>I think I must use the procedure one more to see the final result, but I see -</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality about the Watts whitening kit is that it comes with a little metal attachment for the syringe to help you get a more precise application of the gel.    </li>
            <li>Normally, my gums would have been bright red and burning but this time they were not nor were my teeth sensitive to temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW - this stuff is powerful!  </li>
            <li>This is grade A stuff, definitely as good, if not better, than what you&#x27;d get at your dentists office, and definitely much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It is my opinion that this product is equally as effective as what you can purchase at the dentist&#x27;s office at a far lesser price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this whitening gel one month ago.&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions, I have used it pretty much every day and have seen NO</li>
            <li>This product works very well and results are seen after the first use.</li>
            <li>After first applying I saw that my teeth had become much whiter, not evenly, but segmental.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips are much much more painful and make my teeth more sensitive than this gel, plus this gel works much better!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the gels was also much thinner and runnier than Opalescence.</li>
            <li>The gel would often spill out of the tray, and it&#x27;s not because I used too much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is looking to reconquer that white smile!     </li>
            <li>/ Here are a few great 2 packs  minus some of the extras :</li>
            <li>purposely apply the gel to only the front 6 teeth on top and front 6 teeth on the bottom, so I can compare the color to my back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the sensitive gel you get from the dentist and</li>

            <li> whitening gels that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Sad thing is, I don&#x27;t have a pro-tray for my lower teeth, so my upper teeth is a lot whitter than my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> I even complaint and got some directions from the manufacturer..</li>

            <li> A great product for beginners and or those with sensitive teeth.  Watts Power also offers the new teeth whitening shield system in stronger percentages as well. Simply an excellent product and value....  Oh, here are the other percentages:  [[ASIN:B002SHXO4M New Watts Power Exclusive 35% Dental Pro Formula Teeth Whitening Shield System -2 Huge Gels 20ml]]  / Here are a few great 2 packs  minus some of the extras : [[ASIN:B002IPSNPE 22% Sensitive - Watts Power Teeth Whitening Kits with FCP Enamel Gels plus NT Teeth Shields - 2 Pack]]    / [[ASIN:B001UIF01A 2 -Deep Stain 36% Teeth Whitening Shield Kits - FCP Remineralizing Gels -The New Choice in Whitening]]</li>
            <li> I like this product better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past such as Nite-White. It is mild but effective. The tubes are huge, so it is a good value.</li>
            <li> great product.  Easy to use, good value, great results.  Much cheaper than the sensitive gel you get from the dentist and 1/2 the price</li>
            <li> Hard to mess this one up, but the gel works fine. It was also sold at a  good price!</li>
            <li> We found the product did whiten teeth, but it took longer than expected.  We kept the solution on our teeth for up to two hours at a time without significant sensitivity.  It took 5-6 treatments before we felt our teeth had whitened enough.  We will continue to use it for touchups every few weeks.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get the results I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I would not bother with this one it does not lighten well at all. I have better results with Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this whitening gel one month ago.&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions, I have used it pretty much every day and have seen NO improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the gel on the trays in my mouth at least 1 hour each morning, I had expected to see some whitening happen on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;But there has been no change in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I purposely apply the gel to only the front 6 teeth on top and front 6 teeth on the bottom, so I can compare the color to my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;There is no difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had never tried to whiten my teeth before, so this was all new to me. I am a smoker, and originally my teeth ranked an 8 out of 10. After just two 20 minute treatments, my teeth are already down to a shade 5. If you trim the teeth guards correctly so that it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums, there is no sensitivity or discomfort of any kind. Love this and would recommend to anyone trying to whiten their teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering whitening gel from my dentist for years and paying close to $100 for less whitener with only 15% active agent. This is a superior product. I will certainly be ordering Watts whitening gel again in the future. No stinging, no bad taste, and no sensitivity afterwards - just whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Very cheap way to whiten teeth compared to paying a dentist to do so.  I already have custom fit trays for my teeth, so this works great.  I have had no reaction to my gums with this 22% mixture.  Next time I will go ahead and get the 30% mixture.  I probably only use one milliliter for every time I white my teeth, so I get quite a few applications from these two tubes.</li>
            <li> I like it okay.  I really believe that the strips that you can buy OTC are just as good.  Maybe my teeth were already as white as they were going to get.  Shipping and packaging were good.</li>
            <li> This is a great whitener. This is grade A stuff, definitely as good, if not better, than what you&#x27;d get at your dentists office, and definitely much cheaper! I have used this about 5 times now and it brightened my smile a good 4-6 shades which is fantastic! I recommend this to anyone who is looking to reconquer that white smile!     Also, no sensitivity problems at all! I leave it on for 30 mins and have no issues, and will sometimes do 2 back to back 30 min sessions and no issues. Be careful with getting it on the gums though, it can irritate them! Crest Whitestrips are much much more painful and make my teeth more sensitive than this gel, plus this gel works much better! Dn&#x27;t hesitate to get this, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t read the bad reviews. this stuff is great. your teeth will get very white. no sensitivity, easy to use. if u want white teeth at a very reasonable price, get this tooth bleaching gel. the bad reviews must be from dentists cause they are lying. this stuff works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I expected this whitening gel to be like the ones that they sell in the store or the ones that I have purchased in the dentist&#x27;s office but was quite surprised that it wasn&#x27;t.  The results were the same as the professional solution sold by the dentist but the difference is that it didn&#x27;t make my teeth overly sensitive and didn&#x27;t burn my gums.  While my daughter and I were adding things to do on her list before her wedding, I had my trays in with the whitener and had not been timing it as I normally would.  I believe a good 45 minutes passed before I realized that I hadn&#x27;t removed the trays.  With that, I went in and removed the trays, brushed the solution from my teeth and rinsed.  Normally, my gums would have been bright red and burning but this time they were not nor were my teeth sensitive to temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a wonderful job of whitening the teeth.  It is my opinion that this product is equally as effective as what you can purchase at the dentist&#x27;s office at a far lesser price.  I am happy with this product and will continue to buy it and recommend it to others.  My smile is bright white and I have been complimented on it often.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and only for 15-20 minutes each time, and i can already see a big difference! my teeth are extremely sensitive, and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. ;)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;gel\\&quot; was very runny compared to other teeth whitening gels that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Therefore, I used more of it than I think was necessary.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and it is the best you can use for whitening your teeth. It is fast and effective. I store the tubes not in use in the freezer to prolong it&#x27;s effectiveness. Great price, too. I also use the Watts Dental Super Thin Thermo Trays for a great teeth whitening experience that is equal to or superior than that you would get from a dentist. I know because my dentist tells me!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described by the seller. It arrived quickly and is what I wanted. Great seller!</li>
            <li> This product works very well and results are seen after the first use. I have had no problems with this product. It arrived on time and the two large size containers of the gel is a good purchase.     Jon</li>
            <li> Tried this product but after two weeks of daily use saw no effect.  Same strength (22%) product from dentist was much stronger (could feel more on gums) and worked.</li>
            <li> This gel works great if you use it on a tray customized by your own dentist.  I tried it with the one that came with the gel, and the gel was washed away by my saliva within minutes.  Maybe I don&#x27;t know \\&quot;how\\&quot; to use this one size fits all tray.  I even complaint and got some directions from the manufacturer..but still I&#x27;m not doing it right.  Luckily, my dentist made me my own dental tray &amp; I use it with great success.  Sad thing is, I don&#x27;t have a pro-tray for my lower teeth, so my upper teeth is a lot whitter than my lower teeth.  I asked my dentist to make me a tray for the lower but he said it&#x27;s too tricky and best leave it at that.....</li>
            <li> I used to use whitening gel from Opalescence, but when it ran out, I decided to give Watts a try, since it was cheaper and seemed like a good value. But when I received the product, I felt completely duped! They advertise that their product comes in huge 10cc syringes, but behold - a larger syringe does NOT mean more product! The syringe was filled with so many bubbles that I think there was closer to 3-4cc of actual product in the syringe. (see pictures)    The consistency of the gels was also much thinner and runnier than Opalescence. The gel would often spill out of the tray, and it&#x27;s not because I used too much. It seemed like all the gel just ran out of the tray and into my mouth/tongue. I am ditching Watts and going back to Opalescence.     The only redeeming quality about the Watts whitening kit is that it comes with a little metal attachment for the syringe to help you get a more precise application of the gel.    I can&#x27;t really comment on the whitening effects of this product because I only used it for 3 days. This is just too runny for me to want to continue using it until I see an effect.</li>
            <li> Use this on my teeth, and have seen good results. Has a great price point and is very comparable to the stuff you can get from your dentist.</li>
            <li> The product works for me. After first applying I saw that my teeth had become much whiter, not evenly, but segmental. I think I must use the procedure one more to see the final result, but I see - it works! I have a little difficulties when I apply it on teeth (gel turns into a lather but don&#x27;t fix on teeth)&lt;br /&gt;  I have sensitive gums and when gel gets on them - I feel pain. Be careful.</li>
            <li> GREAT gel.  No burning or sensitivity.  Whitens like a charm.  Just follow the instructions and watch those teeth shine, shine, shine!</li>
            <li> Very little irritation on gums with exceptional whitening with comfortable price point. Packaging exceptional for safety and expediency.  Works as well as professional dentist treatment. Highly recommend for coffee drinkers to keep a brilliant smile.</li>
            <li> WOW - this stuff is powerful!  Teeth really got white!!!</li>
