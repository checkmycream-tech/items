    <ol>
            <li>but this is great!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff has excellent pigment!!</li>
            <li>Excellent, just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is awesome.</li>
            <li>This stick is a perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Excellent all was good without any problem</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>
            <li>It is just amazing, lays perfectly on line, does not spread around eyes.</li>
            <li>Not sooo great.</li>
            <li>It is great for people who don&#x27;t want all those chemicals in eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>LOve my LOreal Kohl LIner!!</li>
            <li>, so I will give it a fair three stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably pick up the rest of the colors before this product becomes unavailable for good.  </li>
            <li>Color is good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have found this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this on Amazon having searched for refills for my Kohl containers.  </li>
            <li>So have fun and keep on rockin&#x27;!!!</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with eye make- up remover or in my case coconut oil, and it creates a great exotic look.  </li>
            <li>this eyeliner isnt very easy to apply its not liquid its powder and the powder falls of the tip of the applicator and</li>
            <li>If you wear contacts, I think it would be best to put in your lenses after applying and letting your eyeballs clear a</li>
            <li>Honestly did not expect it will this easy to apply it.</li>
            <li>then on your face then when u try to rub it it smears on your face i am not so satisfied with this product wood</li>
            <li>i love it will deff buy more</li>
            <li>all fairness though the item is not terrible</li>
            <li>I love this kohl.  </li>
            <li>love this kohl.  </li>
            <li>Most of the product was used.  </li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>The burgundy, navy, and brown are equally my favorite, depending on the day.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it</li>
            <li>Gives a sexy, smoky eye.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite powder Kohl eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure your lashes aren&#x27;t in the way.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a precise, sophisticated makeup look, kohl probably is not you.  </li>
            <li>But when I got my Kohl line I was amazed at how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It bends easily.  </li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best used over top of some eyeliner, and then smudged in with an angled brush or a fluffy blending brush, depending on what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>I apply a bit with the applicator provided and use a smudge brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this - I would recommend it to anyone who has brown or black eyes, as it gives great depth to the eye.</li>
            <li>my original.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>If you skip the powder and still need to clean up, you can do so with a q-tip or cotton pad soaked in a bit of silicone-based primer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t  do what I did and have too much expectation, and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Gives your eyes the most intense look.</li>
            <li>This is real kohl, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I always used the Kohl eyeliner and I prefer it to pencil liner as the look the Kohl eyeliner gives your eyes is different and naturally beautiful, and particularly this Kohl liner is not like any I used before.</li>
            <li>Just love my new L&amp;Oacute;real Kohl eye liner.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the only thing that I would change is that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally bend the wand when trying to put it back in the bottle.</li>
            <li>You can do your eyes first, then clean up up with a swipe of toner before doing the rest of your face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading several good reviews of the product, and I was really looking forward to it</li>
            <li>Not a method that I use, but it will probably transfer nicely from the lower lash line to the upper lash line.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try coal eyeliner, but this created so much fallout, that I really wasn&#x27;t able to use it.  </li>
            <li>It perfect just like my Moroccan Black henna for the eyes that I brought with me from Morocco years back!!</li>
            <li>Even the FDA here in the US has tested and found many lipsticks containing trace amounts of lead (without pulling them from the market), so I am even more suspicious of cosmetics that may be manufactured with less restrictive policies or oversight.  </li>
            <li>I guess it is due to its very comfortable handle that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It sets pencil eyeliner very, very well.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because my wife thought it was going to be a higher grade and not so powdery.</li>
            <li>What you see in the photo is exactly what you get</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a medium black, somewhat powdery liner; this is perfect for smoky eyes and/or any sultry look in general.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and last all day.  </li>
            <li>As you apply it, it has a mind of its own and makes a mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for a substitute, doesn&#x27;t last as long as my original from Asia.</li>
            <li>The applicator is much better on this one, as the Guerlain has a traditional hard stick applicator while this has a flexible silicon tip on it, which is more comfortable and grips the powder better, so there is less fallout (there is still a lot</li>
            <li>If you are squeamish about your eyeballs, you can gently dot onto the lash line.</li>
            <li>absolutely what I was searching for</li>
            <li>but really it is a powder on a stick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go in straight and comes out like a U-shape...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, we don&#x27;t really need a crappily designed kohl storage and application device to get the look of kohl...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my eyes look amazing and smoky with very little effort.  </li>
            <li>I have some gripes that it is not packaged with a sanitary seal, but it is discontinued now and pointless to discuss the flaws, so I&#x27;ll move on to how to make it work for you if you own it already and can&#x27;t make it work for you or are looking to try it while it is available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Practice a couple of times to become perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I made a quick video for those of you visual learners.</li>
            <li>I got traditional kohl from the Indian store and it was gritty and seemed in purified; this is pure and the applicator makes it easy to use</li>
            <li>Pity to hear this particular fine product has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Then if you have a little patch that needs more color just use the tip like you would a pencil.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d do better to find a decent eyeshadow, powder it, put it in a narrow bottle, and then just use a blunted stick to apply it.  </li>
            <li>First, gingerly knock off as much excess powder as you can from the sides of the stick back into the container.  </li>
            <li>(those new to loose kohl might need to practice a few times) but it&#x27;s quick, easy and fast to apply.  </li>
            <li>When i bought it, it was labeled as new, so i was expecting to find it with a seal, but unfortunatly it wasnt sealed and i have no waranty if someone used it before.</li>
            <li>I have splashed out on Guerlain&#x27;s kohl in past and this is much more affordable option</li>
            <li>It says that the color is black but on me it looks light grey and it was very dry, I usually love Loreal products but not this one.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s not as dark as I originally thought</li>
            <li>It does create a lovely black like initially.</li>
            <li>Rich black in color...</li>
            <li>Stays all day and gives you a natural smokey eye.</li>
            <li>this is a POWDER eyeliner and not a dried out tube of liquid liner.</li>
            <li>Gently place the tip between your lids, starting in the inner corner and slide horizontally towards your ear.  </li>
            <li>It takes some practice to use powder, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s worth dealing with black powder on your face.  </li>
            <li>I wear it as my everyday waterline liner because it&#x27;s long lasting and sultry without being over the top.</li>
            <li>One bottle  of the Kohl can last nearly a year for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty  dark, but not the darkest color out there.</li>
            <li>It turns out it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I imagined - it&#x27;s not quite as dark as I had hoped -</li>
            <li>It is highly pigmented loose powder shadow in a tube, with a pointed stick-like applicator.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes feel a little dry throughout the day, but not any more than any other powder liner that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li> It makes my eyes feel a little dry throughout the day, but not any more than any other powder liner that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product based on the higher price for a average, if not below average,</li>
            <li> It lots like sand and leads me to say it is even grainier and therefore clumpier than the much cheaper brands my wife uses in the past.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is long lasting and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> but a few blinks will clear it away.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t stay put in my lid so after a long day it&#x27;s all under my lids and looks a bit yucky.</li>
            <li> It came in later than expected &amp; the wand was also bent.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the same look and probably be less likely to get a damn eye infection.&lt;br /&gt;Watch for splinters.&lt;br /&gt;Ha</li>
            <li> This liner is long lasting, does not irritate my eyes (other liners have) and is priced within my budget.</li>
            <li> Dry.  </li>
            <li> This method works because the loose powder is dependent on moisture in order for it to stick.</li>
            <li> I have had very little luck with pencil or liquid liners which I find more difficult to apply and to keep on.</li>
            <li> This seems very dry, and when I apply it there is a lot of residue under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and they get dry, so I rub my eyes quite a bit, and every other type of liner I use ends up giving me raccoon eyes, but not</li>
            <li> Take wand and swipe it across your closed eyelids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things you can do to deal with the inevitable fallout.  </li>
            <li> No worries; I trimmed it so it doesn&#x27;t get crushed</li>
            <li> Powdered kohl is my choice of eyeliner for over thirty years and it was getting harder to find it with each passing year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in other colors, as well.</li>
            <li> the color is dark as i wanted</li>
            <li> only downside to this is the applicator stick is so delicate.  </li>
            <li> it is black and dark.  </li>
            <li> If you put it back in the bottle in the wrong way, the stick will bend, which makes application in the future a pain.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no plastic or anything to let you know someone else previously opened it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this solely because it causing a mess and is not very easy to apply without problems.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is a method that I&#x27;m not aware of to make it work, but I went back to my gel liner after a few tries with this new liner :(</li>
            <li> I ordered two L&#x27;Oreal HiP Kohl Liners - Black and they were both completely dried out.</li>
            <li> So I have this crappy little right-angle thing I have to stuff into the hole and yank out again, and it boings when I use it, which flicks product all over me.  </li>
            <li> Then after you are done, use a fluffy brush and sweep it all away.  </li>
            <li> I use this for a sort of everyday smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I get the point of the gold, though: not much of a liner since its hardly visible&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not go on very well and it looked bad.</li>
            <li> No wrapping as it usually comes in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s packaged that way, as anybody in the store could spit in it and put it back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other Arabic and Indian kohls in the past, but I am wary of them because some have been found to contain lead.  </li>
            <li> very messy!</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and was afraid at first</li>
            <li> This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m always afraid that I&#x27;m smearing bacteria in my eye with every application, but this is just how it&#x27;s done in other countries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unfortunate that it is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> This will pick up the fallout without disturbing your foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was just a bit difficult to use how the package is, in regards to getting it out of the container</li>
            <li> applying this product is very tough to do.</li>
            <li> Whether in powder or stick form, kohl is going to smear and give you blackout crazy rock chic eyes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to stick the wand in your eye, close it, then glide the wand through, but I&#x27;m too afraid of scratching my eyeball, so I just dab it on my waterline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fallout can be bad, but I hold my hand under my eye while applying it, so the fallout falls onto my fingers and hand and not my cheek.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moBCN91VBB3PY9]]I was a bit disappointed,</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this eyeliner isnt very easy to apply its not liquid its powder and the powder falls of the tip of the applicator and then on your face then when u try to rub it it smears on your face i am not so satisfied with this product wood not purchase again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now. This liner is long lasting, does not irritate my eyes (other liners have) and is priced within my budget. I have had very little luck with pencil or liquid liners which I find more difficult to apply and to keep on. One bottle  of the Kohl can last nearly a year for me. I apply a bit with the applicator provided and use a smudge brush to smooth it out. I am very pleased to have found this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back i had looked for this everywhere i love it will deff buy more the color is dark as i wanted</li>
            <li> I like the contents of this eyeliner however I find the container top-heavy so it&#x27;s always falling over in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Saludos a todos, no recomiendo la compra de este producto puesto que no es ni sombra ni delineador. El contenido es polvo y el aplicador es para un producto líquido, por eso al momento de aplicarlo NO FUNCIONA, se riega la sombra y no deja una línea continua como se esperaría. Creo que el producto es bueno es decir la sombra en polvo el color también es muy lindo. Pero la forma en que lo diseñaron y la manera de la aplicación NO funciona. Habría que sacar la sombra del frasco y aplicársela con otro tipo de pincel. La verdad es que me decepcioné de este producto.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because my wife thought it was going to be a higher grade and not so powdery. It lots like sand and leads me to say it is even grainier and therefore clumpier than the much cheaper brands my wife uses in the past. I do not recommend this product based on the higher price for a average, if not below average, product.&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness though the item is not terrible, so I will give it a fair three stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for a substitute, doesn&#x27;t last as long as my original from Asia. But I like Loreal products that is why I tried it and it&lt;br /&gt;Was cheaper then my original.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moBCN91VBB3PY9]]I was a bit disappointed, cause of all the hype placed into this product. Don&#x27;t  do what I did and have too much expectation, and you&#x27;ll love it. It&#x27;s pretty  dark, but not the darkest color out there. It has a bit of glitter, which diminishes it&#x27;s darkness.  If you don&#x27;t know how to apply this type of liner, I suggest you google it before you buy. Essentially this is how it goes; Close your eye lids. Take wand and swipe it across your closed eyelids. Don&#x27;t worry if some residue falls into your eyes. This method works because the loose powder is dependent on moisture in order for it to stick. Practice a couple of times to become perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I made a quick video for those of you visual learners.</li>
            <li> I got traditional kohl from the Indian store and it was gritty and seemed in purified; this is pure and the applicator makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> This is like a powdery Khol so sometimes bits of it get in my eyes and cause a bit of irritation. Also, it doesn&#x27;t stay put in my lid so after a long day it&#x27;s all under my lids and looks a bit yucky. It does create a lovely black like initially.</li>
            <li> It perfect just like my Moroccan Black henna for the eyes that I brought with me from Morocco years back!! Rich black in color...no smears or tears!! I have bad allergies and was afraid at first but this is great!! no irritations!! can recommend to anyone whom has allergies!!</li>
            <li> You are very annoying bad&lt;br /&gt;Burn the eye I hope I did not buy&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that it was not written by the expiration date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------</li>
            <li> An eyeliner that penetrates my waterline and STAYS on it. It would figure that after my decade searching that this is a discontinued product. I will have to stock up on it. ALL MINE. :|</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading several good reviews of the product, and I was really looking forward to it being everything that I wanted in a waterline liner. It turns out it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I imagined - it&#x27;s not quite as dark as I had hoped - but it&#x27;s still one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a medium black, somewhat powdery liner; this is perfect for smoky eyes and/or any sultry look in general. I wear it as my everyday waterline liner because it&#x27;s long lasting and sultry without being over the top. Again, it&#x27;s not as dark as I originally thought but it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>
            <li> Just love my new L&amp;Oacute;real Kohl eye liner. It is just amazing, lays perfectly on line, does not spread around eyes. Honestly did not expect it will this easy to apply it. But when I got my Kohl line I was amazed at how easy it is to apply. I guess it is due to its very comfortable handle that makes it easy to apply. I always used the Kohl eyeliner and I prefer it to pencil liner as the look the Kohl eyeliner gives your eyes is different and naturally beautiful, and particularly this Kohl liner is not like any I used before. LOve my LOreal Kohl LIner!!</li>
            <li> This seems very dry, and when I apply it there is a lot of residue under my eyes. I do not recommend anyone getting this. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It says that the color is black but on me it looks light grey and it was very dry, I usually love Loreal products but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only thing that I would change is that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally bend the wand when trying to put it back in the bottle.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a precise, sophisticated makeup look, kohl probably is not you.  Whether in powder or stick form, kohl is going to smear and give you blackout crazy rock chic eyes.  Sometimes, this is what I am looking for and this kohl does the job- it is black and dark.  I have splashed out on Guerlain&#x27;s kohl in past and this is much more affordable option and it&#x27;s unfortunate that it is discontinued.  I have tried other Arabic and Indian kohls in the past, but I am wary of them because some have been found to contain lead.  Even the FDA here in the US has tested and found many lipsticks containing trace amounts of lead (without pulling them from the market), so I am even more suspicious of cosmetics that may be manufactured with less restrictive policies or oversight.  The applicator is much better on this one, as the Guerlain has a traditional hard stick applicator while this has a flexible silicon tip on it, which is more comfortable and grips the powder better, so there is less fallout (there is still a lot and I have some tips below for that).  I have some gripes that it is not packaged with a sanitary seal, but it is discontinued now and pointless to discuss the flaws, so I&#x27;ll move on to how to make it work for you if you own it already and can&#x27;t make it work for you or are looking to try it while it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the \\&quot;eastern method\\&quot; to apply it, lining your upper and lower lash line simultaneously.  First, gingerly knock off as much excess powder as you can from the sides of the stick back into the container.  Gently place the tip between your lids, starting in the inner corner and slide horizontally towards your ear.  Et Voila!  If you are squeamish about your eyeballs, you can gently dot onto the lash line. Not a method that I use, but it will probably transfer nicely from the lower lash line to the upper lash line.  You get will some in your eyeball but a few blinks will clear it away.  It makes my eyes feel a little dry throughout the day, but not any more than any other powder liner that I&#x27;ve used.  If you wear contacts, I think it would be best to put in your lenses after applying and letting your eyeballs clear a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things you can do to deal with the inevitable fallout.  You can do your eyes first, then clean up up with a swipe of toner before doing the rest of your face. But if you already have foundation applied, don&#x27;t fret- there are tricks!  Apply a liberal amount of translucent powder under your eye before applying the kohl.  Then after you are done, use a fluffy brush and sweep it all away.  If you skip the powder and still need to clean up, you can do so with a q-tip or cotton pad soaked in a bit of silicone-based primer.  This will pick up the fallout without disturbing your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably pick up the rest of the colors before this product becomes unavailable for good.  So have fun and keep on rockin&#x27;!!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this - I would recommend it to anyone who has brown or black eyes, as it gives great depth to the eye.</li>
            <li> I love this kohl.  I use kohl on the waterline and this product stays put.  This is kohl won&#x27;t smudge or smear, and I know that for a fact!  I wear contacts and they get dry, so I rub my eyes quite a bit, and every other type of liner I use ends up giving me raccoon eyes, but not this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is the applicator stick is so delicate.  If you put it back in the bottle in the wrong way, the stick will bend, which makes application in the future a pain.  Once, mine bent entirely and stayed that way, so I had to ditch it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this kohl.  I get it all the time and I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> absolutely what I was searching for</li>
            <li> This was not a good product. It did not go on very well and it looked bad.</li>
            <li> It came in later than expected &amp; the wand was also bent. I don&#x27;t have time for an exchange though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this solely because it causing a mess and is not very easy to apply without problems.</li>
            <li> very messy! applying this product is very tough to do. its meant to be a liner but really it is a powder on a stick. As you apply it, it has a mind of its own and makes a mess. Save you time and money do not buy this liner.</li>
            <li> Product came in an open bottle.  No wrapping as it usually comes in.  Most of the product was used.  Dry.  Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> This stuff has excellent pigment!! Was just a bit difficult to use how the package is, in regards to getting it out of the container</li>
            <li> I wanted to try coal eyeliner, but this created so much fallout, that I really wasn&#x27;t able to use it.  Perhaps there is a method that I&#x27;m not aware of to make it work, but I went back to my gel liner after a few tries with this new liner :(</li>
            <li> It is ok. Not sooo great. Color is good.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Gives your eyes the most intense look. It doesn&#x27;t smudge with me; I apply it to my lower eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in other colors, as well. The burgundy, navy, and brown are equally my favorite, depending on the day. I&#x27;m not sure I get the point of the gold, though: not much of a liner since its hardly visible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the applicator tip hooks into a bent shape with time and use. No worries; I trimmed it so it doesn&#x27;t get crushed anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^__^</li>
            <li> When i bought it, it was labeled as new, so i was expecting to find it with a seal, but unfortunatly it wasnt sealed and i have no waranty if someone used it before.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is awesome. Stays all day and gives you a natural smokey eye. I love this product and would recommend it</li>
            <li> Love it!  Easy to apply (those new to loose kohl might need to practice a few times) but it&#x27;s quick, easy and fast to apply.  Gives a sexy, smoky eye.  I get tons of compliments when I use this!</li>
            <li> This is a traditional, Middle Eastern, kohl, POWDER liner.  You&#x27;re supposed to apply it to the waterline in your eye.  I&#x27;ve purchased this for years in the stores.  For some reason it doesn&#x27;t have any packaging.  What you see in the photo is exactly what you get and there&#x27;s no plastic or anything to let you know someone else previously opened it.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s packaged that way, as anybody in the store could spit in it and put it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may irritate the eyes of some people, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem, even when I wear contact lenses.  I use it with Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion to keep it from sliding off my waterline.  The fallout can be bad, but I hold my hand under my eye while applying it, so the fallout falls onto my fingers and hand and not my cheek.  You&#x27;re supposed to stick the wand in your eye, close it, then glide the wand through, but I&#x27;m too afraid of scratching my eyeball, so I just dab it on my waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the applicator was somehow different.  It bends easily.  Plus I&#x27;m always afraid that I&#x27;m smearing bacteria in my eye with every application, but this is just how it&#x27;s done in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my eyes look amazing and smoky with very little effort.  I&#x27;ve never found another product for the price that can do what it does.  My only gripe is that I wish it was darker or that the packaging was somehow different.</li>
            <li> I ordered two L&#x27;Oreal HiP Kohl Liners - Black and they were both completely dried out. No stars for this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite powder Kohl eyeliner.  This stick is a perfect size.  Glides on easily and last all day.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is real kohl, and I love it. It is great for people who don&#x27;t want all those chemicals in eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the stick keeps getting bent, it is starting to annoy me! It doesn&#x27;t go in straight and comes out like a U-shape... I can still work with it though but I would take 2 stars off.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d do better to find a decent eyeshadow, powder it, put it in a narrow bottle, and then just use a blunted stick to apply it.  The rubbery applicator in this product almost immediately BENT itself, at a 45 degree angle.  I returned it for another, thinking it was malfunctioning, and the replacement did the same thing.  So I have this crappy little right-angle thing I have to stuff into the hole and yank out again, and it boings when I use it, which flicks product all over me.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this bottle is a germ-trap.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, we don&#x27;t really need a crappily designed kohl storage and application device to get the look of kohl...just take a stick of some sort, get it covered with color, close your eye on it, then withdraw outward.  You&#x27;ll get the same look and probably be less likely to get a damn eye infection.&lt;br /&gt;Watch for splinters.&lt;br /&gt;Ha ha.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this on Amazon having searched for refills for my Kohl containers.  This eye liner is long lasting and non-irritating.  Powdered kohl is my choice of eyeliner for over thirty years and it was getting harder to find it with each passing year.  Pity to hear this particular fine product has been discontinued.  Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to use powder, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s worth dealing with black powder on your face.  It comes off easily with eye make- up remover or in my case coconut oil, and it creates a great exotic look.  Just stick the tip in the corner of your eye, close our eye and draw the stick across the inside of the eye.  Just make sure your lashes aren&#x27;t in the way.  I also like to draw the stick across my eye 2or 3 times without re-dipping the stick.  Then if you have a little patch that needs more color just use the tip like you would a pencil. Just make sure you know this is a POWDER eyeliner and not a dried out tube of liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Excellent all was good without any problem</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I find it&#x27;s best used over top of some eyeliner, and then smudged in with an angled brush or a fluffy blending brush, depending on what you&#x27;re going for. It sets pencil eyeliner very, very well. I use this for a sort of everyday smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP IN MIND, this is NOT traditional eyeliner. It is highly pigmented loose powder shadow in a tube, with a pointed stick-like applicator. I actually like the applicator, I do get some fallout when I apply but that&#x27;s cleaned up easily enough.</li>
