            <li>Totally amazing.  </li>
            <li>It looked amazing and had a 3D effect.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if the product was as stated.</li>
            <li>and she liked it.</li>
            <li>Manicurist was going to just use the Miss Piggy but had virtually no colour on its own - despite appearance in bottle.  </li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>All in all this was a nice change to my collection</li>
            <li>, I felt like my toes were bursting with cheerful happiness.</li>
            <li>I love the name more than I love the polish!</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish, by far the best</li>
            <li>but i love the muppets and opi, great match, thank u for the fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Worked better if I out it over another color.</li>
            <li>It should not take that many coats unless nail polish remover might have been added to it or something else.</li>
            <li>thank&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>i love opi period.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of nail lacquer.</li>
            <li>Let me also say that I love OPI Nail Polish</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more colors in this brand.</li>
            <li>I love the glitter.</li>
            <li>Thw nail polish is ok.</li>
            <li>However, this is simply a \\&quot;top coat\\&quot; with glitter.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to even know how many layers it would take to achieve the look in the stock photo,</li>
            <li>For those complaining of the price this collection came out almost a year ago and if you didn&#x27;t stock up then that&#x27;s why you are paying more now.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this polish.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkles but wish that the polish went on &amp;#34;redder&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>top coat</li>
            <li>it is so sparkly, i just love wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love this polish from OPI and couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was compared to purchasing it at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this glitter</li>
            <li>I have tried just on my nails, tried primer, paint and top coat, and tried varying times around my menstrual cycle</li>
            <li>It is very rich looking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good nail polish but the photo is very misleading.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Ive ordered other OPI nail polish and was very happy with them.</li>
            <li>The glitter is bulky and does not go on easy .</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick and the polish was wrapped in bubble wrap to prevent breakage.  </li>
            <li>Two coats are needed and does not chip as easily.</li>
            <li>love a great bargain and it definitely was.</li>
            <li>I want so many more bottles of this polish because I love the color and the coverage just that much.</li>
            <li>release.&lt;br /&gt;Despite ordering the item almost a year and a half after the movie&#x27;s 2011 release, the bottle I received was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I got this for christmas nail art and its amazing for jelly sandwiches, i layered it with fresh frog of bell aire and that looked cool</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve a very pretty look that received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>it was so eye catching, hence the large pieces of glitter which by the way came out of my bottle just fine.</li>
            <li>Most OPI collections are in such high demand when they release its best if you fall in love with a color, buy multiples because you may never get it at that price again or even be able to get that particular color again.</li>
            <li>After cleaning up two aquariums I did need some light touch up.  </li>
            <li>Off the top, this is not an opaque color, it is very very translucent</li>
            <li>I had to first apply my favorite nail polish</li>
            <li>The nail polish color and mix is sooooo unique.</li>
            <li>Went on almost clear, the sparkles more prominent than color.</li>
            <li>This polish is great however like the previous reviews it is very translucent however If you are an OPI fan you have the perfect red to make it pop.</li>
            <li>its more like a glitter top coat so yea in less u want to buy it for a top Glitter coat!</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that I was going to get a full coverage glitter nail polish; from the way it looks in the bottle, that is what you would think.</li>
            <li>they have such good quality polishs</li>
            <li>Love this nailpolish, very fesive.  </li>
            <li>The photo makes it look like a gorgeous red nail polish with glitter accents</li>
            <li>The price is a little more than I expect though, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Red is my color of choice for them, especially in the summer, and this one is the best and brightest.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>The more the coat the darker and personally the better the polish.</li>
            <li>I love red and do not wear it often, however this is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful, i just bought the green one as well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got home to try it... when I put on the first coat</li>
            <li>Another pretty color!</li>
            <li>To get the look of the picture, you&#x27;d have to paint your nails red and then put this over as a top coat!</li>
            <li>you do have to wear some red polish underneath it and then apply the sparkle on top which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>my opinion: worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And looking at my sparkling toes brings a smile to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It shows up nicely on any red toned nail lacquer.  </li>
            <li>Nice polish to add sparkle over your red color.</li>
            <li>so I jumped right in and applied a \\&quot;Sample Run\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>the silver glitter pieces are very large.</li>
            <li>Complete full coverage with 2 coats!</li>
            <li>and I do like the color of the polish very much.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty</li>
            <li>I got this to make my nails pretty for Christmas</li>
            <li>Had this done recently at nail salon and just love it.  </li>
            <li>funny</li>
            <li>The picture shows exactly how the nails will look after you use this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have never been interested in nail polish that was this involved with sparkle</li>
            <li>and it was definitely pretty.</li>
            <li>This is obviously meant for a top coat effect.  </li>
            <li>they all seem to stick on the sides of the bottle more than actually coming out.</li>
            <li>I tried OPI Red underneath and added two top coats of this.</li>
            <li>This polish is really pretty</li>
            <li>I love the color personally.</li>
            <li>you are looking for full coverage glitter, check out Sally Hansen&#x27;s new Gem Crush colors.</li>
            <li>I love OPI&#x27;s formula, because it lasts a pretty long time without chipping.</li>
            <li>However, make sure you have a good quality nail polish remover, as the glitter is difficult to get off.</li>
            <li>, i love the red in this and it is pretty thin, but the glitters dont sink so its a great formula.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed at first when I purchased this nail polish.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m considering the other Muppets Collection because I enjoy unique colors.</li>
            <li>this is a very vibrant color and the sparkles add some zest to it.</li>
            <li>for a glitter nail polish this is pretty decent but instead of giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li>dries quite fast tho</li>
            <li>but I need to use 5 coats to get anything to really show up on the nail.</li>
            <li>it goes really well</li>
            <li>This is a very sparkly holiday color</li>
            <li>and my nails looked really festive.</li>
            <li>It is really glitzy</li>
            <li>I have to do 1 coat of a red polish I have, 3 coats of Gettin Miss Piggy With It and 1 clear top coat.  </li>
            <li>but it was more clear with red and silver sparkles.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>It is vibrant and very glittery.</li>
            <li>The red glitter is quite large and you can actually see how many edges each piece has, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My little girls like to play with it so we are using it; but I wanted to use it more.  </li>
            <li>This is really just clear polish with glitter in it.</li>
            <li>The green version of this is not any better.</li>
            <li>My mom tried to find a cheaper version of the nail polish in other stores, but the other qualities are not as good, so she decided to steal mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only useful as a topcoat over another polish.</li>
            <li>Drying wise, it doesn&#x27;t dry fast nor is it slow.</li>
            <li>This color is pretty, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the big fat silver sparkles.</li>
            <li>The thing that makes this polish unique is that it has silver glitter mixed in with the red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the look in this misleading stock photo, you will need to first apply a layer or two of opaque red lacquer, followed by a minimum of two coats of the featured polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty, but I wish I had just bought something with smaller pieces of glitter.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the product was shown on nails both with a first coat of red</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but definitely nothing like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, but I didn&#x27;t read close enough as it&#x27;s a cover - it&#x27;s not a glitter polish as I though by just looking at the picture.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 because after two coats there are barely any silver pieces on my nails they aren&#x27;t really coming out, and</li>
            <li>This is really pretty for a concert or something, but you of course have to put a solid red-ish color on underneath.</li>
            <li>but if I ever go out on a date and wear red this is certainly the nails I would be rocking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear polish with flecks of glitter.  </li>
            <li>but this red was too much to pass up</li>
            <li>WHEN ITS SO HEAVY BUT OPI POLISHS  are so neat and clean</li>
            <li>I usually wear apple red polish on my nail and just put this over top of it.</li>
            <li>I recommend no less than two coats of top coat as the rather large size of the glitter makes it difficult to cover with</li>
            <li>My old nail polish just pealed off almost completely after such abuse.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is a glitter nail polish with fairly large pieces of red glitter mixed in with the translucent red lacquer.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating as the nail polish is clear with a lit cast of red .</li>
            <li>The nailpolish is clear with red glitter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear polish with red glitter!  </li>
            <li>just clear nail polish with red glitter.</li>
            <li>as the other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much coverage as the photo makes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The photo makes it look like a gorgeous red nail polish with glitter accents</li>
            <li> The price is a little more than I expect though, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Red is my color of choice for them, especially in the summer, and this one is the best and brightest.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> The more the coat the darker and personally the better the polish.</li>
            <li> I love red and do not wear it often, however this is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, i just bought the green one as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got home to try it... when I put on the first coat</li>
            <li> Another pretty color!</li>
            <li> To get the look of the picture, you&#x27;d have to paint your nails red and then put this over as a top coat!</li>
            <li> you do have to wear some red polish underneath it and then apply the sparkle on top which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> my opinion: worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And looking at my sparkling toes brings a smile to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It shows up nicely on any red toned nail lacquer.  </li>
            <li> Nice polish to add sparkle over your red color.</li>
            <li> so I jumped right in and applied a \\&quot;Sample Run\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> the silver glitter pieces are very large.</li>
            <li> Complete full coverage with 2 coats!</li>
            <li> and I do like the color of the polish very much.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty</li>
            <li> I got this to make my nails pretty for Christmas</li>
            <li> Had this done recently at nail salon and just love it.  </li>
            <li> funny</li>
            <li> The picture shows exactly how the nails will look after you use this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in nail polish that was this involved with sparkle</li>
            <li> and it was definitely pretty.</li>
            <li> This is obviously meant for a top coat effect.  </li>
            <li> they all seem to stick on the sides of the bottle more than actually coming out.</li>
            <li> I tried OPI Red underneath and added two top coats of this.</li>
            <li> This polish is really pretty</li>
            <li> I love the color personally.</li>
            <li> you are looking for full coverage glitter, check out Sally Hansen&#x27;s new Gem Crush colors.</li>
            <li> I love OPI&#x27;s formula, because it lasts a pretty long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> However, make sure you have a good quality nail polish remover, as the glitter is difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> , i love the red in this and it is pretty thin, but the glitters dont sink so its a great formula.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed at first when I purchased this nail polish.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m considering the other Muppets Collection because I enjoy unique colors.</li>
            <li> this is a very vibrant color and the sparkles add some zest to it.</li>
            <li> for a glitter nail polish this is pretty decent but instead of giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li> dries quite fast tho</li>
            <li> but I need to use 5 coats to get anything to really show up on the nail.</li>
            <li> it goes really well</li>
            <li> This is a very sparkly holiday color</li>
            <li> and my nails looked really festive.</li>
            <li> It is really glitzy</li>
            <li> I have to do 1 coat of a red polish I have, 3 coats of Gettin Miss Piggy With It and 1 clear top coat.  </li>
            <li> but it was more clear with red and silver sparkles.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> It is vibrant and very glittery.</li>
            <li> The red glitter is quite large and you can actually see how many edges each piece has, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My little girls like to play with it so we are using it; but I wanted to use it more.  </li>
            <li> This is really just clear polish with glitter in it.</li>
            <li> The green version of this is not any better.</li>
            <li> My mom tried to find a cheaper version of the nail polish in other stores, but the other qualities are not as good, so she decided to steal mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only useful as a topcoat over another polish.</li>
            <li> Drying wise, it doesn&#x27;t dry fast nor is it slow.</li>
            <li> This color is pretty, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the big fat silver sparkles.</li>
            <li> The thing that makes this polish unique is that it has silver glitter mixed in with the red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the look in this misleading stock photo, you will need to first apply a layer or two of opaque red lacquer, followed by a minimum of two coats of the featured polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty, but I wish I had just bought something with smaller pieces of glitter.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the product was shown on nails both with a first coat of red</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but definitely nothing like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, but I didn&#x27;t read close enough as it&#x27;s a cover - it&#x27;s not a glitter polish as I though by just looking at the picture.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 because after two coats there are barely any silver pieces on my nails they aren&#x27;t really coming out, and</li>
            <li> This is really pretty for a concert or something, but you of course have to put a solid red-ish color on underneath.</li>
            <li> but if I ever go out on a date and wear red this is certainly the nails I would be rocking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear polish with flecks of glitter.  </li>
            <li> but this red was too much to pass up</li>
            <li> WHEN ITS SO HEAVY BUT OPI POLISHS  are so neat and clean</li>
            <li> I usually wear apple red polish on my nail and just put this over top of it.</li>
            <li> I recommend no less than two coats of top coat as the rather large size of the glitter makes it difficult to cover with</li>
            <li> My old nail polish just pealed off almost completely after such abuse.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is a glitter nail polish with fairly large pieces of red glitter mixed in with the translucent red lacquer.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating as the nail polish is clear with a lit cast of red .</li>
            <li> The nailpolish is clear with red glitter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear polish with red glitter!  </li>
            <li> just clear nail polish with red glitter.</li>
            <li> as the other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much coverage as the photo makes</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the silver glitter in the right places on my nails</li>
            <li> It was not clear to me that with the polish alone it would be see through in some areas.  </li>
            <li> 5 coats of polish takes awhile to apply and to dry.</li>
            <li> Then I discovered this item was a Muppet Movie product tie-in, meaning it was limited</li>
            <li> This nail polish stayed strong even after a long afternoon of aquarium cleaning so this ( and the color base coat) out performed my old polish.  </li>
            <li> use with a coat of solid red for a base, as light or lighter than the shade of red glitter.</li>
            <li> And with that many coats, I&#x27;m finding it nearly impossible to get off my toenails.</li>
            <li> I tried this with a black base as well and used one thick coat of the red sparkle and it gave the black a whole new depth that I was really digging and that may be a look I could wear somewhat regular.</li>
            <li> The picture must have at least 8 coats of nailpolish to get such a lustrious red color.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> i rEALLY GET TIRED OF BYING IT</li>
            <li> The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> im careful not to scrape the brush coming out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy and additional red base nail polish...and put this on top.</li>
            <li> so we used slightly sparking red Opi base coat with Miss Piggy on top.  </li>
            <li> There are big-like pearls in the polish and viberant colors that other mimick polish cannot do.</li>
            <li> the Muppets Collection seemed watered down from something what I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and it said that it takes quite a few coats, and it does.</li>
            <li> but it is a little deceiving in the picture.  </li>
            <li> If you use this glitter product alone, your nails will be chunky and unevenly colored.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would work for everyday or festive nail color, as well.</li>
            <li> Now Im eager to buy the green one.</li>
            <li> but it was not a good consistency like my other glitter polishes.</li>
            <li> I purchase a lot of OPI Nail polishes usually at the store.</li>
            <li> This is my first on Amazon and I am disappointed with the polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for sparkle polishes, but when I saw this one on Amazon, I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I selected OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Big Apple Red, 0.5 Ounce\\&quot; to go under this polish, for a color base.  </li>
            <li> Please note, you will need to use a base color like solid red to create the look.</li>
            <li> With the red base I only needed two coats of this polish to get the look</li>
            <li> hardly any glitter at all.</li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy a red polish and then add at least 6 coats just to get the look in the pic!!!</li>
            <li> You have to do at least four coats before sparkles start to stick</li>
            <li> Way too thick.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all and was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The polish is clear with read sparkles it doesn&#x27;t have a tinted base to it.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed looks nothing like the picture its 50% white glitter bits.</li>
            <li> I used a glittery red polish as a base then applied 3 coats of this polish.</li>
            <li> Or they must have used a red base coat.  </li>
            <li> I did a base coat of red and layered the glitter</li>
            <li> It might help to have a solid base coat so it all comes out like the picture.</li>
            <li> so I used OPI Red as a base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress as a base for a darker effect.</li>
            <li> Kinda not impressed cause it doesn&#x27;t go on like how it shows on there</li>
            <li> Random selection at a salon</li>
            <li> The color over another red as a base makes your nails look as if they are glowing!</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing bad I can say about this nail polish or any OPI polish!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed:</li>
            <li> Horrible polish!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Kinda not impressed cause it doesn&#x27;t go on like how it shows on there its more like a glitter top coat so yea in less u want to buy it for a top Glitter coat! But great color</li>
            <li> Random selection at a salon, I felt like my toes were bursting with cheerful happiness. Then I discovered this item was a Muppet Movie product tie-in, meaning it was limited release.&lt;br /&gt;Despite ordering the item almost a year and a half after the movie&#x27;s 2011 release, the bottle I received was in excellent condition. It worked just as well as it had in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUST use with a coat of solid red for a base, as light or lighter than the shade of red glitter. If you use this glitter product alone, your nails will be chunky and unevenly colored. The glitter will not show up as nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the larger silver circles in the glitter mix are heavier. You have to tilt the bottle at an angle and fish them out with the brush, then wipe them with intention onto the nails... If you want silver bits on EVERY nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion: worth every penny. OPI is the only polish I use. It never strips my nails and looks amazing. And looking at my sparkling toes brings a smile to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I hope OPI will continue to produce glitter products like this in the future.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed looks nothing like the picture its 50% white glitter bits.</li>
            <li> This product has &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; in it that don&#x27;t mix well. Went on almost clear, the sparkles more prominent than color. Worked better if I out it over another color.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be. I even bought an extra one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that I was going to get a full coverage glitter nail polish; from the way it looks in the bottle, that is what you would think. I was so excited when I got home to try it... when I put on the first coat I was very disappointed: hardly any glitter at all. It took FIVE coats to get the look I wanted. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for full coverage glitter, check out Sally Hansen&#x27;s new Gem Crush colors. Complete full coverage with 2 coats!</li>
            <li> takes forever to take off because of the glitter! dries quite fast tho</li>
            <li> I purchase a lot of OPI Nail polishes usually at the store. This is my first on Amazon and I am disappointed with the polish. I heard good things about glitter polish from OPI but Gettin&#x27; Miss Piggy form the Muppets Collection seemed watered down from something what I don&#x27;t know but it was not a good consistency like my other glitter polishes. It is pretty but I need to use 5 coats to get anything to really show up on the nail. It should not take that many coats unless nail polish remover might have been added to it or something else. Would have been nice if the product was as stated.</li>
            <li> I love OPI&#x27;s formula, because it lasts a pretty long time without chipping. This color is pretty, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the big fat silver sparkles.</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish is perfect for holidays it goes really well onother red color under and the delivery was so fats thank&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> i love opi period. they have such good quality polishs i rEALLY GET TIRED OF BYING IT WHEN ITS SO HEAVY BUT OPI POLISHS  are so neat and clean this is the perfect polish for a night on the town..</li>
            <li> It is too clunky. Doesn&#x27;t cover well unless there is a big glob of polish.  I have never had this experience with OPI.  The green version of this is not any better.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for the Christmas season.  I was thrilled to see the product was going to work perfectly for that purpose!  It is very rich looking and I can&#x27;t wait to work on some nail art with this polish.</li>
            <li> Another pretty color!</li>
            <li> I got this to make my nails pretty for Christmas and it worked but it is not as the picture shows. I used a glittery red polish as a base then applied 3 coats of this polish. It was hard to get the silver glitter in the right places on my nails but after some frustration and lots of re-do&#x27;s I was able to achieve a very pretty look that received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> For some time now, I have wanted sparkly nail polish for my toes. Red is my color of choice for them, especially in the summer, and this one is the best and brightest. I suppose it would work for everyday or festive nail color, as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of nail lacquer. It is the best quality around and this seller was well priced. This is a very sparkly holiday color and I will use it when I want to celebrate anything. It arrived quickly and was packaged well. This was a great seller and I am a very happy buyer.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating as the nail polish is clear with a lit cast of red . The glitter is bulky and does not go on easy . I had to first apply my favorite nail polish and then the OPI nail polish as there was no color to the nail. I would  not recommend this nail color nail polish to anyone . Ive ordered other OPI nail polish and was very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Love this nailpolish, very fesive.  However, make sure you have a good quality nail polish remover, as the glitter is difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I want so many more bottles of this polish because I love the color and the coverage just that much.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is a glitter nail polish with fairly large pieces of red glitter mixed in with the translucent red lacquer. The thing that makes this polish unique is that it has silver glitter mixed in with the red. The silver glitter makes up about 1/10 of the mixture and the silver glitter pieces are about 2/3 the size of the red glitter. The red glitter is quite large and you can actually see how many edges each piece has, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the look in this misleading stock photo, you will need to first apply a layer or two of opaque red lacquer, followed by a minimum of two coats of the featured polish. I recommend no less than two coats of top coat as the rather large size of the glitter makes it difficult to cover with just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty, but I wish I had just bought something with smaller pieces of glitter.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick and the polish was wrapped in bubble wrap to prevent breakage.  I am very pleased with the supplier.  Let me also say that I love OPI Nail Polish and I do like the color of the polish very much.  I do wish that the product was shown on nails both with a first coat of red and then just 3 coats of this color.  It was not clear to me that with the polish alone it would be see through in some areas.  To get the look I desire I have to do 1 coat of a red polish I have, 3 coats of Gettin Miss Piggy With It and 1 clear top coat.  5 coats of polish takes awhile to apply and to dry.</li>
            <li> With Christmas almost always on my mind, I had to get this glittering red nail polish when I happened across it.  I selected OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Big Apple Red, 0.5 Ounce\\&quot; to go under this polish, for a color base.  Of course I couldn&#x27;t leave it, untried until Christmas so I jumped right in and applied a \\&quot;Sample Run\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s working beautifully, even through my work days ( I&#x27;m a homemaker which means I do a bit of almost everything).  After cleaning up two aquariums I did need some light touch up.  My old nail polish just pealed off almost completely after such abuse.  This nail polish stayed strong even after a long afternoon of aquarium cleaning so this ( and the color base coat) out performed my old polish.  I have already ordered more colors in this brand.</li>
            <li> The nail polish color and mix is sooooo unique. It is vibrant and very glittery. My mom tried to find a cheaper version of the nail polish in other stores, but the other qualities are not as good, so she decided to steal mine. There are big-like pearls in the polish and viberant colors that other mimick polish cannot do. Now Im eager to buy the green one. The price is a little more than I expect though, but it is a good product. Two coats are needed and does not chip as easily. The more the coat the darker and personally the better the polish. Drying wise, it doesn&#x27;t dry fast nor is it slow.</li>
            <li> Perfect bling for the Christmas or St Valentines&#x27;s Day bling. I love the glitter. It did take 4-5 coats to obtain coverage. The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> Thw nail polish is ok. You have to coat it two or three times for the color to show. I usually wear apple red polish on my nail and just put this over top of it.</li>
            <li> The picture must have at least 8 coats of nailpolish to get such a lustrious red color. Or they must have used a red base coat.  The nailpolish is clear with red glitter.  It is pretty, but definitely nothing like the picture.  I am going to try using it over red nailpolish to try to get the same effect as pictured.</li>
            <li> like it the color and last like for ever very good, if you like it you could get it because is very good</li>
            <li> Anything from OPI is better than good!  There&#x27;s nothing bad I can say about this nail polish or any OPI polish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good nail polish but the photo is very misleading. The polish is clear with read sparkles it doesn&#x27;t have a tinted base to it.</li>
            <li> Just this ciate is real good nail, and this color is prettyJust this ciate is real good nail, and this color is pretty</li>
            <li> I was really bummed at first when I purchased this nail polish. I bought it based on the picture...which is an amazing red/glittery polish. However, this is simply a \\&quot;top coat\\&quot; with glitter. I had to go out and buy and additional red base nail polish...and put this on top. It adds a great glittery shine...but, I felt that the picture was misleading.</li>
            <li> Love this polish it is great for the holidays...the day after I received it t went to my nail girl to have her do a pedicure</li>
            <li> Had this done recently at nail salon and just love it.  Manicurist was going to just use the Miss Piggy but had virtually no colour on its own - despite appearance in bottle.  I suggested it was actually a glaze/top coat so we used slightly sparking red Opi base coat with Miss Piggy on top.  Totally amazing.  SO Christmassy.  Was going to have toes Minxed but changed my mind and had this instead to match.</li>
            <li> This is really just clear polish with glitter in it. This takes multiple coats to make it red, but it never even comes close to the picture or the color you see in the bottle..</li>
            <li> This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but I didn&#x27;t read close enough as it&#x27;s a cover - it&#x27;s not a glitter polish as I though by just looking at the picture.  To get the look of the picture, you&#x27;d have to paint your nails red and then put this over as a top coat!</li>
            <li> I love red and do not wear it often, however this is absolutely adorable. and the Name? funny but i love the muppets and opi, great match, thank u for the fast shipping !</li>
            <li> The picture shows exactly how the nails will look after you use this nail polish. Please note, you will need to use a base color like solid red to create the look. Nice color.</li>
            <li> I did a base coat of red and layered the glitter and my nails looked really festive. Perfect for X-mas, valentines day, birthday, 4th of July, and anyday.</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas nail art and its amazing for jelly sandwiches, i layered it with fresh frog of bell aire and that looked cool, i love the red in this and it is pretty thin, but the glitters dont sink so its a great formula.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and it said that it takes quite a few coats, and it does. But I still love it! It might help to have a solid base coat so it all comes out like the picture.</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in nail polish that was this involved with sparkle but this red was too much to pass up so I tried. Off the top, this is not an opaque color, it is very very translucent and I don&#x27;t want to even know how many layers it would take to achieve the look in the stock photo, so I used OPI Red as a base. With the red base I only needed two coats of this polish to get the look and it was definitely pretty. Not something I would wear all the time but if I ever go out on a date and wear red this is certainly the nails I would be rocking. I tried this with a black base as well and used one thick coat of the red sparkle and it gave the black a whole new depth that I was really digging and that may be a look I could wear somewhat regular. All in all this was a nice change to my collection and now I&#x27;m considering the other Muppets Collection because I enjoy unique colors. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks NOTHING like it does in the picture! Horrible polish! You have to do at least four coats before sparkles start to stick</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be red with sparkles but it was more clear with red and silver sparkles.  Not what I expected at all and was disappointing.  My little girls like to play with it so we are using it; but I wanted to use it more.  Oh, well.  Don&#x27;t let the picture fool you.</li>
            <li> This is obviously meant for a top coat effect.  It shows up nicely on any red toned nail lacquer.  Great for the holidays or Valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for sparkle polishes, but when I saw this one on Amazon, I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;But as the other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much coverage as the photo makes one assume.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about EIGHT coats to get the look I wanted. Way too thick. And with that many coats, I&#x27;m finding it nearly impossible to get off my toenails.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish, by far the best and this one does need a bottom layer of red to get the color in the stock photo, for a glitter nail polish this is pretty decent but instead of giving it 5 stars I gave it 4 because after two coats there are barely any silver pieces on my nails they aren&#x27;t really coming out, and im careful not to scrape the brush coming out of the bottle they all seem to stick on the sides of the bottle more than actually coming out.</li>
            <li> This polish is great however like the previous reviews it is very translucent however If you are an OPI fan you have the perfect red to make it pop. I tried OPI Red underneath and added two top coats of this. It looked amazing and had a 3D effect. Everywhere I went I was complimented on my nails especially around the holiday season, women were actually stopping me it was so eye catching, hence the large pieces of glitter which by the way came out of my bottle just fine. I&#x27;ve also used I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress as a base for a darker effect. For those complaining of the price this collection came out almost a year ago and if you didn&#x27;t stock up then that&#x27;s why you are paying more now. Most OPI collections are in such high demand when they release its best if you fall in love with a color, buy multiples because you may never get it at that price again or even be able to get that particular color again.</li>
            <li> I love the name more than I love the polish! This Polish DOES NOT look like the picture portrays. You have to add a red bottom to get this look. Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> This polish is really pretty but it is a little deceiving in the picture.  It is really glitzy the silver glitter pieces are very large.</li>
            <li> this is a very vibrant color and the sparkles add some zest to it. I love the color personally. You will to!</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish. I just wish they might have kept the silver hex glitter out, or added smaller silver glitter to go with it. The color over another red as a base makes your nails look as if they are glowing! Perfect for the holiday season!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.  From the picture, I was expecting a glittery red polish.  It&#x27;s a clear polish with flecks of glitter.  It&#x27;s only useful as a topcoat over another polish.</li>
            <li> I love the sparkles but wish that the polish went on &amp;#34;redder&amp;#34;. I ended up painting my nails white and adding this as a &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34; top coat</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! it is so sparkly, i just love wearing it. you do have to wear some red polish underneath it and then apply the sparkle on top which is fine with me. It is beautiful, i just bought the green one as well.</li>
            <li> Polish did not separate correctly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was JUST GLITTER!! The photo makes it look like a gorgeous red nail polish with glitter accents but no! It&#x27;s clear polish with red glitter!  I had to go out and buy a red polish and then add at least 6 coats just to get the look in the pic!!! Very disappointed! Not to mention its a pain to remove!!! But all glitter nail polish is! Sigh...</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Nice polish to add sparkle over your red color.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty for a concert or something, but you of course have to put a solid red-ish color on underneath.</li>
            <li> I love this polish from OPI and couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was compared to purchasing it at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I love a great bargain and it definitely was.</li>
            <li> I love this glitter I only wish it would stick to my nails... I have tried just on my nails, tried primer, paint and top coat, and tried varying times around my menstrual cycle incase oil on the nails was effecting the paints adhering abilities to my nail... I have loved OPI ever since i was introduced to the line in cosmetology school. but with in 24 hrs of applying this paint it will begin to lift and peel off.</li>
            <li> just clear nail polish with red glitter.</li>
