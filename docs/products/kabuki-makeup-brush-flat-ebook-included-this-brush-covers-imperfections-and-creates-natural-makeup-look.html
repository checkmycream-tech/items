            <li>I love the feel of the brush and most of all how evenly my powder is applied to my face when using the brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay kabuki brush</li>

            <li>I just received my kabuki brush and love it.</li>
            <li>This kabuki flat top brush is the best!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this kabuki brush from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After applying it with a foundation brush, I then use a flat top kabuki to flawlessly brush it onto the skin.</li>
            <li>I used it to apply my bronzer, and I feel like I got a beautiful, even application - specifically because of the flat top!</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it, and it&#x27;s sleek and clean.</li>
            <li>Super soft, shed-less brush that works perfectly with mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and applies my blush beautifully.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t shed, it&#x27;s soft and smoothes out my foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush and would make a fabulous addition to any make up bag using mineral based powders, blushes, or bronzers!!!</li>
            <li>Now that I am using this brush, it is easy to apply light and even coverage!</li>
            <li>Nice weight, no shedding, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>and i have got to say i am impressed i dont really know about make up brushes much</li>
            <li>It feels great in your hand.. very professional.</li>
            <li>Works great with my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality kabuki brush for good price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and allow for great coverage.</li>
            <li>Soft and great coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is soft yet allows me to applies my powder foundation with great coverage.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, no shedding, great coverage.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice weight to it, the bristles are soft and well shaped, the metal piece (I&#x27;m sure it has a name, but don&#x27;t know what it is!)</li>
            <li>I recently lost my makeup bag and all of my good brushes were in it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and glad I went with this purchase.</li>
            <li>that hold them together seems sturdy and smooth, and most importantly it holds the powder</li>
            <li>It washes out easily, and retains its softness after washing.</li>
            <li>I had never used a brush for liquid makeup before, but the dense brush made it easy.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to apply the makeup with this one.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply the product.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>got here very quick</li>
            <li>The design of this brush allows for easy application and blending.</li>
            <li>So the question was how to figure out which one I would get, this was an easy decision for me.  </li>
            <li>It spreads the powder fairly evenly so application is pretty quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were soft and allowed the makeup to move around giving a very nice even and light layer of foundation.  </li>
            <li>I use bare minerals and Clinique products and this brush works great with them.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals and wasn&#x27;t happy with their brushes that they give you in their starter kit.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Simply Essentials brushes, they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>This brush is very very soft and feels good on your face.</li>
            <li>The brush portion is the perfect length to get a good coverage, not too short, not too long.</li>
            <li>The hair is super soft but the density is great.</li>
            <li>I do have to add that I also don&#x27;t have to use near as much powder to achieve such smooth, flawless and amazing coverage!</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to since I&#x27;ve always used sponges, but it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>This little brush is the best thing going.</li>
            <li>Perfect little brush for mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is the best Kabuki brush, hands down!  </li>
            <li>That is a HUGE plus in my book.</li>
            <li>This is a vegan brush, so no animals were used to test it, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I like that the bristles are synthetic, rather than animal source, and they are smooth and well packed into the handle.</li>
            <li>Trust me the kind of brush you use really makes a difference on how your make up looks on you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fall apart, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Smooth, even application of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I do not wear a lot of makeup, just light cover powder and blush.</li>
            <li>The effect was just what I was looking for, smooth and even.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and the handle is comfortable to hold while applying.</li>
            <li>so when i thought this brush was gonna be a cheap brush from china</li>
            <li>my makeup goes on smooth without any blotches.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush so much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li>This brush gives good coverage and looks natural without wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li>They really care about giving their customers the best experience possible.</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Essentials Mineral makeup for years, and while the makeup is wonderful,  having the right kind of brush to apply it is essential.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the Simply Essentials Kabuki brush:)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my new kabuki brush and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing!!!</li>

            <li>Nice soft dense bristles, you are definitely getting a great price for this brusb.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of makeup brushes and the minute a new product comes out</li>
            <li>Great for a pressed or loose powder.  </li>
            <li>They are attached very well, no bristles falling out or shedding, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I also like that this brush dries quickly over night unlike many other brushes I use and give a good washing to.</li>
            <li>I use this product with Bare Escentuals makeup and it gives a really nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with my Bare Minerals make-up, and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and i would buy this again at full price when needed</li>
            <li>Shortly after I ordered the brush, I received the e-book via email with lots of good tips.  </li>

            <li>I have had so many different brushes for putting makeup on</li>
            <li>I have found it to be better than the actual brand.</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of make up brush</li>
            <li>and I really like the coverage!</li>

            <li>I recieved this brush last week and IM IN LOVE</li>
            <li>I look at how soft it is, how comfortable it is to hold, if there&#x27;s any fall out from the makeup product or if any bristles fall out of the brush when being used and being cleaned.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s durable, it&#x27;s soft, and it really does just look like a nice professional Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense which really helps with holding liquid foundation, and applying!</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smoothly and covers unsightly blemishes completely.  </li>
            <li>I simply tap it into the powder, tap once more to remove excess, and can apply even natural-looking coverage to my face without powder flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush it is not TOO soft nor is it TOO hard when using the brush the makeup is even on my face!</li>
            <li>This simple-to-clean make-up brush has pride-of-place in my make-up kit because it gives professional results fast and easy.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s full and very soft</li>
            <li>Application was great and didnt waste near as much as i was!</li>
            <li>Now that I have had time to use both with my mineral makeup, I can say that I am pleased with both (angled and flat) of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are compact and designed so that I am confident that is will continue to be my favorite and last a long time!</li>

            <li>The brush does not shed and the handle is big enough to get a good grasp to apply make up in circular motions</li>
            <li>Soft but not too soft so it is able to do its job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft as well!</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are dense and super soft!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s full, it spreads everything evenly.  </li>
            <li>so I imagine it will last a long time, which is good because I really like using it!</li>
            <li>I used this brush to apply and blend my mineral powder, creating a soft full coverage look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very make-up savvy, but this brush blends and makes it really easy for me!  </li>

            <li>, so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some new makeup which included powder foundation, blush and eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge downside though - the seller wrote me several emails daily for over a week asking to write a review.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Very soft just like a makeup brush should be.</li>
            <li>Your make up finish is very professional</li>
            <li>It does not shed and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush stay together well, but are very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush.  </li>
            <li>This bristles are very soft, and they are</li>
            <li>I own a lot of high end brushes and this one is the same if not better than some of them.</li>
            <li>So much nicer than the brush you get at Bare Essentials.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and so far the bristles are not shedding!</li>
            <li>Other than that I will definitely continue to use, repurchase and I plan on buying more of your brushes soon.</li>
            <li>I have been using mineral makeup for some time now, but this was my first Castle Rock Essential Products purchase.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and supple!</li>
            <li>I sell a line of make-up, so I&#x27;m overjoyed to have such a promising new brush to use when I&#x27;m marketing my foundation and blush to my customers!</li>
            <li>I lost my beloved BM precision face brush, and decided to give this one a shot since it costs less than half.</li>
            <li>Good build, big enough to be comfortable, can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li>It looks smooth and takes way less foundation.</li>
            <li>I used less powder and my coverage was even and sheer which is what I love.</li>
            <li>I was recently diagnosed with Rosacea and this brush is soft and gentle and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>The results, a natural, silky, professional look.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so amazingly soft it is unreal and</li>
            <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li>The hairs on it are fairly soft, however I did notice some fall out when washing and using it.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I t blends my makeup seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Works well to distribute evenly, and bristles feel soft  while blending.</li>
            <li>It holds the powder well and is so soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s really, really soft.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft &amp; dense and so far there has been no shedding.</li>
            <li>The brush is also really soft which was a surprise since it is so affordable.</li>
            <li>I normally use Bare Minerals brushes, but after seeing this brush decided to try it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft too</li>
            <li>I love that the weight seems pretty evenly distributed, so it&#x27;s not flimsy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>and when I recently went to purchase some new make up</li>
            <li>It is truly like no other makeup brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use it with bare minerals foundation and it blends  well!</li>
            <li>I really love this brush and use it with a very thick liquid foundation (Lancome teint idole ultra 24H makeup).  </li>
            <li>Hard to get a light coverage with those brushes .</li>
            <li>I use this one for powder foundation and the way the bristles are short and stubby really allows you to control how much or how little product you&#x27;re getting on the brush.</li>
            <li>It flat and not small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that barely have a handle and longer bristles.</li>
            <li>So far it is lasting.</li>
            <li>I use it with my tarte foundation and my bare minerals powder....</li>
            <li>The Simply Essentials Kabuki brush can also be used for liquid and cream based products as it says on their site and was given a rating of 4.9 out of 5 by Professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>A must have if you are a Bare Minerals wearer.</li>
            <li>Someone told me this brush is for the powder bare minerals</li>
            <li>I was worried that I looked too dark and fake, but the brush really does a nice job of applying the bronzer evenly across my face.  </li>
            <li>This is the first brush that has let me add a little all over instead of a lot in one spot.</li>
            <li>The bristles are long, densely-packed, and soft.</li>
            <li>I found that I used far less foundation in the cap of the container, compared what I used with my old brush.</li>

            <li> and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> but it really is a good product.  </li>

            <li> I just received my kabuki brush and love it.</li>
            <li> This kabuki flat top brush is the best!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this kabuki brush from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying it with a foundation brush, I then use a flat top kabuki to flawlessly brush it onto the skin.</li>
            <li> I used it to apply my bronzer, and I feel like I got a beautiful, even application - specifically because of the flat top!</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it, and it&#x27;s sleek and clean.</li>
            <li> Super soft, shed-less brush that works perfectly with mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, and applies my blush beautifully.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t shed, it&#x27;s soft and smoothes out my foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality brush and would make a fabulous addition to any make up bag using mineral based powders, blushes, or bronzers!!!</li>
            <li> Now that I am using this brush, it is easy to apply light and even coverage!</li>
            <li> Nice weight, no shedding, easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> and i have got to say i am impressed i dont really know about make up brushes much</li>
            <li> It feels great in your hand.. very professional.</li>
            <li> Works great with my very sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> It is soft yet allows me to applies my powder foundation with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, no shedding, great coverage.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice weight to it, the bristles are soft and well shaped, the metal piece (I&#x27;m sure it has a name, but don&#x27;t know what it is!)</li>
            <li> I recently lost my makeup bag and all of my good brushes were in it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and glad I went with this purchase.</li>
            <li> that hold them together seems sturdy and smooth, and most importantly it holds the powder</li>
            <li> It washes out easily, and retains its softness after washing.</li>
            <li> I had never used a brush for liquid makeup before, but the dense brush made it easy.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to apply the makeup with this one.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply the product.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> got here very quick</li>
            <li> The design of this brush allows for easy application and blending.</li>
            <li> So the question was how to figure out which one I would get, this was an easy decision for me.  </li>
            <li> It spreads the powder fairly evenly so application is pretty quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were soft and allowed the makeup to move around giving a very nice even and light layer of foundation.  </li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and Clinique products and this brush works great with them.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and wasn&#x27;t happy with their brushes that they give you in their starter kit.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Simply Essentials brushes, they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It is very soft and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> This brush is very very soft and feels good on your face.</li>
            <li> The brush portion is the perfect length to get a good coverage, not too short, not too long.</li>
            <li> The hair is super soft but the density is great.</li>
            <li> I do have to add that I also don&#x27;t have to use near as much powder to achieve such smooth, flawless and amazing coverage!</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to since I&#x27;ve always used sponges, but it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> This little brush is the best thing going.</li>
            <li> Perfect little brush for mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is the best Kabuki brush, hands down!  </li>
            <li> That is a HUGE plus in my book.</li>
            <li> This is a vegan brush, so no animals were used to test it, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I like that the bristles are synthetic, rather than animal source, and they are smooth and well packed into the handle.</li>
            <li> Trust me the kind of brush you use really makes a difference on how your make up looks on you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fall apart, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Smooth, even application of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I do not wear a lot of makeup, just light cover powder and blush.</li>
            <li> The effect was just what I was looking for, smooth and even.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and the handle is comfortable to hold while applying.</li>
            <li> so when i thought this brush was gonna be a cheap brush from china</li>
            <li> my makeup goes on smooth without any blotches.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush so much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> This brush gives good coverage and looks natural without wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li> They really care about giving their customers the best experience possible.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Essentials Mineral makeup for years, and while the makeup is wonderful,  having the right kind of brush to apply it is essential.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the Simply Essentials Kabuki brush:)</li>

            <li> Nice soft dense bristles, you are definitely getting a great price for this brusb.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of makeup brushes and the minute a new product comes out</li>
            <li> Great for a pressed or loose powder.  </li>
            <li> They are attached very well, no bristles falling out or shedding, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I also like that this brush dries quickly over night unlike many other brushes I use and give a good washing to.</li>
            <li> I use this product with Bare Escentuals makeup and it gives a really nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with my Bare Minerals make-up, and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and i would buy this again at full price when needed</li>
            <li> Shortly after I ordered the brush, I received the e-book via email with lots of good tips.  </li>

            <li> I have had so many different brushes for putting makeup on</li>

            <li> I have used many different types of make up brush</li>
            <li> and I really like the coverage!</li>
            <li> sponges are ok but smell after several days.</li>

            <li> I love that the brush is short and compact.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a couple more so that I can have a different brush for each product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this brush last week and IM IN LOVE</li>
            <li> I look at how soft it is, how comfortable it is to hold, if there&#x27;s any fall out from the makeup product or if any bristles fall out of the brush when being used and being cleaned.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s durable, it&#x27;s soft, and it really does just look like a nice professional Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense which really helps with holding liquid foundation, and applying!</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smoothly and covers unsightly blemishes completely.  </li>
            <li> I simply tap it into the powder, tap once more to remove excess, and can apply even natural-looking coverage to my face without powder flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush it is not TOO soft nor is it TOO hard when using the brush the makeup is even on my face!</li>
            <li> This simple-to-clean make-up brush has pride-of-place in my make-up kit because it gives professional results fast and easy.</li>
            <li> it nice, - i do like the beauty blender a little bit better to put on foundation but overall a great brush to buy for everyday use!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full and very soft</li>
            <li> Application was great and didnt waste near as much as i was!</li>
            <li> Now that I have had time to use both with my mineral makeup, I can say that I am pleased with both (angled and flat) of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are compact and designed so that I am confident that is will continue to be my favorite and last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have another brush from Simply Essentials that I love just as much.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and not harsh on the skin, they don&#x27;t fall out onto your face and clothes, and the coverage is more than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any&lt;br /&gt; kabuki.</li>
            <li> The brush does not shed and the handle is big enough to get a good grasp to apply make up in circular motions</li>
            <li> Soft but not too soft so it is able to do its job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft as well!</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are dense and super soft!</li>
            <li> super soft!</li>

            <li> Believe all the positive reviews and order this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the long handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s full, it spreads everything evenly.  </li>
            <li> so I imagine it will last a long time, which is good because I really like using it!</li>
            <li> I used this brush to apply and blend my mineral powder, creating a soft full coverage look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very make-up savvy, but this brush blends and makes it really easy for me!  </li>
            <li> It is super soft.</li>
            <li> and did I mention super soft?  </li>
            <li> It was super soft and the bristles were dense.</li>
            <li> This brush is designed large with foundation and blush in mind.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush a few times since I received it and LOVE it!</li>

            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> Also my daughter wants one now.</li>
            <li> Hope she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This brush really evens out the make up ensuring me to have an even tone and no streaks across my face.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very well made</li>
            <li> The brush helps blend in very well, leaving no hair on my face, no shedding.</li>
            <li> The package arrived within 3 days and the transaction went very well no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my foundation and it goes on very evenly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a much smoother look.  </li>
            <li> Feels really soft,blends very well and zero shedding.  </li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to apply the foundation.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually much faster than using hands or a sponge -</li>
            <li> i really didnt like it</li>
            <li> I finally received the brush yesterday and it is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> And it seems to pick the product up really well</li>
            <li> The Simply Essentials Kabuki Brush is so soft to the touch and even more so on the face.</li>
            <li> Its as nice as a much pricier one i used to have and at half the price!</li>
            <li> I am pretty new to using makeup brushes, but all of my beauty friends have told me that I need a kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> The five minuet face is easy quick natural and sun proof with minimal chemicals.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion I feel that my makeup went on smoother, and blended better than it has with other brushes that I have paid 3x times the amount for.  </li>
            <li> Also the bristles do not fall out like most other makeup brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li> It is very dense and of high quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford high end brushes and this brush has reasonable price.</li>
            <li> washed the brush right away and not a SINGLE HAIR CAME OUT!!!</li>
            <li> It arrived in very quick and is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very well made and comes with an ebook with useful information such as cleaning suggestions.</li>
            <li> They leave a really nice finish when you put on makeup, and so far the one I bought a few months ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and seems very well made</li>
            <li> Gets the job done...and VERY soft!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest feeling makeup brush I have ever used and my skin is very sensitive so this says a lot!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend every women to have this in their make up brush collection.</li>
            <li> It is also a high quality brush</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this for mineral applications.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the photo and very soft for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Inc. I highly recommend purchasing this if your looking for a makeup applicator brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this makeup brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality makeup brush and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s totally fine as long as the brush is soft and applying well.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft, and distributes my makeup very evenly.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle on my face, yet dense when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I tried one with a rounded top a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> , so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some new makeup which included powder foundation, blush and eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge downside though - the seller wrote me several emails daily for over a week asking to write a review.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Very soft just like a makeup brush should be.</li>
            <li> Your make up finish is very professional</li>
            <li> It does not shed and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush stay together well, but are very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush.  </li>
            <li> This bristles are very soft, and they are</li>
            <li> I own a lot of high end brushes and this one is the same if not better than some of them.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the brush you get at Bare Essentials.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and so far the bristles are not shedding!</li>
            <li> Other than that I will definitely continue to use, repurchase and I plan on buying more of your brushes soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using mineral makeup for some time now, but this was my first Castle Rock Essential Products purchase.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and supple!</li>
            <li> I sell a line of make-up, so I&#x27;m overjoyed to have such a promising new brush to use when I&#x27;m marketing my foundation and blush to my customers!</li>
            <li> I lost my beloved BM precision face brush, and decided to give this one a shot since it costs less than half.</li>
            <li> Good build, big enough to be comfortable, can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> It looks smooth and takes way less foundation.</li>
            <li> I used less powder and my coverage was even and sheer which is what I love.</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with Rosacea and this brush is soft and gentle and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The results, a natural, silky, professional look.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so amazingly soft it is unreal and</li>
            <li> It is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li> The hairs on it are fairly soft, however I did notice some fall out when washing and using it.  </li>
            <li> It looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I t blends my makeup seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Works well to distribute evenly, and bristles feel soft  while blending.</li>
            <li> It holds the powder well and is so soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s really, really soft.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft &amp; dense and so far there has been no shedding.</li>
            <li> The brush is also really soft which was a surprise since it is so affordable.</li>
            <li> I normally use Bare Minerals brushes, but after seeing this brush decided to try it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft too</li>
            <li> I love that the weight seems pretty evenly distributed, so it&#x27;s not flimsy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and when I recently went to purchase some new make up</li>
            <li> It is truly like no other makeup brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use it with bare minerals foundation and it blends  well!</li>
            <li> I really love this brush and use it with a very thick liquid foundation (Lancome teint idole ultra 24H makeup).  </li>
            <li> Hard to get a light coverage with those brushes .</li>
            <li> I use this one for powder foundation and the way the bristles are short and stubby really allows you to control how much or how little product you&#x27;re getting on the brush.</li>
            <li> It flat and not small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that barely have a handle and longer bristles.</li>
            <li> So far it is lasting.</li>
            <li> I use it with my tarte foundation and my bare minerals powder....</li>
            <li> The Simply Essentials Kabuki brush can also be used for liquid and cream based products as it says on their site and was given a rating of 4.9 out of 5 by Professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> A must have if you are a Bare Minerals wearer.</li>
            <li> Someone told me this brush is for the powder bare minerals</li>
            <li> I was worried that I looked too dark and fake, but the brush really does a nice job of applying the bronzer evenly across my face.  </li>
            <li> This is the first brush that has let me add a little all over instead of a lot in one spot.</li>
            <li> The bristles are long, densely-packed, and soft.</li>
            <li> I found that I used far less foundation in the cap of the container, compared what I used with my old brush.</li>
            <li> Iwill definitely buy other brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> I work in small circular motions to really create an air brush look without using air brush</li>
            <li> Flat surface for even application.</li>
            <li> but this one is flat across</li>
            <li> /&gt;that should last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> For a flat brush you could use this to put on liquid or cream foundation.</li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff enough and soft enough to use it with powder and for contouring.</li>
            <li> I apply a very small amount of tinted gel cream to the brush and lightly apply to half of my face at a time.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I can pay this low price, and it works better than my expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Kabuki Makeup Brush because of the reasonable price, but was shocked at the quality and texture of this brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft but could be a little firmer</li>
            <li> This brush has surpassed what I have used in the past ( which are high end products).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking to replace an expensive brush but don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Firm yet soft</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found the Kabuki Brush  a long time ago</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on make up and all of the accessories that go with it because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to have a long morning routine.  </li>
            <li> They are good for getting your base color in , not for blush or tinted color .</li>
            <li> I definitely have other brushes that I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> It works very well, and no more using my fingers to apply makeup and having a mess.</li>
            <li> when you apply your makeup with this brush its soft and does not feel prickly compared to others i have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals on my face and from what I could tell, this brush doesn&#x27;t waste ANY product.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but yet still firm enough that when you use it that it doesn&#x27;t scrunch up after a few uses.</li>
            <li> And she also stated it would help me use less product which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going back and forth into the powder making a mess.</li>
            <li> Firm enough to apply mineral make up yet softest brush</li>
            <li> Also noted that the brush comes with a protective cover and didn&#x27;t show up all smooshed  and crushed like a lot of brushes I buy online.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to my makeup brushes just as much as the makeup itself.</li>
            <li> long, and the spread of the bristles is the size of an half dollar.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount on the lid, then dip my Kabuki in the mineral, tap it a few times to get rid of the excess and apply the makeup to my face in a circular motion, giving it a complete blended coverage.</li>
            <li> This brush is SOOOOO soft and silky- seriously-</li>
            <li> I would not use any other brush.  </li>
            <li> of the longer handle and shorter bristles compared to other brushes</li>
            <li> I used the same makeup but this time with the Kabuki brush and no more &amp;#34;gobs&amp;#34; of makeup on one spot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought this item twice due to</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is not the average drug store makeup brush quality, it is a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and never leaves bristle hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> and it has not let me down.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> well so you use less.</li>
            <li> And you finish you face is less time.</li>
            <li> So I thought I would try the Kabuki Brush after reading the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m using a lot less product.  </li>
            <li> , it would have saved me lots of money with using less.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I use much less with the brush</li>
            <li> I scrape some on my pallette then pick up a little with a foundation on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to add a little sparkle.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you if anyone touches that they will be in trouble.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and have had no fall out from the bristles.</li>
            <li> Also tried the round brush.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely no guru when it comes to makeup and likely have used all my tools wrong in the past</li>
            <li> I just pump a small amount on the brush and buff it on my face.</li>
            <li> Not many bristles fell out during the washing process.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have found other less expensive of brushes are poor made.</li>
            <li> The thick handle is 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Does that mean tested on animals...</li>
            <li> I feel like the mineral makeup doesn&#x27;t get wasted on a bunch of useless bristles.</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a brush that I like and can use!</li>
            <li> Sad story.</li>
            <li> i was so wrong 1st of all the brush</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought the wrong brush.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t boast use for liquid, but I was desperate</li>
            <li> I have never used a base makeup brush before.  </li>
            <li> I hate when that happens!!</li>
            <li> (Which I absolutely hate when that happens!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thanks for a speedy delivery. I love the Kabuki Makeup brush! I have used Bare Essentials Mineral makeup for years, and while the makeup is wonderful,  having the right kind of brush to apply it is essential. The bristles on the brush are very soft and don&#x27;t shed. I love the long handle because it helps me have a better hold on it. I apply a small amount on the lid, then dip my Kabuki in the mineral, tap it a few times to get rid of the excess and apply the makeup to my face in a circular motion, giving it a complete blended coverage. The Kabuki brush helps conceal imperfections like my age spots or skin decolorations.  Viola!  The results, a natural, silky, professional look. Love it! I plan to order another brush for my bronzer. Thank you for a wonderful product. I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!! I recently lost my makeup bag and all of my good brushes were in it! This brush is SOOOOO soft and silky- seriously- the nicest makeup brush I have ever had. I am so totally in love with this brush I am planning on ordering another one with the 20% off coupon that they sent with this one. The brush portion is the perfect length to get a good coverage, not too short, not too long. The bristles are so amazingly soft it is unreal and the handle is the perfect length and diameter. It is like an age is using a cloud puff to apply my blush. For real.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and Clinique products and this brush works great with them. I love how soft it is. Flat surface for even application.</li>
            <li> Great brush ~ It&#x27;s soft and easy to clean. It goes on smoothly and it is very well made. I love that it comes with a little cover so that I can throw it in my bag and not worry about the bristles breaking or bending :)</li>
            <li> Everything about this brush is just right.  The handle has a nice weight to it, the bristles are soft and well shaped, the metal piece (I&#x27;m sure it has a name, but don&#x27;t know what it is!) that hold them together seems sturdy and smooth, and most importantly it holds the powder well.  It works well and is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Heaven on my face! This brush flawlessly applies my airbrush makeup. The finish is always spectacular and it blends like a dream. Cleaned once already and the quality is still superb. A great addition to any girls or guys makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Its as nice as a much pricier one i used to have and at half the price! Application was great and didnt waste near as much as i was! Definitely would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I have another brush from Simply Essentials that I love just as much. I use this one for powder foundation and the way the bristles are short and stubby really allows you to control how much or how little product you&#x27;re getting on the brush. This brush is also tapered in a way that allows for better precision when you are applying the product to your face. I cannot say enough good things about Simply Essentials brushes, they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> So, I bought this for the fiancee and here is what she has to say: I have been using this brush for over three weeks now and I love it! This is an extremely high quality brush that feels exquisite on my skin. I look forward to using it every morning, because I absolutely love how it feels! It glides easily, and blends makeup perfectly. It washes out easily, and retains its softness after washing. I recommend this brush to everybody!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. And, just to be sure her review is legit, I had her use the brush on me and I can attest that is is exquisite and soft on the skin. Double review!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I use it with Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD makeup. I just pump a small amount on the brush and buff it on my face. It looks smooth and takes way less foundation. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! spreads powder evenly. Very soft just like a makeup brush should be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, amazing at how different a brush can make.  I have used many and this is by far the best, and excellent service too.</li>
            <li> Great Brush! I love it. It arrived in very quick and is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for pretty much everything I have in my makeup drawer!</li>
            <li> Love it! Soft, dense bristles that make a flawless application of liquid foundation. I had never used a brush for liquid makeup before, but the dense brush made it easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Well made, feels comfortable in the hand, works really well. I have been using my fingers to put on liquid foundation, and this is much superior.  It leaves a smooth and pretty finish to my makeup. I like that the bristles are synthetic, rather than animal source, and they are smooth and well packed into the handle. Well done!</li>
            <li> My new puppy got to my old kabuki brush that I loved (*sob*), so I needed a new one.  Stat.  I looked online, ordered this one, and am very happy with my purchase!  The bristles are soft, it applies my powder smoothly and evenly, and the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out...despite daily use.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this Kabuki brush! I love the feel of the brush and it does a great job applying my powders. I love the way it&#x27;s shaped and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> I would not use any other brush.  Saves on product usage because brush holds powders well so you use less.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it with my moist foundation. Helps it look very smooth.  Just what I  was looking for. Thanks.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the brush you get at Bare Essentials. Love it--super soft and great quality!</li>
            <li> I received the brush super fast.  I believe it arrived the day after I ordered it.  I have started to use it and I really like it.  It is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.  I am using it to apply my liquid foundation.  It takes a little getting used to since I&#x27;ve always used sponges, but it&#x27;s great!  So far it is great, it applies my foundation smoothly and not too thick.  And of course the price point is awesome!  I have already recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  I&#x27;m not very make-up savvy, but this brush blends and makes it really easy for me!  It&#x27;s super soft as well!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Your make up finish is very professional</li>
            <li> I ordered two ( this one and another&#x27;s company) I loved this one. It flat and not small. It obsorbs the liquid so you don&#x27;t need to cake it on. And you finish you face is less time. It&#x27;s soft and sturdy. I&#x27;m going to buy some more as presents.</li>
            <li> This brush is designed large with foundation and blush in mind. The bristles are long, densely-packed, and soft. They do not absorb liquid, so the brush is usable for powder or liquid make-up. The thick handle is 5&amp;#34; long, and the spread of the bristles is the size of an half dollar. This simple-to-clean make-up brush has pride-of-place in my make-up kit because it gives professional results fast and easy. I sell a line of make-up, so I&#x27;m overjoyed to have such a promising new brush to use when I&#x27;m marketing my foundation and blush to my customers!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful, I absolutely love it! The handle is smooth and is a nice weight. The bristles are so soft and allow for great coverage. I&#x27;ve not had any of the bristles fall out- which is a HUGE positive for me- I hate when that happens!! I love that the weight seems pretty evenly distributed, so it&#x27;s not flimsy or uncomfortable. I&#x27;m hoping for lots of other options from this brand, because I have a new favorite brush!!</li>
            <li> Good build, big enough to be comfortable, can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is one great and awesome item. I started using this the next day after I got it in the mail and I can tell you if anyone touches that they will be in trouble. I have had so many different brushes for putting makeup on and I have even had a kabuki brush but this one is flat across and it is so easy to apply the makeup with this one. I am so in love with this I am going to have to get another one. Also my daughter wants one now. Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and the shape is perfect!  Great for a pressed or loose powder.  Much smoother powder application with fantastic coverage.  Love the price, too!</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible.  It&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s full, it spreads everything evenly.  I have found it to be better than the actual brand.</li>
            <li> First time using a brush instead of my fingers, I like it, applies foundation smoothly.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> makes a much better finish on the skin than any sponge</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this kabuki brush! I use it with my bare minerals and it works better than any brush I&#x27;ve used from any company, including BE. The bristles are soft and not harsh on the skin, they don&#x27;t fall out onto your face and clothes, and the coverage is more than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any&lt;br /&gt; kabuki. I do have to add that I also don&#x27;t have to use near as much powder to achieve such smooth, flawless and amazing coverage! The price is amazing! Can&#x27;t say enough about it! Absolutely love my new kabuki brush and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing!!!</li>
            <li> love this bursh. very dense and easy to clean</li>
            <li> A great product!  provides great coverage with my foundation. I am going to purchase another to use for my blush. I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush since 02/2015 and I will never go back to the regular foundation brushes again. Applies make-up evenely and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Just bought one for a friend. Hope she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Great brush, no bristle fall out. Firm enough to apply mineral make up yet softest brush i have ever felt.</li>
            <li> I use this product with Bare Escentuals makeup and it gives a really nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This kabuki flat top brush is the best! I have used many different types of make up brush and I have to say this is one of my favorite! The bristles are very soft and picks up the powder easily and brushes onto my face evenly. The bristles are also even and do not fall out like many I have used. I have noticed that many make up brushes are not put together with care, but the Kabuki brush I can tell it is made with care. I highly recommend every women to have this in their make up brush collection. Trust me the kind of brush you use really makes a difference on how your make up looks on you. This brush really evens out the make up ensuring me to have an even tone and no streaks across my face. I use to have a problem blending the color into my face, having streaks or the color was not the same, after this brush now my face looks airbrushed and even.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s so soft, and applies my blush beautifully. Excellent quality for the price. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking to replace an expensive brush but don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot. This does the job and its an excellent price.</li>
            <li> âœ“ I was so excited to be able to receive and review this kabuki brush from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a working makeup artist and I LOVE to use flat top kabuki brushes on clients. You have really great control when applying and you can be firm yet gentle. I use this brush to apply cream foundation. I scrape some on my pallette then pick up a little with a foundation on. After applying it with a foundation brush, I then use a flat top kabuki to flawlessly brush it onto the skin. I work in small circular motions to really create an air brush look without using air brush makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the brush right away and not a SINGLE HAIR CAME OUT!!! The handle is really sturdy and has a great heft. It feels great in your hand.. very professional. No smell from the bristles or from the adhesive. Ã¢Å“â€œ</li>
            <li> Reasonably price and does a beautiful job. I apply a very small amount of tinted gel cream to the brush and lightly apply to half of my face at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and smooth and does not shed! Great product and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this makeup brush.  It is extremely soft, and distributes my makeup very evenly.  It is also a high quality brush&lt;br /&gt;that should last for a long time.  I&#x27;m glad I ran across it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great brush! I use bare minerals and wasn&#x27;t happy with their brushes that they give you in their starter kit. This brush gives good coverage and looks natural without wasting a lot of product. FINALLY! I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how even my skin looks, which is a rarity!</li>
            <li> amazing!!!! This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had! It&#x27;s blends so well and gets great coverage.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering a make up brush without seeing or feeling it, but I am pleased to say, I loved it&#x27;s! It is very dense and of high quality. I use a powder foundation and it works great. I also tried it with a liquid mineral foundation and it worked well blending it in. Iwill definitely buy other brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great item. I love the way this brush works. No caking of the product. Easy to apply the product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for the bare-minerals liquid foundation. It&#x27;s extremely soft and durable. I would recommend this brush for anyone looking for a new one !!</li>
            <li> I love this brush i have been using it for about a week now and have no complaints. It doesn&#x27;t fall apart, easy to clean and I LOVE the way it distributes my foundation definitely recommend best make up brush i own.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  Works great with my very sensitive skin.  Applies mineral foundation perfectly.</li>
            <li> Awesomeness. Have this and the angled and I wish they had more.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and so far the bristles are not shedding!</li>
            <li> Super soft, shed-less brush that works perfectly with mineral foundation. I lost my beloved BM precision face brush, and decided to give this one a shot since it costs less than half. The brushes are identical; this one works just as well!</li>
            <li> Seems to be very well made and I was impressed with how soft the bristles are. I like the&lt;br /&gt;fact of the longer handle and shorter bristles compared to other brushes&lt;br /&gt;that barely have a handle and longer bristles.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Very soft and dense bristles hold and distribute powder perfectly for a flawless finish.  I am planning to buy a couple more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent brush.  The hairs on it are fairly soft, however I did notice some fall out when washing and using it.  I definitely have other brushes that I&#x27;ll use if given the choice before I would go to pick this one up.  However, it&#x27;s not necessarily a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; brush, just not the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Received at a promotional price for review purposes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with both liquid and powder makeup and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks and no shedding yet!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Best brush ever</li>
            <li> hair on brush shades and is all over your face all day</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The brush sheds, and the quality should be much better for the price.</li>
            <li> Smooth, even application of makeup.  This is an essential tool.  It has a plush feel.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, no shedding, easy to use and to clean. My only suggestion is printing what the brush is for on the handle. Other than that I will definitely continue to use, repurchase and I plan on buying more of your brushes soon. Also noted that the brush comes with a protective cover and didn&#x27;t show up all smooshed  and crushed like a lot of brushes I buy online. Great price for how well it works!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! All the coverage you want and does not leave brush hairs on your face like some brushes do. I will come back for more!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  So far it is lasting.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! It is wonderful! I cannot believe I can pay this low price, and it works better than my expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush! I use it with mineral makeup, and it holds the powder very well, allowing me to blend easily. Would highly recommend this for mineral applications.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It hasn&#x27;t shed, it&#x27;s soft and smoothes out my foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li> Soft and great coverage.  I will buy more of Castle Rock Essentials.</li>
            <li> The quality is really nice. This is not the average drug store makeup brush quality, it is a lot nicer. The wooden handle is nice and the chrome part is very well made too. The hair is super soft but the density is great. I use this to apply my liquid foundation to get a flawless air brush finish. The brush helps blend in very well, leaving no hair on my face, no shedding. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is not the best brush I have ever used but I like it. I use it with my tarte foundation and my bare minerals powder....much better with my that foundation. Gets the job done...and VERY soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using mineral makeup for some time now, but this was my first Castle Rock Essential Products purchase.  I originally purchased the Kabuki Makeup Brush because of the reasonable price, but was shocked at the quality and texture of this brush.  It is truly like no other makeup brush I have ever used.  I will now be making all my makeup brush purchases from this company.  I really love this brush!!</li>
            <li> The softest brush I have ever used.It is a must to have.So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this Kabuki makeup brush. It is super soft. I have been using it to apply powder and blush evenly across my face. It does a wonderful job. It looks so natural. I love how it feels when I am gliding it across my face, as well. I was excited to get this product with a discount because I have never used a Kabuki brush before and it has not let me down. I am very impressed with this makeup brush. I t blends my makeup seamlessly. My makeup always looks even and it applies it just the way I want it. Itâ€™s a wonderful makeup brush!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, easy to use - great coverage</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it for liquid foundation and it&#x27;s amazing! Also the customer service is excellent. They really care about giving their customers the best experience possible. One of the co-founders herself reached out to me and responded to my emails extremely quickly. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for a week and I really like the coverage! It&#x27;s now my favorite brush for my BareEssentials powder foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and never leaves bristle hairs behind.  It spreads the powder fairly evenly so application is pretty quick and easy.  This is the nicest feeling makeup brush I have ever used and my skin is very sensitive so this says a lot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brush a few times since I received it and LOVE it! Softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used. What is great about it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold on to my liquid foundation after I am done with it, what I put on the brush is what goes onto my skin. It&#x27;s a really good product and I would recommend it for sure! Softest brush I own.</li>
            <li> Love this flat top brush. It is perfect for liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but it is hard too clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning to apply my powder dual finish makeup by Lancome.  Works well to distribute evenly, and bristles feel soft  while blending.</li>
            <li> I love the Castle Rock products. I love my Kabuki brush. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush.  My routine:  I moisturize.  Then I apply any foundation, tinted sunscreen,  stick cover up, concealer, blush, highlighter, or contour foundation.  The Kabuki brush in a light circular motion,  blends it all perfectly.  Using fingers makes my face break out.  sponges are ok but smell after several days. and I have bought some more expensive one at sephora.  This brush is the best.  I have one at the gym and at home.  The five minuet face is easy quick natural and sun proof with minimal chemicals.  P.S. use make up and foundation with zinc and/or titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> I completely love this brush.  One of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great for applying liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the second kabuki brush that I have ordered recently from Castle Rock Products.  Now that I have had time to use both with my mineral makeup, I can say that I am pleased with both (angled and flat) of the brushes.  They work well, are priced right, and the customer service is very good.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush. Very well made and comes with an ebook with useful information such as cleaning suggestions.</li>
            <li> The Simply Essentials Kabuki Brush is so soft to the touch and even more so on the face. This brush is dense but when you apply it on your face the bristles tend to seperate and move back and forth almost like a blush brush so its not as dense. But that&#x27;s totally fine as long as the brush is soft and applying well. The Brush does pack on product too, I used it on my Pur Minerals foundation powder and it distributed the powder evenly on the bristles. I also like that this brush dries quickly over night unlike many other brushes I use and give a good washing to. Yes! Always remember to wash your brushes before first use and after a week of using. It&#x27;s helps your skin look it&#x27;s best!  The Simply Essentials Kabuki brush can also be used for liquid and cream based products as it says on their site and was given a rating of 4.9 out of 5 by Professional makeup artists. I&#x27;m an Aspiring Makeup Artist and I&#x27;m very pleased with the Simply Essentials Kabuki brush:)</li>
            <li> Exactly like the photo and very soft for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Made in China? Does that mean tested on animals... Not the brush itself but the chemicals that were used to *test* safety prior to production?  Sad story.</li>
            <li> They are a bit too dense for me . Hard to get a light coverage with those brushes . They are good for getting your base color in , not for blush or tinted color .</li>
            <li> Works great. Very smooth makeup look after using the brush. Would order another one. Love the brush!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. I do not wear a lot of makeup, just light cover powder and blush. However, just because I don&#x27;t lather on the colors, I do need a good applicator.  And this is the one.  I especially like the length of the bristles and the density of the bristles.  I am very happy with how the brush holds my powder blush and how evenly I can apply with the help of this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush was delivered very quickly! I used it to apply my bronzer, and I feel like I got a beautiful, even application - specifically because of the flat top! I think the best results were using it on my cheeks! It was a nice, smooth application! This is a high quality brush and would make a fabulous addition to any make up bag using mineral based powders, blushes, or bronzers!!! Great value for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I use this to apply my bronzer.  I was worried that I looked too dark and fake, but the brush really does a nice job of applying the bronzer evenly across my face.  It&#x27;s very soft and seems very well made so I imagine it will last a long time, which is good because I really like using it!</li>
            <li> The soft bristles and perfect length of this Kabuke brush make it a pleasure to use. I basically used it for bronzer and also tried for powder. The effect was just what I was looking for, smooth and even. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! Don&#x27;t know how else to say it! It holds the powder well and is so soft on your skin. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and the handle is comfortable to hold while applying. I love that the brush is short and compact. I feel like the mineral makeup doesn&#x27;t get wasted on a bunch of useless bristles. There is just enough for application. Great brush to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of makeup brushes and the minute a new product comes out I am the first to get it; with that being said, I would say this is my favorite brush out of them all. I am in love with this brush. It is so soft and gentle on my face, yet dense when applying makeup. When it arrived I immediately wanted to play in my makeup and try it out. I was really impressed with how it helps cover up imperfections. I have used this brush with mineral powders and bronzers and it worked beautifully. I already have recommended this brush to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discount, however all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush. It is great for the blush or powder use. I use press powder and it applies the powder evenly on my face. The brush has great material. It is very soft and feels good on the face. The handle has the great grip.&lt;br /&gt;I am learning the tips and tricks of makeup and I am in search of blush makeup brushes. I can&#x27;t afford high end brushes and this brush has reasonable price. I am in love with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this brush is its cruelty free. The brush has great quality and it does not shed. It glides on my face smoothly and gives me the flawless look.&lt;br /&gt;I received this brush for an unbiased opinion. I am so glad it is a great addition into my brush collection.</li>
            <li> I have never used a make up brush and when I recently went to purchase some new make up the sales person recommend that I purchase a brush to apply make up for more evenly and for a better finished look. And she also stated it would help me use less product which is a big plus. So I thought I would try the Kabuki Brush after reading the previous reviews. I was not disappointed and glad I went with this purchase. This brush is very very soft and feels good on your face. I was recently diagnosed with Rosacea and this brush is soft and gentle and does not irritate my skin at all. So I very happy about this. The brush does not shed and the handle is big enough to get a good grasp to apply make up in circular motions ( I use liquid make up ). And it leaves a perfect finish. The package arrived within 3 days and the transaction went very well no issues at all. I will be looking next for a Kabuki blush brush and Powder Brush  and will definetly purchase again from Castle Rock Essential products, Inc. I highly recommend purchasing this if your looking for a makeup applicator brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brush I have ever used!! Firm yet soft, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.It did a wonderful job of blending &amp; applying my MAC Matchmaster Foundation.Everything looked very nice.Nice soft dense bristles, you are definitely getting a great price for this brusb.Good quality and the bristles do not fall out either.Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A very nice brush in several ways, I have recently tried the Kabuki Brush and I fell in love with the way it made my face feel.  I use it to apply my foundation and it goes on very evenly and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m using a lot less product.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel caked on and it&#x27;s a much smoother look.  I wish I would have found the Kabuki Brush  a long time ago, it would have saved me lots of money with using less.</li>
            <li> very soft and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very nice kabuki brush.  I own a lot of high end brushes and this one is the same if not better than some of them. Feels really soft,blends very well and zero shedding.  One of my favorites for daily use.</li>
            <li> Very high quality kabuki brush for good price. Bristles are stiff enough and soft enough to use it with powder and for contouring. Would recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It is a high quality, best buy for the money. I will be buying this again as a gift.  Really love it!</li>
            <li> This little brush is the best thing going. It holds just the right amount of powder and when you put it on your face it feels like velvet.  Terrific product.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and no more using my fingers to apply makeup and having a mess. Brush is still going strong after 3 weeks so far of using it. I recently bought a second one so I would have a backup.</li>
            <li> WOW!! This is the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve only used it once and I&#x27;m already sold. Even my husband and my two girls (4 and 7), agree that it feels wonderful on their faces (they just tried it out, they don&#x27;t wear makeup;)  I didn&#x27;t see any signs of shedding at all with this brush. I use Bare Minerals on my face and from what I could tell, this brush doesn&#x27;t waste ANY product. I found that I used far less foundation in the cap of the container, compared what I used with my old brush. That is wonderful!! I love the long handle. It makes it so much easier to apply the foundation. I feel like this brush is excellent quality and worth every penny. I would highly recommend! A+</li>
            <li> I love the brush,  It&#x27;s one of the best that I have used and the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  I use Bare minerals and this works perfectly with it.  I love the long handle , makes it easy to find in my make up bag.  It does not shed and the bristles are very soft.  The package shipped quick and no damage as it is protect well.  Just an all around great product.</li>
            <li> I love this Kabuki brush.  I am not an expert on make up and all of the accessories that go with it because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to have a long morning routine.  I got this brush after my sister suggested that I should get a foundation brush because she said it would actually make things easier and save money on foundation.  It makes the foundation go a lot further, it spreads PERFECTLY and it&#x27;s actually much faster than using hands or a sponge - plus it&#x27;s really, really soft.  It&#x27;s probably the softest brush I have used!  I will definitely be buying another one for powder!</li>
            <li> not good i really didnt like it</li>
            <li> I used this brush with my MAC mineral powder and bronzer, and I absolutely love it! The bristles on the brush are dense and super soft! I used this brush to apply and blend my mineral powder, creating a soft full coverage look. The brush is also shaped so that I can use the side of the bristles to apply bronzer for contouring. I have used cheap brushes and have spent $30+ on designer brushes, and I can immediately tell a difference in how much better this brush is. The bristles are compact and designed so that I am confident that is will continue to be my favorite and last a long time!</li>
            <li> This brush is great. My bare essentials goes on really nice and even. It is a quality brush. Comes slipped into a protective cover too which will hold the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I tried one with a rounded top a few months ago.  These brushes are unbelievably soft.  I find myself playing with them because they&#x27;re soothing to the skin.  They leave a really nice finish when you put on makeup, and so far the one I bought a few months ago hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles and still works/looks great.  I like these so well I&#x27;ve recommended them to friends and family because of their quality!</li>
            <li> okay so when i thought this brush was gonna be a cheap brush from china i was so wrong 1st of all the brush got here very quick, i used it the next day i recieved and i have got to say i am impressed i dont really know about make up brushes much but i liked that it was nice and smooth. no bristles were out of place, when i used it i saw none falling out when i was applying makeup with it i am impressed. when you apply your makeup with this brush its soft and does not feel prickly compared to others i have bought in the past. comes with a nice plastic cover over it to keep its shape up i did recieve this product for a discount to review the item and i would buy this again at full price when needed :) this will be recommended to a couple of my friends who are into makeup and are always looking to try out new items.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.  Since I started using mineral foundation i never thought there would be a difference in brushes and application.  Once I tried this I was hooked. My foundation goes on so easily and even now, and i don&#x27;t have to use as much to get even coverage.  Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush I have a hard time finding a brush that I like and can use! This is the perfect brush it is not TOO soft nor is it TOO hard when using the brush the makeup is even on my face! cant wait to get more!</li>
            <li> This brush is a great deal at the 50% off price! The bristles are soft &amp; dense and so far there has been no shedding. I&#x27;ve been using it with my Bare Minerals make-up, and have been very pleased with it. The brush loads well with the make up powder and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush. It feels amazing against my skin, and allows me to apply mineral foundation, blush, or even liquid foundation evenly and smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t boast use for liquid, but I was desperate so I tried it and it was wonderful. I will be ordering a couple more so that I can have a different brush for each product. The bristles on this brush stay together well, but are very soft to the touch. The design of this brush allows for easy application and blending. It is easy to clean, and dries quickly. Loving this addition to my make up kit.</li>
            <li> This is the best Kabuki brush, hands down!  I&#x27;ve used mineral makeup for years and have tried the bareMinerals and Sephora brand kabuki brushes.  This brush gives the best coverage, doesn&#x27;t shed and feels so soft.  Not only that, but the customer service was awesome.  Shortly after I ordered the brush, I received the e-book via email with lots of good tips.  After my brush arrived, the company emailed and asked how I liked the brush and if they could help with anything else.  I am so impressed with this purchase all around.  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I finally received the brush yesterday and it is absolutely fabulous. My mineral makeup when on beyond flawless. I used less powder and my coverage was even and sheer which is what I love. Great job!!</li>
            <li> For a flat brush you could use this to put on liquid or cream foundation. Should you have powder or mineral foundation. This would be my pick to use to apply the product to make sure you get it good and buff into the skin. Another way I am using this brush for is blush. As you can see there is so many uses for just this brush alone. I will say I am impressed with the density of the brush and quality work. I have washed this and had no problems with it having falling out of bristles. Sometimes I have found other less expensive of brushes are poor made. This brush and another I have used from this company is holding up so nicely. It is my hope to get more from this brand. They had curve different style of brush I would love to try. I will like to let people know this has what I call a raised dome shape brush head. If you have never tried this product give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I run a blog and youtube channel and I plan on using this to show it more how it works live soon. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Super nice kabuki brush! The bristles are soft and supple! They are attached very well, no bristles falling out or shedding, which is very important to me. This is a very good quality brush! It applied my makeup flawlessly! I am happy to recieve this product to review! I recomend it!</li>
            <li> Very soft brush.  Bristles do not shed.  Love that the product is vegan/cruelty-free.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Honestly the best Kabuki brush I&#x27;ve ever tried. This feels good in my hand as I apply my makeup and it does a superb job of blending.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. I have been using this to add a little sparkle. This is the first brush that has let me add a little all over instead of a lot in one spot.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for blending. Doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and have had no fall out from the bristles. The brush is also really soft which was a surprise since it is so affordable. I use it to apply my Bare Minerals foundation, but I&#x27;m thinking about getting the rounded brush as well to see which works better.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.. I feel like my make up goes on so much smoother and more even!&lt;br /&gt;Its super soft!</li>
            <li> quick delivery and just what I wanted thanks.</li>
            <li> Kabuki brush is great. The handle fits nicely in my hand and it gives nice smooth coverage. Would recommend this brush to all.</li>
            <li> I wish I purchased this prior to my purchase at Sephora!  I absolutely love this brush.  I am absolutely no guru when it comes to makeup and likely have used all my tools wrong in the past lol.  I purchased some new makeup which included powder foundation, blush and eye shadow.  I used my pricey brush from Sephora, and it bunched up on me.  I got piles of makeup in one spot on my face then I had to use my fingers to smear it.  This brushed was amazing!  I used the same makeup but this time with the Kabuki brush and no more &amp;#34;gobs&amp;#34; of makeup on one spot.  The bristles were soft and allowed the makeup to move around giving a very nice even and light layer of foundation.  I know I shouldn&#x27;t mix my brushes, but after cleaning the Kabuki brush I used it for my blush and it went on very easy.  I absolutely love this brush.  It is well made, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new kabuki brush. My foundation goes on so smooth and it&#x27;s just perfect!!</li>
            <li> Super soft densely filled brush.  Great product distribution and did I mention super soft?  So glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good quality it&#x27;s full and very soft my makeup goes on smooth without any blotches. This is by far the best makeup brush I have</li>
            <li> Good product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I liked this brush so much that I ordered another one. Also tried the round brush. It is also good.</li>
            <li> Great brush at 1/2 the price. I normally use Bare Minerals brushes, but after seeing this brush decided to try it. It&#x27;s as good as Bare Minerals, much softer and much cheaper. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this brush last week and IM IN LOVE this is the BEST kabuki brush i have used! I dont recommend for liquid use but for powder and blending it does fantastic!</li>
            <li> As someone who is a makeup addict I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes to get that flawless makeup application. I am addicted to my makeup brushes just as much as the makeup itself. I just love having awesome brushes. I look at how soft it is, how comfortable it is to hold, if there&#x27;s any fall out from the makeup product or if any bristles fall out of the brush when being used and being cleaned. As soon as I received this Kabuki brush in the mail I inspected it a bit. It was super soft and the bristles were dense. They packed a lot of bristles in it which is awesome. I washed it right away. Not many bristles fell out during the washing process. Of course, with any brush I&#x27;ve ever had, from a $50 brush to a $5 brush, they have all lost some bristles in this process so it was nothing to worry about. Once dried and ready for use I tested it with my liquid foundation. This Kabuki brush really smoothed out my liquid foundation on my face and gave me a really nice and flawless finish. There were no brush lines on my face and no bristles came out while applying my makeup. (Which I absolutely hate when that happens!) Overall, I think this brush is really nice. It&#x27;s made of quality materials, it&#x27;s durable, it&#x27;s soft, and it really does just look like a nice professional Kabuki brush. Another plus about this brush is that it&#x27;s cruelty free and NOT tested on animals! That is a HUGE plus in my book. I highly recommend this brush as the price is very reasonable as well. *Sample provided for review and testing.*</li>
            <li> i did like this brush,&lt;br /&gt;quality it nice, - i do like the beauty blender a little bit better to put on foundation but overall a great brush to buy for everyday use!</li>
            <li> These are lovely brushes, and I am very happy with my purchase. I use them for my mineral makeup application and find them even better than the brushes the mineral makeup company says you &#x27;must use&#x27;. I find they produce lest wastage and have a lighter touch when applying. I found out about them from an Amazon review, glad I took their advice.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Very well made.  Highly recommend this makeup brush.  Product description is right on.</li>
            <li> Perfect little brush for mineral makeup.  The bristles are really soft too</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is soft yet allows me to applies my powder foundation with great coverage. No problems with bristles falling out. Great price for a great product! So glad I shopped around</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Super soft too!</li>
            <li> This brush has surpassed what I have used in the past ( which are high end products). To start.. the design of the brush is wonderful! It has a nice weight to it, and it&#x27;s sleek and clean. The brush hairs are nice and do not fall out of the brush when applying makeup, and when cleaning. In my opinion I feel that my makeup went on smoother, and blended better than it has with other brushes that I have paid 3x times the amount for.  The bristles are dense which really helps with holding liquid foundation, and applying! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.. it&#x27;s simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great brush that blends into the skin very well. Soft but not too soft so it is able to do its job. Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am pretty new to using makeup brushes, but all of my beauty friends have told me that I need a kabuki brush.  So I have been in the market, and it seems like everyone has them to offer. So the question was how to figure out which one I would get, this was an easy decision for me.  This is a vegan brush, so no animals were used to test it, which is a huge plus.  Also the bristles do not fall out like most other makeup brushes I have used.  This bristles are very soft, and they are great add blending my makeup.  And for a newbie to the makeup brush world, like myself, the ebook that they send you was PERFECT.  The ebook tells you how to use your Kabuki Brush! This is a high quality makeup brush and I highly recommend it. I was provided a sample for review at a discounted price and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> well priced, excellent brush. A must have if you are a Bare Minerals wearer. All around great brush for the price. Would recommend !</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever.  I have never used a base makeup brush before.  I will now use Kabuki brushes forever.  Makeup goes on smoothly and covers unsightly blemishes completely.  Believe all the positive reviews and order this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It evenly distributes the makeup without wasting it. It&#x27;s not too soft but could be a little firmer but it works perfect. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush and use it with a very thick liquid foundation (Lancome teint idole ultra 24H makeup).  I noticed that I use much less with the brush and it looks fantastic on my skin!  The brush also feels very soft and I really enjoy the application process.  There is a huge downside though - the seller wrote me several emails daily for over a week asking to write a review.  I feel fairly harassed but it really is a good product.  Seller: if you&#x27;re reading this, let people write reviews based on their experience and not your bullying!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying foundation with mineral make up. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the brushes I was using or the product but my makeup was looking cakey when I recently started using mineral makeup. It was the brush! Now that I am using this brush, it is easy to apply light and even coverage! And it seems to pick the product up really well so I&#x27;m not going back and forth into the powder making a mess. I simply tap it into the powder, tap once more to remove excess, and can apply even natural-looking coverage to my face without powder flying everywhere. Great product. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve already bought this item twice due to it being amazing!</li>
            <li> I am not too big on wearing make up and only wear foundation and powder on a daily basis.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the applicator that my powder came with so I was on the hunt for a good application brush and came across this one.  It has surpassed my expectations.  I love the feel of the brush and most of all how evenly my powder is applied to my face when using the brush.  Great value for sure!</li>
            <li> I have a few kabuki brushes and this one really doesn&#x27;t compare. I gave it to my sister and she seems to like it. It&#x27;s an okay kabuki brush but I wouldn&#x27;t order this one again.</li>
            <li> Great tool for applying liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> This Makeup brush is amazing. I got it and pulled it out and as soon as my daughter and best friend saw it they both tried to take it from me. It is the perfect size that I dont&#x27; have to worry about it getting lost in my makeup bag. The bristles are soft but yet still firm enough that when you use it that it doesn&#x27;t scrunch up after a few uses.I have used it a ton already and it still looks the same today as it did the day I pulled it out. The handle is very comfortable to use and fits perfectly in my hand. This is one of the better makeup brushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought the wrong brush.  Someone told me this brush is for the powder bare minerals and I bought it for the liquid foundation.  Had to go out and buy the proper brush.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, no shedding, great coverage. I would buy this as a gift or recommend to a friend. I will likely buy from the vendor again!</li>
            <li> Delivery was good. The brush is not that great. It leaves bristles on the face. Not that impressed with it. I would not recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I just received my kabuki brush and love it. I use it with bare minerals foundation and it blends  well!</li>
