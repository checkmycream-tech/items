            <li>Amazing scent, great packaging, overall great product.  </li>
            <li>The are not as many bubbles as i would have liked</li>
            <li>The foaming bath does have a very good smell but to achieve a decent amount of bubbles, 1/4 of the bottle needs to be used.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product when I want to take an Epsom salt detox bath.</li>
            <li>Most of the bubbles dissipated after about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be better judging from all the reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you love bubbles, you will love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>but you have to put a great deal of it in to get much foam.</li>
            <li>love this smelling bath oil</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It surely relaxes me and helps me sleep.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s products, and being able to order it here before I run out assures me that I will always have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I purchased from another store in a more concentrated form.</li>
            <li>but considering the amount I paid, I suppose it was an OK.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I purchased this stuff,  It softens the water.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Will order some more.</li>
            <li>Okay...</li>
            <li>Good feel, easy clean, sleep well</li>
            <li>I even tried \\&quot;scratching\\&quot; the product in with the water to produce a more bubbly bath and to no</li>
            <li>I love soaking in this in the evening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lavender is my favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I just wish that it had more of a lavender scent, but for the price I am not complaining.  </li>
            <li>I will get more, and often so I never run out.</li>
            <li>makes a nice amount of bubbles, lightly scented</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>(I love LOTS of bubbles).</li>
            <li>Even the granddaughter loved the scent and the lavender scent helped us both to sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and the properties of the lavender and naturally relaxing!</li>
            <li>It is a rather oily mixture which has holds out for great hopes (in being so condensed) but the result, in my opinion, is far from satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lavendar is my favorite scent, so, this absolutely fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Good product, and the shipper was fast</li>
            <li>and this stuff works amazingly fine with my skin</li>
            <li>If you enjoy relaxing baths, I recommend you try this.  </li>
            <li>instead, I got a run-of-the-mill cheap bubble</li>
            <li>smells great, bought different scents and like them all.</li>
            <li>Combine this with the epsom salt of the same fragrance for a great bath time experience.</li>
            <li>Thank You, amazon for yet another great item at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>luckily i was able to clean it up.</li>
            <li>Dr. Teal (whoever he is) has a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overly generous with the bubbles, but has a nice scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be best to buy the liquid and add ordinary Epsom Salt from the drug store, if you want it at significant levels.</li>
            <li>The scent is the most important thing, and this soap just doesn&#x27;t have much power at all.</li>
            <li>I enjoy is very much!</li>
            <li>We both loved it : ) I would buy again and will try other scents.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is practically non-existent, but I love the creamy and frothy and luxurious bubbles so much that I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes mix this with Epsom salts for a bath, but the smell is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I have had good success with cheaper, store-brand bubble bath products and so recommend maybe looking into those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love anything lavender, and this is definitely a high quality bath product.</li>
            <li>It makes very big foamy bubbles that sit on top of the water, but I do not find it very moisturizing and the bubbles don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to, but I would still repurchase it because it is a great value and smells great.</li>
            <li>I received my first bottle as a gift and enjoyed it so much that when it was gone</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is very relaxing and isnt too strong.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for Epsom Salt at meaningful quantities, you would be better off buying the dry version of this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bubbly, foamy, makes giant bubbles, smells amazing and is super relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have tried various bubble baths and was honestly, temporarily excited by the price and positive reviews of this</li>
            <li>as far as the bubble bath goes- we love it.</li>
            <li>positives of this product are that the scent is fair in aroma-strength, and the bath lather texture created by the product as well as the few bubbles which are created actually last for a good amount of time (20+ minutes in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that this product is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect fancy oil slicks on your bathtub, just a nice scent and decent bubble action.</li>
            <li>While reading these reviews yesterday, a noticed one mentioned that you can purchase this product at Wal-Mart for $4 and change, so when I went to Wal-Mart today, I decided to check it out and the person was right, the price is $4.87...</li>
            <li>Grabbed this because it was cheap and just can&#x27;t believe the fresh natural scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lavender bubble bath at a VERY reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Very, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Using regular shower gel was better than this product.</li>
            <li>We purchased this product because a hot bubble bath helps my wife relax.</li>
            <li>This provides her with another safe means to help her deal with bodily pain relief.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>A lot like sitting in the hot tub.</li>
            <li>When I first got in the bath it made me feel like I just smoked a fat &#x27;ol blunt</li>
            <li>I have definitely had better bath products than this.</li>
            <li>As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
            <li>While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>In all honesty, it is sometimes true that you get what you pay for--I believe such a statement holds true in this</li>
            <li>First, it requires too much soap to justify the amount of bubbles/foam it yields.</li>
            <li>Certainly large quantity at reasonable price</li>
            <li>Some bubble baths don&#x27;t foam up much, you have to put a lot in.  </li>
            <li>EXPECTED  MORE</li>
            <li>Items as described..  fast shipping ..</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t change the formula on us, this will always be real winner.</li>
            <li>The price was certainly reasonable.</li>
            <li>The bubbles pop around you and it creates a very relaxing experience.</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t use too much or you might die.</li>
            <li>a harmless guilty pleasure!--but Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath is by far the best product out there.  </li>
            <li>I find myself more often using items with less smell.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and a big fan of the bubbles, you are better off buying a different bubble bath product.  </li>
            <li>I stock up whenever I see this for a decent price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fiancÃ©e loves it  I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>maybe 1/10th of the bottle for a tub full of bubbles (remember to add the fluid directly into the water stream as you&#x27;re filling up the tub).&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>For multiple baths I added about a 1/10 or so of the entire bottle and ended up with minimal bubbleage (yes, it is fun to make up words sometimes :) ).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; is at a higher percent, but with a smaller font on the label.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite the large font on the label advertising &amp;#34;Pure Epsom Salt&amp;#34;, there are 7 other ingredients at higher percentages.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a pretty long way as well - and the bottle is pretty large compared to other bubble bath bottles, so it&#x27;s well worth the price paid!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very picky about my lavender products and believe me I&#x27;ve smelled all those phony scents that do not even resemble lavender, not to mention they do not contain any actual lavender.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the fact that the ingredient list was short, it didn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>, alas there are others out there for the same price that I think a superior.</li>
            <li>So, right now, I will give it 2 stars and will check back later after I try it out...      </li>
            <li>and you get a decent amount in the bottle (although that benefit is negated with how much you have to use just to get a little sudsy action going).</li>
            <li>High price for return on bubble investment-not hard to blow through a bottle quickly if you are not careful!</li>
            <li>As a long time lover of anything lavender, I highly recommend this foaming bath.</li>
            <li>The scent is potent, the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting, and I only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just wish that it had more of a lavender scent, but for the price I am not complaining.  </li>
            <li> I will get more, and often so I never run out.</li>
            <li> makes a nice amount of bubbles, lightly scented</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> (I love LOTS of bubbles).</li>
            <li> Even the granddaughter loved the scent and the lavender scent helped us both to sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and the properties of the lavender and naturally relaxing!</li>
            <li> It is a rather oily mixture which has holds out for great hopes (in being so condensed) but the result, in my opinion, is far from satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lavendar is my favorite scent, so, this absolutely fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Good product, and the shipper was fast</li>
            <li> and this stuff works amazingly fine with my skin</li>
            <li> If you enjoy relaxing baths, I recommend you try this.  </li>
            <li> instead, I got a run-of-the-mill cheap bubble</li>
            <li> smells great, bought different scents and like them all.</li>
            <li> Combine this with the epsom salt of the same fragrance for a great bath time experience.</li>
            <li> Thank You, amazon for yet another great item at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> luckily i was able to clean it up.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal (whoever he is) has a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overly generous with the bubbles, but has a nice scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be best to buy the liquid and add ordinary Epsom Salt from the drug store, if you want it at significant levels.</li>
            <li> The scent is the most important thing, and this soap just doesn&#x27;t have much power at all.</li>
            <li> I enjoy is very much!</li>
            <li> We both loved it : ) I would buy again and will try other scents.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is practically non-existent, but I love the creamy and frothy and luxurious bubbles so much that I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes mix this with Epsom salts for a bath, but the smell is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I have had good success with cheaper, store-brand bubble bath products and so recommend maybe looking into those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love anything lavender, and this is definitely a high quality bath product.</li>
            <li> It makes very big foamy bubbles that sit on top of the water, but I do not find it very moisturizing and the bubbles don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to, but I would still repurchase it because it is a great value and smells great.</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle as a gift and enjoyed it so much that when it was gone</li>
            <li> The lavender smell is very relaxing and isnt too strong.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for Epsom Salt at meaningful quantities, you would be better off buying the dry version of this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bubbly, foamy, makes giant bubbles, smells amazing and is super relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have tried various bubble baths and was honestly, temporarily excited by the price and positive reviews of this</li>
            <li> as far as the bubble bath goes- we love it.</li>
            <li> positives of this product are that the scent is fair in aroma-strength, and the bath lather texture created by the product as well as the few bubbles which are created actually last for a good amount of time (20+ minutes in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that this product is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect fancy oil slicks on your bathtub, just a nice scent and decent bubble action.</li>
            <li> While reading these reviews yesterday, a noticed one mentioned that you can purchase this product at Wal-Mart for $4 and change, so when I went to Wal-Mart today, I decided to check it out and the person was right, the price is $4.87...</li>
            <li> Grabbed this because it was cheap and just can&#x27;t believe the fresh natural scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lavender bubble bath at a VERY reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Very, very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Using regular shower gel was better than this product.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product because a hot bubble bath helps my wife relax.</li>
            <li> This provides her with another safe means to help her deal with bodily pain relief.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> A lot like sitting in the hot tub.</li>
            <li> When I first got in the bath it made me feel like I just smoked a fat &#x27;ol blunt</li>
            <li> I have definitely had better bath products than this.</li>
            <li> As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
            <li> While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, it is sometimes true that you get what you pay for--I believe such a statement holds true in this</li>
            <li> First, it requires too much soap to justify the amount of bubbles/foam it yields.</li>
            <li> Certainly large quantity at reasonable price</li>
            <li> Some bubble baths don&#x27;t foam up much, you have to put a lot in.  </li>
            <li> EXPECTED  MORE</li>
            <li> Items as described..  fast shipping ..</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t change the formula on us, this will always be real winner.</li>
            <li> The price was certainly reasonable.</li>
            <li> The bubbles pop around you and it creates a very relaxing experience.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t use too much or you might die.</li>
            <li> a harmless guilty pleasure!--but Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath is by far the best product out there.  </li>
            <li> I find myself more often using items with less smell.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and a big fan of the bubbles, you are better off buying a different bubble bath product.  </li>
            <li> I stock up whenever I see this for a decent price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fiancÃ©e loves it  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> maybe 1/10th of the bottle for a tub full of bubbles (remember to add the fluid directly into the water stream as you&#x27;re filling up the tub).&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> For multiple baths I added about a 1/10 or so of the entire bottle and ended up with minimal bubbleage (yes, it is fun to make up words sometimes :) ).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; is at a higher percent, but with a smaller font on the label.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite the large font on the label advertising &amp;#34;Pure Epsom Salt&amp;#34;, there are 7 other ingredients at higher percentages.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a pretty long way as well - and the bottle is pretty large compared to other bubble bath bottles, so it&#x27;s well worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very picky about my lavender products and believe me I&#x27;ve smelled all those phony scents that do not even resemble lavender, not to mention they do not contain any actual lavender.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the fact that the ingredient list was short, it didn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> , alas there are others out there for the same price that I think a superior.</li>
            <li> So, right now, I will give it 2 stars and will check back later after I try it out...      </li>
            <li> and you get a decent amount in the bottle (although that benefit is negated with how much you have to use just to get a little sudsy action going).</li>
            <li> High price for return on bubble investment-not hard to blow through a bottle quickly if you are not careful!</li>
            <li> As a long time lover of anything lavender, I highly recommend this foaming bath.</li>
            <li> The scent is potent, the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting, and I only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long lasting bubbles and nice scent, but I wish it were a bit moisturizing and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Teal&#x27;s is far less expensive and just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Consequently, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The bubbles last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The smell is relaxing and the bubbles last hella long.</li>
            <li> Lots of lavish bubbles, long lasting too!  </li>
            <li> The scent and long lasting bubbles make my baths so relaxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice smell but a very faint one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lavendar smell is so relaxing especially after a long week!</li>
            <li> Bubbles last a long time!</li>
            <li> Plan on buying at least 4 if you want it to last the whole month.</li>
            <li> negative is that I expected it to actually help create a bath full of bubbles, but received very minimal bubbleage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super relaxing -- guaranteed to help me prepare for sleep when I have a lot on my mind or a tired body after a long work day!</li>
            <li> The scent stays long after the bath.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Found this at our local big box retailer for less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> IF I choose to soak in the tub vs the shower, this is the ticket to&lt;br /&gt;soothing, relaxing relief from a long day !&lt;</li>
            <li> This has very little lavender scent compared to the epsom salts of the same brand, and one has to use almost a cup of the fluid to get any bubbles at all.</li>
            <li> Not as aromatic as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Minimal scent.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way in a whirlpool!  </li>
            <li> however it was shipped and spilled over some other items in the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully it is just my experience, and may have something to do with the amount of water pressure my faucet produces (maybe my faucet water pressure is lower than in some other households)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was the watered down version</li>
            <li> so, does this mean that it was tested prior to adding the scent?</li>
            <li> have never used a product which claims to be a \\&quot;foaming bath\\&quot; which produces less bubbles by quantity than this product.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve never bought it before, I expected a small luxury item -</li>
            <li> I have it on subscription to keep plenty on hand &amp; save a few pennies;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s a waste to even include that fact on the label.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a local retailer for only $5.49 (sorry Amazon) but this soap is DANK!</li>
            <li> Some bubble bath liquids have the consistency of water, which I personally find disturbing when I pour them into the tub.  </li>
            <li> I have Psoriatic Arthritis and usually use epsom salt for the bath.  </li>
            <li> Very few bubbles though.</li>
            <li> If you love lavender, but hate those awful perfumy over-the-top scents, you will LOVE Dr. Teal&#x27;s Foaming Bath Lavender.  </li>
            <li> Now I can continue to have my little secret luxury</li>
            <li> I thought it was a product that is too expensive, since Walmart has it for less than 6 dollars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m literally obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> It is quite sad.</li>
            <li> Very thin, like water.</li>
            <li> I could have purchased 3 bottles of this product for less than one from this site without having to pay the outrageous fees for shipping and handling!!!    </li>
            <li> This was really disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it once to treat myself with some Lavender goodness, but was disappointed by this</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the lavender scent and plan to buy this again.  However, if you are looking for Epsom Salt at meaningful quantities, you would be better off buying the dry version of this product.  Despite the large font on the label advertising &amp;#34;Pure Epsom Salt&amp;#34;, there are 7 other ingredients at higher percentages.  &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; is at a higher percent, but with a smaller font on the label.&lt;br /&gt;It may be best to buy the liquid and add ordinary Epsom Salt from the drug store, if you want it at significant levels.</li>
            <li> All I smell is Epsom salt; there&#x27;s no lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fragrance snob. Grabbed this because it was cheap and just can&#x27;t believe the fresh natural scent. Foams great too, I give the baby a bath and he sleeps great after. Pavilions stopped carrying it so now I&#x27;m ordering it on Amazon. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Long lasting bubbles and nice scent, but I wish it were a bit moisturizing and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Lathers up great, smells not too strong, but still okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lavender bubble bath at a VERY reasonable price.  Don&#x27;t expect fancy oil slicks on your bathtub, just a nice scent and decent bubble action.</li>
            <li> Very, very relaxing. Good product, and the shipper was fast</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s soothes the body and makes you feel refreshed after taking your bubble bath. My fiancÃ©e loves it  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Christmas gift to hubby, he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product when I want to take an Epsom salt detox bath. Combined with Dr. Teals Epsom salt, it is great, relaxing, and always guarantees a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dr. Teal&#x27;s spearmint and lavender scented bubble baths.  The fragrance is practically non-existent, but I love the creamy and frothy and luxurious bubbles so much that I can&#x27;t complain.  The product is somewhat pricey but not exceedingly so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and when Walgreen&#x27;s&#x27; stopped carrying it I looked on line.  Now I can continue to have my little secret luxury when ever I want to.  This and my Oscar de la Renta and I&#x27;m good for the day!  Oscar and I have been pals for years as well.</li>
            <li> We purchased this and the epsom salts. This has very little lavender scent compared to the epsom salts of the same brand, and one has to use almost a cup of the fluid to get any bubbles at all. We won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Some bubble baths don&#x27;t foam up much, you have to put a lot in.  This one, you just drizzle it in under the running water and it foams up quite a bit.  Some bubble bath liquids have the consistency of water, which I personally find disturbing when I pour them into the tub.  Consistency of this product is pleasant, thicker like shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, calming scent. High price for return on bubble investment-not hard to blow through a bottle quickly if you are not careful!</li>
            <li> The foaming bath does have a very good smell but to achieve a decent amount of bubbles, 1/4 of the bottle needs to be used. Most of the bubbles dissipated after about 5-10 minutes. Using regular shower gel was better than this product. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> No bubbles! It&#x27;s okay and I thought it would be better judging from all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But, alas there are others out there for the same price that I think a superior.</li>
            <li> Bubble production good.  Not as aromatic as I expected.  Certainly large quantity at reasonable price</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF! Works great and makes for a wonderful soak!</li>
            <li> EXPECTED  MORE BUBBLES - SMELLS GREAT - STILL ENJOYING IT ! VERY PLEASED W/PURCHASE !!! MAY RE ORDER IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li> If you love bubbles, you will love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It produces lots of bubbles, but gives the water a &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender scent is soothing and relaxing and the epsom salt help soothe joint pains and aches.</li>
            <li> Items as described..  fast shipping ..very happy thanks...</li>
            <li> We purchased this product because a hot bubble bath helps my wife relax. This provides her with another safe means to help her deal with bodily pain relief.</li>
            <li> IF I choose to soak in the tub vs the shower, this is the ticket to&lt;br /&gt;soothing, relaxing relief from a long day !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a beautiful fragrant smell, and makes me feel so feminine !â™¥</li>
            <li> Great stuff and relaxing.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and the properties of the lavender and naturally relaxing! A little bit goes a pretty long way as well - and the bottle is pretty large compared to other bubble bath bottles, so it&#x27;s well worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Very few bubbles though.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way in a whirlpool!  Even the granddaughter loved the scent and the lavender scent helped us both to sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bubble bath. The lavendar smell is so relaxing especially after a long week! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have it on subscription to keep plenty on hand &amp; save a few pennies;&lt;br /&gt;i also have the eucalyptus;</li>
            <li> While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  Dr. Teal&#x27;s will not fill your bathtub with bubbles, but you will have plenty of suds.  I actually prefer the lower level of bubbles in this bath.  Furthermore, the fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering at all.  As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice but you have to put a great deal of it in to get much foam. Consequently, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> love this smelling bath oil</li>
            <li> While reading these reviews yesterday, a noticed one mentioned that you can purchase this product at Wal-Mart for $4 and change, so when I went to Wal-Mart today, I decided to check it out and the person was right, the price is $4.87...I bought the Lavender 34 Fluid Ounce along with the Rosemary and Mint...    I could have purchased 3 bottles of this product for less than one from this site without having to pay the outrageous fees for shipping and handling!!!    Things are purchased from Amazon.com because of the reliability of the site and the great deals, not to be ripped-off!!!    Because, I just bought this just a couple of hours ago, I have not had the opportunity to use it as yet, however I do like the nice wonderful fragrance...    So, right now, I will give it 2 stars and will check back later after I try it out...      As of today, 12/10/2014, I increased my rating from 2 to 4, the product is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle. I use it in the bath in the morning actually, so it doesn&#x27;t actually promote sleep. It relaxes me and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m literally obsessed with this stuff. It&#x27;s bubbly, foamy, makes giant bubbles, smells amazing and is super relaxing. I will only buy this brand for my daily bubble baths. I have very sensitive skin and this stuff works amazingly fine with my skin and my dermatologist said it chill.</li>
            <li> Found this at our local big box retailer for less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;Used maybe 1/10th of the bottle for a tub full of bubbles (remember to add the fluid directly into the water stream as you&#x27;re filling up the tub).&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice scent. Makes good bubbles.</li>
            <li> If you love lavender, but hate those awful perfumy over-the-top scents, you will LOVE Dr. Teal&#x27;s Foaming Bath Lavender.  I&#x27;ve always been very picky about my lavender products and believe me I&#x27;ve smelled all those phony scents that do not even resemble lavender, not to mention they do not contain any actual lavender. Not this product.  As a long time lover of anything lavender, I highly recommend this foaming bath. I use it as a shower gel, or as a nice relaxing bubble bath. The scent is truly lavender! If they don&#x27;t change the formula on us, this will always be real winner. I find it at Target for $4.99--no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> I love lavender and have been purchasing lavender bubble bath from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn -- an excellent product by pricey --Dr. Teal&#x27;s is far less expensive and just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great smell and lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li> Works well! Smells great, feels great. Got some for my wife for Christmas and, but don&#x27;t tell her, I sometimes use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The smell is so relaxing and has a pleasant scent. It surely relaxes me and helps me sleep. The price was certainly reasonable.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Lots of bubbles. Just a little goes a long way.  Makes bath feel like silk.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s products, and being able to order it here before I run out assures me that I will always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> the smell of it  relax me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I purchased from another store in a more concentrated form. I didn&#x27;t know this was the watered down version but considering the amount I paid, I suppose it was an OK.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I purchased this stuff,  It softens the water.  The smell is great. If you enjoy relaxing baths, I recommend you try this.  You do not have to use a lot.  The bubbles last a long time.  The scent stays long after the bath.</li>
            <li> Love it! I buy this often. I love the smell and i love the bubbles! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased it once to treat myself with some Lavender goodness, but was disappointed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The price is above what you&#x27;d pay for it in Walmart. But since I&#x27;ve never bought it before, I expected a small luxury item - instead, I got a run-of-the-mill cheap bubble soap.&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is the most important thing, and this soap just doesn&#x27;t have much power at all. It&#x27;s a nice smell but a very faint one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just feel that it was quire underwhelming item for the price I paid for it. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal (whoever he is) has a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overly generous with the bubbles, but has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;and does the job.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  The lavender smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my Mother. She loves it. It smells great and it foams and bubbles a lot. Will order some more.</li>
            <li> Great foaming bubble bath with a great lavender sent!</li>
            <li> smells great, bought different scents and like them all. like the price and the bubbles are abundant get some for yourself</li>
            <li> I sometimes mix this with Epsom salts for a bath, but the smell is pretty strong.  I find myself more often using items with less smell.  If stronger smells aren&#x27;t a problem for you, this is your bath item.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon because it was one of the best deals on foaming bath soap. I am not impressed. First, it requires too much soap to justify the amount of bubbles/foam it yields. It is quite sad. The one good thing I could day about it, is that it smells really nice and you get a decent amount in the bottle (although that benefit is negated with how much you have to use just to get a little sudsy action going). In addition, the label on the back of the bottle says that the &amp;#34;final product&amp;#34; is not tested on animals... Okay... so, does this mean that it was tested prior to adding the scent? In addition, I just don&#x27;t understand why soap would need to be tested on animals at all. It&#x27;s not like this is going on your eyelashes or will be consumed. It&#x27;s soap! I just don&#x27;t agree with it. I feel like it&#x27;s a waste to even include that fact on the label.</li>
            <li> as far as the bubble bath goes- we love it. the smell is relaxing and the soap is soothing to your skin. however it was shipped and spilled over some other items in the box. luckily i was able to clean it up.</li>
            <li> Good feel, easy clean, sleep well</li>
            <li> This was really disappointing.  I had to use like 1/2 the bottle to create any bubbles and the aroma was medicinal, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just like the apsom Salt by Dr Teal this is Bubble Bath and it too is a Great product.  Calms and helps all your aches and pains go away. This is from a doctor on the Doctor OZ Show. I have been using this product for a long time.  It works.</li>
            <li> The best bubble bath out there! Plus it smells heavenly</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and it smells wonderful. Just enough smell to it to not be overpowering, yet calming. The bubbles pop around you and it creates a very relaxing experience. A lot like sitting in the hot tub. Wonderful for a stress reliever. Get some today at this awesome price.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, it is sometimes true that you get what you pay for--I believe such a statement holds true in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an almost daily bather (literally meaning that I take a bath almost every day based on doctor recommendations).  I have tried various bubble baths and was honestly, temporarily excited by the price and positive reviews of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a product which claims to be a \\&quot;foaming bath\\&quot; which produces less bubbles by quantity than this product.  It is a rather oily mixture which has holds out for great hopes (in being so condensed) but the result, in my opinion, is far from satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle tells you something like \\&quot;add a generous amount\\&quot; to your bath.  For multiple baths I added about a 1/10 or so of the entire bottle and ended up with minimal bubbleage (yes, it is fun to make up words sometimes :) ).  I even tried \\&quot;scratching\\&quot; the product in with the water to produce a more bubbly bath and to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives of this product are that the scent is fair in aroma-strength, and the bath lather texture created by the product as well as the few bubbles which are created actually last for a good amount of time (20+ minutes in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative is that I expected it to actually help create a bath full of bubbles, but received very minimal bubbleage creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it is just my experience, and may have something to do with the amount of water pressure my faucet produces (maybe my faucet water pressure is lower than in some other households) but I, personally, do not recommend this product if you are looking for a lot of bubbles in your bubble bath.  If you are like me and a big fan of the bubbles, you are better off buying a different bubble bath product.  Actually, I have had good success with cheaper, store-brand bubble bath products and so recommend maybe looking into those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just my thoughts... I hope they help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and Happy Bathing!</li>
            <li> Gotten this for my friend, she seems to like it. Plenty of foam but you need to use a lot of it. Plan on buying at least 4 if you want it to last the whole month.</li>
            <li> So soothing.  I have Psoriatic Arthritis and usually use epsom salt for the bath.  Lavendar is my favorite scent, so, this absolutely fit the bill.  I love soaking in this in the evening.</li>
            <li> Used by both my dog and I. We both loved it : ) I would buy again and will try other scents.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of Lavender but I do not want it to be over powering either. I like taking a bubble bath about once a week and this always sooths and relaxes me. I have been using Dr Teals brand as compared to others it is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a product that is too expensive, since Walmart has it for less than 6 dollars and I paid over 11 dollars.</li>
            <li> I stock up whenever I see this for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different bubble bath products in the past--they&#x27;re a harmless guilty pleasure!--but Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath is by far the best product out there.  The scent is potent, the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting, and I only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is my favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s super relaxing -- guaranteed to help me prepare for sleep when I have a lot on my mind or a tired body after a long work day!</li>
            <li> Love this product. The smell is very nice but not too overpowering, and it stays with you. Your skin will smell wonderful the whole day.</li>
            <li> my husband loves the stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a local retailer for only $5.49 (sorry Amazon) but this soap is DANK! The smell is relaxing and the bubbles last hella long. When I first got in the bath it made me feel like I just smoked a fat &#x27;ol blunt - don&#x27;t use too much or you might die. The end.</li>
            <li> I use this every night in bath water along with Dr. Teals Epsom salt.  Love it</li>
            <li> Combine this with the epsom salt of the same fragrance for a great bath time experience. Bubbles last a long time!</li>
            <li> The title says it all!  Lots of lavish bubbles, long lasting too!  I just wish that it had more of a lavender scent, but for the price I am not complaining.  I also appreciated the fact that the ingredient list was short, it didn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> I had not tried Dr. Teals before, and am now a big fan. The scent and long lasting bubbles make my baths so relaxing. I love anything lavender, and this is definitely a high quality bath product. I will get more, and often so I never run out. Thank You, amazon for yet another great item at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> makes a nice amount of bubbles, lightly scented</li>
            <li> Love it. Calms me before going to bed. The lavender is a wonderful smell and the price is right. Excellent</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle as a gift and enjoyed it so much that when it was gone I bought another. I plan on buying another one when this one is gone too.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teals is by far the best body soak/bath around.!!!  10 stars!</li>
            <li> Very thin, like water. Minimal scent. I have definitely had better bath products than this. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, great packaging, overall great product.  It makes very big foamy bubbles that sit on top of the water, but I do not find it very moisturizing and the bubbles don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to, but I would still repurchase it because it is a great value and smells great.</li>
            <li> The are not as many bubbles as i would have liked (I love LOTS of bubbles). The lavender smell is very relaxing and isnt too strong. The lavender is supposed to help you sleep. I think that this product is definitely worth buying. I enjoy is very much!</li>
