            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good eye drop.</li>
            <li>Packaged nice.</li>
            <li>They are also very easy to take with one as one can take just the vial used for the day.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Use this 3 or 4 times a day and your eyes will feel better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging; so easy to administer when needed by spouse.</li>
            <li>Best for dry or itchy eyes.  </li>
            <li>The best I have forum for my Dry Eyes.  </li>
            <li>And it is preservative free, which is important because preservatives irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>is by far better from Amazon.</li>
            <li>A trick though that my sister taught me to put eye drops in your own eyes especially if you&#x27;re squeamish about putting anything in your eyes like I am:  </li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>doctor said quit using red eye remover drops lubricating and to only use lubricating drops gave me a sample of this my eyes have been feeling great</li>
            <li>but it does burn a bit when I first put drops in.</li>
            <li>The other products did nothing, this one works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>Really makes it possible to wear my lenses for many hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Alcon Labs products for many years, and lived not far from their Texas labs, so have confidence in the company.  </li>
            <li>is that because these are thicker drops they are better for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and lubricating.</li>
            <li>I was told to use Systane and the individual PRESERVATIVE FREE vials when I got shingles in my eye, and I am continuing using them now twice a day until I see the doctor in six months.  </li>
            <li>My retina specialist recommended this product to me when I could not tolerate the discomfort from my Wet AMD any more.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>That being so stated, it too is over-priced, and these products are pricing themselves out of the market because the people who need them the most have less income now</li>
            <li>What you do is close your eyes and put a drop right on the tear duct then open your eyes and turn your head so the drop falls in your eye.  </li>
            <li>My red eye resolved in just three days, not the usual week on its own.</li>
            <li>and this will naturally correct the redness.</li>
            <li>Her advice that these prevent any chance of infection in the eye being used in sounded very sensible to me and as long as I need to use drops for eyes for dryness</li>
            <li>(As an added comment she told me I could use the vial all day but to then throw it out and open a fresh one each day (once the top is broken off, it reseals and can be opened and closed again).</li>

            <li> I like the individual packaging of this eye drop. doctor said quit using red eye remover drops lubricating and to only use lubricating drops gave me a sample of this my eyes have been feeling great</li>
            <li> Love the packaging; so easy to administer when needed by spouse.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Packaged nice. Great product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference. The eye doctor did recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really makes it possible to wear my lenses for many hours.</li>
            <li> Eye drops with no preservatives that were recommended to me for my dry eyes by my clinic. Very soothing and lubricating.</li>
            <li> Systane seems to last a little longer than my old standby Refresh but it does burn a bit when I first put drops in.</li>
            <li> I was told to use Systane and the individual PRESERVATIVE FREE vials when I got shingles in my eye, and I am continuing using them now twice a day until I see the doctor in six months.  Her advice that these prevent any chance of infection in the eye being used in sounded very sensible to me and as long as I need to use drops for eyes for dryness I will only buy this brand and the individual vials.  They are also very easy to take with one as one can take just the vial used for the day.  (As an added comment she told me I could use the vial all day but to then throw it out and open a fresh one each day (once the top is broken off, it reseals and can be opened and closed again).</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price. I&#x27;ve been buying this at CVS and the quantity and price is by far better from Amazon. Love this product.</li>
            <li> These are the be eye gtts for dry eyes and actually that is what my Ophthmologist told me anyway is that because these are thicker drops they are better for dry eyes.  A trick though that my sister taught me to put eye drops in your own eyes especially if you&#x27;re squeamish about putting anything in your eyes like I am:  What you do is close your eyes and put a drop right on the tear duct then open your eyes and turn your head so the drop falls in your eye.  It works every time.  Try it</li>
            <li> Best for dry or itchy eyes.  Use this 3 or 4 times a day and your eyes will feel better.  Especially great for Sojourner&#x27;s Syndrome patients&lt;br /&gt;Jan in Idaho</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. I used to have terribly red eyes. My doctor suggested that I start using this product to relieve they dry eyes and this will naturally correct the redness. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. Love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyes fro tearing all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best, non-prescription lubricating single-dose  eye drops ever.  Much better than anything else I have tried. I have a bad reaction to preservatives, so this is a boon to my red eyes.</li>
            <li> Have used product before.  It&#x27;s a good eye drop.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my opthamologist for my dry eyes, use them every evening before going to sleep, after I spend a couple hours on the PC and after being outside in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Soothing, non-irritating drops. My red eye resolved in just three days, not the usual week on its own.</li>
            <li> My opthamalogist recommended this product, after i tried other kinds of artificial tears for my post-surgery dryness, and to repair my cornea.  The other products did nothing, this one works amazingly.  And it is preservative free, which is important because preservatives irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very dry and Systane lubricates my eyes quite well.</li>
            <li> The best I have forum for my Dry Eyes.  Soothing, lubricating and refreshing when my eyes get uncomfortable. Recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> These are eye drops were  precscribed by an Ophthalmologist.  FYI: Check with your Opthamologist prior to purchasing.  They are individual ampules.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this solution in a bottle.  Contamination is a probable possibility.  Whether they improve your dry eye condition is to be determined by an Opthamologist.</li>
            <li> very good drops and the price is right</li>
            <li> My retina specialist recommended this product to me when I could not tolerate the discomfort from my Wet AMD any more.  He did emphasize the &amp;#34;additive-free&amp;#34; Systane, which I do purchase.  I&#x27;ve used Alcon Labs products for many years, and lived not far from their Texas labs, so have confidence in the company.  That being so stated, it too is over-priced, and these products are pricing themselves out of the market because the people who need them the most have less income now and these are all &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; (OTC) products.</li>
            <li> My optometrist recommended these for dry eyes. I use a vial in each eye every day before I put in my contact lenses. Very helpful.</li>
