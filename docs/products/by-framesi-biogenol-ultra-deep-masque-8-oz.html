            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>Framesi products are all wonderful.</li>
            <li>This hair product works great!</li>
            <li>Great conditioning treatment and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>It is the BEST on my fine hair!!</li>
            <li>Great for your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think their salon Framesi colors were always the best highlights and produced the prettiest, softest cool and neutral blonds, too.</li>
            <li>It makes the softness and texture of my hair amazing.</li>
            <li>When I found it online, I was so thrilled.  </li>
            <li>If you can find a salon that still uses the brand, combined with a good colorist, I don&#x27;t think you can do better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the smell kind of balances it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it - kind of pricey though.</li>
            <li>Since I found this product, I have been able to grow my hair out longer.  </li>
            <li>this is a wonderful deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this salon product for many years</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair care product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>but it could smell better.</li>
            <li>Well, the product is getting harder to find, but it is still the best conditioner out there for hair that gets color application once a month.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft with a great shine without being oily.  </li>
            <li>I use Kerastase and Shu Umera as well, but those products can really break the bank, so whenever I can get my hands on good ol&#x27; Biogenol</li>
            <li>whole line is good, the leave in spray conditioner, the curl snapp, the humectants.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and sometimes it gets over processed because I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth, shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and find that it is a great conditioner for you hair.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>You will see a significant difference with just one use.</li>
            <li>aunt is a hairdresser and originally turned me onto this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super smooth and with a lot of shine.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best hair deep conditioning mask that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The Wella salon colors are good, but not the same, no matter who the stylist is.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite deep conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li>I wish I had 20-30 extra minutes to use it more often, or that Framesi would come out with a superb daily conditioner (I&#x27;ve tried several of theirs and haven&#x27;t found a comparable one).</li>
            <li>My hair color has looked good with minimal fading.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry frizzy hair, makes it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I like to think of it as a First Aid for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Consistent product</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>your hair is already dry, this will make it feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>it is very helpful once a week.</li>
            <li>If you have highly damaged hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair so you may possibly need to use it more often if your hair is severely damaged.</li>
            <li>It did a good job of rehydrating my fine, thin hair without weighting it down.</li>
            <li>I live in San Francisco where you would think I could get my hands on anything, but</li>
            <li>It is the absolute ultimate in conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>Soft, well cared for hair is guaranteed with Biogenol.</li>
            <li>I put a plastic type hair cap over my wet hair to keep from drying out, but even if the hair around my face dries, it rinses out very well and the shine!  </li>
            <li>If your hair is healthy, I am not sure whether it would make it feel greasy with leave-in use like this as mine is naturally on the dry side.</li>
            <li>This always gave the same results, leaving my hair soft, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I towel dry my hair, I apply the product to the ends of my hair going as far up as about one inch from the scalp.</li>
            <li>It has helped my hair withstand going from black to blonde without much damage.</li>

            <li> My hair type is color treated and loose ringlet curls, which tend to frizz at the end of the hair cycle before the next haircut/color.  </li>

            <li> I have long, unbelievably thick, course, BLONDE, highlighted hair.</li>

            <li> IT DOES SMELL A LITTLE LIKE HAIR DYE.</li>
            <li> When your hair needs a serious boost of help due to extreme brittleness from hair coloring, or exposure to sun, this will repair it.</li>

            <li> I use it at least once a week just on the damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I use at least one a month</li>
            <li> I use it at least 1xWeek, and the day after straightening my hair.  </li>

            <li> It is so difficult to find now</li>

            <li> I color my hair and sometimes it gets over processed because I have fine hair.  Since I found this product, I have been able to grow my hair out longer.  I use it at least once a week just on the damaged ends. It does wonders! I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair so you may possibly need to use it more often if your hair is severely damaged. It is pricey but a little goes a long ways if you use it just on the ends. I don&#x27;t think you would want to use it on your whole head unless the damage was pretty bad. I have only tried the Framesi Masque product but am thinking about trying others.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful deep conditioner.  I use it every two weeks.  If you have highly damaged hair it is very helpful once a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years as a hair stylist recommended it years ago to keep color from fading and to condition my hair.  I use at least one a month and it does not strip out the color.  I even sleep in it and rinse out in the morning as there is never any residue left and that has been a problem with a lot of other conditioners... I put a plastic type hair cap over my wet hair to keep from drying out, but even if the hair around my face dries, it rinses out very well and the shine!  Well, the product is getting harder to find, but it is still the best conditioner out there for hair that gets color application once a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this salon product for many years and I love it - kind of pricey though. When I found it online, I was so thrilled.  The product arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry frizzy hair, makes it soft and manageable.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and find that it is a great conditioner for you hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent....love this masque. It makes the softness and texture of my hair amazing.Framesi products are all wonderful.Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Have been using this hair masque by Framesi for several years. It is the absolute ultimate in conditioning treatments. When your hair needs a serious boost of help due to extreme brittleness from hair coloring, or exposure to sun, this will repair it. You will see a significant difference with just one use. It&#x27;s super thick and it penetrates! Gets to those hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair softer, manageable, shinier and healthier looking immediately.  I like to think of it as a First Aid for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Love it. Great for your hair. I highly recommend it. Leaves hair super smooth and with a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 20 years, during which time my hair has changed from oily to dry, been colored a couple of times. This always gave the same results, leaving my hair soft, silky, and shiny. I wish I had 20-30 extra minutes to use it more often, or that Framesi would come out with a superb daily conditioner (I&#x27;ve tried several of theirs and haven&#x27;t found a comparable one).</li>
            <li> Great conditioning treatment and smells awesome. Leaves hair smooth, shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li> This hair product works great! I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. It makes my hair soft with a great shine without being oily.  However, the container it arrived in was smashed in several pieces. I&#x27;m having to scrape the product off of the plastic wrap it came in and transfer it to another container. Disappointing for sure. I will buy the product again but not from this vender.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best hair deep conditioning mask that I&#x27;ve ever used.  All others that I&#x27;ve tried cannot measure up.  I use it at least 1xWeek, and the day after straightening my hair.  My hair type is color treated and loose ringlet curls, which tend to frizz at the end of the hair cycle before the next haircut/color.  Before the next cut, I increase use to 2xWeek.  It can also be left on overnite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on since 1995. I keep coming back to it. I have long, unbelievably thick, course, BLONDE, highlighted hair. As you can imagine, between the texture and color, my hair can become a haystack in no time without constant conditioning. I use Kerastase and Shu Umera as well, but those products can really break the bank, so whenever I can get my hands on good ol&#x27; Biogenol I use it. It is so difficult to find now, I hope it doesn&#x27;t disappear. I live in San Francisco where you would think I could get my hands on anything, but no, I had to turn to Amazon to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think their salon Framesi colors were always the best highlights and produced the prettiest, softest cool and neutral blonds, too. The Wella salon colors are good, but not the same, no matter who the stylist is. If you can find a salon that still uses the brand, combined with a good colorist, I don&#x27;t think you can do better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole line is good, the leave in spray conditioner, the curl snapp, the humectants. I love it all. Soft, well cared for hair is guaranteed with Biogenol.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair care product.  Not only does it provide protection from the &#x27;heat devices&#x27; but I use instead of a conditioner.  The fragrance lasts after rinsing for a few hours.  Consistent product</li>
            <li> It did a good job of rehydrating my fine, thin hair without weighting it down. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have used it for years and am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite deep conditioner for many years. It performs well for my hair type (color-processed) - I use it once a week. Highly recommended &amp; very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product is no longer manufactured.  I have used it for years.  It is the BEST on my fine hair!!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair or hair that you recently dyed a lot, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aunt is a hairdresser and originally turned me onto this product. She recommended I use it as a leave in conditioner to improve the health of my hair and protect the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I towel dry my hair, I apply the product to the ends of my hair going as far up as about one inch from the scalp. It has helped my hair withstand going from black to blonde without much damage. IT DOES SMELL A LITTLE LIKE HAIR DYE. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of it but it could smell better. I use a Bvlgari shampoo so the smell kind of balances it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is already dry, this will make it feel healthy. If your hair is healthy, I am not sure whether it would make it feel greasy with leave-in use like this as mine is naturally on the dry side. I&#x27;m not sure how well it protects color as I have never dyed my hair without using this product. My hair color has looked good with minimal fading.</li>
