    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my lipstick for over a year. It just recently broke ( I think because of using it in the shower) am buying again. Came with not only 2 lipsticks but also came with a bonus dice game. Very fun. Works well and works fast. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am in love!! I am thinking about buying one for each of my girlfriend&#x27;s.  Small but its does the job.</li>
            <li> i had waited for this product i never received it so I&#x27;m not sure how good of a product this is. hopefully you guys can tell me if it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great for a little something dirty kept in my purse</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because I got a bonus gift and the shipping was fast and efficient. However, the vibration is not powerful enough to do it for me. I don&#x27;t much pleasure from it, in all honesty. The price wasn&#x27;t incredibly high so I will just take the loss.</li>
            <li> Small and compact yet powerful and satisfying&lt;br /&gt;Good for ten dollars&lt;br /&gt;Thanks eforstore its very cool&lt;br /&gt;will continue shopping&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite product! OMG I can&#x27;t begin to tell u how powerful this little thing. I can orgasm in like 5 minutes with this thing. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s loud. But otherwise for the price and delivery it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Same size as lipstick but a bit loud. Works good. Came in discrete packaging a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was broken. Doesn&#x27;t turn on and is very low quality</li>
            <li> Im pleased with this item! It&#x27;s cute and blends well with my lip gloss collection lol</li>
            <li> Nice item. Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> Never worked horrible quality .</li>
            <li> it did not work... this was a wast of money i  wood not tell any one too buy this because it was junk ...</li>
            <li> super loud, and does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Did what I needed it to but the tip broke off after like the 6th use.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought a little add on item could be so fun. discreet and hit the spot. great battery life</li>
            <li> It truly looks exactly like a lipstick. No one would ever know the difference. It does its job and it does it fast. Enough said.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected for the money.  I ordered these as gifts for a bachelorette party! (THE GIRLS LOVED THEM)  The SELLER however went above and beyond I thought and that&#x27;s why I am giving it such a high review.  Knowing that one or two of these may not work out of the box he included a couple extra.  Also threw in a few small bonus gifts!  Will buy from him again next time gifts are needed!!!&lt;br /&gt;~Abbie~</li>
            <li> One speed. It is nice it just doesn&#x27;t last very long. After a couple months and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This Product did not work! I would not suggest buying it .</li>
