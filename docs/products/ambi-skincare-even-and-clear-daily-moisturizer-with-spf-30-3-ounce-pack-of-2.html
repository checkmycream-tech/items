            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I have been using Ambi products for years to even out my fair complexion and get rid of spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>But seller did a good job in ensuring it arrived on time and looked as pictured.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s a fairly good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I took the bottle to my dermatologist and she said the product has good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>It has a good fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that the product is not too oily and it does not leave an ashy residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and i can say i am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>This product betters your skin and makes it look better than before!  </li>
            <li>When I use to use dove even tone, it darkened me evenly, and I liked it</li>
            <li>In combination with the Ambi body lotion, and the Ambi exfoliating facial wash, gives my face a wonderful caramel glow with even tone (no need for makeup!), and has successfully stopped my acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, because I have fair skin and really do need a sunscreen and a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many sunblocks and I haven&#x27;t occurred this kind of problem before.</li>
            <li>And I love not having to go to the store and hunt around for what I want.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use something more affordable than the $30 MaryKay sunscreen +</li>
            <li>As always test products to make sure they don&#x27;t break out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I still like this product, but I discovered something better.</li>
            <li>routine that I was referring too that I found was better for my skin without all of those chemicals that are in this Ambi product</li>
            <li>i would go to sallys to get this product and pay more for one bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love AMBI products and its creamy and can&#x27;t beat the SPF 30 for this price.</li>
            <li>I really think this product is great and it has made my skin glow</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Ambi&#x27;s moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I received the product on time and was very much satisfied with the product and also the packaging was nicelt done.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li>It has a very light &#x27;clean&#x27; fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price of one I purchased 2 bottles of the cream and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>friend, a very beautiful woman with a dark complexion and darker acne scars tried this routine twice a day.</li>
            <li>Sounds too good to be true, but it really happened.</li>
            <li>It feels good not to wear foundation and be able to hug people at social gatherings and not worry about getting their outfits \</li>
            <li>I even put some of the face moisturizer on some light stretchmarks</li>
            <li>it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>light and smooth with out a greasy feel i can use it once in am</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I found other methods that limit the chemical load on my skin, is a cheaper alternative, and is better for the health of my skin/body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I keep experiencing these great results.</li>
            <li>within a week, the skin there was significantly smoother, and the marks are fading.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years - works great for complexion, it&#x27;s non-greasy, and SPF 30 all year long (not just in the summer).</li>
            <li>Rich without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and moist like nothing is on it.</li>
            <li>a get compliments on my skin and even told I must wear special makeup (don&#x27;t use makeup).    </li>
            <li>So, I needed a moisturizer and this one got such good reviews</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and is super affordable.</li>
            <li>My marks are fading quickly.</li>
            <li>But I was looking for a quick one week cure.  </li>
            <li>shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The fluffiness helps it to spread on quickly.</li>
            <li>skin tone evening works quickly on lighter discolorations.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is reasonably priced, and the fragrance is very mild.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed when I could no longer find it in Walgreens or Walmart stores - very happy and pleased Amazon was able to locate product</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer with a sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn!</li>
            <li>Benefits of using a sunblock are: no wait time for absorbtion onto the skin because it coats the skin which makes it work immediately; more effective at screening UVA; and less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes--it tends to burn a little.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>enough it is oil free and has vitamin C and E in it, For my skin that was my selling point there and Amazon gives you such a great price on it to.</li>
            <li>So far, results have been outstanding.</li>
            <li>And I feel better knowing this product was developed taking into consideration the skin concerns of women of color.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks, but it feels really nice on my face.</li>
            <li>It evens out skin-tone, and helps to bring more compliments, to this 40 yr old.</li>
            <li>This has worked well to protect my face and neck from the high sun rays (although I still try to stay out of the sun as much as possible) also most moisturizers used to make me break out, such that I stopped using day moisturizers at one point, but this has worked greatly for my skin, no breakouts.</li>
            <li>Using lemon juice first (if you skin can stand it) helps to remove lines and prepares skin for the Ambi.</li>
            <li>It has SPF 30 and it is not wildly expensive.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t need it anymore, but for those who are interested in trying.</li>
            <li>: I thought that it would be better if I list my alternate routine in the review section to assist others who are interested.</li>
            <li>Everything is not for everybody, but my skin (face and body) loves coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please be aware of the difference between a sunblock and sunscreen (which this Ambi product IS).</li>
            <li>As the title reads, this is the first sunblock that I&#x27;m aware of that I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction to.</li>
            <li>many times my eyes actually get watery.</li>
            <li>I resorted to swiping the tube in the dispenser to catch some of the contents-which defeats the purpose of the dispenser in the first place.</li>
            <li>I like it but prefer sensitive skin if it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had a bottle that was nearly full with the sunblock inside, and despite pressing down the dispenser many times, the contents wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I live in hot hot Nigeria where the sun, well, is something else.</li>
            <li>But what I really admire about this is that it aids in fading/depleting hyperpigmentation spots, however gradual, which was a large reason why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I want to do everything I can to take care of my skin (I spent too many years neglecting it...</li>
            <li>: the produce did eventually cause light outbreaks on my chin and cheeks with daily use.</li>
            <li>Now my whole face takes the darker color instead of the lighter part.</li>
            <li>Sunscreens work by absorbing the UVA and UVB rays which can still cause skin irritations that can result in hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my coloring is very even.  </li>
            <li>Getting ready to order again.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin and the seller for me</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m black), but since my dermatologist advises it, I&#x27;m glad Ambi&#x27;s got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry look or feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is bright white and almost fluffy feeling.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is highly ineffective at getting the contents at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>is that it contains so a high amount of SPF which we all need.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it makes me any more even and clear than any other skin moisturizer, but I like the product</li>
            <li>If you top this off with several minutes a day of facial exercises (find them for free on YouTube) be amazed at how you can not only stop but turn back the clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No negative reaction at all with this product.</li>
            <li>(which is what many skin care experts recommend) or wear it for too long, it irritates my eyes to the point where my eyelids don&#x27;t want to remain open and</li>
            <li>I moved to a new city</li>
            <li>and I have had a hard time finding the product, but since I love it so much</li>
            <li>I just started using the moisturizer with Sunblock and so far no break-outs!</li>
            <li>It also seems to have just a little hint of a golden glow to it, which I really like!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Even &amp; Clear moisturizer/sunscreen for 2+ months.</li>
            <li>I use it in the mornings and at night after using the clear cleansing foamer to wash my face.</li>
            <li>So far, none.</li>
            <li>So far, none.</li>
            <li>I guess because I&#x27;m also using the Ambi fade cream daily, the results are really pronounced.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or breakouts, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely, and does not leave any residual oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected and was received timely.</li>
            <li>For the last year, I have been using my new method</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and use this as my daily moisturizer against the desert sun.</li>
            <li>Darker spots are a little more stubborn, but they are visibly lighter after a few months use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments about my skin lately because of this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that I was clearing up, I&#x27;ve been asked what I put on my face because it was definitely working, and I&#x27;ve been told that my \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; was great because it made my skin look smooth.</li>

            <li> But what I really admire about this is that it aids in fading/depleting hyperpigmentation spots, however gradual, which was a large reason why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I want to do everything I can to take care of my skin (I spent too many years neglecting it...</li>
            <li> : the produce did eventually cause light outbreaks on my chin and cheeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> Now my whole face takes the darker color instead of the lighter part.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens work by absorbing the UVA and UVB rays which can still cause skin irritations that can result in hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my coloring is very even.  </li>
            <li> Getting ready to order again.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin and the seller for me</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m black), but since my dermatologist advises it, I&#x27;m glad Ambi&#x27;s got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry look or feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is bright white and almost fluffy feeling.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is highly ineffective at getting the contents at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> is that it contains so a high amount of SPF which we all need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it makes me any more even and clear than any other skin moisturizer, but I like the product</li>
            <li> If you top this off with several minutes a day of facial exercises (find them for free on YouTube) be amazed at how you can not only stop but turn back the clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No negative reaction at all with this product.</li>
            <li> (which is what many skin care experts recommend) or wear it for too long, it irritates my eyes to the point where my eyelids don&#x27;t want to remain open and</li>
            <li> I moved to a new city</li>
            <li> and I have had a hard time finding the product, but since I love it so much</li>
            <li> I just started using the moisturizer with Sunblock and so far no break-outs!</li>
            <li> It also seems to have just a little hint of a golden glow to it, which I really like!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Even &amp; Clear moisturizer/sunscreen for 2+ months.</li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings and at night after using the clear cleansing foamer to wash my face.</li>
            <li> So far, none.</li>
            <li> So far, none.</li>
            <li> I guess because I&#x27;m also using the Ambi fade cream daily, the results are really pronounced.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or breakouts, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely, and does not leave any residual oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and was received timely.</li>
            <li> For the last year, I have been using my new method</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and use this as my daily moisturizer against the desert sun.</li>
            <li> Darker spots are a little more stubborn, but they are visibly lighter after a few months use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments about my skin lately because of this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that I was clearing up, I&#x27;ve been asked what I put on my face because it was definitely working, and I&#x27;ve been told that my \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; was great because it made my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> I looked at some products that are applied directly to the dark marks but that would take forever.      </li>
            <li> Not only this going to be difficult to do when the sunblock is at the bottom of the bottle, but I&#x27;ve had an instance in which the cheap tube actually broke from when I swiped the contents.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to stop and notice a difference after a few weeks because I&#x27;m not very regular about moisturizing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not only for the allergy experiences that I noted above, but also due to the bottle.</li>
            <li> : I add a little virgin coconut oil all over my face at night, which leaves my face extremely soft and well moisturized for the morning; and add sunblock (not sunscreen with carbon chemicals) in the morning before leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something about the soy complex really does brighten my skin, though.</li>
            <li> but when I wash my face, my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> My skin changes through the seasons, oily, combination, dry, flaky at times.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and it keeps me moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> I have always used oils on my face because it is so dry.</li>
            <li> I apply when my face feels dry because my face will eat this lotion up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already dark enough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and usually products that even skintone gives me acne or hives</li>
            <li> I have dark complexion and I am of Asian descent.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Aveeno was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Other products like CeraVe either burn my skin or leave it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I saw an Ambi commercial and thought \\&quot;hmmm another bogus women of color product\\&quot;  after using it for a few weeks I went to work and</li>
            <li> I like this product which is why I, at the very least, gave it a decent 3-star rating.</li>
            <li> I have some part of my face lighter than other parts.</li>
            <li> the other hand, sunblocks create a protective barrier that allows the UVA and UVB rays to bounce off the skin.</li>
            <li> and I plan to try other Ambi products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember: if there are any other active ingredients listed, it is not a sunblock (chem-free sunscreen/physical sunscreen).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient(s) are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or both.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really wanted something to fade my acne marks not create new ones.  </li>
            <li> The other one was the Olay one which has an SPF of 15 (half of this one).</li>
            <li> If you get back in the sun without sunblock it will ruin all of your hard work.</li>
            <li> I am a person who used to do nothing but pop pimples on my face to solve the problem, so I ended up with alot of dark marks.  </li>
            <li> No ashiness common to similar moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Well used continousely for a week and half no change</li>
            <li> Together, this regimen has cleared up acne and dark spots that I&#x27;ve been battling for over 10 years!</li>
            <li> A waste of my $20.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be enthusiastic about this product if only it didn&#x27;t cause the annoying and inconvenient allergic reaction/irritation to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , have been using it for few years.</li>
            <li> I am a fair-skinned Caucasian with uneven skin tones, and using this product once a day for four days, I don&#x27;t have any skin irritation but my skin feels parched.  </li>
            <li> I also like the SPF 30 without the funky sunscreen feeling left behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, nor is it a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> Used this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> My usual routine in the morning was to apply make-up to cover up my uneven skin-tone.  </li>
            <li> I use Obagi skin care which is very expensive but really works - I started using the Ambi after I had already bleached my skin out</li>
            <li> if you have acne prone skin (which is usually oily skin), applying any OIL or oil based product may clog your pores and cause additional acne.</li>
            <li> I started getting pimples in places where I usually don\\&quot;t break out.  </li>
            <li> I decided to check on Amazon where I can usually find anything I need</li>
            <li> I have used ambi cream for several years but it has gotten so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I complained about how the bottle was inefficient at getting the contents out and recommended that it use a toothpaste-like tube, and thereafter, the company announced that it was packaging the product in a toothpaste-like tube, like I&#x27;d recommended.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong here people</li>
            <li> so try it you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> They should get rid of this horrible packaging and put it in a toothpaste-like tube.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well used continousely for a week and half no change i guess it doesnt just work for me! Have stopped for a while but will try it again sometime and see if it will work this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ambi products for years to even out my fair complexion and get rid of spots on my face and hands. It helps to get rid of signs of aging on face, neck and hands - even legs. Using lemon juice first (if you skin can stand it) helps to remove lines and prepares skin for the Ambi. I just started using the moisturizer with Sunblock and so far no break-outs! Boy am I happy.I am also using this routine on my upper chest and cleavage to get rid of weathering and creasing - and it works but requires persistence. If you top this off with several minutes a day of facial exercises (find them for free on YouTube) be amazed at how you can not only stop but turn back the clock.&lt;br /&gt;My friend, a very beautiful woman with a dark complexion and darker acne scars tried this routine twice a day. It&#x27;s supposed to take about 2 months, but those scars that she had since HS (20 years)were GONE in 4 days. Sounds too good to be true, but it really happened. If you get back in the sun without sunblock it will ruin all of your hard work. I put on my spray Neutrogena block last week and got a migraine that lasted for hours. No negative reaction at all with this product. The price is EXCELLENT. And I love not having to go to the store and hunt around for what I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37. I want to do everything I can to take care of my skin (I spent too many years neglecting it... now&#x27;s the time when it&#x27;ll start to show). I wanted to use something more affordable than the $30 MaryKay sunscreen + $18 moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using for a year (excellent results by the way). I use the [[ASIN:B000GD92PU Ambi Skincare Fade Cream, Oily Skin, 2 oz (57 g)]] to treat my discoloration &amp; acne blemishes with great results. I&#x27;ve been using this Even &amp; Clear moisturizer/sunscreen for 2+ months. So far, results have been outstanding. I was worried I&#x27;d have clogged pores. So far, none. I was worried I&#x27;d experience ocassional acne. So far, none. I guess because I&#x27;m also using the Ambi fade cream daily, the results are really pronounced. Something about the soy complex really does brighten my skin, though. And I feel better knowing this product was developed taking into consideration the skin concerns of women of color. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I keep experiencing these great results. (I guess I would&#x27;ve given the product 5 stars if it firmed or lifted something).  ***  Jan 2012 update: the produce did eventually cause light outbreaks on my chin and cheeks with daily use. Blast this acne prone skin. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or breakouts, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It is a very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every morning after I shower, and every night when I wash my face. In combination with the Ambi body lotion, and the Ambi exfoliating facial wash, gives my face a wonderful caramel glow with even tone (no need for makeup!), and has successfully stopped my acne breakouts. I even put some of the face moisturizer on some light stretchmarks I&#x27;d on my thighs-- within a week, the skin there was significantly smoother, and the marks are fading. Definitely a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes--it tends to burn a little.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says: evens your skin color. I have some part of my face lighter than other parts. This lotion chose the darker color for me. Now my whole face takes the darker color instead of the lighter part. It&#x27;s not for me cos I&#x27;m already dark enough. I don&#x27;t want to get darker. Besides, it doesn&#x27;t even give a glow. When I use to use dove even tone, it darkened me evenly, and I liked it cos it gave me a glow. But not this one. I still have the two bottles doing nothing in my house. A waste of my $20.</li>
            <li> If this gets in your eye it WILL sting alot. It is oily and leaves your face looking like you rubbed it over with vaseline. Not impressed. But seller did a good job in ensuring it arrived on time and looked as pictured.</li>
            <li> Keeps me moisturized and I love it! I have oily skin but when I wash my face, my skin gets dry. So, I needed a moisturizer and this one got such good reviews and I figured I should try it. Works like a charm and is super affordable.</li>
            <li> My usual routine in the morning was to apply make-up to cover up my uneven skin-tone.  My skin changes through the seasons, oily, combination, dry, flaky at times. I saw an Ambi commercial and thought \\&quot;hmmm another bogus women of color product\\&quot;  after using it for a few weeks I went to work and my co-worker asked \\&quot;what type of foundation do you wear on your skin; it looks flawless\\&quot; and I told her \\&quot;I don&#x27;t wear make-up\\&quot;    My skin is now 80-95% even, and when I apply the moisturizer my skin has a beautiful glow to it.  I&#x27;d recommend tihs product to anyone.  As always test products to make sure they don&#x27;t break out your skin.  I have sensitive skin and usually products that even skintone gives me acne or hives and I don&#x27;t experience that w/ this product.  It feels good not to wear foundation and be able to hug people at social gatherings and not worry about getting their outfits \</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for everyday use.  It has SPF 30 and it is not wildly expensive.  I have dry skin, and it keeps me moisturized all day.  It also works well under makeup.  I don&#x27;t know if it makes me any more even and clear than any other skin moisturizer, but I like the product and I like the price.</li>
            <li> i have been using the fade cream for only five days and i can say i am pretty impressed. My marks are fading quickly. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I am a person who used to do nothing but pop pimples on my face to solve the problem, so I ended up with alot of dark marks.  I looked at some products that are applied directly to the dark marks but that would take forever.      I started using Ambi Fade Cream several years ago and thought it didn&#x27;t work.  But I was looking for a quick one week cure.  About three years ago I started using Ambi again but this time religiously day and night and after about three weeks my skin was transformed.  Constantly I a get compliments on my skin and even told I must wear special makeup (don&#x27;t use makeup).    Now I don&#x27;t have to use it all the time only about twice a year for six weeks.</li>
            <li> I still like this product, but I discovered something better. Therefore, I don&#x27;t need it anymore, but for those who are interested in trying. I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I thought that it would be better if I list my alternate routine in the review section to assist others who are interested. Please see the info below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine that I was referring too that I found was better for my skin without all of those chemicals that are in this Ambi product: I add a little virgin coconut oil all over my face at night, which leaves my face extremely soft and well moisturized for the morning; and add sunblock (not sunscreen with carbon chemicals) in the morning before leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, if you have acne prone skin (which is usually oily skin), applying any OIL or oil based product may clog your pores and cause additional acne. Matter of fact, even if you DON&#x27;T have oily skin you should be cautious and do a test spot to avoid a possibe unwanted breakout. Everything is not for everybody, but my skin (face and body) loves coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please be aware of the difference between a sunblock and sunscreen (which this Ambi product IS). Sunscreens work by absorbing the UVA and UVB rays which can still cause skin irritations that can result in hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, sunblocks create a protective barrier that allows the UVA and UVB rays to bounce off the skin. Sunblocks also are named Chem-free sunscreens or physical sunscreens. The active ingredient(s) are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or both. Benefits of using a sunblock are: no wait time for absorbtion onto the skin because it coats the skin which makes it work immediately; more effective at screening UVA; and less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: if there are any other active ingredients listed, it is not a sunblock (chem-free sunscreen/physical sunscreen). FYI: Zinc and titanium are still chemicals, but it does not contain carbon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not against Ambi products (please refer to my orginial review), I have used it for 3 years. For the last year, I have been using my new method and I am happy that I found other methods that limit the chemical load on my skin, is a cheaper alternative, and is better for the health of my skin/body.</li>
            <li> i would go to sallys to get this product and pay more for one bottle.  this price takes the cake!  if you use this product, please buy.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks, but it feels really nice on my face. It absorbs completely, and does not leave any residual oil on my skin. It also seems to have just a little hint of a golden glow to it, which I really like! Plus, it is reasonably priced, and the fragrance is very mild.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week I started to see results but noticed breakouts after a week.  I started getting pimples in places where I usually don\\&quot;t break out.  After reading an article I soon realized that the ingredients used in sunscreens clog pores Avobenzone and Oxybenzone. I was disappointed because I really wanted something to fade my acne marks not create new ones.  I have oily skin and am acne prone btw.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years - works great for complexion, it&#x27;s non-greasy, and SPF 30 all year long (not just in the summer). I was disappointed when I could no longer find it in Walgreens or Walmart stores - very happy and pleased Amazon was able to locate product</li>
            <li> As the title reads, this is the first sunblock that I&#x27;m aware of that I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction to. If I either coat my skin with multiple layers of this stuff (which is what many skin care experts recommend) or wear it for too long, it irritates my eyes to the point where my eyelids don&#x27;t want to remain open and many times my eyes actually get watery. I&#x27;ve purchased many sunblocks and I haven&#x27;t occurred this kind of problem before. I like this product which is why I, at the very least, gave it a decent 3-star rating. I like the claim that it aids in moisturizing the skin, which it actually does-it&#x27;s a fairly good moisturizer. It is also one of two sunblocks that I&#x27;ve come across that doesn&#x27;t leave the white Zinc-oxide residue on the face that makes my face look like a pasty ghost. The other one was the Olay one which has an SPF of 15 (half of this one). But what I really admire about this is that it aids in fading/depleting hyperpigmentation spots, however gradual, which was a large reason why I purchased it. I&#x27;d be enthusiastic about this product if only it didn&#x27;t cause the annoying and inconvenient allergic reaction/irritation to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/30/2013: Over a year later, I decided that this product received a two-star rating. Not only for the allergy experiences that I noted above, but also due to the bottle. The dispenser is highly ineffective at getting the contents at the bottom of the bottle. I&#x27;ve even had a bottle that was nearly full with the sunblock inside, and despite pressing down the dispenser many times, the contents wouldn&#x27;t come out. I resorted to swiping the tube in the dispenser to catch some of the contents-which defeats the purpose of the dispenser in the first place. Not only this going to be difficult to do when the sunblock is at the bottom of the bottle, but I&#x27;ve had an instance in which the cheap tube actually broke from when I swiped the contents. They should get rid of this horrible packaging and put it in a toothpaste-like tube. It&#x27;s the same thing with the Arm and Hammer Whitening Booster. I complained about how the bottle was inefficient at getting the contents out and recommended that it use a toothpaste-like tube, and thereafter, the company announced that it was packaging the product in a toothpaste-like tube, like I&#x27;d recommended. So for those reasons, I&#x27;ve given this a two-star rating.</li>
            <li> I started using Ambi Daily Moissturizer with SPF 30 about 2 years ago.  All of a sudden when I went into store to purchase again... it was no longer available.  I decided to check on Amazon where I can usually find anything I need and there it was.  I can get it in two-pack and the shipping time was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I have used this as my day moisturizer since 2011. I live in hot hot Nigeria where the sun, well, is something else. This has worked well to protect my face and neck from the high sun rays (although I still try to stay out of the sun as much as possible) also most moisturizers used to make me break out, such that I stopped using day moisturizers at one point, but this has worked greatly for my skin, no breakouts. Initially my face used to be oily, then I reduced the amount of it I use.</li>
            <li> Love AMBI products and its creamy and can&#x27;t beat the SPF 30 for this price. Its the last thing I apply underneath my makeup. My makeup sets well with it.</li>
            <li> I have always used oils on my face because it is so dry. But this product is great. The dryness is gone and there is no shine to my face. I apply when my face feels dry because my face will eat this lotion up. So I may apply 3-4 times per day, depending on if I am at home that day for the day. Once you have done this you may only have to apply  1-2 times per day. Great Product. I am AA. American African Woman.</li>
            <li> I use Obagi skin care which is very expensive but really works - I started using the Ambi after I had already bleached my skin out (age spots) and it is excellent.  I now use it in conjuntion with the Obagi to save money!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Aveeno was recommended by my dermatologist.  I went against her recommendations because I had a coupon for Ambi.  I read the ingredients and realized they have some of the same ingredients but Ambi has some specifically for people of color.  I tried Ambi and loved it!  I took the bottle to my dermatologist and she said the product has good ingredients.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I am very pleased that the product is not too oily and it does not leave an ashy residue on my skin.  I moved to a new city and I have had a hard time finding the product, but since I love it so much I ordered it online.  I really think this product is great and it has made my skin glow and my coloring is very even.  I recommend this product and I plan to try other Ambi products.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and was received timely.</li>
            <li> I like it but prefer sensitive skin if it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product and I love it, have been using it for few years. Getting ready to order again.</li>
            <li> If you just need a moisturizer with an spf  30 it&#x27;s good. Don&#x27;t expect it to change any texture or perform miracles. It works if you plan to be out in the sun, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I am a fair-skinned Caucasian with uneven skin tones, and using this product once a day for four days, I don&#x27;t have any skin irritation but my skin feels parched.  Not only is the drying effect a problem for me but I will have to discontinue using it because my eyes are quite irritated.  They are watery, and I keep closing/blinking them because things seem blurry.  And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, I bought the two pack.</li>
            <li> Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+</li>
            <li> Rich without being greasy. Love this product. Absorbs immediately and provides sun protection too.</li>
            <li> Best cr√®me I&#x27;ve tried for even skincare</li>
            <li> Good. I always buy it</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and use this as my daily moisturizer against the desert sun. So far so good. Keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li> I have used ambi cream for several years but it has gotten so expensive.  For the price of one I purchased 2 bottles of the cream and it arrived very quickly.  I am so happy with ambi and amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized. I use it in the mornings and at night after using the clear cleansing foamer to wash my face.</li>
            <li> only moisturizer that does not cause breakouts to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments about my skin lately because of this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told that I was clearing up, I&#x27;ve been asked what I put on my face because it was definitely working, and I&#x27;ve been told that my \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; was great because it made my skin look smooth. I wasn&#x27;t even wearing make-up!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out. I have dark complexion and I am of Asian descent.</li>
            <li> I love Ambi&#x27;s moisturizer.  Other products like CeraVe either burn my skin or leave it feeling dry. I wash with Purpose liquid soap and apply Duac cream and Finacea for acne.  Afterwards, I apply Ambi.  I only have to apply it once.  It has enough moisture to keep my face \\&quot;ashy-free\\&quot; all day, but it&#x27;s not oily on my skin.  Together, this regimen has cleared up acne and dark spots that I&#x27;ve been battling for over 10 years! I also like that it&#x27;s SPF 30.  I didn&#x27;t grow up wearing sunscreen (I&#x27;m black), but since my dermatologist advises it, I&#x27;m glad Ambi&#x27;s got it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin. It has a good fragrance. Not too greasy but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is bright white and almost fluffy feeling. The pump measures out a usable amount. The fluffiness helps it to spread on quickly. Any extra on my hands I put on my elbows. Your skin is NOT tacky, sticky, or greasy feeling after it is applied. Skin feels clean and moist like nothing is on it. It has a very light &#x27;clean&#x27; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin tone evening works quickly on lighter discolorations. I was surprised to stop and notice a difference after a few weeks because I&#x27;m not very regular about moisturizing twice a day. I always use it under makeup once a day, though. Darker spots are a little more stubborn, but they are visibly lighter after a few months use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump on the product and that with a simple twist it clicks on or off for travel or storage. I also like the SPF 30 without the funky sunscreen feeling left behind.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and was very much satisfied with the product and also the packaging was nicelt done.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer with a sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn! I&#x27;m so happy, because I have fair skin and really do need a sunscreen and a moisturizer! No interference from fragrance, either!</li>
            <li> This product betters your skin and makes it look better than before!  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry look or feeling on your face.  I use this product all the time and the price is lower than all the department store prices.</li>
            <li> light and smooth with out a greasy feel i can use it once in am and it last all day</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! It&#x27;s not oily, nor is it a heavy cream. It evens out skin-tone, and helps to bring more compliments, to this 40 yr old. Camera ready...say CHEESE!!!</li>
            <li> Used this product a few years ago. Recent purchase looks oilier than I remembered but soon vanishes into the skin. No ashiness common to similar moisturizers. Price on Amazon is competitive.</li>
            <li> Yes! I use this Ambi product too. It is gentle on my skin and the seller for me is that it contains so a high amount of SPF which we all need. If that was&#x27;nt enough it is oil free and has vitamin C and E in it, For my skin that was my selling point there and Amazon gives you such a great price on it to. You can not go wrong here people so try it you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer... I use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t have a oily feel to it. It makes my skin feel refreshed. I don&#x27;t have a shiny look at I put it on either.</li>
