            <li>this is the best bath product i have ever used.</li>
            <li>The massage bars are also wonderful!</li>
            <li>These would go perfectly with a pair of patent leather mary janes.  </li>
            <li>It smells like vanilla candy and is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY</li>
            <li>I love how delicious she smells when she gets out of the bath.</li>
            <li>Smells so delicious in the bath and leaves your skin smelling softly sweet (but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Its also a very adorable bubble bar...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen so many bubbles in one bath!</li>
            <li>I got the rock chick set and fell in love before i even opened it!  </li>
            <li>Let me start with what I liked - the scent.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells</li>
            <li>It has a delicious sweet candy smell...but its not just sweet.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Lush before, this one is a great starter!!</li>
            <li>but after one bubble bath and used the soap once i&#x27;m in love love love!  </li>
            <li>However, in the wrapper it smelled way too STRONG!  </li>
            <li>It bubbles up beautifully in the tub, smells great, and also leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li>more candy-like</li>
            <li>and it turned out to be more herbally.  </li>
            <li>It was just too much of an overwhelmingly medicinal type scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath product.  </li>
            <li>bubble is the word: bubbles, lovely bubbles.</li>
            <li>Softens the bath water and leaves your skin feeling so lovely</li>
            <li>and it smells even better when added to the bath.</li>
            <li>If I was a kid and didn&#x27;t know any better</li>
            <li>Its sexy.</li>
            <li>A worthwhile indulgence to soothe the stress of life away in a tub of candy bubbles.</li>
            <li>My skin was so smooth!  </li>
            <li>- you know the kind in Pretty Woman!!  </li>
            <li>I love sweet scents, but this bubble bar had even more going for it.</li>
            <li>It makes lots of bubbles and is good for 2 very decadent baths.</li>
            <li>This is the type of bubble bar that you use when you just want a sweet smelling, girly-type bath!  </li>
            <li>It is easily divided into two or three chunks for two or three baths.  </li>
            <li>I ended up ordering two more as replacements, I liked it that much.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong smell</li>
            <li>I love this scent--very sweet.  </li>
            <li>I get delicious little whiffs of it now and then.</li>
            <li>It has a really strong sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this one~and I have tried many, LUSH brand and others~</li>
            <li>bright pink with a candy flower on top.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much.</li>
            <li>only have good things to say about this product, so no cons for this review.  </li>
            <li>I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn&#x27;t pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s part of why I love it so much.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also really yummy, and a lot more skin-softening.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I love the smell so much</li>
            <li>I love this one so much.</li>
            <li>The scent is so good; a definite \\&quot;candy\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing sophisticated or vampy about this particular bubble bar, it&#x27;s all girlish indulgence.</li>
            <li>-I live in Florida so the humidity makes it soften a bit more than I&#x27;d like in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite Lush product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pink, it smells SO good, and the water and bubbles feel so soft against my skin!!  </li>
            <li>Oh well I will not be purchasing any more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than regular bubble bath; it&#x27;s like a perfume, skin conditioner and relaxing end of the day treat all in one!</li>
            <li>They are really pretty too.  </li>
            <li>And the shipping while a bit higher than norm</li>
            <li>This seems like a company that really cares and knows that word of mouth is what it&#x27;s all about!</li>
            <li>It is very creamy (as far as the water turns sooo smoothly soft)and smells like candy (although not in a nauseating way) and</li>
            <li>I only wished for a bigger tub so that i could enjoy this even more.  </li>
            <li>The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything.  </li>
            <li>Makes a whole tub full of soft, luscious bubbles.</li>
            <li>Its amazing by itself and even better mixed with other lush goodies.</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t really know it&#x27;s purpose since it is marketed as a bubble bar.  </li>
            <li>so much that I got the rock star soap in the matching scent.  </li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really see if the water changes colour.</li>
            <li>I have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy.  </li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I love Lush - have always ordered it from Amazon as we have no local store.  </li>
            <li>It was the first LUSH Bubble Bar I ever tried.</li>
            <li>If I would have based my opinion on some LUSH products on the first sniff, I might have thrown everything out before even tossing it in the water.  </li>
            <li>This month has been really stressful, and I&#x27;m getting through it by taking a bath every evening with something Lush.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin very well, but when I crumble a tiny bit of it up in a cup of water and use it on my first hair rinse, it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I used half a bar and found that this created quite a bit of bubbles, but to me they didn&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked!  </li>
            <li>It does bubble a lot, leaves the bathroom smelling yummy, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If you are in the mood to be a really really sweet thang, use this + rock star soap + candy fluff dusting powder like i did)</li>
            <li>) looks so pretty when you get it, with it&#x27;s little candy flower, you&#x27;ll just want to eat it right up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very frilly, young, utterly indulgent scent.  </li>
            <li>Lush Products are handmade.  </li>
            <li>this product has made me a lush customer for life.</li>
            <li>I was up to my neck in bubbles, they lasted forever, and my skin felt so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This is my favourite Lush bubble bar.</li>
            <li>Does not leave your tub with any mess to clean</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a really great smell on the skin and has long lasting bubbles in the bath.  </li>
            <li>The candy flower on top can be pink, blue, yellow, or white.</li>
            <li>What I disliked was that it really didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>And yet again, I expected the scent to be much sweeter,</li>
            <li>I hated to use this bubble bar because it smelled so incredibly delicious!  </li>
            <li>the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water.</li>
            <li>I am a recent customer of Lush and have been trying out a lot of their different bath products.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only down side.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I&#x27;d want one.</li>

            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay with you for very long post-bath, though.  </li>
            <li> I have a dark blue tub</li>
            <li> I broke this bar in two pieces and only used half of it for a regular-sized bathtub.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever take baths, but I use it when I bathe my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I am thinking I will stick with other bath brands.  </li>
            <li> I only used a small piece.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m addicted to Lush now!</li>
            <li> bubbles - like pouring in half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I think if it does, it can only be a faint pink.</li>
            <li> I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub</li>
            <li> I usually add salts and bath oil to my baths as well as bubbles to add skin softening properties....</li>
            <li> so I usually divide into 2 baths.</li>
            <li> The smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so uplifting and just plain yummy to smell!  </li>
            <li> There were hardly any bubbles</li>
            <li> This can also be divided into at least 2 baths, and still be indulgent.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very disappointed in this one.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> And yet again, I expected the scent to be much sweeter, more candy-like and it turned out to be more herbally.  I am thinking I will stick with other bath brands.  I ordered several different items and kept expecting the overly-herbally scent to be an isolated thing, but found that quality in all the products I ordered.  It was just too much of an overwhelmingly medicinal type scent.  Not for me.  I think I will just stick with Mr. Bubble for now.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much. I hardly ever take baths, but I use it when I bathe my 2 year old. One bar lasts 4-5 baths for her and she loves the bubbles. I love how delicious she smells when she gets out of the bath. Four thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Lush Products are handmade.  The qaulity is excellent.  This is my favorite bath product.  It leaves behind a really great smell on the skin and has long lasting bubbles in the bath.  I scent reminds me of candy and bubble gum.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s for dessert tonight? ME! After using this wonderful creamy candy bath bubble bar I am the sweetest thing around. It is very creamy (as far as the water turns sooo smoothly soft)and smells like candy (although not in a nauseating way) and bubble is the word: bubbles, lovely bubbles. I only wished for a bigger tub so that i could enjoy this even more.  &lt;br /&gt;I only have good things to say about this product, so no cons for this review.  &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1) Smells so delicious in the bath and leaves your skin smelling softly sweet (but not overpowering. If you are in the mood to be a really really sweet thang, use this + rock star soap + candy fluff dusting powder like i did) &lt;br /&gt;2) Makes a whole tub full of soft, luscious bubbles. &lt;br /&gt;3) Softens the bath water and leaves your skin feeling so lovely &lt;br /&gt;4) Does not leave your tub with any mess to clean &lt;br /&gt;5) looks so pretty when you get it, with it&#x27;s little candy flower, you&#x27;ll just want to eat it right up. (but don&#x27;t...) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So try this one! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> this is the best bath product i have ever used. it smells so wonderfull i couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing it when it was still in its wrapper and it smells even better when added to the bath. this product has made me a lush customer for life. yummmmmmy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I broke this bar in two pieces and only used half of it for a regular-sized bathtub.  Wow! I was up to my neck in bubbles, they lasted forever, and my skin felt so soft and silky.  Plus now I get to have a second bath like this before I order another one. I love this scent--very sweet.  It doesn&#x27;t stay with you for very long post-bath, though.  Actually it lingered longer in the bathroom than it did on my skin afterward.  That&#x27;s really the only down side.</li>
            <li> I love Lush - have always ordered it from Amazon as we have no local store.  This means that it is hit and miss for me as I cannot preview scents.  This one was a hit!!  This is one of their smaller bubble bars, but still plenty for two baths in a jacuzzi tub.  The smell is yummy and hollywood style bubbles - you know the kind in Pretty Woman!!  Lush is pricey, but I have never bought any other product that makes me feel like I didn&#x27;t have to fight to get bubbles - like pouring in half the bottle.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Lush before, this one is a great starter!!</li>
            <li> If I could have a lifetime supply of these, I would take a bath with one every day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen so many bubbles in one bath! They stayed until the end. The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I&#x27;d want one. I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn&#x27;t pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water. Three times. I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub that I thought someone was going to have to come in after me! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I still smell like candy several hours later. I even conditioned my hair with a totally different scent, and my hair definitely smells like the bubble bath. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m addicted to Lush now! This month has been really stressful, and I&#x27;m getting through it by taking a bath every evening with something Lush. The massage bars are also wonderful!</li>
            <li> I am a recent customer of Lush and have been trying out a lot of their different bath products.  I have to say I am very disappointed in this one.  Let me start with what I liked - the scent.  It smelled like it should be in a candy dish, Yum.  What I disliked was that it really didn&#x27;t do much.  There were hardly any bubbles and so I don&#x27;t really know it&#x27;s purpose since it is marketed as a bubble bar.  Oh well I will not be purchasing any more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite Lush product. I love sweet scents, but this bubble bar had even more going for it. It bubbles up beautifully in the tub, smells great, and also leaves your skin super soft! It&#x27;s better than regular bubble bath; it&#x27;s like a perfume, skin conditioner and relaxing end of the day treat all in one!</li>
            <li> I keep a few of these in a pretty little glass jar on my counter and they absolutely saturate my bathroom with the smell of a mysterious pink hard-candy.  It&#x27;s a very frilly, young, utterly indulgent scent.  These would go perfectly with a pair of patent leather mary janes.  There is nothing sophisticated or vampy about this particular bubble bar, it&#x27;s all girlish indulgence. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin very well, but when I crumble a tiny bit of it up in a cup of water and use it on my first hair rinse, it lasts all day.  I get delicious little whiffs of it now and then.</li>
            <li> I usually add salts and bath oil to my baths as well as bubbles to add skin softening properties....but with this bubble bar, I don&#x27;t have to!!  It&#x27;s pink, it smells SO good, and the water and bubbles feel so soft against my skin!!  I absolutely LOVE this one~and I have tried many, LUSH brand and others~so much that I got the rock star soap in the matching scent.  I will say, however, that I have found it necessary to keep it in the fridge during the summer months although it arrives solid-I live in Florida so the humidity makes it soften a bit more than I&#x27;d like in the cabinet.  Overall?  20 stars!!</li>
            <li> This is my favourite Lush bubble bar. It makes lots of bubbles and is good for 2 very decadent baths. It can be divided into 3 or even 4 baths, but I like lots of bubbles so I usually divide into 2 baths. It smells like vanilla candy and is wonderful. The smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me. I have a dark blue tub so can&#x27;t really see if the water changes colour. I think if it does, it can only be a faint pink. It has a strong smell but I think that&#x27;s part of why I love it so much. The candy flower on top can be pink, blue, yellow, or white. If you like this I would also recommend you try Melting Marshmallow Moment, which is a bath melt (ie no bubbles) but it&#x27;s also really yummy, and a lot more skin-softening. This can also be divided into at least 2 baths, and still be indulgent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome.  I have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I love the smell so much and I don&#x27;t want it to go away.  I just ordered a bunch though, so I will try it out.  They are really pretty too.  If I was a kid and didn&#x27;t know any better I would probably try to eat it.</li>
            <li> I love this one so much. It was the first LUSH Bubble Bar I ever tried. It has a delicious sweet candy smell...but its not just sweet. Its sexy. Its intoxicating bathing in this...It feels very luxurious. Its also a very adorable bubble bar...bright pink with a candy flower on top. Its amazing by itself and even better mixed with other lush goodies.</li>
            <li> I only used a small piece. It has a really strong sweet smell.Just use a lil bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hated to use this bubble bar because it smelled so incredibly delicious!  It is easily divided into two or three chunks for two or three baths.  It does bubble a lot, leaves the bathroom smelling yummy, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  I ended up ordering two more as replacements, I liked it that much.  A worthwhile indulgence to soothe the stress of life away in a tub of candy bubbles.</li>
            <li> This product smells DIVINE... but there are NO bubbles!!!  There is just a bit of white foam that comes out but there is virtually no bubbling going on.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud or its this scent but beware, no bubbling goodness is to be found with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit after reading reviews on how \\&quot;small\\&quot; the soaps where i was bit hesitant but i did it AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY THAT I DID!  I got the rock chick set and fell in love before i even opened it!  The smell is to die for!  I can not explain it except YUMMMM and girls it&#x27;s monday my bathroom still smells like it from a bath on friday evening! &lt;br /&gt;There was no need for lotion after this bath either!  My skin was so smooth!  The bubbles never stopped!  And the shipping while a bit higher than norm well all i can say is you get what you pay for!  Well worthe it!  I think from now on i&#x27;ll do a BIG order to save on shipping or what not but after one bubble bath and used the soap once i&#x27;m in love love love!  I haven&#x27;t stopped telling people about this since i got it! &lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to ANYONE! &lt;br /&gt;No rings in my tub from the creamy bath or the soap!  And they gave me freebies in w/ my order!  This seems like a company that really cares and knows that word of mouth is what it&#x27;s all about!</li>
            <li> This is the type of bubble bar that you use when you just want a sweet smelling, girly-type bath!  It&#x27;s so uplifting and just plain yummy to smell!  I used half a bar and found that this created quite a bit of bubbles, but to me they didn&#x27;t last as long as I would&#x27;ve liked!  The scent is so good; a definite \\&quot;candy\\&quot; smell.  It kind of smells fruity/strawberry-ish mixed with cotton candy.  However, in the wrapper it smelled way too STRONG!  So if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned, it&#x27;s never make up your mind on the scent of the product until AFTER you&#x27;ve used it.  If I would have based my opinion on some LUSH products on the first sniff, I might have thrown everything out before even tossing it in the water.  If you want a real treat, use half of this with half of the MMM Melting Moments bath melt.  ~YUM!~</li>
