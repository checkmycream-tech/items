            <li>just love this oil!</li>
            <li>Great for skin but strong nutty smell.</li>
            <li>Just bought this oil and it makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell is woody and nice.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful golden sparkle to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ability to heal damaged skin is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>my customers love this miracle in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at this oil and just love the earthy smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff - I use it on my whole body and my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is way more manageable.</li>
            <li>I am using it straight, but will soon put it in a acne salve i am brewing lol.</li>
            <li>oil is interesting.</li>
            <li>, I use it on my skin after showering, and my skin looks better than it did before.  </li>
            <li>If I could give this product more stars I would.</li>
            <li>My husband and I just love it.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t put it on my face, as the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>Another huge bonus is how moisturizing this oil is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell as long as it helps my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>Very good pure tamanu oil for the price when you buy the bigger size.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it into some bruise areas and the bruises went away surprisingly quickly.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; I put it on instead of moisturizer and it is absorbed in no time.  </li>
            <li>I can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the difference in my skin because it tingled the first time on my face and I can feel it pull tighter as well.</li>
            <li>My teen customers love it because it keeps acne at bay.</li>
            <li>It is really smooth and soft and some of my wrinkles have diminished quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the first time I have tried Tamanu Oil, I have no comparisons to make with another company.</li>
            <li>It smells like olive oil, so not offensive to me, but I may put another essential oil in, for a better fragrance.</li>
            <li>and this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>I really like the oil.  </li>
            <li>i real like it, its  does what it said it do.</li>
            <li>Feel that this unrefined product ought to be presented in a jar rather than a bottle, as the truly therapeutic part of the oil is really a semi-solid.  </li>
            <li>I have given her some oil and really think it can rebuild those tissues.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend to people that have acne!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back later with the results she gets from using it as well as my own results.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY</li>
            <li>It has a very moist, oily feel and absorbs almost completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>(and be sure to stick with it for at least a couple of months to really see change!)</li>
            <li>She was told she would have to have surgery in order to &#x27;make&#x27; a new tear duct.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using tamanu oil for about 2 years now and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in a super dry climate and tried almost everything before, but my skin was skill flaky.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, but a little useless in the squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use it directly on the skin and in soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li>It can be a little greasy, but trust me, it is SO worth it!</li>
            <li>Along with my special Green tea Toner and Tea Tree oil Face mask.</li>
            <li>Willing to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky with no rough patches....</li>
            <li>I have only used it for two days, so far i can&#x27;t tell if its helping my acne.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, still good after 6 months, use it for eczema and base oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several tamanu oils (different brands-mostly at natural food stores)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the oil.  I use it on my face and hair.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i real like it, its  does what it said it do.</li>
            <li> Very good pure tamanu oil for the price when you buy the bigger size. Willing to try other products from this company.</li>

            <li> This is an amazing oil and so good for your skin. It&#x27;s ability to heal damaged skin is overwhelming. It is said to have benefits for scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts, abrasions, rashes and sores to name a few. I use it directly on the skin and in soaps and lotions. It can separate over time so I give it a good shake before using it but it has a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality oil.  I&#x27;ve used it in my facial serum and my pain cream.  It feels really good on your skin.  I will buy this oil again.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil.  You can see it is unrefined.....It has a beautiful golden sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> This comes in a dark plastic bottle but I don&#x27;t think that will effect it&#x27;s performance. I can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the difference in my skin because it tingled the first time on my face and I can feel it pull tighter as well. I&#x27;m very excited to have found this oil and think this brand and bottle is a great value. My mom has a problem with one of her tear ducts; it waters a lot several times a week. I have given her some oil and really think it can rebuild those tissues. She was told she would have to have surgery in order to &#x27;make&#x27; a new tear duct. Crazy! I&#x27;ll report back later with the results she gets from using it as well as my own results.</li>
            <li> my customers love this miracle in the bottle. My teen customers love it because it keeps acne at bay. Along with my special Green tea Toner and Tea Tree oil Face mask.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at this oil and just love the earthy smell.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I have noticed a big difference in my skin!  It is really smooth and soft and some of my wrinkles have diminished quite a bit.  Since my skin is &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; I put it on instead of moisturizer and it is absorbed in no time.

            <li> Amazing product!!! I&#x27;ve bought several tamanu oils (different brands-mostly at natural food stores) and this one is just as good, if not better. I actually like the nutty smell of it! Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using tamanu oil for about 2 years now and cannot live without it. I had bad acne before and tried everything until I read an article about tamanu oil. My skin has been clear from bad acne since. Also, it is great on scars!!! Another huge bonus is how moisturizing this oil is. I live in a super dry climate and tried almost everything before, but my skin was skill flaky. Then I tried tamanu oil and I haven&#x27;t had flaky dry skin since! It can be a little greasy, but trust me, it is SO worth it! My skin is nicer than it was in my 20s! Can&#x27;t say anything more than to just try it!!! (and be sure to stick with it for at least a couple of months to really see change!)</li>
            <li> Love this tamanu oil.  Quality seems good.  I use it on my face every night and sometimes on my body.  It isn&#x27;t too &#x27;oily&#x27; at all and absorbs well.  The size of this bottle for the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great</li>
            <li> Great stuff - I use it on my whole body and my hair.  My hair is way more manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, still good after 6 months, use it for eczema and base oil for essential oils. Arrived on time and packaged nicely. Would get again.</li>
            <li> excellent for locking in moisture post-shower. has a strong nutty smell, which i find to be slightly unpleasant. i can&#x27;t put it on my face, as the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> use it for a couple weeks on my psoriasis with no improvement.</li>
            <li> Great oil! I have only used it for two days, so far i can&#x27;t tell if its helping my acne. (I will update) Came with a pump so thats awesome for me. I am using it straight, but will soon put it in a acne salve i am brewing lol. Have a feeling its going to work!&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a deep color kinda greenish yellow and has a deep nutty smell, but it goes away quickly. I don&#x27;t mind the smell as long as it helps my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, fast shipping, great product! Should last me a while! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** This oil is a miracle!! It has only been a few days and my skin has CLEARED!! i had horrible acne on my shoulders, and i have used everything to try and clear it! I made myself charcoal soap ( it supposed to be great for acne) no change, acne creams just dry my poor skin out so bad that even if i use an oil it is still dry, plus they don&#x27;t work! Acne body wash everything, and no change in my skin. Until this OIL! I have only used it for a few days and my skin has cleared up IMMENSELY! HIGHLY recommend to people that have acne! will never be without this oil in my lIFE!!</li>
            <li> Great for skin but strong nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it for a few different skin conditions and it has worked very well. The smell is woody and nice. The only ingredient listed on the label is Organic Tamanu Oil. I have bought this product 2 times from the same Seller and the consistency is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is interesting. It has a very moist, oily feel and absorbs almost completely into the skin. It seems to accelerate healing. I started using it on my face in a couple areas that I had treated at the Dermatologist and finally see the skin healing. I rubbed it into some bruise areas and the bruises went away surprisingly quickly. I have to think the Tamanu oil had something to do with it.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I have tried Tamanu Oil, I have no comparisons to make with another company. It seems to be working well, I use it on my skin after showering, and my skin looks better than it did before.  Not quite as oily as coconut oil, but still, it is an oil and sits on your skin for a bit, just not as greasy as coconut oil. It smells like olive oil, so not offensive to me, but I may put another essential oil in, for a better fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just bought this oil and it makes my skin feel amazing. The quality of the oil is excellent. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this!  I&#x27;ve used another brand before, but this one comes with a pump that makes it so convenient!! :D</li>
            <li> If I could give this product more stars I would. My husband and I just love it. He has problem skin with really bad dry flaky spots and oiliness in other areas and his skin looks like radiant baby skin now! I love the texture and knowing its 100% natural has made me obsessed! I look forward to putting it on at night and sometimes wash my face just for an excuse to apply it again before the days even over!</li>
