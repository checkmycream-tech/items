            <li> I think this &amp;#34;Exclamation&amp;#34; might have been a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; because the scent is not quite right and the usual printing on the bottle is non-existent!.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s not soft enough for me.  </li>
            <li> One of my husbands long time favorites.</li>
            <li> It was compared to the same fragrance purchased at a military installation.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> stays on for long time, and cheaper than wal-mart</li>
            <li> It smells like it at first but then fades to a different smell, which I like, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, it&#x27;s a bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> just remember a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I got 3 bottles for the price of one at other stores.</li>
            <li> but it never made it to the other person.</li>
            <li> And other people like the smell.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, I think I smell the peach note and some synthetic scent.  </li>
            <li> Something is just not right with the smell.  </li>
            <li> It does not say exclamation on the bottle at all it just has a black circle.</li>
            <li> After a few hours perfume leaves a poo after smell.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and not too flowery.  </li>
            <li> A test revealed the contents was not authentic.</li>
            <li> but it smelled stale and was sticky on the outside.</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I will never get tired of exclamation!</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> just cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> It is very disturbing to run out of it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> Just as I remembered 12 years ago. Perfect!</li>
            <li> It brought back many good memories for me. It smells just like I remember.</li>
            <li> Fabulous fragrance!!! The commercial for this was &amp;#34;Exclamation! Making a statement without saying a word!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I realize this was a popular scent in the 90s but it smelled stale and was sticky on the outside.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!!! So I get the results. I got 3 bottles for the price of one at other stores.</li>
            <li> Love product and I will get another as soon as this is finish. Great perfume</li>
            <li> I was suppose to buy it for someone else but it never made it to the other person. It ended in my hands.</li>
            <li> Im a exclamation fan from when it first came out. It has a really good scent and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LIKED IT WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG LADY. BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES.</li>
            <li> AT first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like, but as I wear it some days I get some really good feedback of &amp;#34;what are you wearing it smells great&amp;#34; . just remember a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years. I have tried to switch it up with a new scent but I NEVER get the compliments like I do wearing Exclamation!!! It is simply awesome :)</li>
            <li> I recommend this item highly...&lt;br /&gt;All fragrances, smell different on everybody, just being honest.&lt;br /&gt;Coty products are reasonable and the smell is everlasting...&lt;br /&gt;Ref. Exclamation for Women, Cologne Spray 1.7 oz&lt;br /&gt;Go right ahead and make this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just love exclamation. I am 46 and I have to wear some kind of perfume every day or I dont feel normal. I have experimented with so many other fragrances over the years and I always come back to exclamation. I get so many compliments  when I wear it. more than any other. its pretty strong at first, then it just smells so fresh and so clean. i will always wear it forever. And you cant beat the price</li>
            <li> A vintage cologne, but a favorite since teenager!! Smeel so good and a durable fragance all day long!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Did they change the formula for this fragrance?  Granted it was many many moons ago the last time I purchased this fragrance and I do not remember it smelling this way.  Something is just not right with the smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is repulsive, but it is definitely a far cry from what I had expected.  It definitely smells better after it has been on your skin for a little while.  I&#x27;m tempted to re-gift the darn thing, but I don&#x27;t want to disappoint the next recipient.  I will NOT be purchasing this fragrance EVER again.  At least it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> This item is not available in this area , unless it is the holidays , great as a gift ,  price is affordable and I can get access anytime I see fit</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife, and she loved it.  The price was great, and it arrived very fast.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice price and very soft fragrance. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This my &amp;#34;go to &amp;#34; fragrance whether I&#x27;m  working at home or going out running errands. I love the fresh smell. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is perfect for the daytime. It is my most favorite daytime cologne.</li>
            <li> loved finding this, reminds me of my preteen and teen years! thanks for being quick with delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for a long time.  Always satisfied with every bottle, good quality control!</li>
            <li> I got this bottle as a back up for when mine runs out but I think this is a knock off perfume. It does not say exclamation on the bottle at all it just has a black circle. It smells like it at first but then fades to a different smell, which I like, don&#x27;t get me wrong but if you want the original one I suggest you got to a store.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and accurate</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. (I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for years and was excited to find it online.) ...I think this &amp;#34;Exclamation&amp;#34; might have been a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; because the scent is not quite right and the usual printing on the bottle is non-existent!.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that my daughter will wear.  She says that it is the only one that stays fresh smelling all day and I have to agree that it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy with this! I thought it was going to be a very small bottle because of the description, but when it arrived I was so Happy to see it was a BIG bottle. I just love this perfume, and have for the past 20 years.  I will probably be ordering many more!</li>
            <li> I love it. Very nice. And it came fast. I&#x27;m very happy to have it again. I haven&#x27;t had this perfume in a year, and I miss having it. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great quality quick shipping</li>
            <li> Love this and it stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift.  The recipient was very happy. This is an older fragrance that is getting harder to find, so I was happy to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> An older fragrance, but I&#x27;ve always enjoyed it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  It arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Great price! Cant go wrong. CVS charges 28 bucks for the same size bottle.</li>
            <li> Same great stuff from the 90&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;What else is there to say but I can add another five or six or seven words</li>
            <li> stays on for long time, and cheaper than wal-mart</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It was a much better value that I could find in any stores.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was for my mom for Christmas, and she absolutely loved it! She said it has a slightly different smell to it then her Exclamation that she already had, but she said she loved this one so much more.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it really well.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. You don&#x27;t need to spray the whole bottle on for it to last. Just a few spritz and just a light and lovely smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this, it is my favorite perfume, and it cost so much in store love it that you guys are so cheep, thanks a lot will be contuineing to order this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very intense scent.  I keep a container in a guest bathroom drawer.  One spritz freshens the room..  Or--one spritz on the corner of a decorative towel perfumes the air nicely all day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see this much anymore.  Nice to get again.  Great deal and shipped fast.  Classic scent with a natural tone.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Everything went as promised !</li>
            <li> After a few hours perfume leaves a poo after smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. It stays with you. And other people like the smell. It is very disturbing to run out of it.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this perfect Christmas present</li>
            <li> Made in the USA, the bottle and package are slightly different than the toilette, which is made in France.  I purchased both to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was released in 1988, and being an 80s fan, I wanted to see what it is like and why it is still popular.  They are similar, but I think the cologne is better.  They are sharp, I think I smell the peach note and some synthetic scent.  It&#x27;s cheap but not a generic drugstore scent.  I like it, yet it&#x27;s not soft enough for me.  A bit strong, gave a slight headache.  I&#x27;ll try it in different seasons to see if it works for me.  The toilette was sharper but I&#x27;ll need to test again and update the reviews.  I think the cologne is prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottles.  For some reason, both felt greasy and I had to wipe them off.  I believe they are authentic, but this one has the name printed on front.  The toilette does not.  The cologne looks more genuine, and smells slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice trip back to the late 80s.  I can see why teens liked this.  I was a kid and wasn&#x27;t into perfume, so I never owned a bottle before.  I didn&#x27;t know anyone else that used it, either.  But the packaging still looks 80s.  That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Nice item.  Very quick ship.  Good Price.  I would buy again from these people.  Not much else to say, it&#x27;s a bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent.  Not too heavy and not too flowery.  I have allergies to many perfumes, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all!</li>
            <li> I ordered three, and they do NOT Look like they do on this advertisement nor like the ones I buy in the store.&lt;br /&gt;they have an extra sticker on the front , a warning one. I have been buying this for years and this is the first time I have ever seen that extra sticker on the front. These don&#x27;t look like the ones I buy in the store.</li>
