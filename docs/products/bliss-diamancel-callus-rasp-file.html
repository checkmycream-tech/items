            <li>This file is great.  </li>
            <li>Works great and have no concern that the thing could break / snap.  </li>
            <li>This works very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Best foot implement I have ever used -- 10x better that Pedi Egg (leaves feet smoother).  </li>
            <li>My feet feel wonderful after use and, honestly, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>A friend saw this on Dr. Oz and bought one (for $40) and just loved it.  </li>
            <li>The one I had was as good as nothing.  </li>
            <li>The combination is good, but I think it&#x27;s the Diamoncel</li>
            <li>Good implement...works well.</li>
            <li>I received it and put it to good use</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>the #20 is perfect for getting feet silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say this is a good thing since it provides some flex when filing.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I have loved mine and it still does a great job of keeping my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>With one use most of the callouses were history!  </li>
            <li>So effective on foot calluses.</li>
            <li>With this kind of money and the word \\&quot;file\\&quot; in the product name</li>
            <li>However, it is kind f flimsy and not all that effective at the job.   </li>
            <li>Nice rasp, seems to work</li>
            <li>That alone kept me at home dealing with it on my own.</li>
            <li>My first one disappeared this summer after I showed my mom and daughters how amazing this is.  !?!  </li>
            <li>so pleased, thanks for reviewing it so well and leading me to the best.  </li>
            <li>This file was used on me at one of my favorite Spa spots and I fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>I seriously love this product and would probably pay much more than the asking price!</li>
            <li>Bought this in September of 2013 and still going strong!</li>
            <li>first off, i never ever write reviews, even when the product is great</li>
            <li>But I wanted to be able to wear sandals or open-backed shoes this summer without scaring children or making people throw up.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and have bought others.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Does the job better</li>
            <li>This product is used extensively at spas because it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my diamond nail files, but not this.  </li>
            <li>They work great and are very durable.  </li>
            <li>I use the medium one most of the time - but every once in awhile</li>
            <li>(he had never buffed his feet before) and he commented how much better his feet felt - he was amazed.</li>
            <li>I wish I found this sooner, but I&#x27;m really glad I have it now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered the #20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have three different diamancel files and they are all awesome.  </li>
            <li>I used my favorite foot cream afterwards (which is Gold Bond foot cream)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to heal my feet...</li>
            <li>and I have to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>I thought that a foot file costing more than thirty dollars would be substantial.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found any better.  </li>
            <li>I realy love this buffer</li>
            <li>Great product that really works</li>
            <li>I think this file is pretty much the best option that money can buy...</li>
            <li>I have to agree with all the other reviewers and rate this product as excellent!</li>
            <li>This was the best money ever spent!  </li>
            <li>fall off so easily.</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This Diamancel file is the best so far-hands down.</li>
            <li>These (all of them) are very good for anyone with dry feet.  </li>
            <li>It removes callouses into a fine powder and keeps working and working.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>WHO KNEW that the best place for diamonds is on a little buff board for your feet?  </li>
            <li>It takes some effort to achieve a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>enough, this file works great.</li>
            <li>that is really making a difference, and you could probably just use any kind of lotion.</li>
            <li>Leaves my feet smooth and sleek</li>
            <li>She could probably tell they were looking far too good...</li>
            <li>I think the main disadvantage is that it&#x27;s flexible; the more pressure you apply the more it flexes.  </li>
            <li>The day it was delivered, i was so excited, i took my socks off and started to file.  </li>
            <li>This file does a great job getting rid of the dry skin and calluses with ease.  </li>
            <li>I use a toothbrush, liquid soap and water to clean it.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job removing calluses and dry skin on your heels and on the balls of your feet.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use at night right before bed.</li>
            <li>it works great for dry (even cracked) heels!</li>
            <li>As a man, I&#x27;ve never gone in for a pedicure or done anything special with my feet.</li>
            <li>Great product for your rough feet.  </li>
            <li>I coupled that with a nightly application of a foot moisturizer (O&#x27;Keefes, available at Target for about $6.00) and within the week my feet are now as smooth and silky as a babes foot for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This week I had &amp;#34;change polish&amp;#34; rather than full pedi and the gal was checking out my feet with an air of suspicion.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s good enough for Oprah, it&#x27;s good enough for you.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>WOrks great on my husband&#x27;s rough calloused feet!</li>
            <li>Now I have this simple, easy tool to use, and this old lady can truly be comfortable looking her best as - a bare foot girl.</li>
            <li>After the first use my heels felt incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many files for my dry calloused heels and this is hands down the best file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the #11 and it&#x27;s very good but for the really thick calluses, I think you need the #20.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 days use with the Diamancel rasp however, I removed virtually all the dead skin and calluses  from my feet and they looked great.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT and my feet are soft again.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but does the job effectively and can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean as well and should last forever from what I can tell.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and I have never felt like it would affect any living tissue or make my feet sore in any way.</li>
            <li>Very grateful for this product!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products: from foot creme, emjoi devices, peels for the feet, results were so so and only temporary.  </li>
            <li>so well I personally would have paid many times that price.</li>
            <li>Saw it in Nieman Marcus for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I had my first one for well over 3 years</li>
            <li>But after many pedicures, foot creams, various foot files. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I did balk at the price, but I was willing to try anything</li>
            <li>Together, these do exactly what you&#x27;d hope, only better.  </li>
            <li>If choosing, I&#x27;d order #11 first and get this as an auxiliary.</li>
            <li>Mine was a gift, and now I&#x27;ve bought two for other friends and will buy more!</li>
            <li>I KNOW you have one!&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Using on dry skin gives a much better result.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s like a large nail file) and ease of packing for travel.</li>
            <li>this baby works great and is nice and thin to get into the tight places</li>
            <li>Friends who have professional pedicures, have also experienced the horrors of cuts from shaving methods to trim hard, crusty skin on the feet.</li>
            <li>This really works....</li>
            <li>So, this whole business was news to me.</li>
            <li>It works very well without doing damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally confused by all the great ratings on here?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say about it.</li>
            <li>This works really well at removing course skin without damaging and breaking the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>but it really does work so in the end</li>
            <li>It hurts to walk much of the time.  </li>
            <li>The file does work very well though.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the pumice stones and other cheese grater implements my wife already had on hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy, but I still have my first one (now 8+ yrs old) and bought this one to keep in travel bag.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple products and  this  by far gives the most professional results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the only thing that can really take off thick callous without harming the skin.</li>
            <li>Better than any other home callus remover!</li>
            <li>I had seen this product on the today show and it recieved high praise.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I can recommend it, but this doesn&#x27;t get high marks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with cracking heals.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It washes well and so far the &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; have held on in spite of much use.</li>
            <li>Only time and use will determine if its worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I really love mine more because I didn&#x27;t pay near $40.</li>
            <li>For the last couple of years my heels have been completely dried-out and cracked, to the point where they didn&#x27;t even resemble part of a human body -- they were more like rock formations in a Martian desert.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using it twice a day for two days, and my feet look almost normal already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps smooth down though calluses fast</li>
            <li>it has removed all dry skin and my feet are smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li>In fact, they look pretty human.  </li>
            <li>Love the small size</li>
            <li>so finally I took to the internet to search for products for those of us with more extreme heel-cracking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>.. has been working wonderfully so far.....  Please keep in stock!</li>
            <li>I use this file first and then follow up by using the Diamancel # 11 Foot Buffer Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li>It takes off dead skin so easily.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it on DRY feet and not feet that have been freshly washed or feet that have been moisturized.  </li>
            <li>if you have rough, dry heel skin this is a sure bet to get it off.</li>
            <li>Smaller than i expected but come to find out strong.</li>
            <li>So thin (yet strong) and about 6&amp;#34; long so it makes for easy travel in my beauty bag.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing little device that gently scrapes away dead skin from around the heel and ball of foot.  </li>
            <li>It completely solved my cracked heel issue within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing to remove my calluses, especially for the cost of this product.</li>
            <li>After years of using pumice stones and tons of creams, I now have heels that look like they did when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li>my feet are SO soft.  </li>
            <li>When I got it and took it out of the package, I was surprised at how flimsy it was.  </li>
            <li>This product is touted as &amp;#34;heavy duty, professional grade&amp;#34; foot file.  </li>
            <li>baby-skin soft.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that $30 I spent on this foot file was well worth it indeed.  </li>
            <li>I expect that within the week my feet will be back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I read the customer reviews of course, and wondered after using it for the first time myself why anyone would rate this other than 4-5 stars.  </li>
            <li>For the high price, I wish the entire thing was solid metal.  </li>
            <li>My feet were not wet</li>
            <li>This is a well built professional quality tool which works as it should and will last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you have dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>just throw away all that other junk that doesn&#x27;t really do much anyway</li>
            <li>but i was wearing socks so they were not completely dry.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I was \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; but after only a few uses it has lost its power.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> WHO KNEW that the best place for diamonds is on a little buff board for your feet?  </li>
            <li> It takes some effort to achieve a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> enough, this file works great.</li>
            <li> that is really making a difference, and you could probably just use any kind of lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves my feet smooth and sleek</li>
            <li> She could probably tell they were looking far too good...</li>
            <li> I think the main disadvantage is that it&#x27;s flexible; the more pressure you apply the more it flexes.  </li>
            <li> The day it was delivered, i was so excited, i took my socks off and started to file.  </li>
            <li> This file does a great job getting rid of the dry skin and calluses with ease.  </li>
            <li> I use a toothbrush, liquid soap and water to clean it.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job removing calluses and dry skin on your heels and on the balls of your feet.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> it works great for dry (even cracked) heels!</li>
            <li> As a man, I&#x27;ve never gone in for a pedicure or done anything special with my feet.</li>
            <li> Great product for your rough feet.  </li>
            <li> I coupled that with a nightly application of a foot moisturizer (O&#x27;Keefes, available at Target for about $6.00) and within the week my feet are now as smooth and silky as a babes foot for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This week I had &amp;#34;change polish&amp;#34; rather than full pedi and the gal was checking out my feet with an air of suspicion.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s good enough for Oprah, it&#x27;s good enough for you.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> WOrks great on my husband&#x27;s rough calloused feet!</li>
            <li> Now I have this simple, easy tool to use, and this old lady can truly be comfortable looking her best as - a bare foot girl.</li>
            <li> After the first use my heels felt incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many files for my dry calloused heels and this is hands down the best file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the #11 and it&#x27;s very good but for the really thick calluses, I think you need the #20.  </li>
            <li> After just 2 days use with the Diamancel rasp however, I removed virtually all the dead skin and calluses  from my feet and they looked great.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT and my feet are soft again.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but does the job effectively and can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean as well and should last forever from what I can tell.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and I have never felt like it would affect any living tissue or make my feet sore in any way.</li>
            <li> Very grateful for this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products: from foot creme, emjoi devices, peels for the feet, results were so so and only temporary.  </li>
            <li> so well I personally would have paid many times that price.</li>
            <li> Saw it in Nieman Marcus for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I had my first one for well over 3 years</li>
            <li> But after many pedicures, foot creams, various foot files. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I did balk at the price, but I was willing to try anything</li>
            <li> Together, these do exactly what you&#x27;d hope, only better.  </li>
            <li> If choosing, I&#x27;d order #11 first and get this as an auxiliary.</li>
            <li> Mine was a gift, and now I&#x27;ve bought two for other friends and will buy more!</li>
            <li> I KNOW you have one!&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Using on dry skin gives a much better result.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like a large nail file) and ease of packing for travel.</li>
            <li> this baby works great and is nice and thin to get into the tight places</li>
            <li> Friends who have professional pedicures, have also experienced the horrors of cuts from shaving methods to trim hard, crusty skin on the feet.</li>
            <li> This really works....</li>
            <li> So, this whole business was news to me.</li>
            <li> It works very well without doing damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally confused by all the great ratings on here?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say about it.</li>
            <li> This works really well at removing course skin without damaging and breaking the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> but it really does work so in the end</li>
            <li> It hurts to walk much of the time.  </li>
            <li> The file does work very well though.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the pumice stones and other cheese grater implements my wife already had on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy, but I still have my first one (now 8+ yrs old) and bought this one to keep in travel bag.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products and  this  by far gives the most professional results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only thing that can really take off thick callous without harming the skin.</li>
            <li> Better than any other home callus remover!</li>
            <li> I had seen this product on the today show and it recieved high praise.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can recommend it, but this doesn&#x27;t get high marks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with cracking heals.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It washes well and so far the &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; have held on in spite of much use.</li>
            <li> Only time and use will determine if its worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I really love mine more because I didn&#x27;t pay near $40.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years my heels have been completely dried-out and cracked, to the point where they didn&#x27;t even resemble part of a human body -- they were more like rock formations in a Martian desert.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using it twice a day for two days, and my feet look almost normal already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps smooth down though calluses fast</li>
            <li> it has removed all dry skin and my feet are smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li> In fact, they look pretty human.  </li>
            <li> Love the small size</li>
            <li> so finally I took to the internet to search for products for those of us with more extreme heel-cracking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> .. has been working wonderfully so far.....  Please keep in stock!</li>
            <li> I use this file first and then follow up by using the Diamancel # 11 Foot Buffer Extra Strength.  </li>
            <li> It takes off dead skin so easily.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it on DRY feet and not feet that have been freshly washed or feet that have been moisturized.  </li>
            <li> if you have rough, dry heel skin this is a sure bet to get it off.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i expected but come to find out strong.</li>
            <li> So thin (yet strong) and about 6&amp;#34; long so it makes for easy travel in my beauty bag.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing little device that gently scrapes away dead skin from around the heel and ball of foot.  </li>
            <li> It completely solved my cracked heel issue within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to remove my calluses, especially for the cost of this product.</li>
            <li> After years of using pumice stones and tons of creams, I now have heels that look like they did when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> my feet are SO soft.  </li>
            <li> When I got it and took it out of the package, I was surprised at how flimsy it was.  </li>
            <li> This product is touted as &amp;#34;heavy duty, professional grade&amp;#34; foot file.  </li>
            <li> baby-skin soft.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that $30 I spent on this foot file was well worth it indeed.  </li>
            <li> I expect that within the week my feet will be back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I read the customer reviews of course, and wondered after using it for the first time myself why anyone would rate this other than 4-5 stars.  </li>
            <li> For the high price, I wish the entire thing was solid metal.  </li>
            <li> My feet were not wet</li>
            <li> This is a well built professional quality tool which works as it should and will last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you have dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> just throw away all that other junk that doesn&#x27;t really do much anyway</li>
            <li> but i was wearing socks so they were not completely dry.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; but after only a few uses it has lost its power.  </li>
            <li> This file has left my feet soft and free of dry skin without scales that other files left behind.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a very long time with proper maintenance.</li>
            <li> I also like the small size of this (versus the #11) as it is easier to maneuver and really get to the problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact its small enough not to be awkward to use and hopefully should last a good while.  </li>
            <li> It filed away all of the dead skin and my feet are like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are dry, calloused and split open and bleed all the time.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my feet is really dry, especially the heels.  </li>
            <li> It does the job VERY WELL of removing hard skin ( I am a runner and can get a callous here and there).  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Some people have said you can use it on wet skin, which I tried, but it only clogs up the rasp.</li>
            <li> Hope it has a long life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products to solve this, like the ped egg and the pumice stone, and they just don&#x27;t take off enough skin.  </li>
            <li> my heels were so cracked and dry</li>
            <li> well, i should have listened to reviewers, feet do have to be dry.  </li>
            <li> however, when my feet were dry i went to work.  </li>
            <li> u need this if u have dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> but it was just dry skin and calluses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had serious rotten heals for decades, tried lots of creams and rasps, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> You have to use it when the skin is really dry.  </li>
            <li> it gets all the dead skin off like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li> Its a little bit more expensive than other products</li>
            <li> It is thin, flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t really remove much of the dead skin from my feet (if any, maybe a few flakes perhaps).  </li>
            <li> The file removes rough dry skin in powder like form.  </li>
            <li> After using it once i went back to using the $5 pumace stone i had purchased previously at wal-mart.   </li>
            <li> I tried several other products over the years that just did not work very well including natural and artificial pumice stones and the Ped-Egg that you see in stores a lot.</li>
            <li> Its not stunningly good and a little miracle worker, but used over a few days and then applying a rich heel balm, its does do the job.  </li>
            <li> It is actually quite durable and bends a little bit in use to accommodate the curvature of your foot.</li>
            <li> The flexibility of it really lets it get those tough curvy parts of the foot.  </li>
            <li> Not something I expected in this product.</li>
            <li> then I expected and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and it has not yet dulled with occasional use (once a month).  </li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have circulation problems.</li>
            <li> The only problem with using sandpaper is that it wears out every few weeks</li>
            <li> I got this one for my nasty winter calluses and it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Must be used on dry skin, so can take a little longer versus one that can be used on wet skin.  </li>
            <li> Within just a few minutes of using it I could see a difference, as white skin flakes rained down from my foot to reveal softer, newer skin beneath.  </li>
            <li> I resorted to using sandpaper for awhile because that was the only thing rough enough to take off the tough callouses.  </li>
            <li> I tried pumice stones and other remedies, but those didn&#x27;t work --</li>
            <li> Purchased based on other reviewers comments.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I have a host of other products in my arsenal that I&#x27;ve tried for callus removal including the Ped Egg and some grater like instruments.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish it had a black handle like the other files.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, it is extremely thin and nothing at all like what my pedicurist uses professionally.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp, just don&#x27;t bear down to heavily.</li>
            <li> (Typical man, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always have hard skin on my heels and developed a couple of shallow cracks, so wanted a file that was stronger than average.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the $$!</li>
            <li> Plus it is a little too harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> have some tough calluses on my big toes.  </li>
            <li> First, It&#x27;s expensive, second, the metal is a little thin as compared to other Diamancel files which makes me worry that it could bend if it were not supported from behind while it was being used.</li>
            <li> Its a little thin and seems flimsy but just put your finger on the back of it when filing your feet.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I used it (as it states on dry feet) and after the sandstorm of shavings</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the narrow size of this or the fact that it is rather bendable.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s rather narrow too.  </li>
            <li> If you have dried and callused feet this is the product you need.</li>
            <li> product is basically a file that has diamond face to it which files away the dead skin but does not seem to affect living skin at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all - it is not up to the job of taking care of dead skin on the foot in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I would advise people not to waste their money on this, it is overpriced and doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> Handle could have been a little longer, a bit hard to hold.</li>
            <li> I am long overdue for my pedicure but this piece of thin metal does it work to remove the hard calluses.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t work as well as even the medium Angel.  :\</li>
            <li> I need the heavy duty one!</li>
            <li> I did try the Bliss No 11 to start with, but find its no stronger than the usual &#x27;sandpaper&#x27; type file.  </li>
            <li> I have had the worst callousy rough feet for about 4-5 years since i had my first child.</li>
            <li> The file has gotten dull.  </li>
            <li> needless to say i use it everyday for a few mins.  </li>
            <li> Two of them I have had for at least five years</li>
            <li> Just not particularly comfortable using something so thin in my hand...</li>
            <li> thick creams help the dryness but do nothing for the calloused areas</li>
            <li> My feet which weren&#x27;t bad, my heels have a tendency to get a little rough, are like a baby&#x27;s bottom now.  </li>
            <li> I have spent one session with the rasp so far, and they&#x27;re no longer terrible.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Dont be skeptical when u see the file as it is small and flimsly looking, but it does the work.  </li>
            <li> No this sucker works!</li>
            <li> Works well on tough spots.</li>
            <li> but is extremely THIN.</li>
            <li> file does look flimsy, but I suspect there is a reason behind the design...</li>
            <li> it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> My feet are in horrible shape and have been the entire summer.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who is not easily impressed, was also amazed as he watched me use the file and</li>
            <li> It has just a very very thin layer of metal wear the diamonds are attached, and then has about a 2mm acrylic plastic layer on the backside of it.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am baffled by the negative reviews because my feet are the worst of anyone</li>
            <li> My feet would catch in the sheet when i was sleeping, it was that bad.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just had a bad one?  </li>
            <li> My feet were so bad looking</li>
            <li> I had a callous on my heel and it cracked and became painful.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I hate summer when i have to wear sandals and slipper becuase</li>
            <li> My heels were terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> But I wanted to be able to wear sandals or open-backed shoes this summer without scaring children or making people throw up.  My heels were terrible.  They looked like something you&#x27;d see on Jerry Springer.  I have spent one session with the rasp so far, and they&#x27;re no longer terrible.  In fact, they look pretty human.  I&#x27;m going to keep on with this until they&#x27;re entirely nondescript.  Very grateful for this product!</li>
            <li> first off, i never ever write reviews, even when the product is great but i took the time to do this one because it works.  I have had the worst callousy rough feet for about 4-5 years since i had my first child. I hate summer when i have to wear sandals and slipper becuase my heels were so cracked and dry, i was so embarrassed. I have tried so many products: from foot creme, emjoi devices, peels for the feet, results were so so and only temporary.  I had seen this product on the today show and it recieved high praise.  Yet i didnt purchase becuase it was expensive.  I was at my wits end this month. My feet would catch in the sheet when i was sleeping, it was that bad.  i was on the verge of spending $200 for clarisonic pedi foot device and then decided to get this file based on reviews.  The day it was delivered, i was so excited, i took my socks off and started to file.  well, i should have listened to reviewers, feet do have to be dry.  My feet were not wet but i was wearing socks so they were not completely dry.  however, when my feet were dry i went to work.  needless to say i use it everyday for a few mins.  it has removed all dry skin and my feet are smooth and baby soft. never would i have thought this could happen.  Like i said i have been suffering with this for years now.  I am looking forward to summer and wearing sandals.  Trust me this works and i didnt think it was possible.  The file removes rough dry skin in powder like form.  it is easy to clean and easy to use. Dont be skeptical when u see the file as it is small and flimsly looking, but it does the work.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i expected but come to find out strong. I like the smaller size.  It did remove callus faster. Only time and use will determine if its worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> So effective on foot calluses. Easy to use at night right before bed. Great tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of skin on my feet but I was disappointed in this product. With this kind of money and the word \\&quot;file\\&quot; in the product name i guess i was expecting something heavy duty that would really do some damage to the callouses on my feet. However, it is kind f flimsy and not all that effective at the job.   After using it once i went back to using the $5 pumace stone i had purchased previously at wal-mart.   Do yourself a favor, stick with a stone!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The first time I used this I was \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; but after only a few uses it has lost its power.  The file has gotten dull.  Not worth the $$!</li>
            <li> This is a well built professional quality tool which works as it should and will last a lifetime.  I love it, and have bought others.</li>
            <li> This really works....it gets all the dead skin off like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used....u need this if u have dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am a dancer who lives in California, which means I spend lots of time barefoot or in flip flops.  This is a great product to take care of my feet.</li>
            <li> Nice rasp, seems to work okay but is extremely THIN. Not something I expected in this product. It washes well and so far the &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; have held on in spite of much use. For the price, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase. Just not particularly comfortable using something so thin in my hand...It takes some effort to achieve a smooth surface. I can recommend it, but this doesn&#x27;t get high marks.</li>
            <li> I had a callous on my heel and it cracked and became painful. As a man, I&#x27;ve never gone in for a pedicure or done anything special with my feet. So, this whole business was news to me. My wife has a ton of foot products, but I went ahead and ordered the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; I could find after researching my issue. (Typical man, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, this file works great. It completely solved my cracked heel issue within a couple of days. (Combined with lotion/foot balm of course.) It filed away all of the dead skin and my feet are like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy: who knew you had to sand your feet? We are never told these things. But this product works great. Much better than the pumice stones and other cheese grater implements my wife already had on hand. I&#x27;m going to stick with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this in September of 2013 and still going strong! Does the job better then I expected and if you have rough, dry heel skin this is a sure bet to get it off. Stays sharp, just don&#x27;t bear down to heavily. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product is used extensively at spas because it is an excellent product. It works very well without doing damage.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been searching for.  This file does a great job getting rid of the dry skin and calluses with ease.  I highly recommend this for anyone with cracking heals.</li>
            <li> A friend saw this on Dr. Oz and bought one (for $40) and just loved it.  Needless to say, I really love mine more because I didn&#x27;t pay near $40.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to remove my calluses, especially for the cost of this product. What a disappointment. All it did was scratch my skin. I immediately sent it back.</li>
            <li> After years of using pumice stones and tons of creams, I now have heels that look like they did when I was a young girl. I really didn&#x27;t expect to use it once and have a pile of dried skin fall off so easily. Don&#x27;t let the price stop you, it works so well I personally would have paid many times that price. Friends who have professional pedicures, have also experienced the horrors of cuts from shaving methods to trim hard, crusty skin on the feet. That alone kept me at home dealing with it on my own. Now I have this simple, easy tool to use, and this old lady can truly be comfortable looking her best as - a bare foot girl.</li>
            <li> I have had this rasp for about 15 years and finally bought one for my husband so he would quit using mine.  I have loved mine and it still does a great job of keeping my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Better than any other home callus remover! I&#x27;ve tried the egg and all the various rasp-type beauty tools. Love the small size (it&#x27;s like a large nail file) and ease of packing for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally confused by all the great ratings on here?  Maybe I just had a bad one?  The one I had was as good as nothing.  I LOVE my diamond nail files, but not this.  Threw it away same day that it got here.  I have a medium Angel Foot File and I was debating between this one and a coarse Angel file.  I should&#x27;ve gotten the coarse Angel.  This one didn&#x27;t work as well as even the medium Angel.  :\</li>
            <li> this baby works great and is nice and thin to get into the tight places</li>
            <li> These (all of them) are very good for anyone with dry feet.  They work great and are very durable.  I think I have had mine for over a year and they are still going strong.  I use the medium one most of the time - but every once in awhile I need the heavy duty one!</li>
            <li> Works well, can&#x27;t be used too often given its coarse nature. My only complaint is I wish it had a black handle like the other files. Seems like it will last a very long time with proper maintenance.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but does the job effectively and can be cleaned easily.  I use a toothbrush, liquid soap and water to clean it.  Must be used on dry skin, so can take a little longer versus one that can be used on wet skin.  I think the main disadvantage is that it&#x27;s flexible; the more pressure you apply the more it flexes.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and it has not yet dulled with occasional use (once a month).  My husband used it on his feet (he had never buffed his feet before) and he commented how much better his feet felt - he was amazed.</li>
            <li> This works very effectively.  It&#x27;s flexible, which is a benefit.  I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say about it.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years my heels have been completely dried-out and cracked, to the point where they didn&#x27;t even resemble part of a human body -- they were more like rock formations in a Martian desert.  I tried pumice stones and other remedies, but those didn&#x27;t work -- so finally I took to the internet to search for products for those of us with more extreme heel-cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the Diamoncel #20 based on recommendations here -- and it works!  Within just a few minutes of using it I could see a difference, as white skin flakes rained down from my foot to reveal softer, newer skin beneath.  I&#x27;ve now been using it twice a day for two days, and my feet look almost normal already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use the Diamoncel rasp, I cover my heels with Flexitol Heel Balm just to add some moisture back in.  The combination is good, but I think it&#x27;s the Diamoncel that is really making a difference, and you could probably just use any kind of lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many files for my dry calloused heels and this is hands down the best file I&#x27;ve ever used. This file has left my feet soft and free of dry skin without scales that other files left behind. I wish I found this sooner, but I&#x27;m really glad I have it now.</li>
            <li> Good implement...works well.</li>
            <li> Handle could have been a little longer, a bit hard to hold. But still works well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just for calluses...it works great for dry (even cracked) heels! Well made. Worth the price. Just be careful if you have circulation problems.</li>
            <li> I always have hard skin on my heels and developed a couple of shallow cracks, so wanted a file that was stronger than average.  This fits the bill.  Its not stunningly good and a little miracle worker, but used over a few days and then applying a rich heel balm, its does do the job.  I also appreciate the fact its small enough not to be awkward to use and hopefully should last a good while.  I did try the Bliss No 11 to start with, but find its no stronger than the usual &#x27;sandpaper&#x27; type file.  No 20 is the one to go for and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for your rough feet.  I am a guy that likes his feel uncalloused.  This works really well at removing course skin without damaging and breaking the skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little device that gently scrapes away dead skin from around the heel and ball of foot.  Never &amp;#34;over does damage&amp;#34; like the razors or cheese graters I&#x27;ve purchased from drug stores.  So thin (yet strong) and about 6&amp;#34; long so it makes for easy travel in my beauty bag.  It&#x27;s pricy, but I still have my first one (now 8+ yrs old) and bought this one to keep in travel bag.  Spend the money, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This file was used on me at one of my favorite Spa spots and I fell in love with it!  It does the job VERY WELL of removing hard skin ( I am a runner and can get a callous here and there).  I was elated to find it on Amazon! I received it and put it to good use.. has been working wonderfully so far.....  Please keep in stock!</li>
            <li> Purchased based on other reviewers comments. I have been looking for a product like this for a long time. Saw it in Nieman Marcus for a much higher price. Does a good job. I am pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I also bought the#11 which is great for horrid heels and the #20 is perfect for getting feet silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth down though calluses fast</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered the #20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some tough calluses on my big toes.  I had ordered the #11 and it&#x27;s very good but for the really thick calluses, I think you need the #20.  I also like the small size of this (versus the #11) as it is easier to maneuver and really get to the problem areas.  Like other reviewers, I have a host of other products in my arsenal that I&#x27;ve tried for callus removal including the Ped Egg and some grater like instruments.  This Diamancel file is the best so far-hands down.</li>
            <li> This rasp does a terrific job of removing unsightly calluses. Leaves my feet smooth and sleek (no alligator skin, like you get with those &amp;#34;shredder&amp;#34; type rasps). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> No this sucker works! so pleased, thanks for reviewing it so well and leading me to the best.  Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> My first one disappeared this summer after I showed my mom and daughters how amazing this is.  !?!  It&#x27;s probably somewhere in the house but once you try it, there is no going back to ANYTHING else.  It removes callouses into a fine powder and keeps working and working.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the narrow size of this or the fact that it is rather bendable.  The flexibility of it really lets it get those tough curvy parts of the foot.  That&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s rather narrow too.  I had my first one for well over 3 years and it never dulled, either.  GREAT product.  Now I&#x27;m looking at the hand callous filer I see they also make. Hmmmmm...</li>
            <li> I have to agree with all the other reviewers and rate this product as excellent! If you have dried and callused feet this is the product you need. My feet were so bad looking I thought maybe I had some sort of foot disease but it was just dry skin and calluses. I tried several other products over the years that just did not work very well including natural and artificial pumice stones and the Ped-Egg that you see in stores a lot. After just 2 days use with the Diamancel rasp however, I removed virtually all the dead skin and calluses  from my feet and they looked great. I coupled that with a nightly application of a foot moisturizer (O&#x27;Keefes, available at Target for about $6.00) and within the week my feet are now as smooth and silky as a babes foot for the first time in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is basically a file that has diamond face to it which files away the dead skin but does not seem to affect living skin at all. It is very gentle and I have never felt like it would affect any living tissue or make my feet sore in any way. Its a little bit more expensive than other products but it really does work so in the end just throw away all that other junk that doesn&#x27;t really do much anyway and it is a bargain. Its a little thin and seems flimsy but just put your finger on the back of it when filing your feet. It is actually quite durable and bends a little bit in use to accommodate the curvature of your foot. I wholeheartedly endorse this product!</li>
            <li> I have three different diamancel files and they are all awesome.  Two of them I have had for at least five years so the quality is excellent.  I got this one for my nasty winter calluses and it is very effective.  I would highly recommend this if you have dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would buy a $30 foot file.  But after many pedicures, foot creams, various foot files. . I decided to give this a try. I read the customer reviews of course, and wondered after using it for the first time myself why anyone would rate this other than 4-5 stars.  My feet which weren&#x27;t bad, my heels have a tendency to get a little rough, are like a baby&#x27;s bottom now.  Seriously, I used it (as it states on dry feet) and after the sandstorm of shavings LOL. . my feet are SO soft.  I used my favorite foot cream afterwards (which is Gold Bond foot cream) and I have to say that $30 I spent on this foot file was well worth it indeed.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had serious rotten heals for decades, tried lots of creams and rasps, nothing really worked. This rasp is the only one that has ever made a difference, I use it once or twice a week then use Olivella olive oil lotion with an ankle sock. Better than all those expensive potions my dermatologist has given me.</li>
            <li> My feet are in horrible shape and have been the entire summer.  They are dry, calloused and split open and bleed all the time.  It hurts to walk much of the time.  I have tried so many products to heal my feet...pumice stones just don&#x27;t cut it...thick creams help the dryness but do nothing for the calloused areas so my feet still split open.  In desperation I bought the Diamencel #20 file.  I&#x27;ll admit, I did balk at the price, but I was willing to try anything so I begrudgingly forked over the cash.  This was the best money ever spent!  With one use most of the callouses were history!  I expect that within the week my feet will be back to normal.  My husband, who is not easily impressed, was also amazed as he watched me use the file and my callouses disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The file does look flimsy, but I suspect there is a reason behind the design...perhaps to keep people from filing their heel off?!  It is actually quite sturdy.  I am baffled by the negative reviews because my feet are the worst of anyone I know and the file transformed them before my eyes.  I seriously love this product and would probably pay much more than the asking price!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Diamancel #11.  Together, these do exactly what you&#x27;d hope, only better.  My feet feel wonderful after use and, honestly, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  If choosing, I&#x27;d order #11 first and get this as an auxiliary.</li>
            <li> Very good option for foot file. Can stay in shower and doesn&#x27;t get gross over time like wooden or plastic files. Works well on tough spots.</li>
            <li> WOrks great on my husband&#x27;s rough calloused feet!</li>
            <li> The skin on my feet is really dry, especially the heels.  When I run a lot and play basketball they start to crack and bleed if not taken care of.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products to solve this, like the ped egg and the pumice stone, and they just don&#x27;t take off enough skin.  I resorted to using sandpaper for awhile because that was the only thing rough enough to take off the tough callouses.  The only problem with using sandpaper is that it wears out every few weeks and I have to purchase more.  Plus it is a little too harsh on the skin.  I did some research and found this Diamancel #20 file and ordered it.  When I got it and took it out of the package, I was surprised at how flimsy it was.  It has just a very very thin layer of metal wear the diamonds are attached, and then has about a 2mm acrylic plastic layer on the backside of it.  Some reviewers say this is a good thing since it provides some flex when filing.  For the high price, I wish the entire thing was solid metal.  The file does work very well though.  You have to use it when the skin is really dry.  It takes off dead skin so easily.  It is easy to clean as well and should last forever from what I can tell.  I think this file is pretty much the best option that money can buy... I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products and  this  by far gives the most professional results. Some people have said you can use it on wet skin, which I tried, but it only clogs up the rasp. Using on dry skin gives a much better result.</li>
            <li> I thought that a foot file costing more than thirty dollars would be substantial.  This is not.  It is thin, flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t really remove much of the dead skin from my feet (if any, maybe a few flakes perhaps).  This product is touted as &amp;#34;heavy duty, professional grade&amp;#34; foot file.  All I can say is, it is extremely thin and nothing at all like what my pedicurist uses professionally. I didn&#x27;t like this product at all - it is not up to the job of taking care of dead skin on the foot in my opinion.  I would advise people not to waste their money on this, it is overpriced and doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> This file works great!  I&#x27;ve never found any better.  However, it does have disadvantages. First, It&#x27;s expensive, second, the metal is a little thin as compared to other Diamancel files which makes me worry that it could bend if it were not supported from behind while it was being used.</li>
            <li> Best results, durable, washable - love it!  Mine was a gift, and now I&#x27;ve bought two for other friends and will buy more!</li>
            <li> This file is great.  You have to use it on DRY feet and not feet that have been freshly washed or feet that have been moisturized.  It does a great job removing calluses and dry skin on your heels and on the balls of your feet.  I use this file first and then follow up by using the Diamancel # 11 Foot Buffer Extra Strength.  Together, I think these foot files do the best job in getting your feet baby-skin soft.  I have had mine for 5+ years and it hasn&#x27;t dulled at all.</li>
            <li> I realy love this buffer and i highly recommend. After the first use my heels felt incredibly smooth. Worth every penny in my opinion. Great product that really works</li>
            <li> WHO KNEW that the best place for diamonds is on a little buff board for your feet?  Best foot implement I have ever used -- 10x better that Pedi Egg (leaves feet smoother).  Totally worth the investment.  Some people have remarked that it is on the flimsy/thin side -- I don&#x27;t think so.  Works great and have no concern that the thing could break / snap.  Buy one for your husband, too, so that he does not steal yours.  Hope it has a long life.  The only people who don&#x27;t like this are the owners of the nail salons, as you will no longer need to fork out $30 each week for a pedicure.  Seriously.  This week I had &amp;#34;change polish&amp;#34; rather than full pedi and the gal was checking out my feet with an air of suspicion.  She could probably tell they were looking far too good...but she did not confront me (as in, &amp;#34;O.k., hand over your Bliss Diamancel......I KNOW you have one!&amp;#34;).  I read about this product in a magazine...O (Oprah), maybe?  Now I know: Bliss Diamancel is one of those &amp;#34;must-haves&amp;#34; in the well-groomed woman&#x27;s toolkit.  If it&#x27;s good enough for Oprah, it&#x27;s good enough for you.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Yes, the price is alittle steep for a simple piece of metal. But I must say that it works. I am long overdue for my pedicure but this piece of thin metal does it work to remove the hard calluses.</li>
            <li> My husband says I have hooves for feet. This is a great product and the only thing that can really take off thick callous without harming the skin. LOVE IT and my feet are soft again.</li>
