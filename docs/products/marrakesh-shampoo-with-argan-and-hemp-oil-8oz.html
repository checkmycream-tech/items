            <li>My hair is so healthy</li>
            <li>love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My most favorite shampoo, I reach for it time and again.</li>
            <li>so I found I was able to purchase it on-line at a greater savings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need conditioner :)</li>
            <li>Best shampoo available for fine, soft hair.  </li>
            <li>Too drying for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I now refuse to put any sulfate in my hair and buy sulfate free hairspray and gel.</li>
            <li>and it does have a light foam.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about the marrakesh oil, then I saw the full kit on Amazon with shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and the oil for under $40.00 and free shipping</li>
            <li>I tried the conditioner first and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>love it so much!</li>
            <li>Since I use it to replace no-poo, I use it to clean my scalp rather than foam up my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt so healthy (and I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands).</li>
            <li>a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost identical to the Argan oil, but not as strong since you&#x27;re rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>the product rinses well leaving hair feeling clean, the scent is natural and enjoyable, the price is affordable.</li>
            <li>Let me educate some people right quick.</li>
            <li>The second wash produces copious suds, and an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with how healthy my hair is now and it doesn&#x27;t frizz like before my boyfriend is obsessed with my hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best ever and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After I stopped using it, my hair grew back better, smoother, &amp; thicker.</li>
            <li>Being a guy, I find it more to the feminine side of fragrance but not totally objectionable.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t to find in stores, I have only been able to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fact that the first washing produces almost no sudsing, but that&#x27;s what happens with no-sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li>We purchased it because we really love the marakesh x spray for detangling her long hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not color my hair so the greys are very course.</li>
            <li>I really like this, the aroma of the shampoo and how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>but it does not lather up very well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t supposed to, but if you have straight hair (or have never followed the Deva product</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing and moisturizes well without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other shampoos) but it makes your hair so soft and manageable and smells delicious!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>First I just want to say that I am a Caucasian with very fine but thick hair with naturally curly hair!.</li>
            <li>I have slightly dry and fly-away hair and many shampoos dry my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>Now I consider this my new staple.  </li>
            <li>Now when I go have my haircut, the stylist cannot believe how soft it is!  </li>
            <li>It is also clear, which leads me to believe there aren&#x27;t any added chemicals to make it appear</li>
            <li>just makes your hait so soft and shiny..  </li>
            <li>I was seeking to find a natural shampoo to replace my chemical shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a delight and we were pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This made my hair even more dry like hay, brittle, thinning, &amp; dead.</li>
            <li>The scent is like no other shampoo I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>and he is of African and Spanish decent.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is definitely different than no-poo in that it will lather, but it&#x27;s not like regular shampoo because you really have to work it for a while before a flat lather appears.</li>
            <li>This is a must for those who dye, perm and/or use straight irons or other heated styling tools.  </li>
            <li>I do not use the conditioner because it weights my hair down, but the shampoo is lovely...a real treat for my hair.</li>

            <li> This is AMAZING,leaves your hair so soft and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry and coarse feeling until I started using this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I decided to do some research on my own and learned a lot about sulfate and how bad it is for your Hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos, but enough.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, I hoped this would be help with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> When I used the shampoo, hair got very tangled and it seemed like it do not clean my hair, there were very little suds.</li>
            <li> You can style your hair over and over without having to wash it everyday and my hair is growing faster and my brush stays clear from hair meaning less breakage and it&#x27;s never tangled up in knots.</li>
            <li> After using this in combo with the conditioner, I think my hair is less dry &amp; softer.</li>
            <li> I will try one of the other fragrances if I order again.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT AT ALL .</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy hair that is normally dry and a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> purchased this as something to change up my typical no-poo by deva.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; fragrance is a little persistent and slightly floral.  </li>
            <li> Do not let the negative reviews discourage you because many people have not been taught the proper way to wash your hair and they are they ones walking around with greasy roots which eventually causes dandruff and nasty flakes.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago</li>
            <li> Less unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just because this doesn&#x27;t sudd doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (which is not good for you) which is the ingredient that makes shampoo foam.</li>
            <li> Before I was going through shamp/cond like crazy</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out horribly .</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> My hair used to be dry and coarse feeling until I started using this shampoo!  Now when I go have my haircut, the stylist cannot believe how soft it is!  The oils in this product soak INTO your hair.  They do not just sit on top of it.  This is a must for those who dye, perm and/or use straight irons or other heated styling tools.  It definitely helps protect and restore your hair.  I used the shampoo, conditioner and elixir.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING,leaves your hair so soft and keeps the frizz down. I do not color my hair so the greys are very course. A friend told me about the marrakesh oil, then I saw the full kit on Amazon with shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and the oil for under $40.00 and free shipping so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The \\&quot;oil\\&quot; is amazing in itself it does not leave a oily residue just makes your hait so soft and shiny..  I do believe I found THE product for me.</li>
            <li> Too drying for my fine hair. Had to slather on the conditioner after. Smelled like spicey after-shave. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I was seeking to find a natural shampoo to replace my chemical shampoo. Reading the reviews, I hoped this would be help with my dry hair. I was wrong! This made my hair even more dry like hay, brittle, thinning, &amp; dead. My hair was starting to fall out. I was losing hair! Thought I was just me until I noticed my hair length for noticeably shorter. After I stopped using it, my hair grew back better, smoother, &amp; thicker. This shampoo didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair feel silky smooth.  The scent is like no other shampoo I have ever used before. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have slightly dry and fly-away hair and many shampoos dry my hair too much.  The Marrakesh is perfect and leaves my hair soft and not oily.  The &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; fragrance is a little persistent and slightly floral.  Being a guy, I find it more to the feminine side of fragrance but not totally objectionable.  I will try one of the other fragrances if I order again.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos, but enough.  I think it is an excellent product, especially at Amazon prices.</li>
            <li> First I just want to say that I am a Caucasian with very fine but thick hair with naturally curly hair!. I dye my hair and breakage has been a problem as well as tangles after washing that when I brushed it I was literally ripping my hair. I decided to do some research on my own and learned a lot about sulfate and how bad it is for your Hair. I tried the conditioner first and fell in love with it So I ordered the shampoo and leave in oil and conditioner. It has been 3 months and I buy this stuff in bulk! My hair is so healthy and I can go without washing for 3 days and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily. Let me educate some people right quick. Shampooing is for the scalp conditioner is for the roots. Just because this doesn&#x27;t sudd doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working. The suds are what creates build up because of the sulfate this shampoo leaves my scalp feeling great and used with the conditioner it&#x27;s the best ever and a little goes a long way. Before I was going through shamp/cond like crazy but this stuff last me 2 months. I have turned a lot of people that had the same problems as I did with their hair and they are convinced. I now refuse to put any sulfate in my hair and buy sulfate free hairspray and gel. You can style your hair over and over without having to wash it everyday and my hair is growing faster and my brush stays clear from hair meaning less breakage and it&#x27;s never tangled up in knots. I cannot say enough about this product line. I am so happy with how healthy my hair is now and it doesn&#x27;t frizz like before my boyfriend is obsessed with my hair and he uses this too and he is of African and Spanish decent. Do not let the negative reviews discourage you because many people have not been taught the proper way to wash your hair and they are they ones walking around with greasy roots which eventually causes dandruff and nasty flakes.</li>
            <li> When I used the shampoo, hair got very tangled and it seemed like it do not clean my hair, there were very little suds.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  Leaves hair smooth, frizz-free, shiny and smelling wonderful!!!!!!!  I really have been impressed with all the products in this line.</li>
            <li> The scent takes me away to another land. Please create hair spray, gel, mousse, lifter, and anything else.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy hair that is normally dry and a tangled mess. I started using this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago and I will never use anything else again!! My hair has never looked or felt so healthy (and I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands). Plus, the original scent of this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m constantly smelling my hair. I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo available for fine, soft hair.  I do not use the conditioner because it weights my hair down, but the shampoo is lovely...a real treat for my hair.</li>
            <li> This makes my daughter&#x27;s hair smell wonderful.  We purchased it because we really love the marakesh x spray for detangling her long hair.  Thought since it was the same brand it would also be helpful in the detangling dept.  Didn&#x27;t seem any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I constantly and will only buy Marrakesh brand shampoo and condition.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both lover the smell. Can&#x27;t to find in stores, I have only been able to find on Amazon.Amazon has it for a great price and a wonderful product. (2nd time I have bought through Amazon!)</li>

            <li> I really like this, the aroma of the shampoo and how my hair feels. I tried another brand after this, but will be stocking up on this brand again soon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It takes a little getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other shampoos) but it makes your hair so soft and manageable and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Like the smell but it does not lather up very well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a delight and we were pleasantly surprised at the results. Our hair is  not only shiny but looks and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li> the product rinses well leaving hair feeling clean, the scent is natural and enjoyable, the price is affordable. love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using shampoos with argan oil &amp; no sulfate for awhile-they all smell wonderful. But this one exceeds my expectations for scent &amp; performance. It&#x27;s a fact that the first washing produces almost no sudsing, but that&#x27;s what happens with no-sulfate shampoos. The second wash produces copious suds, and an amazing scent. After using this in combo with the conditioner, I think my hair is less dry &amp; softer. I&#x27;m sold on this product.</li>
            <li> NOTE: If you don&#x27;t have wavy/curly hair, you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product. Several reviews complain that it doesn&#x27;t suds. It isn&#x27;t supposed to, but if you have straight hair (or have never followed the Deva product \\&quot;way\\&quot;) you would think you&#x27;re buying a product that isn&#x27;t working. Sulfates aren&#x27;t good for curly hair, but they do make shampoo sudsy. You don&#x27;t want that if you are just cleaning your scalp (like people with curly hair should be doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as something to change up my typical no-poo by deva. I already use Argan oil in my hair post shower as my finishing product. The shampoo is definitely different than no-poo in that it will lather, but it&#x27;s not like regular shampoo because you really have to work it for a while before a flat lather appears. It is also clear, which leads me to believe there aren&#x27;t any added chemicals to make it appear a certain way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost identical to the Argan oil, but not as strong since you&#x27;re rinsing it out. Since I use it to replace no-poo, I use it to clean my scalp rather than foam up my hair. It seems to be effective and my hair is nice and shiny whether I wear it curly or straighten it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have been using it for over a year. A little goes a long way and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> My most favorite shampoo, I reach for it time and again. I have curly hair and it performs well for me and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo along with the conditioner. I found this item at store and loved the smell. Less unnecessary ingredients. It was a bit pricey so I found I was able to purchase it on-line at a greater savings. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I color regularly and have tried every shampoo out there.  Now I consider this my new staple.  Great scent.  Nice lather.  Keeps my color.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this! I love the scent! Gentle cleansing and moisturizes well without being greasy.  I also have Marrakesh X...love it so much! I don&#x27;t even need conditioner :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it does have a light foam. Foam is not what cleans your hair. It doesn&#x27;t contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (which is not good for you) which is the ingredient that makes shampoo foam.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Dried my hair out horribly . Doesn&#x27;t make it shine . Feels like horse hair. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL .</li>
