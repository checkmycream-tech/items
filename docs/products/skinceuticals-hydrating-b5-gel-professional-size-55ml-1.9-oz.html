            <li>my skin was mostly low-maintenance for a lot of years.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s more of a long-term thing.</li>

            <li>I can see a tremendous difference in my skin when I am using the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this forumla has the right amount of hydration for my skin without making it feel greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>Look at the line, they have many night moisturizers and I have used, most of their moisturizers can be used day or night, but a few just for night.</li>
            <li>I live in hot FL and it is light and never greasy, just soaks into your skin and oyou get all the benefit of B5, good PM if you dont need a heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>for me, my skin is medium complexioned with olive undertones, I have heriditary dark circles, I still get oily more often than not, and I have the beginnings of fine lines and some blotchiness.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating !</li>
            <li>Exactly what skin needs after being washed.</li>
            <li>Love the hydrating B5 gel... especially in the winter months.  </li>

            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and exactly as it stated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more a recent thing.</li>
            <li>I love the professional size and the value that amazon offers.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I get rashes from such products, but this is light moisturizer with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>This product comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Soothing and very moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It does go really fast</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all who are looking for an excellen product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a special undereye cream that I found that goes on after and over time reduces the effect of dark circles, and that&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ve just hit upon the right combination for my skin, which I think is the key - not an objective holy grail product, but the right series of products for your particular skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simple to use and, over time, I&#x27;ve seen positive effects.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft everyone asks what I put on it.  </li>
            <li>I notice when I get busy and skip using this for a week or so.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and would highly recommend for its anti-inflammatory results</li>
            <li>Since I am 69 years old, I need the added moisturizer because my skin now tends to be dry.</li>

            <li> Love the hydrating B5 gel... especially in the winter months.  This is a staple in my anti-aging routine, as well as keeping my skin super moisturized!</li>
            <li> Amazing moisture -especially if your oily</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, thanks for being there when the product was needed!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great price!</li>
            <li> This was my first time tryin Hydrating B5 gel. Totally love the way my skin feels. Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more. i really love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> i have used this product for approximately 15 years. Since I am 69 years old, I need the added moisturizer because my skin now tends to be dry. People repeatedly tell me I don&#x27;t look my age. Thank you Hydrating B5 Gel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product along with the CE Ferulic  and love them both. I would strongly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It arrived on time and exactly as it stated. My wife uses all Skin Ceuticals products and she looks as good as the day that I met her for the first time. A slight exaggeration, but you get the point.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals B5 Gel is absorbed immediately and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> ...I could probably retire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more a recent thing. I have good genes my skin was mostly low-maintenance for a lot of years. Once I reached my late 40s, some of the expected issues started to show up...a bit of blotchiness, some fine lines, those damned 11s between my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like I said, I&#x27;ve cruised through a good number of the popular and a handful of the more elite solutions out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skinceuticals products seem to work best for me. They&#x27;re simple to use and, over time, I&#x27;ve seen positive effects. Perhaps I&#x27;ve just hit upon the right combination for my skin, which I think is the key - not an objective holy grail product, but the right series of products for your particular skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, my skin is medium complexioned with olive undertones, I have heriditary dark circles, I still get oily more often than not, and I have the beginnings of fine lines and some blotchiness. I use an oil cleanser (soap is bad!), then the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic as an antioxidant, with this over the top. There&#x27;s a special undereye cream that I found that goes on after and over time reduces the effect of dark circles, and that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this forumla has the right amount of hydration for my skin without making it feel greasy or oily. It&#x27;s not an overnight fix - it&#x27;s more of a long-term thing. I used it (and the related products I talked about) over a period of about six weeks before seeing noticable results. And like I said, I really believe that it&#x27;s a matter of finding what works best for you. For me, a simple skincare regime that can provide some visible results over time is all I&#x27;ll stick with. I notice when I get busy and skip using this for a week or so. That&#x27;s how I know it works.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product! Thank you for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have used it for 8plus years and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great together with any Vitamin C, Phloretin or any RetinA you may be using.  Soothing and very moisturizing on the skin.  It does go really fast so I rotate it with another product, just a hyaluronic with vit C which is cheaper and also gives a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my dermatologist, but found it cheaper on amazon!  I love the professional size and the value that amazon offers.  I recommend it to all who are looking for an excellen product and reasonable price.</li>
