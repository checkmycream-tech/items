            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>A great, sweet, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>but this is delightfully light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that you have to be close to experience it.  </li>
            <li>I love all CK fragrances (my favs are Euphoria &amp; Escape) and this spray smelled good in the store, but it doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL.</li>
            <li>This is a great evening scent, for night time not too loud just right.</li>
            <li>I am working 2 jobs trying to keep up with house payment and not being able to return it was not the right answer.</li>
            <li>I love this , it has a clean smell not over powerful flower smells which I am allergic too.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>CK dosnt never fail!</li>
            <li>I love it and advise to purchares ( the price is wow )</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the real deal not a knock off.  </li>
            <li>I love the original CK ONE and this actually has a slight essence of that scent in it as well.</li>
            <li>I believe the 1.7 ounce retails for $42.00, I paid a few dollars more for the 6.7 ounce.</li>
            <li>The item arrived brand new sealed in plastic in the box.  </li>
            <li>Had bought it last year as a&lt;br /&gt;Christmas for the first time.</li>
            <li>apparently you all can ship flammable stuff</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I will be buying anything from Amazon in the near future if ever.&lt;br /&gt;Lynda Polys</li>

            <li> Great price and a great scent.</li>
            <li> I love all CK fragrances (my favs are Euphoria &amp; Escape) and this spray smelled good in the store, but it doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL.</li>
            <li> A great, sweet, fresh scent.  I bought the him version too, and I mic them, but that is just me.  I love the hints of Patchouli and you can almost smell Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> I love this , it has a clean smell not over powerful flower smells which I am allergic too.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t do CK perfumes because they&#x27;re heavy to me but this is delightfully light. I prefer this as a daytime fragrance.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not the real perfume. I purchased it and I can promise you as soon as you spray it you cant smell it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into Macy&#x27;s and sprayed it and it lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the real perfume. It&#x27;s obviously some watered down knock off version. I&#x27;m not happy. Considering, I ended up having to buy the department store version after spending $60 for this one. DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. It&#x27;s not sweet and not musky, but kinda in between. I love the original CK ONE and this actually has a slight essence of that scent in it as well. I totally recommend this for anyone. If give your hair a few spritz of this you can smell it all day.</li>
            <li> great buy love the smell</li>
            <li> Awi its great , fresh and suitible for summer days .. I love it and advise to purchares ( the price is wow )</li>
            <li> Fragrance scam goes by 5 minutes hurts, scammers amazon should have more control of this makes three items that I buy on amazon and are bad products</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s so charming - light &amp; wonderful.  I find it&#x27;s perfect for summer and I receive compliments everytime I hug someone.  It&#x27;s so light that you have to be close to experience it.  Exactly what I like.  I don&#x27;t like any fragrance that&#x27;s overpowering and CK Shock is one of the best out there.  I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.  Seller shipped quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I chose one star bc I could not ship it back. My daughter chose to not see me on Christmas so I returned her gift except the perfume bc apparently you all can ship flammable stuff but the buyer can&#x27;t which I didn&#x27;t know when I made purchase. It sucks bc I paid $30+ for it and now I am stuck with it and no I do not want to put it online to sell it myself I don&#x27;t have the time. I am working 2 jobs trying to keep up with house payment and not being able to return it was not the right answer. I would have given 0 stars if I had the option. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying anything from Amazon in the near future if ever.&lt;br /&gt;Lynda Polys</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really pretty and is perfect for the summer! I will definitely be buying it again once my bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and in a good price! The size it&#x27;s amazing for the price! Love it!</li>
            <li> CK dosnt never fail! their product always look good! and smeel good!</li>
            <li> I got a large 6.7 ounce Ck One Shock for Her for the price of the smallest one that is sold. I believe the 1.7 ounce retails for $42.00, I paid a few dollars more for the 6.7 ounce. The item arrived brand new sealed in plastic in the box.  It amazes me how much more I got for my money. No question about it, it&#x27;s the real deal not a knock off.  Glad I ordered!!</li>
            <li> Buen perfume, buen precio</li>
            <li> This is a great evening scent, for night time not too loud just right.</li>
            <li> My roommate had this last year and ever since then I wanted to get my own.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it and at such a good price!!</li>

            <li> Perfect birthday gift. Had bought it last year as a&lt;br /&gt;Christmas for the first time. Young ladies absolutely love this scent.</li>
