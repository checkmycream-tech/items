            <li>and I love this thing it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is probably a professional drill at its best.</li>
            <li>A very nice little pedicure set which is of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Some have cost many times what I paid for this one (under $20) and do not work any better.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more attachments.  </li>
            <li>I love this drill...  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $30.00</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But, his thing works way better than those.  </li>
            <li>so I love his thing..</li>
            <li>I was going through too many nail blocks then decided to buy a nail drill.</li>
            <li>I love my drill</li>
            <li>Love that I can change the speeds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY for light filing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I was excited to find such a good deal on a nail drill, but this was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It may look cheap but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it</li>
            <li>and it has a lot of speed so good so far</li>
            <li>I just started doing nails as my trade and this drill was cheap and had fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>instead of going out every month and paying 40 to 50 dollars to get a full set of acrylic nails, I decided to get this and just do them at home.</li>
            <li>it came fast, and worked  at a level that acceptable for my acrylic work(i am a professional nail tech at a good level.)</li>
            <li>This is a really cute nice little drill</li>
            <li>I do my own silk wraps and acrylics and gel so its for personal use and friends and family</li>
            <li>This comes with some different attachments which is nice</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to spend money on them right away.</li>
            <li>Vents are right where you hold the drill</li>
            <li>First I wanna say I got this in 2 days,</li>
            <li>but the product is exactly what you expect.</li>
            <li>This thing has made doing my nails so much easier and a breeze!</li>
            <li>and it goes pretty fast..</li>
            <li>this drill is easy to use and I love that it has various speeds and it cost me less than one full acrylic set at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE MY NEW DRILL, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SOME PEOPLE</li>
            <li>everyone always wants me to do their refills or put on sets or do silk wraps so they can grow them out..</li>
            <li>I used it two times and it&#x27;s really a drill for the price</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Also, the drill cord seemed like it didn&#x27;t fit properly into the outlet not he machine.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have to much strength.  </li>
            <li>The sanding discs will go right through your natural nail, so</li>
            <li>Overall the quality and power of the machine itself is great the only let down are the drill bits that come with it</li>
            <li>does just what I need for my home-applied gel nails, files off the ends and top enough to apply new gel for the next 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I at first when I opened it thought well it looks a little cheap</li>
            <li>and you can change if you want it to spin right or left.  </li>
            <li>These are more for putting on the finishing touches or delicate work like the manicures for which they are intended.</li>
            <li>I have a salon and so far it&#x27;s working to my expectations</li>
            <li>Not only was the shipping fast</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive and professional nail drill machine, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING USE TO THIS BECAUSE ITS KINDA LIKE A PROFESSIONAL DRILL BUT</li>
            <li>I have tried other drills and they are not strong enough even though they state good for acrylic nails.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this drill for a little over a month now and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Most nail drills re just crazy ridiculously expensive except for the ones that are those little pen ones.  </li>
            <li> totally got brownie points for this purchase if ya know what I mean!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if that caused the product not to work.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is sometimes if i move the cord the wrong way, the drill will slow down almost to a stop.</li>
            <li> it has made it so so much easier for me and saves a crap load of time</li>
            <li> you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> got tired of paying $20 for a fill when all I needed was coverage around my nail bed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but it&#x27;s annoying if it does.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you&#x27;re comfortable with the manufacturer&#x27;s description, this is a great buy. I have several of these micromotor tools that I use to make jewelry and models. Some have cost many times what I paid for this one (under $20) and do not work any better. None will put out the torque of the type of rotary tool from a building supply or hardware store. These are more for putting on the finishing touches or delicate work like the manicures for which they are intended. Almost all of these types of machines take only tools with a single diameter shaft. Some lock the tool in place. This one uses friction to hold the tool in place. I don&#x27;t see this as a problem but some might want the security of a locked in tool. I&#x27;ve found that I can use the variable power supply for other tools or even other purposes. For someone who likes to tinker, the power supply alone is a good deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this drill! I&#x27;ve had this drill for a little over a month now and it works wonders. instead of going out every month and paying 40 to 50 dollars to get a full set of acrylic nails, I decided to get this and just do them at home. this drill is easy to use and I love that it has various speeds and it cost me less than one full acrylic set at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my nails spa it&#x27;s an excellent electric file. Very powerful. I&#x27;m buying another one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I wish it had more attachments.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> Overall the quality and power of the machine itself is great the only let down are the drill bits that come with it they have no use for me so I have to buy separate nails drill bits.</li>
            <li> I love this drill...  The adjustable speed is great and does a wonderful job on gel and acrylic nails.  I have tried other drills and they are not strong enough even though they state good for acrylic nails.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $30.00 and I am very happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> First I wanna say I got this in 2 days, Ordered on a Friday it shipped on Saturday and received on Monday. So super awesome shipping. It was packed well so no damage it it or the package. I at first when I opened it thought well it looks a little cheap but then I tried it and I love this thing it is amazing. By far the best nail drill I have purchased over the years of doing my own nails. You can apply pressure and it does not bog out like the cheapy you buy at Walmart. I will def buy from this company again. It may look cheap but it is a quality product. I give it 10 stars if I could. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Nice nail drill ! No complaints at all! Received all my item without damage , it took about 3 weeks! I recommend to buy! I recommend to buy!</li>
            <li> Does its job right, files like any other super expensive nail drill. I have a salon and so far it&#x27;s working to my expectations</li>
            <li> Love this product. got tired of paying $20 for a fill when all I needed was coverage around my nail bed. Decided to try this machine for use in between visits to the nail salon. I now fill my own nails and visit the nail salon every 2 months instead of twice a month and sometimes 3 times a month. Well worth the money and easy to operate. it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> This nail drill is great. Not only was the shipping fast but the product is exactly what you expect. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use when I received it. If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive and professional nail drill machine, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute nice little drill I&#x27;m really happy with it.  Its works really good and it was a great price.  Most nail drills re just crazy ridiculously expensive except for the ones that are those little pen ones.  But, his thing works way better than those.  I like how you can change the speed and it goes pretty fast.. and you can change if you want it to spin right or left.  I do my own silk wraps and acrylics and gel so its for personal use and friends and family im not  professional or anything but I do it ALOT..everyone always wants me to do their refills or put on sets or do silk wraps so they can grow them out..just all kinds of stuff...I was just always the family nail person and I really enjoy it but I don&#x27;t know how the heck I used to do it without this thing.  It would take me forever to file off the layers of gel in order  to make it easier to soak things off. or to even out acrylic...it used to suck..so I love his thing..it has made it so so much easier for me and saves a crap load of time so I do recommend to anyone who does a lot of different kinds of nails.</li>
            <li> Broke after one use!!! Stay away from this drill</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do my own gel polish at home. I was going through too many nail blocks then decided to buy a nail drill. This comes with some different attachments which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to spend money on them right away. My only complaint is sometimes if i move the cord the wrong way, the drill will slow down almost to a stop. It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but it&#x27;s annoying if it does.</li>
            <li> I love my drill it came on time I used it two times and it&#x27;s really a drill for the price and it has a lot of speed so good so far</li>
            <li> A very nice little pedicure set which is of excellent quality. Handy to use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find such a good deal on a nail drill, but this was too good to be true. I spent hours trying to turn it in. The instructions don&#x27;t even match up with the product. I tried researching other instructions or tips, but that was unsuccessful. In the reviews and FAQ&#x27;s, it seems like some other people had the same problem and suggested playing with the switches. After doing that for two hours I gave up. Haha I event tried putting it away and trying later on, but that didn&#x27;t work either. So disappointed!!! Also, the drill cord seemed like it didn&#x27;t fit properly into the outlet not he machine. Not sure if that caused the product not to work.</li>
            <li> This little gem doesn&#x27;t pretend to be a professional model. It rotates slowly enough not to rip through your skin on lower settings. The sanding discs will go right through your natural nail, so practice first.&lt;br /&gt;It does just what I need for my home-applied gel nails, files off the ends and top enough to apply new gel for the next 2 weeks. Saves me a lot of time with the hand-held file. Great price.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE MY NEW DRILL, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SOME PEOPLE I DON&#x27;T LIKE HOW IT TOLD ME THE COLOR WAS WHITE BUT WHEN I GET IT, ITS BLACK. ITS A REALLY NICE DRILL MY SISTER HAS ONE LIKE IT. I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING USE TO THIS BECAUSE ITS KINDA LIKE A PROFESSIONAL DRILL BUT ITS NOT</li>
            <li> Extremely nice and works just like it&#x27;s supposed to,  even after a year of regular use.</li>
            <li> I I got a black one instead of a white one and the brand was different too, which didn&#x27;t matter to me. But after about a year it is not working that great anymore. It has a lot less power now and I think it will be done soon.</li>
            <li> Got this machine for my daughter who loves to do nails it works well it&#x27;s a great product for the price</li>
            <li> This thing has made doing my nails so much easier and a breeze! Love that I can change the speeds and it was interchangeable with my pedicure bits I purchased too. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts awhile, but if it ever goes out will definitely get again</li>
            <li> Vents are right where you hold the drill</li>
            <li> my girlfriend said its (explicit) awesome! totally got brownie points for this purchase if ya know what I mean!! you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> This is probably a professional drill at its best. I know they say its not but it does the job as efficiently as the ones at the salon. I just started doing nails as my trade and this drill was cheap and had fast delivery!!! It came within a week and it took my &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; work to &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have to much strength.  I stops when I put pressure on the nail.  It&#x27;s OKAY for light filing.</li>
            <li> it came fast, and worked  at a level that acceptable for my acrylic work(i am a professional nail tech at a good level.) i would buy another one for my extra table.</li>
