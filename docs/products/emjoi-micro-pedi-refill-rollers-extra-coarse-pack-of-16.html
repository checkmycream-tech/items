            <li>Best value if you need replacement refills.  </li>
            <li>These are the best.</li>
            <li>Great price for refills.</li>
            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;INEXPENSIVE and fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>So many for a great price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these once since receiving them and my feet have never felt better nor have I had a &#x27;good job&#x27; on my feet from my doctor.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Divided them among 4 friends that have the Micro-Pedi, zero complaints here, just pretty feet and happy spa days.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, smooths the skin, and does not hurt when used properly!</li>
            <li>They are great for calluses, but I also use them to file down my nails.</li>
            <li>Once you get rid of the initial roughness they work fantastic!</li>
            <li>I got several grades of coarseness, yet have been able to use these regularly without an issue.  </li>
            <li>Brush off with an old toothbrush and extend usage.  </li>
            <li>They are just coarse enough to make removing the dried skin very easy.  </li>
            <li>I spent WAY TOO MUCH for the device itself to not buy the darn refills.</li>
            <li>This roller, along with the Dr. Scholls foot-trim razor (Walmart) is the only thing that keeps my heels soft and with not cracking.</li>

            <li> They work just like the ones that came with my wife&#x27;s unit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INEXPENSIVE and fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Work just as well as the brand name. They are not quite strong enough if you are using this for the first time and have very bad feet. Once you get rid of the initial roughness they work fantastic!</li>
