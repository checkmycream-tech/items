            <li>Love Amazon&#x27;s prices!</li>
            <li>Which being a gift, I would have liked it to be ( the cap was dented too).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it does have nice scent  and</li>
            <li>but it may be my own fault.  </li>
            <li>I liked the smell in the &#x27;70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>make excellent christmas gift for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Charlie continues to make a good gift despite being around for many years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice perfume and my mother in law like it.</li>
            <li>After I apply it, I can not smell it anymore but those who hug me say it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>still nice as it was 20 years ago</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, price is right, would buy from again. :)</li>
            <li>This is the best, not to strong, not to floral, just the right amount of fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>But I got it to give it as a surprise gift to my mom that liked it many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Charlie for many MANY years...</li>
            <li>Moms favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and the drugstore was selling it for close to $30.00.   </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected,1/2 of what you pay in the store.</li>
            <li>I get many many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that pleased</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy the Eau de Toilette vs the cologne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to hunt any more.</li>
            <li>she has liked Charlie almost her whole like smells good gets rid of Oder</li>
            <li>This is the same great product without paying retail prices!</li>
            <li>I wore this fragrance many years ago and thought I&#x27;d try it again.  </li>
            <li>Favorite perfume and the scents blend well.</li>
            <li>People with allergies to any typwe of fragrance will simply LOVE this...</li>
            <li>more can I say about it?  </li>
            <li>I love all Charlie products.</li>
            <li>Glad to find out they haven&#x27;t  </li>
            <li>I love my Charlie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>I have bought this many times as I run out, but this go around it</li>
            <li>I have worn Charlies perfume for more than 30 years and it still remains a favorite with me.  </li>
            <li>I had air fresheners that smelled better.</li>
            <li>Not the product I have used many moons ago.</li>
            <li>Delivery was outstanding though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; cologne for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>Charlie perfume by Revlon is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>AND ALL WHO RECEIVED THEM LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>love this fragrance</li>
            <li>My mom will love it.</li>
            <li>Mom used to love this</li>
            <li>but the scent is even better.</li>
            <li>I MUST HAVE MORE SOPHISTICATED TASTES</li>
            <li>Finally, a decent price for a great &amp; favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>It still is a nice smell but nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Bought this to give to friends but smell is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  </li>
            <li>but if your mother is in her 60s and might be interested in a good cologne this might work for her.</li>
            <li>I loved Charlie when it first came out</li>
            <li>The original Charlie scent, I have missed it!</li>
            <li>came early great deal</li>
            <li>/&gt;she loves it and was good price and fast to get here  on time  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance and this is a very affordable version.  </li>
            <li>It was a fast delievery and a good pice, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>nice and fun</li>
            <li>, I certainly didn&#x27;t love it, but again it was not purchased for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Myself it is strong scent and not my style</li>
            <li>If it were not so strong and lasted longer, I&#x27;d stick with it.</li>
            <li>Her sister says it&#x27;s a bit strong</li>
            <li>I was delighted with not only this product, but I am happy the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>And typically find the best buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Great came fast and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a huge bottle (100 mL).</li>
            <li>but it was dirt cheap, so</li>
            <li>That being said, I would recommend Charlie not only because I like it, but the price is great.</li>
            <li>and made with cheap quality</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li>My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li>Seller sent the item fast!!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell that last awhile on your body.  </li>
            <li>Generally the products that I choose is already Cuz Got A experience and recommend it to everyone because this French brand is of excellent quality and outstanding frangrancia.</li>
            <li>It most certainly is!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what the original Charlie smelled like</li>
            <li>, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not this is like the original.  </li>
            <li>Some suggested it was not the original Charlie scent some of us remembered.  </li>
            <li>s. This is the original scent.</li>
            <li>it is unique....</li>
            <li>Glad to find a large bottle of it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Charlie Blue and decided to buy it for myself for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Charlie since the late 70&#x27;s and have been told it smells wonderful on me - even by people I walk by in the store!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it is still manufactured and is so reasonably priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Most economical perfume that money can buy that both my wife and 13-year old girl love...</li>
            <li>Smells good but does not last</li>
            <li>I also ordrered the Charlie Red and that smells just as good.</li>
            <li>Good Fragrance, long standing &amp; sweet smell.   </li>
            <li>I have worn Charlie Blue for many , many , years.</li>
            <li>Quick Ship.</li>
            <li>THAT I&#x27;M OLDER:-)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance by far such a mysterious beautiful scent, I guarantee you will love, and wanna buy over and over again.</li>
            <li>Price was awesome from Amazon and shipping was free since I ordered several other items.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Wonder if there is some kind of standardized rating for the strength of the smell that potential buyers can rely on.</li>
            <li>this is the only kind my wife likes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently, if you look enough, you&#x27;ll still be able to purchase the original Charlie online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my signature scent, I guess, and I am very happy to find I can order it online, because the last few years I only seemed to be able to find it at Christmas in gift packs!  </li>
            <li>and it seems to make my big old cotton panties smell good, too.</li>
            <li>The perfume has a nice scent, but it fades so quickly that unless you wanted to carry the bottle around and reapply it periodically it&#x27;s just not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>What you see in the picture is exactly what I received.</li>
            <li>give it 3 stars because that&#x27;s the rating for OK (middle range)</li>
            <li>I knew Charlie perfume, I used many times and it was exactly the same as I remembered.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom for her birthday its higher at the store.</li>
            <li>this is the only type of perfume I am able to wear and it not &amp;#34;overtake&amp;#34; my sinus or anyone else&#x27;s through out the day.</li>
            <li>This was my first perfume</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a light cologne and is not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>Love the lasting fragrance - recommend it for fall and winter.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>My first time...</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS CHARLIE BLUE FOR WOMEN PERCHASE</li>
            <li>Just to make sure I have enough Charlies around.</li>
            <li>I have used original Charlie for many years and Charlie blue is the same as I remember, I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>i bought these to give away to some of my less fortunate relatives in my country and they seem to love the smell.</li>
            <li>It is indeed the same original Charlie that I had used eons ago!</li>
            <li>Charlie Blue not as good as the regular Charlie.  </li>
            <li>but I love the fragrance almost as much as the RED</li>
            <li>Charlie has been around for a long time and it will be my keeper for sure.</li>
            <li>smells good scent does not last long</li>
            <li>This bottle is large and it has lasted me for a while.</li>
            <li>still makes a good gift for my g freind  its not a new product but just same it still sold&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main thing I love about it is that it lasts and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>Blue\\&quot; but I can guarantee that what I ordered using the link below is the real thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The return service was fast (prepaid shipping label), and Amazon return personnel curtious, and helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li>Charlie Blue is one that I can wear and enjoy doing so.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Also, I find this cologne is very soothing to my mood.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like this one, won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li>I FOUND THE REAL THING!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smells delcious and its reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>I had used this quite sometime ago, I really had forgotten what it smelled like, but ordered this and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>In many countries other than US, this product is sold as unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li>CHARLIE BLUE cologne IS NOT the original Revlon Charlie cologne that was launched by Revlon in 1973.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve purchased it from AMAZON, you will NOT be able to return it, due to federal shipping regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wear this a lot for everyday and first got this when I was in Paris love it</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>long lasting I love it</li>
            <li>long lasting love it...</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like this very much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and the cologne arrived earlier than I thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong fragrance for my taste but long lasting</li>
            <li>I have used this product for most of my adult life (will soon be 75) and it is usually hard to find in the modern stores.</li>
            <li>aware the blue box is not wrapped in plastic wrapper!</li>
            <li>The cap and the quantity of fluid inside seemed intact ( the first one had a dented cap and perfume</li>
            <li>this was the first time I tried Charlie Blue</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE SCENT.I HAVE TRIED MANY VERY EXPENSIVE PERFUMES; BUT THIS ONE IS A WINNER FOR ME.</li>
            <li>CHARLIE BLUE EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY LASTS MUCH LONGER THAN MOST OTHER CHARLIE BLUE TYPES.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the classic Charlie fragrance from years back that still resonates today.&lt;br /&gt;Clean, classic, fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my favorite , but it was getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>I frequently get stopped in the street (by women as well as men) who ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>I really like Charlie Blue Cologne!</li>
            <li>but if you want to know it is overpowering and smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li>Surprising since it is not an expensive product.  </li>
            <li>If you buy CHARLIE BLUE expecting it to be the same as the original Charlie you&#x27;ve loved for many years, you will be very disappointed!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other colognes and perfumes throughout the years, including the most &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; and expensive..  </li>
            <li>No overpowering fragrance, just the same subtle lingering scent that I always liked.</li>
            <li>Charlie Classic is the only one I care for!</li>
            <li>This is not an original product, I think in English it&#x27;s called knock off (fake and filled with Alcohol.)</li>
            <li>Plus my husband&#x27;s Nautica Blue smelled like someone had substituted blue mouthwash for the real fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is not over-powering and it might not last as long as some more expensive colognes, but it has lasted me a long time and I enjoy the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I also did not want to spend a lot for something to wear on a near daily basis.</li>
            <li>I am a late 40&#x27;s age woman, so I was wanting something a little more grown-up without smelling like the old fashioned, old lady, baby powdery colognes.</li>
            <li>This perfue is delicate and sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one no long time ago, and the aroma is completely different!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love Amazon&#x27;s prices!</li>
            <li> Which being a gift, I would have liked it to be ( the cap was dented too).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does have nice scent  and</li>
            <li> but it may be my own fault.  </li>
            <li> I liked the smell in the &#x27;70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> make excellent christmas gift for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Charlie continues to make a good gift despite being around for many years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume and my mother in law like it.</li>
            <li> After I apply it, I can not smell it anymore but those who hug me say it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> still nice as it was 20 years ago</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, price is right, would buy from again. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best, not to strong, not to floral, just the right amount of fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> But I got it to give it as a surprise gift to my mom that liked it many years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Charlie for many MANY years...</li>
            <li> Moms favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the drugstore was selling it for close to $30.00.   </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected,1/2 of what you pay in the store.</li>
            <li> I get many many compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that pleased</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy the Eau de Toilette vs the cologne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to hunt any more.</li>
            <li> she has liked Charlie almost her whole like smells good gets rid of Oder</li>
            <li> This is the same great product without paying retail prices!</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance many years ago and thought I&#x27;d try it again.  </li>
            <li> Favorite perfume and the scents blend well.</li>
            <li> People with allergies to any typwe of fragrance will simply LOVE this...</li>
            <li> more can I say about it?  </li>
            <li> I love all Charlie products.</li>
            <li> Glad to find out they haven&#x27;t  </li>
            <li> I love my Charlie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> I have bought this many times as I run out, but this go around it</li>
            <li> I have worn Charlies perfume for more than 30 years and it still remains a favorite with me.  </li>
            <li> I had air fresheners that smelled better.</li>
            <li> Not the product I have used many moons ago.</li>
            <li> Delivery was outstanding though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; cologne for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> Charlie perfume by Revlon is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> AND ALL WHO RECEIVED THEM LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance</li>
            <li> My mom will love it.</li>
            <li> Mom used to love this</li>
            <li> but the scent is even better.</li>
            <li> I MUST HAVE MORE SOPHISTICATED TASTES</li>
            <li> Finally, a decent price for a great &amp; favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> It still is a nice smell but nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Bought this to give to friends but smell is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  </li>
            <li> but if your mother is in her 60s and might be interested in a good cologne this might work for her.</li>
            <li> I loved Charlie when it first came out</li>
            <li> The original Charlie scent, I have missed it!</li>
            <li> came early great deal</li>
            <li> /&gt;she loves it and was good price and fast to get here  on time  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance and this is a very affordable version.  </li>
            <li> It was a fast delievery and a good pice, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> nice and fun</li>
            <li> , I certainly didn&#x27;t love it, but again it was not purchased for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Myself it is strong scent and not my style</li>
            <li> If it were not so strong and lasted longer, I&#x27;d stick with it.</li>
            <li> Her sister says it&#x27;s a bit strong</li>
            <li> I was delighted with not only this product, but I am happy the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> And typically find the best buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Great came fast and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a huge bottle (100 mL).</li>
            <li> but it was dirt cheap, so</li>
            <li> That being said, I would recommend Charlie not only because I like it, but the price is great.</li>
            <li> and made with cheap quality</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li> Seller sent the item fast!!!  </li>
            <li> Very nice smell that last awhile on your body.  </li>
            <li> Generally the products that I choose is already Cuz Got A experience and recommend it to everyone because this French brand is of excellent quality and outstanding frangrancia.</li>
            <li> It most certainly is!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the original Charlie smelled like</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not this is like the original.  </li>
            <li> Some suggested it was not the original Charlie scent some of us remembered.  </li>
            <li> s. This is the original scent.</li>
            <li> it is unique....</li>
            <li> Glad to find a large bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Charlie Blue and decided to buy it for myself for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Charlie since the late 70&#x27;s and have been told it smells wonderful on me - even by people I walk by in the store!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it is still manufactured and is so reasonably priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Most economical perfume that money can buy that both my wife and 13-year old girl love...</li>
            <li> Smells good but does not last</li>
            <li> I also ordrered the Charlie Red and that smells just as good.</li>
            <li> Good Fragrance, long standing &amp; sweet smell.   </li>
            <li> I have worn Charlie Blue for many , many , years.</li>
            <li> Quick Ship.</li>
            <li> THAT I&#x27;M OLDER:-)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance by far such a mysterious beautiful scent, I guarantee you will love, and wanna buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> Price was awesome from Amazon and shipping was free since I ordered several other items.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Wonder if there is some kind of standardized rating for the strength of the smell that potential buyers can rely on.</li>
            <li> this is the only kind my wife likes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, if you look enough, you&#x27;ll still be able to purchase the original Charlie online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my signature scent, I guess, and I am very happy to find I can order it online, because the last few years I only seemed to be able to find it at Christmas in gift packs!  </li>
            <li> and it seems to make my big old cotton panties smell good, too.</li>
            <li> The perfume has a nice scent, but it fades so quickly that unless you wanted to carry the bottle around and reapply it periodically it&#x27;s just not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li> What you see in the picture is exactly what I received.</li>
            <li> give it 3 stars because that&#x27;s the rating for OK (middle range)</li>
            <li> I knew Charlie perfume, I used many times and it was exactly the same as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for her birthday its higher at the store.</li>
            <li> this is the only type of perfume I am able to wear and it not &amp;#34;overtake&amp;#34; my sinus or anyone else&#x27;s through out the day.</li>
            <li> This was my first perfume</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a light cologne and is not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Love the lasting fragrance - recommend it for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> My first time...</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CHARLIE BLUE FOR WOMEN PERCHASE</li>
            <li> Just to make sure I have enough Charlies around.</li>
            <li> I have used original Charlie for many years and Charlie blue is the same as I remember, I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> i bought these to give away to some of my less fortunate relatives in my country and they seem to love the smell.</li>
            <li> It is indeed the same original Charlie that I had used eons ago!</li>
            <li> Charlie Blue not as good as the regular Charlie.  </li>
            <li> but I love the fragrance almost as much as the RED</li>
            <li> Charlie has been around for a long time and it will be my keeper for sure.</li>
            <li> smells good scent does not last long</li>
            <li> This bottle is large and it has lasted me for a while.</li>
            <li> still makes a good gift for my g freind  its not a new product but just same it still sold&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main thing I love about it is that it lasts and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> Blue\\&quot; but I can guarantee that what I ordered using the link below is the real thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The return service was fast (prepaid shipping label), and Amazon return personnel curtious, and helpful.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> Charlie Blue is one that I can wear and enjoy doing so.</li>

            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> In many countries other than US, this product is sold as unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li> CHARLIE BLUE cologne IS NOT the original Revlon Charlie cologne that was launched by Revlon in 1973.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve purchased it from AMAZON, you will NOT be able to return it, due to federal shipping regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wear this a lot for everyday and first got this when I was in Paris love it</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> long lasting I love it</li>
            <li> long lasting love it...</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this very much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the cologne arrived earlier than I thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong fragrance for my taste but long lasting</li>
            <li> I have used this product for most of my adult life (will soon be 75) and it is usually hard to find in the modern stores.</li>
            <li> aware the blue box is not wrapped in plastic wrapper!</li>
            <li> The cap and the quantity of fluid inside seemed intact ( the first one had a dented cap and perfume</li>
            <li> this was the first time I tried Charlie Blue</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE SCENT.I HAVE TRIED MANY VERY EXPENSIVE PERFUMES; BUT THIS ONE IS A WINNER FOR ME.</li>
            <li> CHARLIE BLUE EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY LASTS MUCH LONGER THAN MOST OTHER CHARLIE BLUE TYPES.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the classic Charlie fragrance from years back that still resonates today.&lt;br /&gt;Clean, classic, fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my favorite , but it was getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I frequently get stopped in the street (by women as well as men) who ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li> I really like Charlie Blue Cologne!</li>
            <li> but if you want to know it is overpowering and smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Surprising since it is not an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> If you buy CHARLIE BLUE expecting it to be the same as the original Charlie you&#x27;ve loved for many years, you will be very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other colognes and perfumes throughout the years, including the most &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; and expensive..  </li>
            <li> No overpowering fragrance, just the same subtle lingering scent that I always liked.</li>
            <li> Charlie Classic is the only one I care for!</li>
            <li> This is not an original product, I think in English it&#x27;s called knock off (fake and filled with Alcohol.)</li>
            <li> Plus my husband&#x27;s Nautica Blue smelled like someone had substituted blue mouthwash for the real fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is not over-powering and it might not last as long as some more expensive colognes, but it has lasted me a long time and I enjoy the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I also did not want to spend a lot for something to wear on a near daily basis.</li>
            <li> I am a late 40&#x27;s age woman, so I was wanting something a little more grown-up without smelling like the old fashioned, old lady, baby powdery colognes.</li>
            <li> This perfue is delicate and sweet.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one no long time ago, and the aroma is completely different!</li>
            <li> But it also doesn&#x27;t cost near as much as other fragrances; we get what we pay for.  </li>
            <li> Does not last long, however.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to recreate a mood from long ago but this smells like a knock-off, almost over the hill.</li>
            <li> Remind about long time smell, shipping ontime</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume practically all my life, but it can be difficult to find the original in the retail settings in retail stores unless it is Christmas.</li>
            <li> Such a pity, as I was looking forward to it!</li>
            <li> I have worn Charlie for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is so difficult for me to be able to remain in a room with various kinds of perfumes and hard to purchase one that I can  use.</li>
            <li> In fact I found it rather unpleasant and doubt that I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Charlie Blue spray leaves a dark stain on your clothes after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this until the bottle is empty, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no thanks!  </li>
            <li> but I can see the contact seller option for all my other orders.</li>
            <li> The scent stays longer compared with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the difference is between &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Charlie Blue</li>
            <li> but it,s not.i don,t like it.may be some other like it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in local stores or even online.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it does not smell like the original Charlie.</li>
            <li> I am a little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes smell really awful on me for some unknown reason.</li>
            <li> seemed to be missing -</li>
            <li> Found it online, ordered it and it came within a few days.</li>
            <li> and I would pick it up from retail stores every year for Christmas, but haven&#x27;t found it for the past few years.</li>
            <li> so I have an affection for it, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is too subtle to be noticed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in my bottle, but it is not Charlie Blue. :(</li>
            <li> This is Very bad for a customer who like to buy things online with amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been wearing Charlie for many MANY years... it is my signature scent.  I have tried many other colognes and perfumes throughout the years, including the most &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; and expensive..  but no thanks!  I always came back to my Charlie, and now, don&#x27;t even think about buying anything else.  I now ONLY buy Charlie!  Everyone loves it on me and I love the compliments!  And typically find the best buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell but it was dirt cheap, so I decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> My mother has been wearing this for years. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this cologne. She is in her 60s and loves this stuff. Myself it is strong scent and not my style but if your mother is in her 60s and might be interested in a good cologne this might work for her.</li>
            <li> Nice odour, good price</li>
            <li> Moms favorite scent.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is exactly what you would expect. Excellent experience. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Well, nobody answered our question in the Discussion Forum so I took the bull by the horn and ordered the product anyway. It arrived well packed, wrapped in bubble wrap and sent via UPS. It is indeed the same original Charlie that I had used eons ago! The package says \\&quot;Charlie Blue\\&quot; but I can guarantee that what I ordered using the link below is the real thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Charlie-Revlon-Women-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000C21A7I/ref&#x3D;/ref&#x3D;cm_cd_f_pb_t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a huge bottle (100 mL). What you see in the picture is exactly what I received. It says \\&quot;Made in UK\\&quot; in the box and at the bottom of the bottle. It also has a phone number that you can call if you have any question about the product. (UK:Questions? Comments? Freephone 0800 085 2716)</li>
            <li> Excellent and perfect pricing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the drugstore was selling it for close to $30.00.   Price was awesome from Amazon and shipping was free since I ordered several other items.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this very much. I&#x27;ve been a Mugler Angel user for 6 yrs. But I got it to give it as a surprise gift to my mom that liked it many years ago. I have to admit, it brought up scent memory when I smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because that&#x27;s the rating for OK (middle range), I certainly didn&#x27;t love it, but again it was not purchased for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would like to say though is this:&lt;br /&gt;Be aware the blue box is not wrapped in plastic wrapper! Which being a gift, I would have liked it to be ( the cap was dented too). So I call Amazon, and get an RMA. The replacement comes without the wrapper too. I didn&#x27;t return it however. The cap and the quantity of fluid inside seemed intact ( the first one had a dented cap and perfume seemed to be missing - it looked used all the way). The return service was fast (prepaid shipping label), and Amazon return personnel curtious, and helpful. Very happy with how the shipments were handled.</li>
            <li> Sprayer stopped after 4 squirts.  Plus my husband&#x27;s Nautica Blue smelled like someone had substituted blue mouthwash for the real fragrance.  These items are not returnable through the mail.  From now on we&#x27;ll shop for non-returnable items like Health &amp; Beauty stuff at the local store.  What a jip! No wonder the stuff was priced to move.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, but very strong fragrance.  Does not last long, however.  But it also doesn&#x27;t cost near as much as other fragrances; we get what we pay for.  Will continue to use this until the bottle is empty, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the original Charlie smelled like, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not this is like the original.  But I do find the scent pleasant.  If it were not so strong and lasted longer, I&#x27;d stick with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for the second time here in Amazon. The first one, like 2 years ago, was great! I knew Charlie perfume, I used many times and it was exactly the same as I remembered. I bought a second one no long time ago, and the aroma is completely different! I am a little dissapointed. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it does not smell like the original Charlie. What did you change it???</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife.  She loves it and so do I!  Charlie has a great fragrance that we both like.</li>
            <li> Great Value! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Charlie Blue for 35 years.  I love it.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Thanks for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume!!!!  Seller sent the item fast!!!  I look forward to working with them again!!!!</li>
            <li> still makes a good gift for my g freind  its not a new product but just same it still sold&lt;br /&gt;she loves it and was good price and fast to get here  on time  well packed&lt;br /&gt;it does have nice scent  and where both happy with product and seeler was real good--</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my wife for 37 years. She still requests it on her birthday.</li>
            <li> Good Fragrance, long standing &amp; sweet smell.   In many countries other than US, this product is sold as unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not an original product, I think in English it&#x27;s called knock off (fake and filled with Alcohol.)</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for her birthday its higher at the store. I recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> More than I expected,1/2 of what you pay in the store.My mom loved it</li>
            <li> came early great deal</li>
            <li> I bought that for my wife for Christmas. Her sister says it&#x27;s a bit strong but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I like the Charlie perfume products. The price for the product was lower than the retail stores with a comparable selection. Item shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for over 20 years....I get many many compliments. This is the best, not to strong, not to floral, just the right amount of fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> this is the only type of perfume I am able to wear and it not &amp;#34;overtake&amp;#34; my sinus or anyone else&#x27;s through out the day.</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments when I wear Charlie!  Surprising since it is not an expensive product.  Always have it on my dressing table!</li>
            <li> I grew up with this scent. long lasting I love it</li>
            <li> OMGosh I smell deliteful now that I&#x27;m a Charlie Girl again.  Will purchase over and over again</li>
            <li> Most perfumes smell really awful on me for some unknown reason. And that is the reason that I seldom wear any perfume. Charlie Blue is one that I can wear and enjoy doing so. The smell is perfect for me and does not annoy or make me sneeze. I only put on just a tiny bit because I do not want to overwhelm anybody. I like to put the perfume bottle in my underwear drawer and it seems to make my big old cotton panties smell good, too. Charlie has been around for a long time and it will be my keeper for sure. I like it a lot and appreciate the fact that I can wear it without smelling like a skunk.</li>
            <li> I wore Charlie years ago and decided to try it again. I still like the scent. Perfume and cologne are personal and smell different on different people.  That being said, I would recommend Charlie not only because I like it, but the price is great.</li>
            <li> Smells as it always has.  Glad to find a large bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Charlie Blue and decided to buy it for myself for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that pleased but it may be my own fault.  I thought I was getting what I got before and did not know that Charlie Blue is different than Charlie.  It came on time though and was in good condition.  I&#x27;ll use it up and get the stuff I like next time.</li>
            <li> Wife has worn it for years.  Be sure to buy the Eau de Toilette vs the cologne. The fragrance lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I have worn Charlie Blue for many , many , years. It is my favorite , but it was getting hard to find. Thanks to Amazon I don&#x27;t have to hunt any more.</li>
            <li> Great scent for the price. i bought these to give away to some of my less fortunate relatives in my country and they seem to love the smell. They actually told me to get this for them.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order and the timing was great.  Ola C</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Charlie since the late 70&#x27;s and have been told it smells wonderful on me - even by people I walk by in the store!  It&#x27;s my signature scent, I guess, and I am very happy to find I can order it online, because the last few years I only seemed to be able to find it at Christmas in gift packs!  Perfumes smell differently on different people.  For me, this one smells great and Always has!</li>
            <li> Very nice gift and she likes it</li>
            <li> I frequently get stopped in the street (by women as well as men) who ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s my perfect perfume.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes.  The main thing I love about it is that it lasts and lasts all day long.  I&#x27;ve loved Charlie ever since my teens and I&#x27;m well into my 40&#x27;s at this point.  This was my first perfume so I have an affection for it, to say the least.  I&#x27;m glad it is still manufactured and is so reasonably priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for mom for her birthday she has liked Charlie almost her whole like smells good gets rid of Oder a lot too thank you merry Christmas melissa</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this item on your site.  I have used this product for most of my adult life (will soon be 75) and it is usually hard to find in the modern stores.</li>
            <li> As always ...good price...same product...in perfect condition...</li>
            <li> Charlie Blue not as good as the regular Charlie.  Charlie Blue spray leaves a dark stain on your clothes after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Bought this to give to friends but smell is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  Bottle  and cap is not so great. and made with cheap quality meterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not allowing to contact seller for this product as that option is not showing for this order. but I can see the contact seller option for all my other orders. This is Very bad for a customer who like to buy things online with amazon.</li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the user ratings. The fragrance is too subtle to be noticed. Wonder if there is some kind of standardized rating for the strength of the smell that potential buyers can rely on.</li>
            <li> Finally, a decent price for a great &amp; favorite cologne. I have used Charlie for over 50 years. I was delighted with not only this product, but I am happy the cost was reasonable. Shipping was very fast and the cologne arrived earlier than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;This is a light cologne and is not a heavy scent. Also, I find this cologne is very soothing to my mood.</li>
            <li> long lasting love it...</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume practically all my life, but it can be difficult to find the original in the retail settings in retail stores unless it is Christmas. This is the same great product without paying retail prices!</li>
            <li> I ordered Charlie for Women. Your picture of the product shows Charlie for Women.&lt;br /&gt;The product I received was Charlie Blue, which is an entirely different scent. You need&lt;br /&gt;to insure that what you picture is correct. The supplier that mailed me the perfume&lt;br /&gt;said you (Amazon) did not have the correct product. I have returned the order.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance many years ago and thought I&#x27;d try it again.  There seemed to be some confusion in the reviews regarding the \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; designation.  Some suggested it was not the original Charlie scent some of us remembered.  It most certainly is! When my shipment arrived, although the external packaging was undamaged, somehow 1/4 of the cologne had leaked out soaking the Charlie box and packing materials.  Within three minutes of reporting the damage to Amazon I received an e-mail response from Customer Service expressing regret for the damage.  They told me NOT to return the damaged shipment, assuring me a replacement would be on its way immediately.  Hours later, I received notification it had shipped.  That, coupled with the excellent price of the item itself, (a fraction of the drugstore price) made this an OUTSTANDING Amazon transaction! Love the lasting fragrance - recommend it for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> smells good scent does not last long</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom and she says it&#x27;s not the same Charlie Blue that she bought years ago. She doesn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Generally the products that I choose is already Cuz Got A experience and recommend it to everyone because this French brand is of excellent quality and outstanding frangrancia.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a decent price. I liked the smell in the &#x27;70&#x27;s and I still like it. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this one, won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> The scent stays longer compared with my other perfumes.Favorite perfume and the scents blend well.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Item arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.Very good price. BIG hug from my girl!</li>
            <li> People with allergies to any typwe of fragrance will simply LOVE this...Great for allergies...Sometimes it is so difficult for me to be able to remain in a room with various kinds of perfumes and hard to purchase one that I can  use. This perfue is delicate and sweet.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to recreate a mood from long ago but this smells like a knock-off, almost over the hill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say about it?  It&#x27;s Charlie.</li>
            <li> I love all Charlie products. this was the first time I tried Charlie Blue but I love the fragrance almost as much as the RED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Charlie for years and thought they&#x27;d quit making it.  Glad to find out they haven&#x27;t  No overpowering fragrance, just the same subtle lingering scent that I always liked.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance by far such a mysterious beautiful scent, I guarantee you will love, and wanna buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> I love my Charlie. I have been wearing it for years. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Most economical perfume that money can buy that both my wife and 13-year old girl love...</li>
            <li> CHARLIE BLUE cologne IS NOT the original Revlon Charlie cologne that was launched by Revlon in 1973. If you buy CHARLIE BLUE expecting it to be the same as the original Charlie you&#x27;ve loved for many years, you will be very disappointed! DO NOT buy CHARIE BLUE. Once you&#x27;ve purchased it from AMAZON, you will NOT be able to return it, due to federal shipping regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, if you look enough, you&#x27;ll still be able to purchase the original Charlie online. Look at the picture of the bottle - the writing is white, and it does NOT say BLUE on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I may I use as a room spray or bath room spray</li>
            <li> CHARLIE BLUE EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY LASTS MUCH LONGER THAN MOST OTHER CHARLIE BLUE TYPES. THIS IS MY FAVORITE SCENT.I HAVE TRIED MANY VERY EXPENSIVE PERFUMES; BUT THIS ONE IS A WINNER FOR ME. SOME SELLERS ADVERTISE AS CHARLIE BLUE;HOWEVER, UNLESS THE WRITING ON THE BOTTLE IS IN BLUE IT IS NOT CHARLIE BLUE AT ALL. GLAD I FOUND THE REAL THING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent purchase and my comment &amp;#34;Wonderful fragrance that I love!&amp;#34; Thank you Seller. Kathy</li>
            <li> I have bought this many times as I run out, but this go around it just wasn&#x27;t the same. It doesn&#x27;t even smell the same as what I last had. I don&#x27;t know what is in my bottle, but it is not Charlie Blue. :(</li>
            <li> My first time...using this product, but I can say is so,so....</li>
            <li> make excellent christmas gift for a reasonable price.  Charlie continues to make a good gift despite being around for many years.</li>
            <li> Remind about long time smell, shipping ontime</li>
            <li> Yuckkkkkkk I don&#x27;t know why this has so many good reviews. It smells like cheap aftershave. Doesn&#x27;t match description at all</li>
            <li> I have worn Charlie for a very long time.  I have a hard time finding it in local stores or even online.  I loved finding it here.  I always get compliments about my perfume.</li>
            <li> The perfume has a nice scent, but it fades so quickly that unless you wanted to carry the bottle around and reapply it periodically it&#x27;s just not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance and this is a very affordable version.  The price was really great and both the shipping and packaging were excellent.  I would/will refer our family and friends to buy similar items from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. On time arrival.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! Not sure what the difference is between &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Charlie Blue but I like this one just as well as the &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, price is right, would buy from again. :)</li>
            <li> I have worn Charlies perfume for more than 30 years and it still remains a favorite with me.  I still get asked about the scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think  of a time that I have had this on and someone did not compliment me. It is not over-powering and it might not last as long as some more expensive colognes, but it has lasted me a long time and I enjoy the way it smells. I am a late 40&#x27;s age woman, so I was wanting something a little more grown-up without smelling like the old fashioned, old lady, baby powdery colognes. I also did not want to spend a lot for something to wear on a near daily basis. This bottle is large and it has lasted me for a while. Just a squirt or two after the shower and I am set for my day to begin.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume still do. Thank You  Would order again. Will soon introduce my daughter to this fragrance and order her one.</li>
            <li> I had air fresheners that smelled better. Not the product I have used many moons ago. Delivery was outstanding though.</li>
            <li> This smells delcious and its reasonable too.  It was a fast delievery and a good pice, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Wear this a lot for everyday and first got this when I was in Paris love it and I get it alot</li>
            <li> Strong fragrance for my taste but long lasting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Charlie&amp;#34; cologne for years and love it.  I just wish it were easier to locate when I&#x27;m in need of it.</li>
            <li> nice and fun My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Charlie (Blue) since it came out in the 1970 &#x27;s. This is the original scent. This is a great buy. Love Amazon&#x27;s prices!</li>
            <li> I really like Charlie Blue Cologne! I had used this quite sometime ago, I really had forgotten what it smelled like, but ordered this and&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. Not too overwhelming, very good!</li>
            <li> Smells good but does not last</li>
            <li> I thought it will be a good smell but it,s not.i don,t like it.may be some other like it. every one have his on choise</li>

            <li> Mother loves the Charlie blue.</li>
            <li> Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances and I am so glad to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Charlie perfume by Revlon is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  I see to it that she is never without this great smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this &#x27;Charlie&#x27; was not the scent that I remember. In fact I found it rather unpleasant and doubt that I will be able to use it. Such a pity, as I was looking forward to it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;Charlie Blue&amp;#34; because posted it smelled identical to the &amp;#34;Charlie Original&amp;#34;, BUT IT DOES NOT..  It still is a nice smell but nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> Mom loves it!  Quick Ship.</li>

            <li> Mom used to love this and I would pick it up from retail stores every year for Christmas, but haven&#x27;t found it for the past few years. Found it online, ordered it and it came within a few days. Mom loves it and it was a steal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this with out knowing what it smells like but if you want to know it is overpowering and smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Charlie is my fragrance.  After I apply it, I can not smell it anymore but those who hug me say it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> For the value, I will buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> still nice as it was 20 years ago</li>
            <li> I love cologne and this one is great. I thought the price was great but the scent is even better. Its a must have.</li>

            <li> NOT AS WONDERFUL AS I REMEMBERED.  I MUST HAVE MORE SOPHISTICATED TASTES NOW THAT I&#x27;M OLDER:-)</li>
            <li> I loved Charlie when it first came out and I still do.  I bought 2 bottles; one red and one blue.  Just to make sure I have enough Charlies around.</li>
            <li> I have used original Charlie for many years and Charlie blue is the same as I remember, I am not disappointed. It was here in a couple days, much earlier than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Charlie Classic is the only one I care for!</li>
