            <li>Exactly what I wanted and received, I had not been able to find this color which I love anywhere, to be safe</li>
            <li>My mother really liked it, and I really like it, too!</li>
            <li>it was a quick delivery thank you!</li>
            <li>This was a discontinued item that I thought was no longer available.</li>
            <li>This Cover Girl shade has special meaning for me.  </li>
            <li>wore this in high school and will be wearing it as an old lady love love love it</li>

            <li>Since it&#x27;s a challenge buying most anything from a photo, especially a lip shade, I was surprised it blended well with certain items in my wardrobe.</li>

            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem to stock much CoverGirl lipstick at the stores near me.  </li>
            <li>This is a first-rate lipstick; a creamy, slightly frosty, longlasting true color.  </li>
            <li>so I have found that Amazon is the only place I can get and not get ripped off by the high prices of a discontinued item.  </li>
            <li>I needed this color to round out my pink love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that Cover Girl decided to discontinue Pick-Me-Up-Pink, as I&#x27;ve used it for years and have always been happy with it.</li>

This color is my very favorite color so I have found that Amazon is the only place I can get and not get ripped off by the high prices of a discontinued item.

            <li> Thank goodness I can still find this color.  CoverGirl has the best lipstick.  I tried L&#x27;Oreal and it is so sticky and waxy.  Yuck.  This one is almost like a lip stain so even if you eat a meal, you still have some nice color on your lips when you are finished that can last you all day.  I wish I could still find this locally but they don&#x27;t seem to stock much CoverGirl lipstick at the stores near me.  This is my favorite brand and color.</li>
