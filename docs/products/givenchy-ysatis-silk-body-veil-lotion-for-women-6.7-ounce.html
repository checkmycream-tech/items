            <li> I was so thrilled to find my favorite scent. I started using this scent in the 80&#x27;s and became disappointed when I was unable to buy it at the large department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for having one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> You can no longer get this product in department stores. I only found it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com.  I was excited when I found this body veil and ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly and was happy with the transaction and convenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years and I still love it.  It&#x27;s a very feminine scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is such a delightful perfume, makes you feel good and gets you lots of compliments.  Works for me</li>
            <li> Love the scent after it&#x27;s been on awhile.  A bit strong at first (heavy), but fades to a great scent.  Just remember to use a light touch when using it......Maybe cut it with an unscented lotion.</li>
            <li> i was thrilled to finally be able to find the lotion for my favorite perfume.  Every local retailer has stopped selling it!!</li>
            <li> The quantity was more than I expected for the money. This is a great fragrance and I will enjoy it for some time. It is lasting but not not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!  Great price!  Super fast shipping! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and still smells good at the end of the day - I even use it for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 20 years and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who is 90 years young. She thought it was discontinued so she was THRILLED!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents - very nice and silky feeling when applied to skin. I&#x27;ve used the perfume for years and am very happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Been using this Body Veil for close to thirty years. Hard to find and works great when the weather is warm. Saves you the expense of the perfume by using this silky veil.</li>
            <li> Just hope they don&#x27;t stop making this scent available.  It is so hard to get right now but, as usual, Amazon comes through!</li>
            <li> Ysatis is my favorite fragrance--I like to use this after a  shower for skin and it helps to layer the scent.</li>
