            <li> this product is great for sun burn  workd well using aloe vera gel first then applying aloe vera lotion on top  used twice a day and did not peel</li>
            <li> Great for after sun bathing...it keeps the skin from burning until I bathe and apply aloe vera plus oil...thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the second large container of lotion... I love the clean smell... Moisturizing the skin like no other... And the speed of delivery is a bonus</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of skin lotion and have found this to be the best.  I am on my third 20 oz bottle and use it pretty much daily.  I have dry skin and this goes on without leaving a film.  It has a slightly pleasant odor and absorbs quickly into my skin.  It does not clog pores and keeps my skin soft, while not causing me to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to replace the squeeze cap with a spare pump cap that I have and then to get last out of the bottle I store it inverted.  I have noticed that if I apply it to wet skin it can get a bit \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, it&#x27;s fresh and clean. It&#x27;s light but hydrating, soothing, and cooling. My favorite body lotion in the spring and summer. It also leaves a slightly sweet taste to skin.  I think that&#x27;s an added benefit if you find yourself in certain situations ;)</li>
            <li> Works very well on my sensitive skin. Even has made sunburn go away if I apply cream generously before and after exposure.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for this Ole Stand By Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked for my husband to help take the sting out of sunburns too.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera is a very good lotion to take with us to the beach too. ☺</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. I keep it in the fridge to keep it cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but I don&#x27;t like the odor of the product.  Maybe you can making odorless.  This product is good and I have recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed the aloe vera.  I went back to using another product when this did not help but, my skin is softer though not healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/08/2013 update:  I am now using this lotion as a hand cream for my chapped hands and I must say the lotion is working very well for that.  Plus... it has a very pleasing aroma. My hands were so chapped they were turning red and sore. The lotion has cured that condition so, I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Love Love love it!!!  Ahhhhhh the smell!!!  Thank you!!  :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of filler and fragrances that can really aggravate the skin. It is the only lotion I&#x27;ll use on my face. I have to find it on Amazon because no local store even carries it anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this lotiion in the summer and winder. It&#x27;s great on sun burn. I use it after a shower and it really is soothing. I like the smoothness of this lotion.</li>
            <li> The best lotion EVER!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. The only lotion that list aloe vera as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> as a auto tech this is the best ive found for my dry hands and i will continue to use it</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I have bought in the past 25 years.  It is absolutely the best.  I  have been complemented on my skin over and over again and I am convinced it&#x27;s because of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This is IT.  Why you cannot find it in stores anymore is beyond me.  It is better than any other cream I have ever tried, period.  I would actually allow them to write my name on the bottle as a reference, that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both like this product a lot - very nice for dry skin, nice smell, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing ... quality product that is often hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> i  have very dry skin and this works great for me. I recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fruit of the Earth body lotions for years, since I started to have dry skin - year round. Love love LOVE how it feels and how it goes on. On my body/skin, it&#x27;s does NOT feel greasy, sticky, tacky, or drying. It feels smooth, soft and the scent is not over-wheling. Stays on all day, treats my dry skin and so much better than the most popular brands out on the market that are over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/11/13 Update. FYI, SOME sellers on Amazon are asking double the price for a 20oz bottle, DO NOT get fooled and over pay for this brand as it is NOT an expensive brand. The formula is just right and most of ingredients are natural/pure. Also, everyone skin is different, so what works for some MAY NOT work for others. I just LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for dry skin and works very well for sunburn and scrapes also. All the Fruit of the Earth products are excellent and I use them and trust them.</li>
            <li> Greasy. Dont stay on your hand for a long time,</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  It is very soothing and not at all watery or greasy.  The mead ingredient is aloe vera extract not water or any petroleum product.  I use it all over.</li>
            <li> Pros: Price, Good for Sun Burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t think of any...may cause cancer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this to help re-hydrate skin after working in sun for several hours a day. Works great to lessen affects of a sun burn.</li>
            <li> I had already been using this specific lotion . It is awesome! It is a healthy lotion and it makes your skin soft and supple but you don&#x27;t need very much. The cost for the size of the bottles was a very good deal. It was delivered very quickly and in excellent condition.  I  am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife is responsible for purchasing this product. she swears by it.  for rough dry skin it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> very soothing. i will enjoy this every time i use it. thanks</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years. When we moved we were unable to get from the pharmacy in our old neighborhood. So now ordering online. This stuff leaves your skin feeling smooth throughout the day and he its a decent scent.</li>
            <li> Recommended By my Sister. Cools skin nicely.</li>
            <li> We love the lotion, and the fragrance is just a &amp;#34;clean smell&amp;#34;. Everything we wanted for dry skin.We ordered three containers and they arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> My husband found this brand by accident while traveling. He purchase a 4 oz. bottle so he could bring it home on the plane. Our hands get very dry in the Winter and mine crack and bleed. This cream works wonders and you only need a dime size amount. Once applied and worked in it is not greasy at all. My only minor &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that it smells faintly of suntan lotion. It is not offensive at all but I prefer unscented lotions. My hands completely cleared up within 2 days of regular use. I immediately purchased the 20 ounce bottle. Works much better and faster than the expensive name brand I previously used. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product.  I have many allergies and this lotion works wonders for me.  I was only able to buy it at K-Mart in the small travel size until I found them on the web.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Really great light weight lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t too perfume-y. Of course, shortly after i ordered it here I found a smaller bottle of it at the Family Dollar...</li>
            <li> I love the light, clean scent of this lotion.  It&#x27;s very hydrating, and makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this product after every hand washing it is the best. It makes your skin a lasting soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well, tried to find this in stores but it is not around any more in the St. Louis area.</li>
