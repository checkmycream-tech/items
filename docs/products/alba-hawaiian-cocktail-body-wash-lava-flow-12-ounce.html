            <li>LOVE this stiff!</li>

            <li> Good smell and smooth skin. My wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I like that the scrubbies are actually loofa bits. But personally I did not care for the smell. Lathers just ok.</li>

            <li> Smells great. I like it.</li>
            <li> Found this at Target and fell in love..then couldn&#x27;t find it again.  I have ordered 3 and will continue to order it from Amazon as I run out.  I have tried tons of scented body washes and tons of organic/more natural body washes as well and this one is the most amazing.  Even my husband (a soap man) loves this.</li>
            <li> Really great for the skin! Everyone must have this body wash</li>
            <li> I liked this product ok.  It has a tropical smell similar to tropical flavored koolaid.  It has tiny little lava granules for exfoliating.  It was a bit pricey for the result.  It is also advertised as sulfate free, but it has sulfates as the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING! You will think you have died and gone to heaven! It&#x27;s the consistency of a sugar scrub, not harsh at all, could use it everyday without irritation. Leaves you GLOWING! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Even better it&#x27;s all natural, no harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Smells great, it was on time, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out with it, even in Nebraska winters.</li>
            <li> I love love love alba products! Fantastic! And arrived very fast :)) money well spent. Smell great and was everything I expected. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s pretend this is a mini hawaiian vacation in a bottle. I know a stretch. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells AMAZING. The scrubby things in it exfoliate well. Used on a poof this little bottle lasts forever. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.  It smells cheap.  Sorry I ordered this.</li>

            <li> I love this body wash. I used Pacifica body wash for a long time, which is great, but I am so happy to make the switch over to Alba! This stuff smells like candy and is a wonderful body wash. It has little beads in it to really slough off dead skin. I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
