            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for years and LOVED the silver can version; I gave that 5 stars.  </li>

            <li>I use just a real light misting of this on my hair to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to love this product as I saw it recommended on a YouTube beauty guru, however, I think that it might work great for Asian/course hair but for my medium to fine textured hair</li>
            <li>Great hair spray wax, delivered quickly</li>

            <li>love this</li>
            <li>One of my favorite hair products ever.</li>
            <li>Really helps to manage fly away hair.</li>
            <li>I guess it was put in the Style Sexy Hair line to appeal more to men.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that I can spray and not goop up my hands with product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure not to over spray</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this spray wax.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to give my hair more texture and hold.</li>
            <li>but this is mostly because it makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This gives me more body than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;  and chnges the texture to easy to manage while allowing me to shampoo</li>
            <li>Dry Wax is awesome, ordering again.</li>
            <li>My hair still feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products, I use it as a finishing products,  after spraying lightly</li>
            <li>package arrived in excellent condition sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Great product arrived when it said it would and is great with my new short hair cut</li>
            <li>The spray washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is such a fun product to do that with... and it smells great!</li>
            <li>It is very humid in Georgia, and once I got outside in the humidity with this product in, my hair went to the semi-crunchy state, but it still looked pretty good, the hold was awesome.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and holds well for our fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
            <li>If you have fine unruly hair this is a must.</li>
            <li>I style it in beachy waves, tussle it a bit, then lightly spritz this all over my hair.</li>
            <li>I always finish with a light dose of hairspray.</li>
            <li>So this will last me quite a while which is always good :)</li>
            <li>Yep...this is the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for short, short hair.  </li>
            <li>Quick bursts about 8 inches away from my hair.</li>
            <li>loved the dry wax spray.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it works for short fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of volume and style-ability.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product for anyone with short limp, fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I have a short shag, and this is the best product for creating a tussled, piecy look that stays in place without being stiff or crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair, calms my frizz and adds controls.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it makes the texture in my haircut look awesome.</li>
            <li>crunchy is not the exact word</li>
            <li>If they ever quit making this product, I will go nuts! ; )</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient shipping though !  </li>
            <li>The product works great at first, but then it fades and doesn&#x27;t last as long as needed.  </li>
            <li>California Hair Play Dry Wax better.</li>
            <li>The wax comes out so much easier with this product.</li>
            <li>Very moldable hold.</li>
            <li>but use very sparingly or your hair will feel very greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>and I apply just as much.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much otherwise</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and spunky, but not greasy; very Rock Star.</li>
            <li>I really like the stuff.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if you use too much your hair will appear greasy and lifeless.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have short thin hair that most days has a mind of its own.  </li>
            <li>It DID make my hair feel a little more.....</li>
            <li>But the product in the black can is very different and not for the better!  </li>
            <li>I really like this, so far.</li>
            <li>We have used this for years and live it.</li>
            <li>It holds for about an hour, but then my hair just feels the same as when it&#x27;s greasy and hasn&#x27;t been washed in a day or two which isn&#x27;t exactly the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little and it&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now!</li>
            <li>Perhaps I got old product, because I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would buy it if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like that.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the old product.  </li>
            <li>I used the Short Sexy Hair Play Dirty spray wax (yellow cap) for years (loved how it gave my short hair</li>
            <li>I have a short, pixie-style haircut that I love to spike up and make messy.</li>
            <li>I have fine short, spikey hair and the previous product in the silver can did the job and held my spikes in place forever.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried to use this a few times and it might just be my hair texture, but this leaves it feeling really sticky and looking pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>A can lasts me a long time as you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li>but it is always hard to get body because it is so fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into really spiky or extreme coiffures</li>
            <li>Not very good, other products work better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not into really spiky or extreme coiffures</li>
            <li> Not very good, other products work better.</li>
            <li> like I never applied it and my hair goes flat;</li>
            <li> It looks better 3 days after shampooing, but PLAY DIRTY gives me the same look immediately after washing!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff for getting those broken shorter hairs from sticking up without feeling oily or stiff.</li>
            <li> When I use my sexy hair play dirty  </li>
            <li> I like that your hair holds all day and it doesn&#x27;t make it look wet or waxy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or doesn&#x27;t have a gross feel.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair and made it very flat</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> my flat hair is flat no more!</li>
            <li> And after a few hours my hair is really dry</li>
            <li> This does the trick without weighing my hair down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and this seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> But the product inside must have changed when they changed the packaging to a black can,</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my thick hair</li>
            <li> It also adds a little shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it does help a little and does make my hair easier to shape and reshape</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of dirty dry to manage thin hair.</li>
            <li> I find even if I spray a little too much, it dries and doesn&#x27;t feel dirty.</li>
            <li> keep my hair in order feeling fluffy but controlled,</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I found this I was hoping it was the same as the Play Dirty dry wax I used before...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using less so as not to make it look greasy, but then it hardly holds anything.</li>
            <li> no more spikes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up,</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really disappointed with the new product in the black can.</li>
            <li> cause now it hardly holds my hair</li>

            <li> I love this spray. I have a short shag, and this is the best product for creating a tussled, piecy look that stays in place without being stiff or crunchy. The fragrance is kind of sweet and pleasant. The spray washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and while they work well, they smell awful. Sort of a rancid smell. Perhaps I got old product, because I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would buy it if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like that. I used to use Paul Mitchell which smelled GREAT.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pumps my hair up. I have very straight hair, calms my frizz and adds controls. Totally happy.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of volume and style-ability.  I&#x27;m not into really spiky or extreme coiffures but I do like to have lift and volume, so I can achieve the &#x27;tousled&#x27; look.  This does the trick without weighing my hair down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> great  product.  love this</li>
            <li> Great product compares to Paul Mitchell spray wax. The wax comes out so much easier with this product.</li>
            <li> Dry Wax is awesome, ordering again.</li>
            <li> Daughter was very happy with this spray!</li>
            <li> I like that your hair holds all day and it doesn&#x27;t make it look wet or waxy.The smell is lovely!</li>
            <li> Lightweight and holds well for our fine hair. We have used this for years and live it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair products ever. Really helps to manage fly away hair. Makes styling easier.</li>
            <li> I used the Short Sexy Hair Play Dirty spray wax (yellow cap) for years (loved how it gave my short hair the piecey look), then it was replaced by a Texturizing Hairspray. I&#x27;ve been using that product, but have never been happy with it.  It weighs my hair down.  When I found this I was hoping it was the same as the Play Dirty dry wax I used before... and it is!! I guess it was put in the Style Sexy Hair line to appeal more to men. It is a great product for anyone with short limp, fine hair!  So happy to have found it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this, so far. It has a good smell and I love the fact that I can spray and not goop up my hands with product. The reason I say &amp;#34;so far&amp;#34; is because I&#x27;ve just started using it today and I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll hold up thru my work day. But I will update and let you know!</li>
            <li> The hold on this product is excellent. It is easy to use. It DID make my hair feel a little more..... crunchy is not the exact word but it is the closest I can come. It is very humid in Georgia, and once I got outside in the humidity with this product in, my hair went to the semi-crunchy state, but it still looked pretty good, the hold was awesome.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is it makes my hair feel and look thicker. With our humidity my hair will lose it&#x27;s curl by the time I get to work but I still have body and thicknest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I like KMS California Hair Play Dry Wax better. This is a little heavy. My hair is thinning and this seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my pixie haircut.  Very moldable hold.</li>
            <li> loved the dry wax spray. cheaper than my hairdresser wanted me to pay and just as good as paul Mitchell stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair manageable with a shiny glow. I have fine, wavy hair and this helps me get it looking the way I want. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It smells amazing, kinda like coconuts. It&#x27;s a spray wax so there no making my hands all waxy . A little goes a long way and it makes the texture in my haircut look awesome. Just make sure not to over spray cuz then your hair can look dirty , hence the name.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Great product but use very sparingly or your hair will feel very greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> If you have fine unruly hair this is a must.</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair that most days has a mind of its own.  When I use my sexy hair play dirty  I have volume and and my hair stays in place.  I know that I will order this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair and made it very flat</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray wax. It only takes a little and it&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now! If they ever quit making this product, I will go nuts! ; )</li>
            <li> To me, it just seems like an overpriced hairspray.  :(  Doesn&#x27;t do much for me. Fast and efficient shipping though !  :)</li>
            <li> Yep...this is the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for short, short hair.  I use it to style my pixie cut before I apply hairspray.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that stuff !! keep my hair in order feeling fluffy but controlled,</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for years and LOVED the silver can version; I gave that 5 stars.  But the product in the black can is very different and not for the better!  I have fine short, spikey hair and the previous product in the silver can did the job and held my spikes in place forever.  But the product inside must have changed when they changed the packaging to a black can, cause now it hardly holds my hair even tho the can says Hold 4 and I apply just as much.  And after a few hours my hair is really dry like I never applied it and my hair goes flat; no more spikes.  Not sure what&#x27;s up, but I&#x27;m really disappointed with the new product in the black can.</li>
            <li> Use in moderation and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works amazing. A little goes a long way. So this will last me quite a while which is always good :)</li>
            <li> It weighs your hair down. It does smell good, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Sorry, meant to give it 3 stars. A bit too oily for my liking.</li>
            <li> The product works great at first, but then it fades and doesn&#x27;t last as long as needed.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried to use this a few times and it might just be my hair texture, but this leaves it feeling really sticky and looking pretty greasy. I&#x27;ve tried using less so as not to make it look greasy, but then it hardly holds anything. I probably won&#x27;t get this again just cause it makes my hair look dirty when I use it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to love this product as I saw it recommended on a YouTube beauty guru, however, I think that it might work great for Asian/course hair but for my medium to fine textured hair it seems to leave it too sticky and almost greasy.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this when she cut my hair into a shoulder length bob. I style it in beachy waves, tussle it a bit, then lightly spritz this all over my hair. A little goes a LONG way. It is an aerosol can, but I treat it like a spritz bottle...Quick bursts about 8 inches away from my hair. It gives the piecy look I&#x27;m going for, holds my style and tames fly aways. It isn&#x27;t heavy or doesn&#x27;t have a gross feel. My hair still feels soft and looks great. I always finish with a light dose of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Could not manage my hair without this product. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Not very good, other products work better.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this helps me to keep my style and make it look piecey. A little goes a long way.  Don&#x27;t spray too much otherwise it will feel sticky.  I find even if I spray a little too much, it dries and doesn&#x27;t feel dirty.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the old product.  Makes hair look greasy.  Not enough &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; to give your hair any lift.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a number 4 hold when I bought it. Smells nice and I like the feel it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for getting those broken shorter hairs from sticking up without feeling oily or stiff. On a side note, the fragrance is delightful.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products, I use it as a finishing products,  after spraying lightly I use my fingers to finish styling.  It also adds a little shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> great stuff!!!! my flat hair is flat no more! worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know there was a Wax Spray hair product until my hairdresser used it on me in the salon. I had to ask what it was and when she told me, I found it here on Amazon and bought it the same day! I have a short, pixie-style haircut that I love to spike up and make messy. This is such a fun product to do that with... and it smells great! My hair looks shiny and spunky, but not greasy; very Rock Star.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except maker my hair appear oily</li>
            <li> I use just a real light misting of this on my hair to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; it up a bit.  I really like the stuff.  A can lasts me a long time as you don&#x27;t need much at all.  In fact, if you use too much your hair will appear greasy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have a lot o hair but it is always hard to get body because it is so fine. This product works great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of dirty dry to manage thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to give my hair more texture and hold. It holds for about an hour, but then my hair just feels the same as when it&#x27;s greasy and hasn&#x27;t been washed in a day or two which isn&#x27;t exactly the look I&#x27;m going for. I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it does help a little and does make my hair easier to shape and reshape (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t harden my hair like hairspray or hair gel) but this is mostly because it makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray wax, delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with my purchase and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this product. This gives me more body than anything I have ever used. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works for short fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived when it said it would and is great with my new short hair cut</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine,  with excellent lift.  It looks better 3 days after shampooing, but PLAY DIRTY gives me the same look immediately after washing!  It&#x27;s a very fine &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;  and chnges the texture to easy to manage while allowing me to shampoo daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived in excellent condition sooner than expected.  I will reorder with this vendor!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Only wish it did not stick to everything in my bathroom.</li>
