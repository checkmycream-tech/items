            <li>a little slow in the shipping, but it does not change the fact of how great it works.</li>
            <li>It charges my old razor.  </li>
            <li>No problem so far.</li>
            <li>My electric shaver is that old but this charger keeps it going.</li>
            <li>It is marked Norelco but looks nothing like its picture.</li>
            <li>well i lost my last cord and looked online at Amazon for a new cord</li>
            <li>If this is a true Norelco product, their traditional quality is missing.</li>

            <li> I lost my original charging cord several yrs ago shortly after getting my razor.  I kept the razor since it was almost new in the hopes of finding a cord one day.  this cord works perfectly, and now I have the use of my practically new Norelco again after about 3 years of being stored in my bathroom!

            <li> Works but looks different than the original.</li>
            <li> very happy to get this replacement</li>
            <li> It showed up on a timely matter &amp; I have no issues.</li>
            <li> it is a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> tHIS IS NOT THE ITEM THAT I ORDERED. TRYING TO RETURN IS FRUSTRATING AND IS MEANT TO CONFUSE. I KEEP GETTING THE SAME QUESTIONS AND I GIVE THE SAME ANSWERS, RING AROUND THE ROSIE AND STUPID QUESTIONS . ALL I WANT TO DO IS RETURN I CANT EVEN GET A PHONE NUMBER OR AN EMAIL ADDRES TO GET THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT. I HAVE OTHER ITEMS TO PURCHASE BUT NOT FROM THIS VENDOR.</li>
            <li> My youngest son lost his charging cord and I ordered this hoping it would work.  It worked perfectly and he was thrilled that I was able to find a replacement.  I would order it again.  It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It charges my old razor.  I&#x27;m not sure what else I can say.  It doesn&#x27;t make good coffee or fry my french fries the way I like, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco electric razor for a long time and it still works great (just replace the blades now and then) but the charger cord was falling apart. The replacement charger fit perfectly and works great. In fact, my razor seems to be stronger and the charge lasts longer. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> The product that I received is not the same as the picture but it works just the same. My shaver was fully charged in less than 15 minutes. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> We lost my husband&#x27;s cord in a move - this one works great, was inexpensive and arrived on time! He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since his charging cord was starting to disintegrate.  I plugged it in and it immediately started charging.  I was skeptical at first since it was a different design, but it works great.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect replacement cord for the one my husband lost.  Fit perfectly and worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Works great and the cord itself is thicker than the original charging adapter that came with it. Great quality, price, and shipping time! Airport luggage staff damaged my original charging cord (cord split) and I received the replacement well before my facial hair got to be too &amp;#34;scrappy&amp;#34;! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Works great, quick delivery.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Exact fit for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price, exactly what I needed, thanks.</li>
            <li> That was the product I expected.</li>
            <li> The charging cord was oregenal norelco. it is a good replacement from the one I had works very well and very good price. shipt on time in good condirion.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s fine. No problem so far.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I wanted, and it works great. Fast shipping. I would recommend this product to anyone who asked about it.</li>
            <li> might have figered found my old one after I got new one o well  my fault</li>
            <li> I found this to be the best price and I love the two days to get it with Prime Shipping  I have used it on my shaver and it works fine so far.</li>
            <li> I bought it. Paid for it. They sent it. This is the way it should be done. Thanks. You did right.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works well.</li>
            <li> Great product. It worked exactly as I had hoped. I ordered the same thing from another company and was so disappointed. I would order from this company again. Thanks</li>
            <li> - It arrived on time and pretty quick. No worries there.&lt;br /&gt;- The photo looks like the original charger that came with the razor, but newer models have a slightly different charger; works just the same though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> great replacement for shaver cord that broke!</li>
            <li> just as advertised it charged my speed xl razor with not issue. a little slow in the shipping, but it does not change the fact of how great it works.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Fast delivery.  Shopping made easy</li>
            <li> Equivalent in quality to original OEM. Satisfied purchaser.</li>
            <li> The adapter end hardly fits into the clippers I have (even though they are stated as the same brand and model), and it didn&#x27;t even charge the clippers.</li>
            <li> I can finally shave again.</li>
            <li> This cord replaced the original cord that came with the shaver.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Much nicer that the original which was some 15-18 years old. My electric shaver is that old but this charger keeps it going.</li>
            <li> Sold as a Phillips power cord which has a semi-dome like shape in the plug as in the Amazon picture. What I got looks like a cheap Chinese after market cord that looks much like the less expensive HQRP cord next to it on the Amazon sale page. It is marked Norelco but looks nothing like its picture. If this is a true Norelco product, their traditional quality is missing. The supplier, Beauty Filler, an company fulfilled by Amazon should at least provide the correct image.</li>
            <li> Finally have it!!! Thought H was going to freeze over before I saw it.</li>
