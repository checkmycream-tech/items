            <li>i went by the cologne  store  and sprayed this good stuff on me and it fit like a  glove.</li>
            <li>i always enjoy smelling good and this is the truth.  </li>
            <li>I know the stories about olfactory, however I am sure that it should have stayed longer, but it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that this cologne may have gone the way of the vehicle, but I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Warmer, more energy, and not as strong of a stench after a workout.</li>

            <li>This is a large sized Eau De Toilette, very good value for your hard earned $&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good fragrance but light, it doesn&#x27;t last two long.</li>
            <li>You can wear this if you are going for a date and know that the whole session would not last for more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this is an inexpensive product, it sure wears like a much more expensive Eau De Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I previously had an exact same Hummer 2 which was amazing, but this new one is outright watered down.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Had it been for smell only, the product would have received somewhere around 4.5 stars, however it has serious longevity issues.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival one of the box corners was smushed in as if they packed it a little too tight but am hoping the product itself is not damaged.</li>
            <li> Been using it now for a few years.  </li>

You can wear this if you are going for a date and know that the whole session would not last for more than 3 hours. Nice perfume to wear when you are spending some quality time with your partner. NOT advised for an all-day affair.</li>
