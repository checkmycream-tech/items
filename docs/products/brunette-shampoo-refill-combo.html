            <li>This was perfect to use before I went on a trip</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Really, really a great product!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>Brilliant product!</li>
            <li>I have highlighted  hair and the brunette blended in perfectly to cover my gray roots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ever</li>
            <li>I am impressed that it isn&#x27;t an aerosol.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>He loved that he didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in the photos and now I catch him stealing it from my vanity!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Also, I thought it would have a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>It also lasts quite a while, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I had to use the product a couple of times to figure out how to best use the brush, but it was easy once I did.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the seller was good and prompt.</li>
            <li>I loved not having to wash my hair as often</li>
            <li>I have way too many of those in my bathroom already!</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite thing in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>and I liked the applicator.</li>
            <li>Great for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo or for when you want to give clean hair a lift.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this product</li>
            <li>this is by far the best product I have used!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how long I went before needing to buy more!  </li>
            <li>OK-</li>
            <li>But my FAVORITE thing about this is the applicator, which I have to admit took me a couple of days to figure out.</li>
            <li>OK, I managed for a bit - and then I noticed something.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never been able to go 3 days without washing it.</li>
            <li>I also love the volume that it creates.</li>
            <li>love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>but I feel better on the environment using this form.</li>
            <li>I love that the brown color matches my hair, but I also like that it&#x27;s not an aerosol</li>
            <li>but it still looks very clean</li>
            <li>The color is good on my dark hair but not overpowering or staining, and there is a nice, light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with, I even put it on my hubby&#x27;s balding spot when we took outdoor family photos.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length, curly hair</li>
            <li>Great, but darn, I have to screw the cap back on over the brush somehow without messing up all the bristles.</li>
            <li>Original Review: August 7, 2012&lt;</li>
            <li>Try to use it during my cousin&#x27;s wedding, it got everywhere and on my light pink beige sweater, didn&#x27;t look very nice during wedding family photoshoot.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the smell, which is pretty strong when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Pull it up, and it neatly pulls the bristles together so that you can slide the cap right over it!</li>
            <li>Good point, actually merges the root color of dyed hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best Dry Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean my hair like magic, it makes it look thicker too!</li>
            <li>So I was very interested in the idea of a powder that had color in it to prevent that side-effect.  </li>
            <li>I have never been remotely successful with aerosol spray Dry Shampoos, but I gave this powder one a shot because I know baby powder is effective at eliminating grease, though it of course leaves your hair looking kind of white or grey.  </li>
            <li>It was comparable to other dry shampoos, not as great as some of my favorite aerosols</li>
            <li>they can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t meet, it is refreshing to actually use a product that exceeds their claims!</li>
            <li>I love that it comes tinted so your hair doesn&#x27;t get a white residue.</li>
            <li>I just came here to repurchase for the first time because I ran out last week, and Amazon is telling me at the top of the page that I first purchased it in August 2012.  </li>
            <li>SO, I love the idea of the color in the dry shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it was a little itchy</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>, it really lived up to what is said it would do for my hair.</li>
            <li>You just hold it over your head and tilt and shake gently and rub in.</li>
            <li>but it comes out much lighter and with a very matte tone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I have continued to use this product at least a few days per week and am still very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Quality wise this dry shampoo compares to high end brands and is half the price and twice the size!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only one I liked was Finley, but that is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>I like the idea and it looks fairly normal.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with too much coming out or with the color looking funny, like some of the other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this for two days so far (day three and day four), but it does really seem to absorb the oil.</li>
            <li>its has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you do not take off excess product with a towel it will leave you with shoulders full of dark spots.</li>
            <li>Push it down, use the full length of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t speak to how long it will last, but unless it runs out very very quickly, I will likely purchase this item</li>
            <li>I have been pretty careful, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any color transfer to my clothes yet.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of dry shampoo as I have very oily hair.....</li>
            <li>I just washed my hands after (they were only slightly tinted) and everything was clean.</li>
            <li>A lot of dry shampoos in this form are messy, I would be willing to try the black color once I use this up and see if I prefer the product more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different products to cover up my female balding but this has been one of the few that I genuinely like.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that works for me and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair but the brunette shade is not dark enough to cover a single root.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of dry shampoo and most were disappointing.</li>
            <li> Be Careful when you open it, because it will spill power everywhere.</li>
            <li> and that is why it lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored b/c of wicked grey hairs</li>
            <li> You have to be extra careful with this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t contain aluminum and other possibly harmful ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even once I get it combed through, three days is the max I&#x27;ll go with the spray-in dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I feel like this only works for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I generally wash my very long thick brown hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I want to cut down on that b/c I don&#x27;t want to have to blow it dry and straighten it that often.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair that tends to get very dry with daily washing.</li>
            <li> Covers a little grey between hair appointments as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Always used dry shampoo or baby powder in my blonde hair but had a hard time finding one for brown hair (that&#x27;s not aerosol)</li>
            <li> have lowered my review by two stars due to the experience I had when repurchasing this product in November 2013.  </li>
            <li> So here is the feedback they asked for:  Good product, horrible service.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention they specifically reached out to me and asked me to leave them feedback, and then when I reached out to them they shut me down.  </li>
            <li> Also my brush has some loose connections so sometimes gets messy and application is generally messy.  </li>
            <li> I have used the spray-in dry shampoos before, but with my brown hair I always end up looking like I have gray roots, and it&#x27;s hard to comb through sufficiently to fix this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s refillable, because that means less packaging and waste going into landfills.</li>
            <li> Another review said she had trouble with it -</li>
            <li> It also provides plenty of body to my otherwise limp hair.</li>
            <li> and it was not very effective at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how.</li>
            <li> I like to touch up in the late afternoon.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of products making claims</li>
            <li> That is absurd.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  Covers a little grey between hair appointments as well.</li>
            <li> This was perfect to use before I went on a trip but I would only use this for emergencies.  Otherwise, the seller was good and prompt.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of dry shampoo as I have very oily hair.....this is by far the best product I have used!</li>
            <li> I like this product OK- I haven&#x27;t had any problems with too much coming out or with the color looking funny, like some of the other reviews have said.  However, I do find that my hair feels greasy by the end of the day- I feel like this only works for a few hours.  I also don&#x27;t love the smell, which is pretty strong when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of dry shampoo and most were disappointing. The only one I liked was Finley, but that is a bit more expensive. So I tried this - and it did not disappoint! The color is good on my dark hair but not overpowering or staining, and there is a nice, light, pleasant scent. But my FAVORITE thing about this is the applicator, which I have to admit took me a couple of days to figure out. Built-in brush? Great, but darn, I have to screw the cap back on over the brush somehow without messing up all the bristles. OK, I managed for a bit - and then I noticed something. There is a built-in sleeve that goes over the brush. Push it down, use the full length of the bristles. Pull it up, and it neatly pulls the bristles together so that you can slide the cap right over it! Neat!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used!  Not only does it clean my hair like magic, it makes it look thicker too! It even covered my roots!!! I am so tired of products making claims they can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t meet, it is refreshing to actually use a product that exceeds their claims! I had to use the product a couple of times to figure out how to best use the brush, but it was easy once I did.  Really, really a great product!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it was a little itchy and I didn&#x27;t like the color transferring to my fingers when I would run my hands through my hair during the day. My hands would end up colored and every thing else I touched. Also, I thought it would have a pleasant smell and it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Be Careful when you open it, because it will spill power everywhere.</li>
            <li> I used this and it was not very effective at all. Then even after I showered, when I ran my fingers through my hair, I was left with brown grit under my fingernails. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Ladies! This product is awesome! I love that it comes tinted so your hair doesn&#x27;t get a white residue. I have fine, medium length, curly hair and it&#x27;s a pain to straighten every day. I&#x27;ve had other dry shampoos but I&#x27;ve never been able to go 3 days without washing it. I also love the volume that it creates. Brilliant product!</li>
            <li> I have highlighted  hair and the brunette blended in perfectly to cover my gray roots.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will buy it again. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Original Review: August 7, 2012&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best Dry Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have never been remotely successful with aerosol spray Dry Shampoos, but I gave this powder one a shot because I know baby powder is effective at eliminating grease, though it of course leaves your hair looking kind of white or grey.  So I was very interested in the idea of a powder that had color in it to prevent that side-effect.  This stuff is awesome!  A few times I have accidentally spilled out too much but it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of.  I brush it on my roots with the applicator and then use my fingers to comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has lasted me over a year too!  I just came here to repurchase for the first time because I ran out last week, and Amazon is telling me at the top of the page that I first purchased it in August 2012.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely intend to keep this around at all times, and I cannot recommend it enough.&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT November 17, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I have lowered my review by two stars due to the experience I had when repurchasing this product in November 2013.  I was very impressed with how long I went before needing to buy more!  But then when the product arrived, it only came with what was already in the applicator, whereas last time there was a refill as well and that is why it lasted so long.  I reached out to the seller to ask whether it was a mistake or if they no longer include a refill.  They told me that because Amazon ships the product I would need to talk to them.  Um... what?  How can you sell something on Amazon and not even know what is supposed to come in the box?  That is absurd.  Not to mention they specifically reached out to me and asked me to leave them feedback, and then when I reached out to them they shut me down.  So here is the feedback they asked for:  Good product, horrible service.  I will not likely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever and I hope I never run out of it.  It banishes oil and gives my hair volume. Great for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to shampoo or for when you want to give clean hair a lift.</li>
            <li> Makes dirt. If you do not take off excess product with a towel it will leave you with shoulders full of dark spots. Good point, actually merges the root color of dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before I tried this product. I am impressed that it isn&#x27;t an aerosol. I have way too many of those in my bathroom already! I generally wash my very long thick brown hair every other day. I want to cut down on that b/c I don&#x27;t want to have to blow it dry and straighten it that often. My hair is colored b/c of wicked grey hairs SO, I love the idea of the color in the dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it all, it really lived up to what is said it would do for my hair. I loved not having to wash my hair as often and I liked the applicator. Another review said she had trouble with it - I&#x27;m not sure how. You just hold it over your head and tilt and shake gently and rub in. I combed it through and there wasn&#x27;t a transfer. I just washed my hands after (they were only slightly tinted) and everything was clean. No fuss. I&#x27;m on day four of not washing and I&#x27;ve put it in a ponytail but it still looks very clean and I didn&#x27;t even use it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I&#x27;ll be getting a refill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products to cover up my female balding but this has been one of the few that I genuinely like.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best but the applicator brush does make it the easiest to apply of all the products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t contain aluminum and other possibly harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Quality wise this dry shampoo compares to high end brands and is half the price and twice the size!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to thicken and conceal thinness. I will be going back to Jonathan Awake Root Touch Up beccae its has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the idea and it looks fairly normal.  Some spray got on hands, shirt, etc.  Color lasted two days</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that works for me and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. It also provides plenty of body to my otherwise limp hair. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do that the packaging states is provide shine but that doesn&#x27;t bother me considering how well it works for everything else. I will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite thing in the bathroom! I use it all the time! Easy to travel with, I even put it on my hubby&#x27;s balding spot when we took outdoor family photos. He loved that he didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in the photos and now I catch him stealing it from my vanity! Your hair will look fresh and clean. It does however start to wear in as the day goes on. I like to touch up in the late afternoon.</li>
            <li> Recently dyed my hair brown from blonde.. Always used dry shampoo or baby powder in my blonde hair but had a hard time finding one for brown hair (that&#x27;s not aerosol) Super happy with this product it matched my chocolate brown hair also makes it look thicker !!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair but the brunette shade is not dark enough to cover a single root.  It looks like it should by the color in the tube but it comes out much lighter and with a very matte tone.  Also my brush has some loose connections so sometimes gets messy and application is generally messy.  A lot of dry shampoos in this form are messy, I would be willing to try the black color once I use this up and see if I prefer the product more.  It was comparable to other dry shampoos, not as great as some of my favorite aerosols but I feel better on the environment using this form.</li>
            <li> Try to use it during my cousin&#x27;s wedding, it got everywhere and on my light pink beige sweater, didn&#x27;t look very nice during wedding family photoshoot. You have to be extra careful with this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair that tends to get very dry with daily washing. To avoid getting split ends, I try to only wash my hair every 2-4 days. I have used the spray-in dry shampoos before, but with my brown hair I always end up looking like I have gray roots, and it&#x27;s hard to comb through sufficiently to fix this. Even once I get it combed through, three days is the max I&#x27;ll go with the spray-in dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before. Today I&#x27;m on day four and my hair doesn&#x27;t look oily at all! I love that the brown color matches my hair, but I also like that it&#x27;s not an aerosol and it&#x27;s refillable, because that means less packaging and waste going into landfills. I have only used this for two days so far (day three and day four), but it does really seem to absorb the oil. I have been pretty careful, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any color transfer to my clothes yet. I also can&#x27;t speak to how long it will last, but unless it runs out very very quickly, I will likely purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have continued to use this product at least a few days per week and am still very happy with it.  It also lasts quite a while, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
