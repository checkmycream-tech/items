            <li>I received this in a timely manner, and the product was in perfect condition.  </li>

            <li>Orly bonder + Seche Vite &#x3D; flawless mani for a full week!</li>
            <li>A great nail bonder which nail salons will not put on your nails unless you bring your own.</li>
            <li>It is just that good.</li>
            <li>This goes on nicely and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>But a couple drops of nail polish thinner, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the package is not like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>used and it seems good, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will never go without it, and I will continue to enjoy beautiful nails that stay chip-free for days!</li>
            <li>and I used to be really good and chipping my nail polish within hours that I painted them.</li>
            <li>This gives me a good week with my nail polish.</li>
            <li>and it still looks just as good today.</li>
            <li>this basecoat kept it good about 2 days before it started to chip...</li>
            <li>Good LucK</li>
            <li>Top it off with Seche Vite top coat for a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really good luck with keeping pedicures looking good for a week or so, which for me is amazing.</li>
            <li>great top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure OPI is great too</li>
            <li>I better stock up on it!</li>
            <li>This is like magic for your nails!</li>
            <li>My mother introduced me to this product and I am glad she did!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Best bonder to put on nails as first coat.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This has made an amazing difference in the longevity of my manicure.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I like doing my nails on my own</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and works great!</li>
            <li>I do my own nails</li>
            <li>Works great... better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.. Need to order some more :)</li>
            <li>Excellent, brand new, speedy delivery</li>
            <li>The basecoat has a good thickness and the brush is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product more than all of my nail polishes put together!  </li>
            <li>I was about to throw out a perfectly good bottle of nail polish because it was cheap and bubbled.</li>
            <li>This is the best basecoat I have found for natural nails.</li>
            <li>this is just a product I have trusted for many years on my own nails.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I love that it dries very quickly and helps to keep my polish from chipping for up to a week!</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Seche Vite Top Coat for my toesies.</li>
            <li>If you use both the nail bonder and the Seche Vite top coat, then gurl, your polish ain&#x27;t goin nowhere.</li>
            <li>Slap these babies top and bottom, and you&#x27;ll basically have a gel manicure that you remove without freakin acid and sandpaper.</li>
            <li>However, I occasionally use the Sally Hansen polish strips, and this stuff is perfect for those!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow sturdy nails until now.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Wish I ordered more than one.</li>
            <li>Be patient because it does take awhile for your nail to become better.  </li>
            <li>I love this basecoat.</li>
            <li>I love this bonder.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and is great even by itself to protect your nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s matte, so don&#x27;t use as a top coat if you want shiny polish.</li>
            <li>sure it does</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this with the Seche Vite top coats.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>now I do not have the need to spend the money of gel to get chip free nails!</li>
            <li>It allows my nail polish to stick better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Not awful.</li>
            <li>I mostly wear it so my nail polish won&#x27;t stain my nails.</li>
            <li>I use many different polishes but always end with Seche Vite and my manicures have been GREAT!</li>
            <li>This product does provide a tacky surface for the polish to better adhere.  </li>
            <li>I had read many reviews on this before I purchased it and let me just say I love it.  </li>
            <li>which includes using more nail polish remover, more cotton balls or what ever you use.</li>
            <li>I love it buy it</li>
            <li>This nail polish and many of these reviews share</li>
            <li>The Won&#x27;t chip polish, top coat, doesn&#x27;t do justice either.  </li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>so the nailpolish you use stays on a bit better.</li>
            <li>One of the better basecoats I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying those reviewers did , Make sure not to coat your cuticles.</li>
            <li>and so glad a friend recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I use this product with Seche-vite top coat and my nails</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>After applying this, your own nail colors just grab right on!</li>
            <li>I thought there was a problem with my nail polish brands, because my polish chipped almost within the first 24 hours of applying this basecoat, two coats of polish, and a good topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I hear it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great new product.  </li>
            <li>Results are truly amazing, given that I am usually lucky to get 2 weeks out of a paint job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its sticky when applied doesnt dry but works best that way .</li>
            <li>Good for the price and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>Strong &amp; fast-drying.</li>
            <li>Keeps nails strong even working with horses.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help my polish stay on better.</li>
            <li>It is weining me off of gel nails with the uv light.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scuff up your nails.</li>
            <li>This rubberized basecoat is amazing and really makes</li>
            <li>This stuff dries reasonably fast, and provides the kind of &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; surface for the polish to hold onto.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth and helped nails with cracking and chipping.  </li>
            <li>Indispensable in my mani routine.</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth the price :)</li>
            <li>Then use a good top coat and your nail polish will last for about a week.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Adding the bonder and the polish right on top, before drying.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time at home with another Orly polish and the top coat I had available.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li>It makes it last remarkably longer, but also creates a layer between your nail and the polish, so when you take it off, there are no stains or discoloration.</li>
            <li>When I received this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t in the original box</li>
            <li>It keeps my nail polish unchipped for significantly longer than others.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and with no streaks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think there is anything special about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I like no base coat and a coat of Big Shiny Top Coat on top of my color instead for staying power.</li>
            <li>Even helped my full acrylics stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I am hoping this lasts a full week as I do my nails once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the day after that, things went south quickly</li>
            <li>Applies nice and this dries fast and keep polish in much longer</li>
            <li>Use this with the top coat from this brand and your polish will last a week or more.  </li>
            <li>It really does have a rubber texture to it, so the polish you apply over top of it sticks right too it.</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smoothly and sticks to your nails, then the next color layer of polish sticks to the Orly and builds a strong bond that keeps your mani looking great for several days.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>But when you are painting your own nails, anything that helps keep the polish a little longer is ok in my book.</li>
            <li>I used this bonder 3 days ago and my color is still holding strong, normally I&#x27;d have several chips in my nails by now, love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary basecoat AND topcoat since, &amp; it really has extended the length of my manicure</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I can&#x27;t say I notice a considerable difference when I use this and when I don&#x27;t, but I have acrylic nails and change my polish often</li>
            <li>Whatever the reason, I I find this product handy for this use only.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite basecoat.</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>this product is worth</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>peeled right off..</li>
            <li>Be sure to cover the whole nail, cause if you do not, the mani will chip faster, but if you cover the whole nail - it helps to keep your mani nice for a pretty long time</li>
            <li>I have used this product as long as I have been doing my own nails , it has always served me well.</li>
            <li>I have perfect little nailshaped colored pieces now, so if I decide to craft in the future that could be helpful, I suppose....</li>
            <li>Best bottom coat ever use with nail optimizer top coat two coats whatever shade in middle and will last a few days with no chips</li>
            <li>love it never thought i would find a base coat that could keep my nail polish from chipping for couple more days wow great product!</li>
            <li>The one thing I noticed is that instead of chipping the polish tends to &amp;#34;wear down&amp;#34; off the top of my nails so they look a little bit better than having large chips all over them.  </li>
            <li>The polish itself is amazing, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, probably not from this particular seller.</li>
            <li>I put on one coat of this basecoat, two layers of polish and Orly quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>This has helped to extend the life of my manicures and pedicures so much!</li>
            <li>I use it with seche vite top coat and my manicures last all week with no chips.</li>
            <li>and when I did it went on very gummy where normally it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I also use rubber gloves when washing items that I do not put in the dishwasher, so that I can use the hottest of hot water.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it last month, and I love my nail polish brands again.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I finally am able to paint my nails without them turning yellow.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my second time, I want to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep the polish on!</li>
            <li>Orly Bonder really works!</li>
            <li>Orly Bonder has worked much better for me than the Duri Rejuvacote or Sally Hansen (various) that I was using before.</li>
            <li>This stuff chips really fast on my nails!</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s not worth buying cheap nail polish because then you have do your nails more often.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really holds on to the nail and the polish!</li>
            <li>Will make your nails pretty &amp;#34;chip free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using the bonder many different ways: 1.  </li>
            <li>If anyone finds that it&#x27;s not working well, it&#x27;s more likely that they&#x27;re using a crappy brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I also make sure i apply an even coat over my entire nail bed.</li>
            <li>so I am able to see where  it actually is going on.</li>
            <li>Applying a top coat also keeps that manicure lasting longer, I usually apply two coats of out the door brand top coat, making sure I coat the tips again.</li>
            <li>This goes on funny and looks a bit sticky, even after it dries.</li>
            <li>This product really does as advertised!</li>
            <li>and I have a 20month old toddler to chase around and clean up after all day.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this to anyone who wants their manicure to last more than 48 hours.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite basecoat is the Ulta brand (clear, greenish)</li>
            <li>I love my Orly Bonder, my nail polish seems to last SO much longer with it than without it</li>
            <li>With this base coat and two coats of color, I have a manicure that looks perfect for a week or more.</li>
            <li>I make sure it is dry before I paint my first coat.</li>
            <li>In fact, it did more bad than good!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to grow my nails long-</li>
            <li>You can use this as a top coat as well, keep in mind again there is no shine when it&#x27;s dry .</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does seem to make my polish last longer.</li>
            <li>cause this site required a certain amount of words</li>
            <li>After 2-3 coats of color polish, I always end with Seche Vite dry fast top coat.  </li>
            <li>My formaldehyde free formulas don&#x27;t even last through the day.</li>
            <li>How fast do your toenails grow?</li>
            <li>I really like this one because it seems to make the polish stay on longer without chipping.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll try these with a few more home manis and a better topcoat and report back!</li>
            <li>so I know they are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want your mani to last chip and crack free.</li>
            <li>and this really helps the polish stay on</li>
            <li>My polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip as much.</li>
            <li>I think it really does help.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I still need to paint weekly but they do not chip too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my peeling nails don&#x27;t peel as much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Very matt finish which is why it seems to works so well.</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well with Revlon Colorstay and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel</li>
            <li>Really does help nailpolish stick alot longer..</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Really allows nail polish to adhere to the nails and stay on longer.  </li>
            <li>If you wash your hands as much as I do and not have to worry about your nail polish coming or chipping off....</li>
            <li>I apply it under a very  lit area</li>
            <li>💅 THANKS FOR READING,</li>
            <li>💅 THANKS FOR READING, BYE.</li>
            <li>really helps polish stay on longer...</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>The one really nice thing about this base coat is that it goes on nice and smooth and matte, almost like a primer.</li>
            <li>The fallen Jam has also lost a lot of it&#x27;s original glue and the Orly is sticking to the actual wrap and not the sticky backing?</li>
            <li>As long as you use a good quality nail polish along with your Orly Bonder your polish will last for up to 2 weeks on natural nails...</li>
            <li>My manis normally last 24-36 hrs max without getting destroyed, but with this basecoat, I got through 3 full days before the chipping started.</li>
            <li>I work from home and have my hands in water, like an average person, and type at a computer many hours during the day.  </li>
            <li>If you do not get these decent results, you are probably using crappy  colored polish with it.</li>
            <li>I just gave my nails enough of a 3 day break (because I&#x27;m sure that this particular product dehydrates the nail bed just enough to keep the nail polish from falling apart).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main thing I always remember is to, never shake any of my polishes, this causes air bubbles , even the smallest of them which you then apply onto your nails which will soon eventually collect that moisure I spoke of or just pop like any bubble would .</li>
            <li>I experimented with high end and drug store polish, and guess what?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this bonder</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this basecoat.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Orly&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>when I remove the polish, they are yellow where the polish was and any new growth is nice and pink.</li>
            <li>since I don&#x27;t have to touch-up or change polish nearly as often!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to file the edges down well!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help normal polish though</li>
            <li>I did a fresh manicure last night and it is already chipped this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE had success with Orly as use for a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; to put the fallen wrap back on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about normal nail polish, not gel polish.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and helps dry first color coat too!</li>
            <li>If my nails are rough, I use 2 coats of Bonder and it gives a very smooth final finish.</li>
            <li>Durable and lasted without peeling and looking new for 10 days.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting too much from this base coat because of the wonderful reviews I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with fingernail polish because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to deal with repainting more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by how well this works!</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big problem with my nail polish peeling from my nails, as opposed to chipping.</li>
            <li>I bought several bottles and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I think ORLY and Seche Vite use some sort of black magic because these products are not of the human realm.</li>
            <li>I also use the Sec N Dry top coat.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to put on a clear topcoat?</li>
            <li>I have tried so many base coats that have been disappointments, but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>I put it on after 2 coats of a clear polish strengthener.  </li>
            <li>This product dries clear and without any shine to it.</li>
            <li>It really does help my manicure to last longer.  </li>
            <li>stuff is alright as far as in concerned.</li>
            <li>One unexpected benefit is that my nails are now growing longer and maintaining length.</li>
            <li>yellow but not too much</li>
            <li>It always helps my manicure last so much longer (my record is two weeks, no chips or repaints) and my nail polish never peels or chips.</li>
            <li>Polish last longer using Orly bonder , highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li>This made all the uneven parts of my nails smooth.</li>
            <li>It really makes my mani last longer.</li>
            <li>Makes mani last much longer.</li>
            <li>The only time it doesn&#x27;t last the whole week is when I use really cheap/thin nail polishes.</li>
            <li>That being said, As far as I&#x27;ve seen it does nothing to extend the life of my manicures.</li>
            <li>I used to be a manicurist a long time ago, which was when I first began using this product.  </li>
            <li>This will naturally prolong your manicure and protect your nails.</li>
            <li>product to use on your nails if you have soft and brittle nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really  helps to make the polish stick and last.</li>
            <li>Excellent base coat.</li>
            <li>Read a lot of reviews to decide which base coat is the best.</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The best base coat I have used.</li>
            <li>I have really nice nails and just got so annoyed with the polish chipping that I stopped painting for a while, then I found this.  </li>
            <li>This base coat is great!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to keep nail polish in decent condition for more than two days before trying this base coat.</li>
            <li>Seriously one star is too many.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by several nail blogs as a way to prolong your manicure&#x27;s life, a miracle cure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to leave a review but being a small business owner customer service and reliability are important</li>
            <li>It does this especially with my glitter polishes that would normally stay on forever by themselves.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it does dry really fast and the handle of the brush is a non slip.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps my Jamberry lacquer last SO much longer.</li>
            <li>I use 2 coats, then my choice of polish, add a top coat (Seche Vite), and my at-home manicure lasts for at least 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>With the exception of Saturday&#x27;s I polish my  nails at night, so I&#x27;m not going to do major damage to them at night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid nail polish lover, and this is most definitely my favorite base coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on bare nails and over a bottom coat.</li>
            <li>It was as expected and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It helped keep the polish fresh for a few days longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with Essie polish and my manicure lasted less than 24 hours, which is very unusual for an Essie manicure</li>
            <li>no top coat needed (I&#x27;ll sometimes add a top coat a few days later for new shine).</li>
            <li>I definitely expected it to help normal polish</li>
            <li>So I really need something that holds it down well.</li>
            <li>For someone with natural, long nails this is a must!</li>
            <li>a desk typing all day, &amp; have very long natural nails..  </li>
            <li>Let it dry completely before applying polish.  </li>
            <li>Within the first day, I get a narrow white edge where the polish wears off.</li>
            <li>only downside is that it does start to get goopy near the bottom, and then it takes forever to dry on the nails.</li>
            <li>advise, 3 days of natural look, a single coat of nail strengthener, plus daily cuticle oil of your choice and back to the bonder.</li>
            <li>Helps the nail polish stay on a little longer, but not that much longer.  </li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This Bonder is Amazing!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Orly bonder + Seche Vite &#x3D; flawless mani for a full week!</li>
            <li> A great nail bonder which nail salons will not put on your nails unless you bring your own.</li>
            <li> It is just that good.</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> But a couple drops of nail polish thinner, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the package is not like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> used and it seems good, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will never go without it, and I will continue to enjoy beautiful nails that stay chip-free for days!</li>
            <li> and I used to be really good and chipping my nail polish within hours that I painted them.</li>
            <li> This gives me a good week with my nail polish.</li>
            <li> and it still looks just as good today.</li>
            <li> this basecoat kept it good about 2 days before it started to chip...</li>
            <li> Good LucK</li>
            <li> Top it off with Seche Vite top coat for a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really good luck with keeping pedicures looking good for a week or so, which for me is amazing.</li>
            <li> great top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure OPI is great too</li>
            <li> I better stock up on it!</li>
            <li> This is like magic for your nails!</li>
            <li> My mother introduced me to this product and I am glad she did!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Best bonder to put on nails as first coat.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This has made an amazing difference in the longevity of my manicure.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I like doing my nails on my own</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and works great!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails</li>
            <li> Works great... better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.. Need to order some more :)</li>
            <li> Excellent, brand new, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> The basecoat has a good thickness and the brush is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product more than all of my nail polishes put together!  </li>
            <li> I was about to throw out a perfectly good bottle of nail polish because it was cheap and bubbled.</li>
            <li> This is the best basecoat I have found for natural nails.</li>
            <li> this is just a product I have trusted for many years on my own nails.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I love that it dries very quickly and helps to keep my polish from chipping for up to a week!</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the Seche Vite Top Coat for my toesies.</li>
            <li> If you use both the nail bonder and the Seche Vite top coat, then gurl, your polish ain&#x27;t goin nowhere.</li>
            <li> Slap these babies top and bottom, and you&#x27;ll basically have a gel manicure that you remove without freakin acid and sandpaper.</li>
            <li> However, I occasionally use the Sally Hansen polish strips, and this stuff is perfect for those!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow sturdy nails until now.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I ordered more than one.</li>
            <li> Be patient because it does take awhile for your nail to become better.  </li>
            <li> I love this basecoat.</li>
            <li> I love this bonder.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and is great even by itself to protect your nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s matte, so don&#x27;t use as a top coat if you want shiny polish.</li>
            <li> sure it does</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this with the Seche Vite top coats.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> now I do not have the need to spend the money of gel to get chip free nails!</li>
            <li> It allows my nail polish to stick better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> Not awful.</li>
            <li> I mostly wear it so my nail polish won&#x27;t stain my nails.</li>
            <li> I use many different polishes but always end with Seche Vite and my manicures have been GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product does provide a tacky surface for the polish to better adhere.  </li>
            <li> I had read many reviews on this before I purchased it and let me just say I love it.  </li>
            <li> which includes using more nail polish remover, more cotton balls or what ever you use.</li>
            <li> I love it buy it</li>
            <li> This nail polish and many of these reviews share</li>
            <li> The Won&#x27;t chip polish, top coat, doesn&#x27;t do justice either.  </li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> so the nailpolish you use stays on a bit better.</li>
            <li> One of the better basecoats I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying those reviewers did , Make sure not to coat your cuticles.</li>
            <li> and so glad a friend recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I use this product with Seche-vite top coat and my nails</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> After applying this, your own nail colors just grab right on!</li>
            <li> I thought there was a problem with my nail polish brands, because my polish chipped almost within the first 24 hours of applying this basecoat, two coats of polish, and a good topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I hear it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great new product.  </li>
            <li> Results are truly amazing, given that I am usually lucky to get 2 weeks out of a paint job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its sticky when applied doesnt dry but works best that way .</li>
            <li> Good for the price and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> Strong &amp; fast-drying.</li>
            <li> Keeps nails strong even working with horses.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help my polish stay on better.</li>
            <li> It is weining me off of gel nails with the uv light.  </li>
            <li> Lightly scuff up your nails.</li>
            <li> This rubberized basecoat is amazing and really makes</li>
            <li> This stuff dries reasonably fast, and provides the kind of &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; surface for the polish to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth and helped nails with cracking and chipping.  </li>
            <li> Indispensable in my mani routine.</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Then use a good top coat and your nail polish will last for about a week.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Adding the bonder and the polish right on top, before drying.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time at home with another Orly polish and the top coat I had available.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> It makes it last remarkably longer, but also creates a layer between your nail and the polish, so when you take it off, there are no stains or discoloration.</li>
            <li> When I received this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t in the original box</li>
            <li> It keeps my nail polish unchipped for significantly longer than others.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and with no streaks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think there is anything special about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I like no base coat and a coat of Big Shiny Top Coat on top of my color instead for staying power.</li>
            <li> Even helped my full acrylics stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this lasts a full week as I do my nails once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the day after that, things went south quickly</li>
            <li> Applies nice and this dries fast and keep polish in much longer</li>
            <li> Use this with the top coat from this brand and your polish will last a week or more.  </li>
            <li> It really does have a rubber texture to it, so the polish you apply over top of it sticks right too it.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on smoothly and sticks to your nails, then the next color layer of polish sticks to the Orly and builds a strong bond that keeps your mani looking great for several days.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li> But when you are painting your own nails, anything that helps keep the polish a little longer is ok in my book.</li>
            <li> I used this bonder 3 days ago and my color is still holding strong, normally I&#x27;d have several chips in my nails by now, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary basecoat AND topcoat since, &amp; it really has extended the length of my manicure</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I can&#x27;t say I notice a considerable difference when I use this and when I don&#x27;t, but I have acrylic nails and change my polish often</li>
            <li> Whatever the reason, I I find this product handy for this use only.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite basecoat.</li>
            <li> its worth it</li>
            <li> this product is worth</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> peeled right off..</li>
            <li> Be sure to cover the whole nail, cause if you do not, the mani will chip faster, but if you cover the whole nail - it helps to keep your mani nice for a pretty long time</li>
            <li> I have used this product as long as I have been doing my own nails , it has always served me well.</li>
            <li> I have perfect little nailshaped colored pieces now, so if I decide to craft in the future that could be helpful, I suppose....</li>
            <li> Best bottom coat ever use with nail optimizer top coat two coats whatever shade in middle and will last a few days with no chips</li>
            <li> love it never thought i would find a base coat that could keep my nail polish from chipping for couple more days wow great product!</li>
            <li> The one thing I noticed is that instead of chipping the polish tends to &amp;#34;wear down&amp;#34; off the top of my nails so they look a little bit better than having large chips all over them.  </li>
            <li> The polish itself is amazing, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, probably not from this particular seller.</li>
            <li> I put on one coat of this basecoat, two layers of polish and Orly quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> This has helped to extend the life of my manicures and pedicures so much!</li>
            <li> I use it with seche vite top coat and my manicures last all week with no chips.</li>
            <li> and when I did it went on very gummy where normally it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I also use rubber gloves when washing items that I do not put in the dishwasher, so that I can use the hottest of hot water.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it last month, and I love my nail polish brands again.  </li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I finally am able to paint my nails without them turning yellow.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my second time, I want to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep the polish on!</li>
            <li> Orly Bonder really works!</li>
            <li> Orly Bonder has worked much better for me than the Duri Rejuvacote or Sally Hansen (various) that I was using before.</li>
            <li> This stuff chips really fast on my nails!</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s not worth buying cheap nail polish because then you have do your nails more often.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really holds on to the nail and the polish!</li>
            <li> Will make your nails pretty &amp;#34;chip free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using the bonder many different ways: 1.  </li>
            <li> If anyone finds that it&#x27;s not working well, it&#x27;s more likely that they&#x27;re using a crappy brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I also make sure i apply an even coat over my entire nail bed.</li>
            <li> so I am able to see where  it actually is going on.</li>
            <li> Applying a top coat also keeps that manicure lasting longer, I usually apply two coats of out the door brand top coat, making sure I coat the tips again.</li>
            <li> This goes on funny and looks a bit sticky, even after it dries.</li>
            <li> This product really does as advertised!</li>
            <li> and I have a 20month old toddler to chase around and clean up after all day.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to anyone who wants their manicure to last more than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite basecoat is the Ulta brand (clear, greenish)</li>
            <li> I love my Orly Bonder, my nail polish seems to last SO much longer with it than without it</li>
            <li> With this base coat and two coats of color, I have a manicure that looks perfect for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I make sure it is dry before I paint my first coat.</li>
            <li> In fact, it did more bad than good!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to grow my nails long-</li>
            <li> You can use this as a top coat as well, keep in mind again there is no shine when it&#x27;s dry .</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does seem to make my polish last longer.</li>
            <li> cause this site required a certain amount of words</li>
            <li> After 2-3 coats of color polish, I always end with Seche Vite dry fast top coat.  </li>
            <li> My formaldehyde free formulas don&#x27;t even last through the day.</li>
            <li> How fast do your toenails grow?</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it seems to make the polish stay on longer without chipping.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll try these with a few more home manis and a better topcoat and report back!</li>
            <li> so I know they are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want your mani to last chip and crack free.</li>
            <li> and this really helps the polish stay on</li>
            <li> My polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip as much.</li>
            <li> I think it really does help.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I still need to paint weekly but they do not chip too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my peeling nails don&#x27;t peel as much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Very matt finish which is why it seems to works so well.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well with Revlon Colorstay and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel</li>
            <li> Really does help nailpolish stick alot longer..</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> Really allows nail polish to adhere to the nails and stay on longer.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hands as much as I do and not have to worry about your nail polish coming or chipping off....</li>
            <li> I apply it under a very  lit area</li>
            <li> 💅 THANKS FOR READING,</li>
            <li> 💅 THANKS FOR READING, BYE.</li>
            <li> really helps polish stay on longer...</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> The one really nice thing about this base coat is that it goes on nice and smooth and matte, almost like a primer.</li>
            <li> The fallen Jam has also lost a lot of it&#x27;s original glue and the Orly is sticking to the actual wrap and not the sticky backing?</li>
            <li> As long as you use a good quality nail polish along with your Orly Bonder your polish will last for up to 2 weeks on natural nails...</li>
            <li> My manis normally last 24-36 hrs max without getting destroyed, but with this basecoat, I got through 3 full days before the chipping started.</li>
            <li> I work from home and have my hands in water, like an average person, and type at a computer many hours during the day.  </li>
            <li> If you do not get these decent results, you are probably using crappy  colored polish with it.</li>
            <li> I just gave my nails enough of a 3 day break (because I&#x27;m sure that this particular product dehydrates the nail bed just enough to keep the nail polish from falling apart).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main thing I always remember is to, never shake any of my polishes, this causes air bubbles , even the smallest of them which you then apply onto your nails which will soon eventually collect that moisure I spoke of or just pop like any bubble would .</li>
            <li> I experimented with high end and drug store polish, and guess what?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this bonder</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this basecoat.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Orly&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> when I remove the polish, they are yellow where the polish was and any new growth is nice and pink.</li>
            <li> since I don&#x27;t have to touch-up or change polish nearly as often!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to file the edges down well!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help normal polish though</li>
            <li> I did a fresh manicure last night and it is already chipped this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE had success with Orly as use for a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; to put the fallen wrap back on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about normal nail polish, not gel polish.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and helps dry first color coat too!</li>
            <li> If my nails are rough, I use 2 coats of Bonder and it gives a very smooth final finish.</li>
            <li> Durable and lasted without peeling and looking new for 10 days.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much from this base coat because of the wonderful reviews I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with fingernail polish because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to deal with repainting more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how well this works!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty big problem with my nail polish peeling from my nails, as opposed to chipping.</li>
            <li> I bought several bottles and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I think ORLY and Seche Vite use some sort of black magic because these products are not of the human realm.</li>
            <li> I also use the Sec N Dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to put on a clear topcoat?</li>
            <li> I have tried so many base coats that have been disappointments, but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> I put it on after 2 coats of a clear polish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> This product dries clear and without any shine to it.</li>
            <li> It really does help my manicure to last longer.  </li>
            <li> stuff is alright as far as in concerned.</li>
            <li> One unexpected benefit is that my nails are now growing longer and maintaining length.</li>
            <li> yellow but not too much</li>
            <li> It always helps my manicure last so much longer (my record is two weeks, no chips or repaints) and my nail polish never peels or chips.</li>
            <li> Polish last longer using Orly bonder , highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> This made all the uneven parts of my nails smooth.</li>
            <li> It really makes my mani last longer.</li>
            <li> Makes mani last much longer.</li>
            <li> The only time it doesn&#x27;t last the whole week is when I use really cheap/thin nail polishes.</li>
            <li> That being said, As far as I&#x27;ve seen it does nothing to extend the life of my manicures.</li>
            <li> I used to be a manicurist a long time ago, which was when I first began using this product.  </li>
            <li> This will naturally prolong your manicure and protect your nails.</li>
            <li> product to use on your nails if you have soft and brittle nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really  helps to make the polish stick and last.</li>
            <li> Excellent base coat.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews to decide which base coat is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The best base coat I have used.</li>
            <li> I have really nice nails and just got so annoyed with the polish chipping that I stopped painting for a while, then I found this.  </li>
            <li> This base coat is great!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to keep nail polish in decent condition for more than two days before trying this base coat.</li>
            <li> Seriously one star is too many.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by several nail blogs as a way to prolong your manicure&#x27;s life, a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to leave a review but being a small business owner customer service and reliability are important</li>
            <li> It does this especially with my glitter polishes that would normally stay on forever by themselves.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it does dry really fast and the handle of the brush is a non slip.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my Jamberry lacquer last SO much longer.</li>
            <li> I use 2 coats, then my choice of polish, add a top coat (Seche Vite), and my at-home manicure lasts for at least 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> With the exception of Saturday&#x27;s I polish my  nails at night, so I&#x27;m not going to do major damage to them at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid nail polish lover, and this is most definitely my favorite base coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on bare nails and over a bottom coat.</li>
            <li> It was as expected and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> It helped keep the polish fresh for a few days longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with Essie polish and my manicure lasted less than 24 hours, which is very unusual for an Essie manicure</li>
            <li> no top coat needed (I&#x27;ll sometimes add a top coat a few days later for new shine).</li>
            <li> I definitely expected it to help normal polish</li>
            <li> So I really need something that holds it down well.</li>
            <li> For someone with natural, long nails this is a must!</li>
            <li> a desk typing all day, &amp; have very long natural nails..  </li>
            <li> Let it dry completely before applying polish.  </li>
            <li> Within the first day, I get a narrow white edge where the polish wears off.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it does start to get goopy near the bottom, and then it takes forever to dry on the nails.</li>
            <li> advise, 3 days of natural look, a single coat of nail strengthener, plus daily cuticle oil of your choice and back to the bonder.</li>
            <li> Helps the nail polish stay on a little longer, but not that much longer.  </li>
            <li> What I specifically love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t get thick and gross like a lot of base coats and top coats do after a while.  </li>
            <li> sometimes it will last for even two weeks with just minor chips.</li>
            <li> With minor tip touch-ups, I&#x27;ve had a manicure last 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this new orly bonder basecoat.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay on my nails after putting on the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this is different from any other similar, yet cheaper, product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to not commit to shellac or artificial nails, so</li>
            <li> Expected it to help my manicure last longer than it did though.  </li>
            <li> I will use this until it&#x27;s gone, it has lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I will update how long this product keeps my nails chip</li>
            <li> Polish stays on my nails twice as long.  </li>
            <li> Good long-lasting base coat.  </li>
            <li> The search for a good base coat goes on...</li>
            <li> I finally realized the chipping was due to this basecoat after switching out polish brands and topcoat brands.  </li>
            <li> , it might just be my nail type (dry and brittle).</li>
            <li> Adding two coats of bonder, letting dry, then adding polish.</li>
            <li> and my nails need polish on them to survive the dry air in Colorado.  </li>
            <li> even used a single base coat and 2 bonder coats.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the nail polish, I noticed my natural nail bed to be smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s 1 inch per year, and you&#x27;re comfortable with some white space at the base of your toenail, along with color above (&amp;#34;reverse French pedicure,&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s known in the biz), here is your 6 month paint job in a bottle.</li>
            <li> have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I think it did help my polish last slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry nails and tend to peel at them when they start chipping-</li>
            <li> , I use plenty of -HO &amp; 2(HO) to run a clinic) and I&#x27;ve got all sorts of base coats, top coats, even \\&quot;chip skip\\&quot; and after 6 days, not a dent, a chip or a snag!</li>
            <li> Orly bonder base coat also dries very quickly , without any tackiness, so if you encounter this , it is probably old  and  has thickened up</li>
            <li> When I use this on bare nails it may extend the wear off my polish slightly, but it still chips rather quickly, no matter the quality of the polish I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I was careful to apply it thoroughly to the edge/tip of each nail</li>
            <li> like I had expected.</li>
            <li> I was so upset that I spent $8 on this product at CVS.</li>
            <li> I can only recommend that you put a tiny bit extra polish on the leading edge of your nail, because the polish begins to wear thin before the rest of it begins to wear.</li>
            <li> On my nails this can make a 99 cent polish last at least a week with a good base coat.</li>
            <li> When using this polish as a base coat, my color adheres better and my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found a base coat that seals my nails and doesn&#x27;t allow the color of my polish to discolor my nails.  </li>
            <li> I am a busy mom and constantly using and banging up my poor nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried several base coats and top coats and nothing</li>
            <li> I was concerned from other reviews that it might turn my nails orange, but I haven&#x27;t seen any discoloration.</li>
            <li> but I could get the job done with a lot of other products too</li>
            <li> This works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes my nail color last longer though.</li>
            <li> - the latter will stay on without chipping even if I clip my nails and usually lasts 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> Helped make my manicure last longer than it usually does  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I&#x27;d love to not have to do my nails every 3 days</li>
            <li> Sometimes it worked other times</li>
            <li> works well with other brands of nail polish not just Orly products.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble getting it to dry.</li>
            <li> True, it does have a rubbery feel and is thus very different from other base coats, but I didn&#x27;t notice the nail polish lasting any longer than it usually does.</li>
            <li> Add an Orly topcoat and the at-home manicure will last at least a week or so.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if it prevents nail staining from dark polishes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat of all time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve continued using it is because I do not have the money to buy a better quality base coat at the moment, and it at least stops the color in my polishes from staining my nails.</li>
            <li> I love it, I recommend this, and if this keeps happening I will probably never buy another brand of base coat again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this bonder base coat for more then 15 years.</li>
            <li> My usage of this product is as follows; I do not apply any base coat to my cuticle or skin area, many people polishing their nails are rushing or watching tv or otherwise multi-tasking .</li>
            <li> Also had some immediate shrinkage at the tips of my nails, so would suggest using a bit of the base coat on the top edge of your nails and maybe a little bit underneath the nails.</li>
            <li> There is no color on the nails, despite the slightly orange tinge in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price.  </li>
            <li> Normally my nails chip within 3 days (I normally use China Glaze base coat).</li>
            <li> I am rough on my nails, and this base coat helps my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> I actually use two coats of it each time (one as a base then another after the color polish before the top coat) and it has helped the lessening of chipped nail polish, which is an ongoing issue for me since I have thin nails.</li>
            <li> did not help my nail polish last any longer, and I sometimes saw chips and cracks within ONE day.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but this base coat did nothing to protect my natural nails.</li>
            <li> nail polish chips easily even with thi base coat</li>
            <li> and it seems to be holding up a little</li>
            <li> This can be a little bumpy when used and I&#x27;ve noticed little threadlike things on my nails afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I so wish I would have discovered this little gem YEARS ago.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep my color from chipping, but it actually improved my weak thin splitting nails.</li>
            <li> now I have to keep filing them down to nubs because they will not stop breaking!</li>
            <li> amazing base coat !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with polish staying on the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> been using it for few weeks and noticed it stained my nails</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any product missing out of the bottle itself, I just think maybe the company sent me one out of the bottom of the barrel or something.</li>
            <li> and I have trouble with nail polishes staining my toenails.  </li>
            <li> Biggest waste of my money</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth base for whatever color polish I choose to wear, and it also seems to keep my polish on longer.</li>
            <li> I did everything as usual, following my very very rigorous home pedicure protocol, merely using this in place of my standard base (Orly Toecoat).</li>
            <li> I typically do my nails ever 4ish days, because I get bored with the same color.</li>
            <li> It still chipped like usual, after a few days or some kitchen work.</li>
            <li> Put a thin coat of bonder, let dry.</li>
            <li> Paint two thin coats of color, letting it dry in between coats.</li>
            <li> With this basecoat I made it at least half a week before any noticeable clipping.</li>
            <li> wet when I put the lost wrap back on and *dry as a base coat?</li>
            <li> Love this base coat!  </li>
            <li> not sure why this is THE basecoat to have</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it had the same result as usual.</li>
            <li> Even if my nails bend and the polish cracks, it does not chip off usually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to do?</li>
            <li> I usually get about 38</li>
            <li> I tried it as a base coat on one hand and the Jamberry base coat on the other and ALL of the Orly hand wraps fell off after a week, while the other hand lost only 1 and that was at 2 weeks right before I removed them all.</li>
            <li> Bought this basecoat to see if it would last longer than my current base which was OPI.</li>
            <li> When I used the same polish with a different base coat, it lasted.</li>
            <li> This base coat really works!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews I decided to try this base coat.</li>
            <li> The lid to it was rough like it had been chewed on a little, and it was dirty.</li>
            <li> and I do my nails at least one a week...</li>
            <li> You should also manicure your nails at least once a week because if you don&#x27;t they&#x27;ll continue doing the peeling, spliting, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointing, and definitely baffling.</li>
            <li> It made my nails peel like crazy, and weakened them to the point that they were ALWAYS chipping and splitting, especially at the corners.</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing stays on my nails longer than 12 hours with out chipping.  </li>
            <li> I have been giving myself manicures for years and this base coat is making my manicures last one and a half weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> Sorry if that makes my review less helpful.</li>
            <li> My nails had become so damaged and weak from the 2 years of using gel nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nails that peel and are weak.</li>
            <li> color stays on for a week even on weak nails</li>
            <li> Pure crap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one seems to go on consistently thin and doesn&#x27;t let my polish stain my nails.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> The second test was compared to Sally Hanson strengthening base coat, Orly still lost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it to prolong my nail polish, I just needed a base coat because I was painting my toe nails red</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> I applied the base coat, waited for it to dry  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to extend that even further and it has been TERRIBLE about chipping.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve gotten bored w/ the color)  </li>
            <li> so very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Why it sticks this way, and not as a base coat, I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I am sick and tired of chipped nails and polishes</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> course, it remains to be seen what the hell is going on under the color--I will update if my attempts to remove my paint job fail, leaving me with a dancing-red-slippers-esque pedicure that can NEVER be removed!</li>
            <li> Forget anything else you see on Pinterest... use this as your basecoat and you won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> However weird it looks, it holds onto nail polish like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li> I do my nails every 10 days to 2 weeks and the cuticles grow out and get ugly before the polish chips.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped :(</li>
            <li> I use Orly Bonder as my base coat for all of my manicures.  </li>
            <li> I have been using another base coat (OPI Nail Envy) and Seche Vite topcoat with a variety of polish brands and</li>
            <li> Does it work as a base coat?</li>
            <li> when I used this as a base coat, the polish chipped.</li>
            <li> Since using this product as a base coat my nails have flourished.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 base coat for all my manicures.</li>
            <li> The base coat itself bonded quite well with the polish, and then they decided to run off together without my nails in toe.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, this base coat has caused severe yellowing in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This base coat doesnt stain my nails like Sally does.</li>
            <li> This base coat is the bee&#x27;s knees.</li>
            <li> I am a polish junkie, and this base works with every brand of polish I have used.</li>
            <li> and it looks like I will never want to buy another brand/type of base coat again.</li>
            <li> While washing your hands, applying hand lotion , or anything where your hands receive moisture  any base coat will come off of your skin (cuticles) causing the base coat to lift off your nails as well.</li>
            <li> Also apply this bonder to the tips of your nails and under your nails, not just this brand , any base coat.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I was looking for something to make my polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Never buying another base coat after having this!</li>
            <li> DUH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Never will I ever use (or even try) another base coat!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this base coat!  I actually use two coats of it each time (one as a base then another after the color polish before the top coat) and it has helped the lessening of chipped nail polish, which is an ongoing issue for me since I have thin nails.</li>
            <li> This has helped to extend the life of my manicures and pedicures so much! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best sticky basecoat I&#x27;ve ever used on my nails. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one seems to go on consistently thin and doesn&#x27;t let my polish stain my nails.</li>
            <li> This is one of my holy grail products. I use it in combination with the Seche Vite Top Coat for my toesies. I don&#x27;t bother with fingernail polish because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to deal with repainting more often. Sorry if that makes my review less helpful. Anyway, I use various qualities of polish (OPI, knockoff stuff I got in Thailand, etc), and let me tell you, these products make all the difference. If you use both the nail bonder and the Seche Vite top coat, then gurl, your polish ain&#x27;t goin nowhere. Slap these babies top and bottom, and you&#x27;ll basically have a gel manicure that you remove without freakin acid and sandpaper. I think ORLY and Seche Vite use some sort of black magic because these products are not of the human realm.</li>
            <li> this product works, period.  I use it with seche vite top coat and my manicures last all week with no chips.</li>
            <li> Nail polish last like when I had acrylics. It is a minimum of 11 words so I am filling up space.</li>
            <li> I find that with a lot of my nail polishes, this bonder makes it easier for the colors to peel off. It does this especially with my glitter polishes that would normally stay on forever by themselves. My formaldehyde free formulas don&#x27;t even last through the day. Maybe it only works with Orly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like no base coat and a coat of Big Shiny Top Coat on top of my color instead for staying power.</li>
            <li> Good long-lasting base coat.  Expected it to help my manicure last longer than it did though.  Also had some immediate shrinkage at the tips of my nails, so would suggest using a bit of the base coat on the top edge of your nails and maybe a little bit underneath the nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  It really does help my manicure to last longer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> How fast do your toenails grow? If it&#x27;s 1 inch per year, and you&#x27;re comfortable with some white space at the base of your toenail, along with color above (&amp;#34;reverse French pedicure,&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s known in the biz), here is your 6 month paint job in a bottle. My pedicure is entering month 2 with zero (0) (none) (de nada) chips, flakes, dings, etc. I did everything as usual, following my very very rigorous home pedicure protocol, merely using this in place of my standard base (Orly Toecoat). Results are truly amazing, given that I am usually lucky to get 2 weeks out of a paint job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen what the hell is going on under the color--I will update if my attempts to remove my paint job fail, leaving me with a dancing-red-slippers-esque pedicure that can NEVER be removed!</li>
            <li> This works so damn well! I am sick and tired of chipped nails and polishes so I finally tried and joined the hype. Well, my record is 3 weeks and 2 days!!!! I love, love, love it! I better stock up on it!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of positive reviews I decided to try this base coat. It dries quickly, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help my polish stay on better. I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I applied the base coat, waited for it to dry  and then applied my OPI nail polish and when I did it went on very gummy where normally it goes on smooth. I wish it would have worked for me but no luck. I gave it two stars because it does dry really fast and the handle of the brush is a non slip.</li>
            <li> It is weining me off of gel nails with the uv light.  My nails had become so damaged and weak from the 2 years of using gel nails</li>
            <li> Bought this basecoat to see if it would last longer than my current base which was OPI. I really like this one because it seems to make the polish stay on longer without chipping.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this stuff for about 5 years now. It works great! Lightly scuff up your nails. Put a thin coat of bonder, let dry. Paint two thin coats of color, letting it dry in between coats. Im a mechanic and I&#x27;m looking at my nails as I write, I painted them a week ago, and they still look wonderful!</li>
            <li> Never buying another base coat after having this! Helps make your nail polish last! I only have to paint them once a week sometimes it will last for even two weeks with just minor chips. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time at home with another Orly polish and the top coat I had available. My manis normally last 24-36 hrs max without getting destroyed, but with this basecoat, I got through 3 full days before the chipping started. I think the day after that, things went south quickly and I had remove my polish. Again, I didn&#x27;t use the best topcoat, so perhaps with a better quality one, this may end up being the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my nails. However, I occasionally use the Sally Hansen polish strips, and this stuff is perfect for those! While I like the initial results, I&#x27;m not convinced. But I&#x27;ll try these with a few more home manis and a better topcoat and report back!</li>
            <li> A great nail bonder which nail salons will not put on your nails unless you bring your own. It is just that good.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve found. Almost like a gel polish.</li>
            <li> Very effective using two coats. I also used it as a topcoat under a regular topcoat. Durable and lasted without peeling and looking new for 10 days. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days and I&#x27;m on the fence. I&#x27;ve used it with Essie polish and my manicure lasted less than 24 hours, which is very unusual for an Essie manicure and now I&#x27;ve got it on under OPI polish and it seems to be holding up a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my Essie and OPI came from Ulta so I know they are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is alright as far as in concerned. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on it again though.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I can&#x27;t say I notice a considerable difference when I use this and when I don&#x27;t, but I have acrylic nails and change my polish often so it always last well. When I use this on bare nails it may extend the wear off my polish slightly, but it still chips rather quickly, no matter the quality of the polish I&#x27;m using. I will use this until it&#x27;s gone, it has lasted a long time and I do my nails at least one a week...but I might try another basecoat when this is done</li>
            <li> amazing base coat ! i dont know what ive been doing without it all this time ! great buy !</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow sturdy nails until now.  this product is terrific.  I bought several bottles and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This stuff practically glues color polish to your nails. I use 2 coats, then my choice of polish, add a top coat (Seche Vite), and my at-home manicure lasts for at least 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> love it. I use it to help bond my gel manicures.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It&#x27;s the best basecoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Let it dry completely before applying polish.  Then use a good top coat and your nail polish will last for about a week.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> I have been giving myself manicures for years and this base coat is making my manicures last one and a half weeks without chipping. Wish I ordered more than one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  Works great as a base coat by can be worn without additional color.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Need a refund one listed as bonder one listed as basecoat got two of the same wont accept return. Not happy</li>
            <li> Truly helps the nails from peeling, spliting, etc.  Be patient because it does take awhile for your nail to become better.  You should also manicure your nails at least once a week because if you don&#x27;t they&#x27;ll continue doing the peeling, spliting, etc.&lt;br /&gt; I also use rubber gloves when washing items that I do not put in the dishwasher, so that I can use the hottest of hot water.</li>
            <li> This basecoat works just as I had hoped. It really does have a rubber texture to it, so the polish you apply over top of it sticks right too it. My polish seems to last even longer now too!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes a difference in the duration of my manicures.  Easy to use and worth the money. Manicures have gone from 3 days to 5.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two years.  I thought there was a problem with my nail polish brands, because my polish chipped almost within the first 24 hours of applying this basecoat, two coats of polish, and a good topcoat.  I finally realized the chipping was due to this basecoat after switching out polish brands and topcoat brands.  I stopped using it last month, and I love my nail polish brands again.  I do not recommend this to anyone who wants their manicure to last more than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Great price!  I use Orly Bonder as my base coat for all of my manicures.  I love that it dries very quickly and helps to keep my polish from chipping for up to a week!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my Jamberry lacquer last SO much longer. It didn&#x27;t help normal polish though and I haven&#x27;t tried it under my jams yet. Will update as necessary. I definitely expected it to help normal polish so that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you want your mani to last chip and crack free. I&#x27;m really surprised by how well this works! One unexpected benefit is that my nails are now growing longer and maintaining length. Be sure to file the edges down well!</li>
            <li> I have been using another base coat (OPI Nail Envy) and Seche Vite topcoat with a variety of polish brands and my manicures have been lasting 3-5 days. I bought this hoping to extend that even further and it has been TERRIBLE about chipping. I did a fresh manicure last night and it is already chipped this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many positive reviews, it might just be my nail type (dry and brittle). The search for a good base coat goes on...</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely manner, and the product was in perfect condition.  It seems to make my polish stay on longer as well!</li>
            <li> This rubberized basecoat is amazing and really makes&lt;br /&gt;the nail polish last longer on your nails.  My hands are&lt;br /&gt;in water a lot and this really helps the polish stay on&lt;br /&gt;better and longer.</li>
            <li> I love this basecoat. My manicures tend to last 5-7+ days without chipping. I was concerned from other reviews that it might turn my nails orange, but I haven&#x27;t seen any discoloration. The basecoat has a good thickness and the brush is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this bonder. This is my second bottle.  It dries fast and is great even by itself to protect your nails. It&#x27;s matte, so don&#x27;t use as a top coat if you want shiny polish.</li>
            <li> One coat of this primes my nails for color. It makes it last remarkably longer, but also creates a layer between your nail and the polish, so when you take it off, there are no stains or discoloration. Great product.</li>
            <li> Be sure to cover the whole nail, cause if you do not, the mani will chip faster, but if you cover the whole nail - it helps to keep your mani nice for a pretty long time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my manicure last any longer than before. Very disappointed because I was looking for something to make my polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This base coat really works! It helps my nail polish stay on a lot longer than if i had not applied a bottom coat. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This can be a little bumpy when used and I&#x27;ve noticed little threadlike things on my nails afterwards.  I&#x27;ll continue using it but will not reorder.</li>
            <li> keeps my polish on so well.</li>
            <li> not sure why this is THE basecoat to have but I don&#x27;t think there is anything special about it. Does it work as a base coat? sure it does but I could get the job done with a lot of other products too</li>
            <li> Best bottom coat ever use with nail optimizer top coat two coats whatever shade in middle and will last a few days with no chips</li>
            <li> I got this because I am a Jamberry lover. I tried it as a base coat on one hand and the Jamberry base coat on the other and ALL of the Orly hand wraps fell off after a week, while the other hand lost only 1 and that was at 2 weeks right before I removed them all. I have tested this twice, switching hands and both times Orly lost. The second test was compared to Sally Hanson strengthening base coat, Orly still lost. I HAVE had success with Orly as use for a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; to put the fallen wrap back on! Why it sticks this way, and not as a base coat, I am not sure. I am thinking it is because the polish is *wet when I put the lost wrap back on and *dry as a base coat? The fallen Jam has also lost a lot of it&#x27;s original glue and the Orly is sticking to the actual wrap and not the sticky backing? Whatever the reason, I I find this product handy for this use only.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. I&#x27;ve used it on bare nails and over a bottom coat. My polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip as much. This goes on nicely and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite basecoat. I have a pretty big problem with my nail polish peeling from my nails, as opposed to chipping. So I really need something that holds it down well. This stuff dries reasonably fast, and provides the kind of &amp;#34;rubberized&amp;#34; surface for the polish to hold onto. I think it really does help. There is no color on the nails, despite the slightly orange tinge in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it does start to get goopy near the bottom, and then it takes forever to dry on the nails. But a couple drops of nail polish thinner, and you are good to go. I would recommend using this with the Seche Vite top coats. They are a match made in heaven.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep jamberry on</li>
            <li> My polish still chips within days of application.  And not just on my dominant hand.  I even use OPI polish, which is suppose to be the best.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with polish staying on the tips of my nails. Within the first day, I get a narrow white edge where the polish wears off. I had hoped this product would solve that issue. I was careful to apply it thoroughly to the edge/tip of each nail but unfortunately it had the same result as usual. Maybe I have to put on a clear topcoat?</li>
            <li> Why oh why have I not stumbled across this product before? I was about to throw out a perfectly good bottle of nail polish because it was cheap and bubbled. However, if I properly prepare the nail bed with this stuff, no bubbling, no chipping, no peeling. Add an Orly topcoat and the at-home manicure will last at least a week or so.</li>
            <li> Pure crap! If you want a great bonding base coat go for the Sally Hansen Insta-Grip. This stuff makes my nails chip by the next day. I experimented with high end and drug store polish, and guess what? when I used this as a base coat, the polish chipped. When I used the same polish with a different base coat, it lasted. With the exception of Saturday&#x27;s I polish my  nails at night, so I&#x27;m not going to do major damage to them at night (hence, they shouldn&#x27;t chip). Seriously one star is too many. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Shame on you Orly!...Shame, Shame, Shame, Shame, Shame.</li>
            <li> love it never thought i would find a base coat that could keep my nail polish from chipping for couple more days wow great product! its sticky when applied doesnt dry but works best that way . been using it for few weeks and noticed it stained my nails yellow but not too much so not a problem for me  i always keep my nails polished.</li>
            <li> I love this. It really makes a difference. It is truly sticky. You will get fuzzies stuck to your nail if you don&#x27;t watch it. I have not had any trouble getting it to dry. I make sure it is dry before I paint my first coat. I will definitely purchasing it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat of all time. It always helps my manicure last so much longer (my record is two weeks, no chips or repaints) and my nail polish never peels or chips. On my nails this can make a 99 cent polish last at least a week with a good base coat. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do...bond. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many base coats that have been disappointments, but this one is amazing. I like that it strengthens my nails while making my polish last longer. I will definitely be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> Have had no need for a ridge filler with this. Even helped my full acrylics stay on longer. Won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Went on smooth and helped nails with cracking and chipping.  Would purchased again and again and again and again and again (had to put all them agains cause this site required a certain amount of words DUH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is like magic for your nails! I used this bonder 3 days ago and my color is still holding strong, normally I&#x27;d have several chips in my nails by now, love it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this bonder but I don&#x27;t feel it makes my polish last any longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it.  By far, my favorite basecoat is the Ulta brand (clear, greenish) and it&#x27;s half the price.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> I have had the same nail polish on for over a week no chips, peeling, lifting of any kind..work great..</li>
            <li> Great product! Dries fast and helps dry first color coat too! Polish last longer using Orly bonder , highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I finally am able to paint my nails without them turning yellow. This also helps keep the polish longer. I still need to paint weekly but they do not chip too much.</li>
            <li> Helps the nail polish stay on a little longer, but not that much longer.  Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> I so wish I would have discovered this little gem YEARS ago. This product is amazing. My nails almost always chip within a day or two- which is my biggest pet peeve. I am on day 4 with no chipping- not to mention my nails look flawless. I found this also filled in ridges and made the base smooth for application as well. I have very dry nails and tend to peel at them when they start chipping- This made all the uneven parts of my nails smooth. I will update how long this product keeps my nails chip free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering starting to get shellac gel done before buying this- now I do not have the need to spend the money of gel to get chip free nails! I am hoping this lasts a full week as I do my nails once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! Buy it and don&#x27;t look back!</li>
            <li> The product is good but the package is not like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I used and it seems good, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I got it on time</li>
            <li> When I received this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t in the original box like I had expected. The lid to it was rough like it had been chewed on a little, and it was dirty. There wasn&#x27;t any product missing out of the bottle itself, I just think maybe the company sent me one out of the bottom of the barrel or something. Somewhat disappointing, and definitely baffling. The polish itself is amazing, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, probably not from this particular seller.</li>
            <li> This is the best basecoat I have found for natural nails. I have been using it for about 9 years now. I do my nails every 10 days to 2 weeks and the cuticles grow out and get ugly before the polish chips. Even if my nails bend and the polish cracks, it does not chip off usually. If you do not get these decent results, you are probably using crappy  colored polish with it. If my nails are rough, I use 2 coats of Bonder and it gives a very smooth final finish.</li>
            <li> Since using this product as a base coat my nails have flourished. I&#x27;ve always had nails that peel and are weak. When using this polish as a base coat, my color adheres better and my manicures last longer. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my peeling nails don&#x27;t peel as much. This is my #1 base coat for all my manicures.</li>
            <li> It allows my nail polish to stick better and lasts longer.  I highly recommend this basecoat.  You should give it a try!</li>
            <li> Orly Bonder works awesome. I am rough on my nails, and this base coat helps my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to do? Bond the polish to your nail? The base coat itself bonded quite well with the polish, and then they decided to run off together without my nails in toe. I have perfect little nailshaped colored pieces now, so if I decide to craft in the future that could be helpful, I suppose....</li>
            <li> My mother introduced me to this product and I am glad she did!  I didn&#x27;t use it to prolong my nail polish, I just needed a base coat because I was painting my toe nails red and I have trouble with nail polishes staining my toenails.  After about 3 or 4 weeks I removed the polish from my toe nails and was amazed that the color (red) did not stain my toe nails.  The bonding agent also works as a barrier.  I am so glad I finally found a base coat that seals my nails and doesn&#x27;t allow the color of my polish to discolor my nails.  I don&#x27;t care what color I use on my toe nails, when I remove the polish, they are yellow where the polish was and any new growth is nice and pink.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got 2 toddlers and I wash my hands constantly. Enough said! I like doing my nails on my own (I don&#x27;t trust enough the sanitation process of beauty salons, I use plenty of -HO &amp; 2(HO) to run a clinic) and I&#x27;ve got all sorts of base coats, top coats, even \\&quot;chip skip\\&quot; and after 6 days, not a dent, a chip or a snag! APPLY ON AS IT READS ON LABEL.&lt;br /&gt;I even used a single base coat and 2 bonder coats.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the nail polish, I noticed my natural nail bed to be smooth and not dry. This is a plus for me. I just gave my nails enough of a 3 day break (because I&#x27;m sure that this particular product dehydrates the nail bed just enough to keep the nail polish from falling apart).&lt;br /&gt;My advise, 3 days of natural look, a single coat of nail strengthener, plus daily cuticle oil of your choice and back to the bonder.</li>
            <li> I love my Orly Bonder, my nail polish seems to last SO much longer with it than without it, now you will not catch me without this product in my home.</li>
            <li> It really makes my mani last longer. This purchase was my second time, I want to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. I need this for my manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li> Not great. Not awful. Works sometimes depending on the nail polish you&#x27;re wearing. I mostly wear it so my nail polish won&#x27;t stain my nails.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. My polish chipped in 12 hours. I use Stuck on Blu now.</li>
            <li> This has made an amazing difference in the longevity of my manicure. I will never go without it, and I will continue to enjoy beautiful nails that stay chip-free for days!</li>
            <li> I used this product expecting it to make my manicure last longer and it chipped the day after. Then I went to remove me polish and my nails were stained!!!</li>
            <li> I was so upset that I spent $8 on this product at CVS. Biggest waste of my money EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It did not help my nail polish last any longer, and I sometimes saw chips and cracks within ONE day.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but this base coat did nothing to protect my natural nails. In fact, it did more bad than good! It made my nails peel like crazy, and weakened them to the point that they were ALWAYS chipping and splitting, especially at the corners. I used to be able to grow my nails long- now I have to keep filing them down to nubs because they will not stop breaking! Not to mention, this base coat has caused severe yellowing in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have half a bottle left. The only reason I&#x27;ve continued using it is because I do not have the money to buy a better quality base coat at the moment, and it at least stops the color in my polishes from staining my nails. As soon as I can replace this one, I intend to toss it and never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. My nail polish stays on with no chips for 2 wks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and works great! After applying this, your own nail colors just grab right on! Super smooth and with no streaks. Definitely would purchase again!</li>
            <li> It really helps keep the polish on! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid nail polish lover, and this is most definitely my favorite base coat I&#x27;ve ever used! It provides a smooth base for whatever color polish I choose to wear, and it also seems to keep my polish on longer. Love it!</li>
            <li> Orly Bonder really works! My polish stays on the 4 to 7 days I need it to and does not chip. With minor tip touch-ups, I&#x27;ve had a manicure last 2 weeks! I use many different polishes but always end with Seche Vite and my manicures have been GREAT! Orly Bonder has worked much better for me than the Duri Rejuvacote or Sally Hansen (various) that I was using before. I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Makes mani last much longer. It is a really great bonding base layer for polish. Very matt finish which is why it seems to works so well.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by several nail blogs as a way to prolong your manicure&#x27;s life, a miracle cure. True, it does have a rubbery feel and is thus very different from other base coats, but I didn&#x27;t notice the nail polish lasting any longer than it usually does. It still chipped like usual, after a few days or some kitchen work. No miracle solution here.</li>
            <li> This product does provide a tacky surface for the polish to better adhere.  I put it on after 2 coats of a clear polish strengthener.  Then I add 2 coats of color.</li>
            <li> Excellent, brand new, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> nail polish chips easily even with thi base coat</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews on this before I purchased it and let me just say I love it.  My polish lasts days longer using this.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff chips really fast on my nails!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well. Way better than I expected. I do my own nails and I used to be really good and chipping my nail polish within hours that I painted them. This gives me a good week with my nail polish.</li>
            <li> This Bonder is Amazing!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;This basecot just change my life!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and I gave for present to a friends!!</li>
            <li> if you want your color to stay - this is your best option ! color stays on for a week even on weak nails</li>
            <li> I have this and Orly is great. I use rubber gloves for doing dishes but I also wash my several times a day. I highly recommend Orly&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve all heard the term, you get what you pay for. I gave myself a french manicure on 8/6/2014 and it still looks just as good today. aka 9/5/2014. I feel it&#x27;s not worth buying cheap nail polish because then you have do your nails more often. which includes using more nail polish remover, more cotton balls or what ever you use. I also use the Sec N Dry top coat. great top coat. I&#x27;m sure OPI is great too I hear it&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;ll give it try and I have the $ to spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this new orly bonder basecoat.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay on my nails after putting on the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;This peeled right off..&lt;br /&gt;I always use a nail brush before applying polish. There fore, the basecoat did not work as it should.&lt;br /&gt;When it peeled off in two days, it takes part of the nail with it , and damaged my nails, till that night I could take&lt;br /&gt;it off with polish remover..</li>
            <li> Forget anything else you see on Pinterest... use this as your basecoat and you won&#x27;t go wrong! Top it off with Seche Vite top coat for a beautiful shine! ;)</li>
            <li> So far so good. This base coat doesnt stain my nails like Sally does. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes my nail color last longer though.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by Missglamorazzi on YouTube and it works just as good as she said it did! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Never will I ever use (or even try) another base coat! I have to keep my nails very short for work, so I do my nails once a week, and this keeps the polish not only on my nails the entire week, but it doesn&#x27;t chip at all! The only time it doesn&#x27;t last the whole week is when I use really cheap/thin nail polishes. Works very well with Revlon Colorstay and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel - the latter will stay on without chipping even if I clip my nails and usually lasts 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> Works great and came on time</li>
            <li> This base coat is the bee&#x27;s knees. Indispensable in my mani routine. Really holds on to the nail and the polish! I am a polish junkie, and this base works with every brand of polish I have used.</li>
            <li> Really does help nailpolish stick alot longer.. I dont do my manicure without this. I love it buy it its worth it</li>
            <li> Great new product.  Helped make my manicure last longer than it usually does  Will make your nails pretty &amp;#34;chip free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to leave a review but being a small business owner customer service and reliability are important so I&#x27;m leaving a review.  This nail polish and many of these reviews share it&#x27;s glory but I did not experience the same.  I work from home and have my hands in water, like an average person, and type at a computer many hours during the day.  The bonder, and won&#x27;t chip, do not pull threw with their promises giving extended life of your manicure.  I&#x27;ve tried using the bonder many different ways: 1.  Adding the bonder and the polish right on top, before drying. 2. Adding two coats of bonder, letting dry, then adding polish. 3.  Adding bonder, adding a color, adding bonder, then color again.  Nothing seems to help the polish last longer than 32 hours.  The Won&#x27;t chip polish, top coat, doesn&#x27;t do justice either.  I&#x27;m so disappointed because I&#x27;d love to not have to do my nails every 3 days and my nails need polish on them to survive the dry air in Colorado.  I&#x27;d love to not commit to shellac or artificial nails, so I was hoping this would work. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great base coat... My nail polish lasts a hole week! For me is a lot, without it only lasts couple of days max</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t paint my nails without this stuff!!  I can wear my polish for up to 2 weeks without chipping.  For someone with natural, long nails this is a must!</li>
            <li> Excellent base coat. Strong &amp; fast-drying.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews to decide which base coat is the best. and this was the one which topped the list. Good for the price and shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much from this base coat because of the wonderful reviews I&#x27;d read. The one really nice thing about this base coat is that it goes on nice and smooth and matte, almost like a primer. That being said, As far as I&#x27;ve seen it does nothing to extend the life of my manicures. In fact, they almost seem to chip faster with this.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I have ever used. Not only does it keep my color from chipping, but it actually improved my weak thin splitting nails. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product more than all of my nail polishes put together!  What I specifically love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t get thick and gross like a lot of base coats and top coats do after a while.  That means that I can actually use this until it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sold on this product, I know it says it prolongs the life of the manicure but I have not seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it worked other times it didnt</li>
            <li> I used to be a manicurist a long time ago, which was when I first began using this product.  I&#x27;ve been using for myself now for years and years and it always work great.  If anyone finds that it&#x27;s not working well, it&#x27;s more likely that they&#x27;re using a crappy brand of nail polish.  As long as you use a good quality nail polish along with your Orly Bonder your polish will last for up to 2 weeks on natural nails... that&#x27;s awesome.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i tried this because polish chips within 24hrs on me... this basecoat kept it good about 2 days before it started to chip... so its okay...</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It is sort of sticky so the nailpolish you use stays on a bit better. I&#x27;ve had really good luck with keeping pedicures looking good for a week or so, which for me is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best!  The polish goes on smoothly and sticks to your nails, then the next color layer of polish sticks to the Orly and builds a strong bond that keeps your mani looking great for several days.  After 2-3 coats of color polish, I always end with Seche Vite dry fast top coat.  Orly bonder + Seche Vite &#x3D; flawless mani for a full week!</li>
            <li> The best base coat I have used.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat. Applies nice and this dries fast and keep polish in much longer</li>
            <li> This worked great,until I started doing dishes and cooking...these products work well if you&#x27;re not on kitchen duty.. Good LucK</li>
            <li> Really allows nail polish to adhere to the nails and stay on longer.  I  use this before any nail polish so it doesn&#x27;t stain my nails either.</li>
            <li> Great Nail bonder treatment</li>
            <li> If you wash your hands as much as I do and not have to worry about your nail polish coming or chipping off....this is the product you want.</li>
            <li> Holy moley does this basecoat help colors stick. I always have problems with nail colors chipping the day I paint my nails. I would have to re-paint daily to maintain an attactive coat... so very frustrating. With this basecoat I made it at least half a week before any noticeable clipping. One of the better basecoats I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once and it looks like I will never want to buy another brand/type of base coat again. I used this last week (on March 10th, it is now March19th) and my nails have not chipped once. Normally my nails chip within 3 days (I normally use China Glaze base coat). I love it, I recommend this, and if this keeps happening I will probably never buy another brand of base coat again.</li>
            <li> Use this with the top coat from this brand and your polish will last a week or more.  Mine does even though I have a habit of picking at my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this bonder base coat for more then 15 years. Lots of pros &amp; cons reviews. My usage of this product is as follows; I do not apply any base coat to my cuticle or skin area, many people polishing their nails are rushing or watching tv or otherwise multi-tasking . I&#x27;m not saying those reviewers did , Make sure not to coat your cuticles. While washing your hands, applying hand lotion , or anything where your hands receive moisture  any base coat will come off of your skin (cuticles) causing the base coat to lift off your nails as well. Also apply this bonder to the tips of your nails and under your nails, not just this brand , any base coat. This will naturally prolong your manicure and protect your nails. I also make sure i apply an even coat over my entire nail bed. This product dries clear and without any shine to it. I apply it under a very  lit area so I am able to see where  it actually is going on. You can use this as a top coat as well, keep in mind again there is no shine when it&#x27;s dry . Orly bonder base coat also dries very quickly , without any tackiness, so if you encounter this , it is probably old  and  has thickened up , this also happens with all polishes. The main thing I always remember is to, never shake any of my polishes, this causes air bubbles , even the smallest of them which you then apply onto your nails which will soon eventually collect that moisure I spoke of or just pop like any bubble would . Roll the bottles between your hands or across the table on a towel , the towel is to prevent any damage to your furniture and adds friction while rolling the bottle ,I always use my hands . Applying a top coat also keeps that manicure lasting longer, I usually apply two coats of out the door brand top coat, making sure I coat the tips again. I have used this product as long as I have been doing my own nails , it has always served me well. I&#x27;m not nail expert , or manicurist,  this is just a product I have trusted for many years on my own nails.💅 THANKS FOR READING, BYE.💅own nails.💅 THANKS FOR READING, BYE.💅</li>
            <li> Use this product to keep my polish on longer.  It works great and so glad a friend recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this is different from any other similar, yet cheaper, product.  I tried to use it with nail wraps to get them to stay longer and it didn&#x27;t work.  I also used it with nail polish to see if the polish would stay longer and it didn&#x27;t.  May work different for others but for me I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it again.</li>
            <li> This bonder works so well. I&#x27;ve gotten another bottle since I ordered this one, I use it with every manicure!</li>
            <li> Received it when they said I would receive this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great product to use on your nails if you have soft and brittle nails.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again if I needed to</li>
            <li> Works great.Keeps nails strong even working with horses.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is easy to use and does seem to make my polish last longer. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it prevents nail staining from dark polishes.</li>
            <li> My manicurist used this product on me, and I thought it was excellent.  It helped keep the polish fresh for a few days longer.</li>
            <li> Best bonder to put on nails as first coat.  It really  helps to make the polish stick and last.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have never been able to keep nail polish in decent condition for more than two days before trying this base coat. With this base coat and two coats of color, I have a manicure that looks perfect for a week or more. It would probably last longer, but I don&#x27;t want to see a line where the nails are growing out. This goes on funny and looks a bit sticky, even after it dries. However weird it looks, it holds onto nail polish like nobody&#x27;s business! I&#x27;m talking about normal nail polish, not gel polish. I can only recommend that you put a tiny bit extra polish on the leading edge of your nail, because the polish begins to wear thin before the rest of it begins to wear.</li>
            <li> It was as expected and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff!  really helps polish stay on longer... bonder, polish, polish, bonder.  no top coat needed (I&#x27;ll sometimes add a top coat a few days later for new shine).</li>
            <li> Works great... better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.. Need to order some more :)</li>
            <li> Got this when it was being endorsed by LORI GRENIER/QVC. I&#x27;ve been using it as my primary basecoat AND topcoat since, &amp; it really has extended the length of my manicure 10-fold! I save money too... since I don&#x27;t have to touch-up or change polish nearly as often!! Actually, most times- I end up changing polish before it even chips @ all!! (&amp; that&#x27;s over a week later, &amp; only &#x27;cuz u can see it growing out or I&#x27;ve gotten bored w/ the color)  ..true story!  Also, considering I wash dishes by hand.. work @ a desk typing all day, &amp; have very long natural nails..  this product is worth it&#x27;s weight.  It somehow makes your manicure last an eternity, even w/ all that! Definitely a great buy in my opinion! &#x3D;) Amanda/Chicago</li>
            <li> This product really does as advertised! It makes my manicures last two weeks without chipping and pedis a month without chipping! Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> And mine never stayed longer than a day.  So I guess if I do my nails on a Friday and want them to get through a weekend they will, but they certainly don&#x27;t last a week.  The one thing I noticed is that instead of chipping the polish tends to &amp;#34;wear down&amp;#34; off the top of my nails so they look a little bit better than having large chips all over them.  So I guess it sort of works.</li>
            <li> This is the best basecoat I have found. I have tried plenty of Sally Hansen, and also used CND for a while. Sally Hansen always cracked, and CND sticky basecoat made my nails peel. I don&#x27;t have either of these problems with this product. I typically do my nails ever 4ish days, because I get bored with the same color. Using this and Essie topcoat I only ever get a bit of tip wear. I am a busy mom and constantly using and banging up my poor nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried several base coats and top coats and nothing and I mean nothing stays on my nails longer than 12 hours with out chipping.  Even the OPI polishes will chip by the end if the day. I have really nice nails and just got so annoyed with the polish chipping that I stopped painting for a while, then I found this.  I can paint my nails and shower the next day and they end up rubbing off on the edges before they chip.  I usually get about 38+ hours without a chip.  For me that&#x27;s great and I have a 20month old toddler to chase around and clean up after all day. I think this product is worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped :(</li>
            <li> Helps to bond nail polish to your nails.</li>
            <li> I put on one coat of this basecoat, two layers of polish and Orly quick dry top coat.  This product is amazing.  Polish stays on my nails twice as long.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to make my nail polish not chip for years. I have always had the problem of doing my nails and then having my polish chip within a day or two. This is the only product I have ever purchased that truly makes a difference. My nail polish does not budge. Even when my polish cracks it still stays stuck to my nail so it is not noticeable. I will never paint my nails without this stuff again. I use this product with Seche-vite top coat and my nails always look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great base coat.  I think it did help my polish last slightly longer.  It&#x27;s no miracle worker.  But when you are painting your own nails, anything that helps keep the polish a little longer is ok in my book.</li>
            <li> This base coat is great! It keeps my nail polish unchipped for significantly longer than others. The package came without delay.</li>
            <li> Item was as described. works great. works well with other brands of nail polish not just Orly products. Love it</li>
