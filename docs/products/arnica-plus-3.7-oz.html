    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Arnica. I have used this brand exclusively for the past 5 years because it works that well. You can find cheaper Arnica but in my experience the cheaper brands never work as well.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  No lingering smells.  Works with pain almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Eases pain when you apply it.  We&#x27;ve bought it 4 times and tell our friends about it too.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this blend of Arnica.  I like to use it for bowling and my partners have been borrowing it also!</li>
            <li> This product works for sore muscles and strains.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible!  Nice texture, dries quickly and not sticky.  Lower back pain relief in seconds. Best arnica I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great product. A quick pain relief</li>
            <li> seems to work on my aching back. I also take the Hyland&#x27;s oral product for back muscle problems.</li>
            <li> Another Peaceful Mountain gel that we can&#x27;t get along without at our house. Takes care of those muscle aches caused by digging, lifting etc. while gardening.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Arnica Plus at the Boulder Marathon and discovered how great it was!  I have tried other brands of Arnica, but Peaceful Mountain&#x27;s Arnica Plus is by far better!</li>
            <li> The cream is great for helping sore muscles.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and is not greasy.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> This product is good, more herbal than typical Arnica jell and not as strong as I like, it works OK.</li>
            <li> Used this after cosmetic procedure for soreness and itching, works well, I suppose it&#x27;s better absorbing than lotion...at least that&#x27;s what the assistant to the doctor said ...</li>
            <li> Ok but only limited pain relief.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for muscle aches and pains. I use it often on my knees and feet. Recently I had hot grease splash on my arm, leaving several bad burns. I put Arnica Plus on the burns and WOW what a difference. I was amazed that it instantly stopped the pain, after a few hours the inflammation was greatly improved and appeared to be an almost healed burn. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been having trouble with his wrist and this product was recommended.&lt;br /&gt;He had been applying it now for about a month and has seen a marked improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as well and love that it really absorbs in nicely!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the pharmacist in Boulder, CO when I fell off my bike on a mountain downhill and broke bones in my hand and had lacerations all over my body, especially my face.  Putting the gel on feels good, cooling - and the healing is very accellerated!  Within 12 days you could barely tell there was damage to my cheek and eye area.  My doc was amazed!  Also good post-workout!  I am never without my Arnica Plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  using topicals for years and in recent years no thanks to advancing OA and Fibro and a mess from  hip replacement, I&#x27;m using topicals more than ever.  Love the Arnica Plus and Topricin as well....both are homeopathic based and I find them to be great.</li>
            <li> will definitely order again</li>
            <li> The best for healing bruises quickly - recommended by other users and medical personnel.</li>
            <li> Great product have used for quite some time; ordered because I was out and just not the time to get to local shop to purchase.  Sure wish if two or more items were ordered from this vendor it&#x27;d move to amazon Prime and leave the &#x27;add-on&#x27; status.  NO SMELL!</li>
            <li> Always have some of this on hand.  Can&#x27;t live without it.  My massage therapist is actually the person that got me to start using this.</li>
