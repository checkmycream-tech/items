            <li>(it seems like I have to use a lot of it for good coverage).  </li>
            <li>I saw a bunch of good reviews that I decided to try Dinair makeup.</li>
            <li>and  I loved it, but this makeup made no changes on my face.</li>
            <li>Good product my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li>and she said it works better than the ones that they use in her salon.</li>
            <li>top of this being a great product the customer service is really what shines.</li>
            <li>it, and you will fall in love.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want to invest a bunch of money into something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like.</li>
            <li>Had family try it out too &amp; they seem to love it as well.</li>
            <li>Looking for a better makeup to try out that is compatible with Dinair...</li>
            <li>Be sure and watch the cleaning routines to keep it up and running.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;much more beter than Luminess Airbrush</li>
            <li>i Love it just practicing a bit...</li>
            <li>but I use a lot more then  </li>
            <li>And the service team told me will be adding airbrush makeup sets to their Amazon store:)</li>
            <li>I can use other airbrush makeup in this machine (AKA Mac Pro Airbrush concealer) and the application is so flawless and light!</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing the Luminesse air brush kit that costs more but they have a huge warranty on the kit...</li>
            <li>First of all the product itself has been amazing.</li>
            <li>This is working just fine.  </li>
            <li>You can also skype with them for free with your purchase and they will teach you everything you need to know.</li>
            <li>: before you order, go to their website and do the free color match service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post later if I have any more info, but so far I am a happy purchaser!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic to work with.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying if you are looking at airbrush makeup!</li>
            <li>arrived with a very good lesson on how to properly use the system came with DVD very informative</li>
            <li>They have hundreds of tutorial videos, how tos and help videos to teach you how to use the product and how to clean everything.</li>
            <li>The foundation felt ok, but was hard to use because it dries way too quickly!!!!</li>
            <li>Love my new backup compressor!</li>
            <li>It made my fine lines pretty visible up close.</li>
            <li>The makeup has stayed put all day, even through the hot summer days!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I like the airbrush system, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the makeup it comes with</li>
            <li>So I have only used this about 4 times so far, so I don&#x27;t have the best review, but I did a TON of research before deciding on this Dinair kit and here&#x27;s the short version</li>
            <li>Love this product ordered dinair instead of the  other brand seen on TV  the airbrush works very well easy to clean the package</li>
            <li>on the whole I LOVE IT and does not rub off on clothing also amazing white shirts stay white</li>
            <li>:) I was debating on 3 machines and ultimately picked this one from youtube tutorials and reviews.</li>
            <li>the system does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I get fantastic coverage without too much makeup and my skin went from acne-prone to clear in one month.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything, but it actually covers very nice</li>
            <li>and I accidentally went over my eye area too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very finished look</li>
            <li>very good&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon thanks dinair</li>
            <li>The entire unit is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a few samples, but I use my own color corrector and highlighter.</li>
            <li>considering you&#x27;re using way less product that&#x27;s mostly water.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a little too much work to get out, set up, use, then clean the machine, and wind up cords and put up...</li>
            <li>But honestly it takes so little time to actually apply the makeup</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working like a dream!</li>
            <li>This has completely changed my make up game, i love it!</li>
            <li>It took about 3 tries before I realized less really is more.</li>
            <li>I ordered the wrong color and was ticked, because I then had to wait another week for the right color (which could have been included in the original price) got to my house.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this kit Is amazing, my best friend who works at a top salon here was using it and she said it works better than the ones that they use in her salon.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit last year and I have to rave about it. First of all the product itself has been amazing. I get fantastic coverage without too much makeup and my skin went from acne-prone to clear in one month. It&#x27;s so so so simple to use and clean and the amount of things you can do with it is crazy (eye shadow, contouring, eyebrows, lips and face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was a lot for me at the time but it&#x27;s been worth every penny. I also got their eye shadow and I don&#x27;t even need any other makeup. I use this daily and still have enough foundation to use (6-7 months total).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this being a great product the customer service is really what shines. They have hundreds of tutorial videos, how tos and help videos to teach you how to use the product and how to clean everything. You can also skype with them for free with your purchase and they will teach you everything you need to know. Every employee I have talked to has been incredible. They helped me with picking colors, picking this kit, a problem I had when shipping and questions about using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, and you will fall in love. If you have any issues their customer support will make you happy.</li>
            <li> Good product my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a little too much work to get out, set up, use, then clean the machine, and wind up cords and put up... But honestly it takes so little time to actually apply the makeup, you&#x27;re still out of there faster than normal.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is very &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; which is weird considering you&#x27;re using way less product that&#x27;s mostly water. You do have to get used to it though. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I accidentally went over my eye area too much. It made my fine lines pretty visible up close. It took about 3 tries before I realized less really is more. It&#x27;s a very finished look that I think most women like, it&#x27;s just a matter of whether or not it will be too inconvenient for your regimen.&lt;br /&gt;P.s if water hits your face... You&#x27;re a streaky mess, but they do have a water proof makeup. They advertise it underwater, literally.&lt;br /&gt;One WORD OF ADVICE: before you order, go to their website and do the free color match service. I ordered the wrong color and was ticked, because I then had to wait another week for the right color (which could have been included in the original price) got to my house.</li>
            <li> So I have only used this about 4 times so far, so I don&#x27;t have the best review, but I did a TON of research before deciding on this Dinair kit and here&#x27;s the short version :) I was debating on 3 machines and ultimately picked this one from youtube tutorials and reviews. I am so glad I did!! I like that I can use other airbrush makeup in this machine (AKA Mac Pro Airbrush concealer) and the application is so flawless and light! I was a little nervous at first, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything, but it actually covers very nice (I have a few age spots and dark circles, shhhhh!). I actually like the makeup that comes with it, but once it runs out I&#x27;ll probably try other airbrush makeup in this machine. I have never done airbrush makeup before so I didn&#x27;t want to invest a bunch of money into something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like. So far it&#x27;s working like a dream! It comes with a few samples, but I use my own color corrector and highlighter. If you do use the airbrush highlighter- go Very EASY!!! Don&#x27;t use the highlighter on the same speed as the foundation, or when you go outside you&#x27;ll be competing with the sun for reflectiveness! The Dinair sprays evenly and I have had no issues with clogging or uneven spray so far! Had family try it out too &amp; they seem to love it as well. The makeup seems to last all day, I am a heavy sweater-especially when I get stressed which is quite often. The makeup has stayed put all day, even through the hot summer days! (Although I do mist my finished face with e.l.f. makeup mist and set). I&#x27;ll post later if I have any more info, but so far I am a happy purchaser!!</li>
            <li> I like the airbrush system, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the makeup it comes with (it seems like I have to use a lot of it for good coverage).  Looking for a better makeup to try out that is compatible with Dinair...</li>
            <li> This is working just fine.  Be sure and watch the cleaning routines to keep it up and running.</li>
            <li> I saw a bunch of good reviews that I decided to try Dinair makeup. There was nothing wrong with my airbrush machine itself but the makeup didn&#x27;t cover anything on my face. I&#x27;ve had airbrush makeup before and  I loved it, but this makeup made no changes on my face.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;i love it&lt;br /&gt;much more beter than Luminess Airbrush</li>
            <li> the system does exactly what it says it does.  it took me a few time to get the hang of it and I wanted to send it back, but I watched the instructional video as well as talked to a representative, who gave me some tips not on the video, and decided to try it again.  Am happy I did.</li>
            <li> i Love it just practicing a bit... Thanks amazon thanks dinair</li>
            <li> It is the best airbrush system I have aver used!</li>
            <li> I fell for the advertisements, and regret it.  When my unit arrived, the brand-new airbrush didn&#x27;t even work.  The entire unit is cheaply made.  And when I wanted my money back, they wouldn&#x27;t return my calls.  I found out that they didn&#x27;t even have a money-back guarantee, always a bad sign. Then, when I requested a replacement airbrush, they wanted to charge me a 25% restocking fee!  Lousy product, non-existent customer service.  I&#x27;m going back to my usual makeup.</li>
            <li> This has completely changed my make up game, i love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product ordered dinair instead of the  other brand seen on TV  the airbrush works very well easy to clean the package arrived with a very good lesson on how to properly use the system came with DVD very informative the make up looks great I have really terrible skin lots of blocky patches and sun damage it covers well but I use a lot more then  the few drops recommended  it lasts all day no touch ups needs  AMAZING!  Very happy with it  on the whole I LOVE IT and does not rub off on clothing also amazing white shirts stay white</li>
            <li> I ordered this air brush kit, I read everything they sent me, then I watched the instructional DVD that came with my kit. Then, I put water into it and tested it put, nothing... Nothing came out. I tried over and over again, nothing. Them I cleaned it just like it said in the DVD... I asked them if they would send me another one. It finally came. But it sputters in every position on the dial. It spurts... I will be returning it ASAP. The foundation felt ok, but was hard to use because it dries way too quickly!!!! I do not want this. I plan on purchasing the Luminesse air brush kit that costs more but they have a huge warranty on the kit... Hoping it will work t</li>
            <li> Fantastic to work with. I had a lot of questions and the customer service was excellent as well. Love my new backup compressor! And the service team told me will be adding airbrush makeup sets to their Amazon store:)</li>
            <li> Hard to find the right color of foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used my airbrush machine a couple of time now and absolutely LOVE it!!! It leaves my skin looking perfect and is so light! Definitely worth trying if you are looking at airbrush makeup!</li>
