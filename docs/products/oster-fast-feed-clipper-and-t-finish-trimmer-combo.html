            <li>I have been using these for over two years and they still work as good as the day I bought them.  </li>
            <li>The seller did a good job</li>
            <li>The trimmers are good too.  </li>
            <li>Oster makes good products.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with it since years.</li>
            <li>However, she did try the finish trimmer and fell in love with it as well!  </li>
            <li>I have &#x27;buzzed&#x27; my own hair for over 10 years now to save money.  </li>
            <li>and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong!</li>
            <li>They are very quiet, which is especially great since we use them to trim his face and ears.  </li>
            <li>I love Amizon.com ever sinceI</li>
            <li>I love Amizon.com.</li>
            <li>We have owned many cheaper brands of clippers but have never been 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Saving me alot of money by being able to cut my two sons and my hair every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>These two items are top notch.</li>
            <li>Better than Wal*art quality, but not like the barbers.</li>
            <li>and they have more than paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li>clippers are okay, but the trimmers are not getting as close as I had hope for.</li>
            <li>clippers are okay, but the trimmers are not getting as close as I had hope for.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Outstanding Product.</li>
            <li>The included brush and oil allow me to keep the clipper and trimmer in top shape.  </li>
            <li>Clippers worked better than planned.</li>
            <li>The price here was better than I found anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>The oster T-finish trimmer could be better.</li>
            <li>My wife then cut my hair and did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>An old travel bag of mine makes a great storage case for both clipper, trimmer, combs, oil, and brushes.</li>
            <li>, I can tell the motor is much more powerful, and it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A. - it&#x27;s not going to fall apart any time soon!  </li>
            <li>I wish they had used recycled molded cardboard or something more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Good clippers with a strong motor and nice and fluid cut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these clippers for well over 4 years now and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li>At first, I went to Hair Cuttery and then considered getting my own set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Love these, first they are very light.</li>
            <li>I expect that the finished results are fine.  </li>
            <li>You could spend the money on this, or you can buy a cheap one at a drug store for 20 bucks.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t great about these clippers are the guard sizes.  </li>
            <li>From the first time she used the clipper, my wife commented on how well balanced it felt and how easily it was to work with!  </li>
            <li>no need to get the oster 76 classic as these are top quality products!</li>
            <li>These shavers are fine, My fiance says it shaves him clean and doesn&#x27;t nick him or leave bumps like a razor would.</li>
            <li>The T-trimmer makes quick and easy work of any edging you have to do.  </li>
            <li>I carefully read many reviews and decided I would take the plunge and spend about $90 on a good set of clippers with trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The fast feed clippers cuts with eaze and the trimmers could be better</li>
            <li>My wife cuts three heads of hair in a row and the clippers stay cool in her hand.  </li>
            <li>It was OK, but I trimmed a bit much.  </li>
            <li>They &#x27;re not bad</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get hot in my hand and does everything I want.  </li>
            <li>Like many others, I enjoyed getting my hair cut at home, but cringed at the thought of getting the final trim work done.  </li>
            <li>The Oster fast feed hairclippers are the very best I have ever had, very professional, i can&#x27;t wait for my next haircut, so that i can use them again.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean look to the sides, edges, and back.      </li>
            <li>This is my second Oster Clipper and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>so the amazon combo price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was able to give my son and I really professional looking haircuts.</li>
            <li>Overall this combo kit is nice for a beginners set.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I experienced is with the trimmer&#x27;s vibrating loudly at times.</li>
            <li>There are many articles available on the web that show you how to do a basic buzz cut.  </li>
            <li>Cut my own hair as I have for the last decade.</li>
            <li>This set is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t think that they are worth $120.00.</li>
            <li>I can tell you he was right</li>
            <li>Each successive haircut gets a little bit better as we get more practice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These clippers are great, I can&#x27;t believe how they just plow through my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>, you can feel the quality the first time you use it</li>
            <li>The clippers overall feel sturdier and more well balanced in your hand compared to entry level $30 clippers.  </li>
            <li>I oil them every few uses and they have been good to me since day 1.  </li>
            <li>There is no trouble with fading, I don&#x27;t have to use special techniques.  </li>
            <li>If you agree with the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll sell it to you.</li>
            <li>It has a pivot motor inside, which is supposed to be more powerful than a magnetic motor (found in cheaper hair clippers) but not as strong as a rotary motor (found in heavy duty, professional clippers).  </li>
            <li>They also stay fairly cool and we haven&#x27;t had any maintenance problems so far.  </li>
            <li>Second the trimmer works so good, I mostly use it for cutting most hair.</li>
            <li>It runs quiet and cool!</li>
            <li>In spite of diligent efforts to be very careful, my wife would invariably nick my neck line with the older cheaper clippers we used to own.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was astonished of the result i got from this Oster Fast Feed Clipper.</li>
            <li>The set of clippers work really well, were shipped promptly and were very well priced.</li>
            <li>In this time they have more than paid for themselves by saving money that would have been spent at the hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also very quite.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Cache Beauty  M.R.</li>
            <li>Hill[[ASIN:B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]]</li>
            <li>To quiet the sound I have to twist the cord or hold the clippers tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really shouldn&#x27;t make that much noise.</li>
            <li>We use it for our whole family every week.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The Oster clipper was so much better than what we previously owned, that she could have done the whole job with it alone!  </li>
            <li>With shipping and everything it was $86 total and they had super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are very sturdy and feel professional as they very much are professional clippers.</li>
            <li>I wanted long lasting quality, low maintenance at a good price and this is what he said to go with.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this clipper highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommed them.</li>
            <li>The hair clipper cuts through thick hair quickly, evenly, smoothly.  </li>
            <li>kept buying the $30 Wal-mart sets, and they only hold up for a couple years, never cut the hair right</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like right out of the box was the styrofoam casing.  </li>
            <li>, I can not use her new set.</li>
            <li>The clippers seem to have a clean cut, but just about par with the other name brands.</li>
            <li>They are much better that the cheap clippers and trimmers I have purchased in the past that haven&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint but more compliments about his new buzzer.</li>
            <li>As far as the shipping it was shiped through UPS and it was perrty fast for standard shiping...</li>
            <li>This set of clippers and trimmer are all you need to get professional quality results.  </li>
            <li>We purchased the Oster set on recommendation from a friend who is a Professional Barber.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old boy who could also use the clippers.  </li>
            <li>He seems to like it so far no complaints.</li>
            <li>The price was right through Amazon, I would have had to pay double at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>The Oster clippers are definitely a step up, I would recommend a few more blade guards of different lengths though.</li>
            <li>Clean smooth cutting - Quiet - very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Now, with this new set of clippers, not only does she leave my clippers alone</li>
            <li>After much research, we decided to invest in a slightly more expensive product.  </li>
            <li>If I wait several days I use the bigger trimmer and then use the smaller T-trimmer for a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>There were only a few comb attachments for cutting, but for it&#x27;s price, these clippers cut great, they do not get hot</li>
            <li>do yourself a favor and get these and not a cheap pair of walmart clippers that just pull your hair and dont cut worth a damn.</li>
            <li>We have been cutting our own hair for nearly 30 years.</li>

            <li> To quiet the sound I have to twist the cord or hold the clippers tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really shouldn&#x27;t make that much noise.</li>
            <li> We use it for our whole family every week.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The Oster clipper was so much better than what we previously owned, that she could have done the whole job with it alone!  </li>
            <li> With shipping and everything it was $86 total and they had super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are very sturdy and feel professional as they very much are professional clippers.</li>
            <li> I wanted long lasting quality, low maintenance at a good price and this is what he said to go with.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this clipper highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommed them.</li>
            <li> The hair clipper cuts through thick hair quickly, evenly, smoothly.  </li>
            <li> kept buying the $30 Wal-mart sets, and they only hold up for a couple years, never cut the hair right</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like right out of the box was the styrofoam casing.  </li>
            <li> , I can not use her new set.</li>
            <li> The clippers seem to have a clean cut, but just about par with the other name brands.</li>
            <li> They are much better that the cheap clippers and trimmers I have purchased in the past that haven&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint but more compliments about his new buzzer.</li>
            <li> As far as the shipping it was shiped through UPS and it was perrty fast for standard shiping...</li>
            <li> This set of clippers and trimmer are all you need to get professional quality results.  </li>
            <li> We purchased the Oster set on recommendation from a friend who is a Professional Barber.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old boy who could also use the clippers.  </li>
            <li> He seems to like it so far no complaints.</li>
            <li> The price was right through Amazon, I would have had to pay double at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> The Oster clippers are definitely a step up, I would recommend a few more blade guards of different lengths though.</li>
            <li> Clean smooth cutting - Quiet - very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Now, with this new set of clippers, not only does she leave my clippers alone</li>
            <li> After much research, we decided to invest in a slightly more expensive product.  </li>
            <li> If I wait several days I use the bigger trimmer and then use the smaller T-trimmer for a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> There were only a few comb attachments for cutting, but for it&#x27;s price, these clippers cut great, they do not get hot</li>
            <li> do yourself a favor and get these and not a cheap pair of walmart clippers that just pull your hair and dont cut worth a damn.</li>
            <li> We have been cutting our own hair for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> These clippers only require one go around for the high n tight....</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, I put the #2 attachment on it and went to town, cut my hair in less than half the time</li>
            <li> If I have one complaint is that the largest clipper attachment is only a #3 (3/8&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> The are quality devices and they just feel better in the hand when you are cutting hair.</li>
            <li> and they are not loud.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that if I use it with the guard it is very VERY loud.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set after careful review of other sets.</li>
            <li> I get no funny works at work, so</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and came well oiled.  </li>
            <li> My friend and I have been giving each other haircuts for about a year.</li>
            <li> I got sick of spending $20 or more (with tip) on average to below average hair cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I visited Amizon.com and paid half price for the clippers and the other half paid for the trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The clipper turned what used to be a 25minute hair cut into a haircut that took less then 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few clipper sets through the years</li>
            <li> After just a few haircuts, the clippers have paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li> So I bought him this, and it&#x27;s been a few months</li>
            <li> say heavy feed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the t-blade for doing my neck, she used to spend 5 minutes doing just the neck, but with the t-blade it took less than a minute!</li>
            <li> and so does 20 other people, and I got tired of hearing him talk about replacing his buzzer every few months or so.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied until we bought the Oster set.  </li>
            <li> However, every set that I purchased from retail stores never satisfied her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the Marine Corps and I have to cut my hair at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> (some parts of my head I would have to go over at least 5 times)</li>
            <li> So that at least made a home on my barber table.</li>
            <li> They come with thick extension cords.    </li>
            <li> The clippers we were using not only did a bad job at cutting hair, but also mad a very loud noise while doing so.</li>
            <li> As my hair was thinning, I was getting tired of paying $15+ for someone to spend 5 minutes to shave what was reamining off.  </li>
            <li> I am still cutting all 3 boys and my husband as often as they will let me and have not had any trouble with these.</li>
            <li> As for shipping, they arrived on time and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any issues what so ever with them.</li>
            <li> They have performed for well over a year now without fail.</li>
            <li> but Ill rather use another brand of clippers..</li>
            <li> I assume I just happen to get a bad trimmer in the deal.</li>
            <li> Purchase this set, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought these clippers for giving haircuts to our miniature schnauzer.  They are very quiet, which is especially great since we use them to trim his face and ears.  They also stay fairly cool and we haven&#x27;t had any maintenance problems so far.  They paid themselves back in two haircuts.  Great price from Cache Beauty and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> You could spend the money on this, or you can buy a cheap one at a drug store for 20 bucks.  The difference is, the 20 buck ones are basically disposable.  They are toys.  This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I thought these clippers would give a close cut but not I guess they are good for fades but not to use if you are trying to achieve the bald look!!!</li>
            <li> I love Amizon.com ever sinceI joined the site I was sold. I bought these clippers in sally&#x27;s and paid an arm and a leg for the clippers alone I visited Amizon.com and paid half price for the clippers and the other half paid for the trimmers.  I love Amizon.com.</li>
            <li> We have been cutting our own hair for nearly 30 years. We have owned many cheaper brands of clippers but have never been 100% satisfied.  Not satisfied until we bought the Oster set.  The best we have ever had. Clean smooth cutting - Quiet - very high quality.  Buy Them!</li>
            <li> Have used them three diffrent times and they work perfect.  Saving me alot of money by being able to cut my two sons and my hair every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> These two items are top notch. The clipper turned what used to be a 25minute hair cut into a haircut that took less then 5 minutes. both the clippers and trimmer are very quiet. easy to clean. do yourself a favor and get these and not a cheap pair of walmart clippers that just pull your hair and dont cut worth a damn. no need to get the oster 76 classic as these are top quality products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the Marine Corps and I have to cut my hair at least once a week.  I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few clipper sets through the years and this one is by far the best.  There is no trouble with fading, I don&#x27;t have to use special techniques.  The only thing that isn&#x27;t great about these clippers are the guard sizes.  You have to purchase the extra attachments if you want your hair longer than an inch.  But together, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> They were supposed to replace hair cuts for me and save some money. Now they just sit on the shelf. Better than Wal*art quality, but not like the barbers.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve cut a lot of hair around my house with these. They are much better that the cheap clippers and trimmers I have purchased in the past that haven&#x27;t last all that long. The are quality devices and they just feel better in the hand when you are cutting hair. They are quiet and solid. I think they are a good value. If I have one complaint is that the largest clipper attachment is only a #3 (3/8&amp;#34;). After using this clipper and trimmer I won&#x27;t be buying the economy clippers again.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I enjoyed getting my hair cut at home, but cringed at the thought of getting the final trim work done.  In spite of diligent efforts to be very careful, my wife would invariably nick my neck line with the older cheaper clippers we used to own.  After much research, we decided to invest in a slightly more expensive product.  Were we happy with making this choice?  You bet!!  From the first time she used the clipper, my wife commented on how well balanced it felt and how easily it was to work with!  The Oster clipper was so much better than what we previously owned, that she could have done the whole job with it alone!  However, she did try the finish trimmer and fell in love with it as well!  What wonderful products, and from a great name in hair care.  Purchase this set, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Whaoo this apparatus is one of the best i never used. I was astonished of the result i got from this Oster Fast Feed Clipper. I will encourage you to try this, and you will see the result</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut my hair work a darn! It won&#x27;t hold on to the comb. I wish I could get my money back. If you agree with the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll sell it to you.</li>
            <li> To start out - I saved about $8 by going to Price Grabber and searching for this combo.  I bought it from Discount Jungle&#x27;s store.  With shipping and everything it was $86 total and they had super fast shipping.  Now with that helpful tip out of the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are great, I can&#x27;t believe how they just plow through my thick hair.  I have &#x27;buzzed&#x27; my own hair for over 10 years now to save money.  I got sick of spending $20 or more (with tip) on average to below average hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept buying the $30 Wal-mart sets, and they only hold up for a couple years, never cut the hair right (some parts of my head I would have to go over at least 5 times), you can only go about an inch or so at a time, they would pull hair, and a lot of the time simply cut unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these Oster clippers, that is not the case!  Right out of the box, I put the #2 attachment on it and went to town, cut my hair in less than half the time, I can tell the motor is much more powerful, and it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A. - it&#x27;s not going to fall apart any time soon!  My wife loves the t-blade for doing my neck, she used to spend 5 minutes doing just the neck, but with the t-blade it took less than a minute!</li>
            <li> The set of clippers work really well, were shipped promptly and were very well priced.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oster Clipper and it is amazing.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get hot in my hand and does everything I want.  I recommend this clipper highly.  I even bought the lube to go with it and it is also great stuff.</li>
            <li> I order these clippers and they work great.... As far as the shipping it was shiped through UPS and it was perrty fast for standard shiping... The fast feed clippers cuts with eaze and the trimmers could be better but you do get what you pay for... I checked at different beauty shops and they were selling the clippers alone for about 80 bucks so the amazon combo price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This set of clippers and trimmer are all you need to get professional quality results.  I have been using these for over two years and they still work as good as the day I bought them.  In this time they have more than paid for themselves by saving money that would have been spent at the hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also very quite.</li>
            <li> As my hair was thinning, I was getting tired of paying $15+ for someone to spend 5 minutes to shave what was reamining off.  So I got this kit hoping I could save some money and do it myself.  And well...I can!  If I wait several days I use the bigger trimmer and then use the smaller T-trimmer for a much closer shave.  It&#x27;s not like bic&#x27;ing it...but it&#x27;s close.  They have performed for well over a year now without fail. I oil them every few uses and they have been good to me since day 1.  I have not had to replace the blades nor do I think I&#x27;ll need to for awhile.  I use the T-trimmer most...and that&#x27;s about 2 times a week.  I&#x27;m very happy with these and they have more than paid for themselves.  Quality build and sturdy use.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this set about 3 or 4 years ago. We have 3 boys and couldn&#x27;t afford to have their hair cut as often as needed. I am still cutting all 3 boys and my husband as often as they will let me and have not had any trouble with these. Still going strong!</li>
            <li> We purchased the Oster set on recommendation from a friend who is a Professional Barber. I wanted long lasting quality, low maintenance at a good price and this is what he said to go with.  I can tell you he was right, you can feel the quality the first time you use it and it is very quiet. My wife cuts three heads of hair in a row and the clippers stay cool in her hand.  The price was right through Amazon, I would have had to pay double at a local beauty supply store.  Thanks Amazon and Cache Beauty  M.R. Hill[[ASIN:B000ERCU98 Oster Fast Feed Clipper &amp; T-finish Trimmer Combo]]</li>
            <li> There were only a few comb attachments for cutting, but for it&#x27;s price, these clippers cut great, they do not get hot and they are not loud. I was able to give my son and I really professional looking haircuts. The clippers are very sturdy and feel professional as they very much are professional clippers. As for shipping, they arrived on time and nothing was broken. The seller did a good job and I will buy from them again say they have something that peaks my interest.</li>
            <li> clippers are okay, but the trimmers are not getting as close as I had hope for. clippers are okay, but the trimmers are not getting as close as I had hope for.</li>
            <li> Wife kept using my clippers, and I needed to get her a pair of clippers for our son, so that she would leave mine alone. However, every set that I purchased from retail stores never satisfied her. Now, with this new set of clippers, not only does she leave my clippers alone, I can not use her new set. That&#x27;s okay, I just may have to buy another set of clippers for myself. Outstanding Product.</li>
            <li> Overall this combo kit is nice for a beginners set. The only problem that I experienced is with the trimmer&#x27;s vibrating loudly at times. To quiet the sound I have to twist the cord or hold the clippers tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this set for future buyers. I assume I just happen to get a bad trimmer in the deal.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling these will last forever, very solid product!</li>
            <li> These shavers are fine, My fiance says it shaves him clean and doesn&#x27;t nick him or leave bumps like a razor would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going bald for several years.  After years of going to a hair salon and paying $30+ for a basic haircut, I decided to save some money.  At first, I went to Hair Cuttery and then considered getting my own set of clippers.  I have a 4 year old boy who could also use the clippers.  I carefully read many reviews and decided I would take the plunge and spend about $90 on a good set of clippers with trimmer.  There are many articles available on the web that show you how to do a basic buzz cut.  You can do it yourself or have someone do it for you.  I started by giving my son a haircut.  It was OK, but I trimmed a bit much.  My wife then cut my hair and did a pretty good job.  Each successive haircut gets a little bit better as we get more practice.  After just a few haircuts, the clippers have paid for themselves.  I get no funny works at work, so I expect that the finished results are fine.  The included brush and oil allow me to keep the clipper and trimmer in top shape.  An old travel bag of mine makes a great storage case for both clipper, trimmer, combs, oil, and brushes.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Good clippers with a strong motor and nice and fluid cut.  Only complaint is that if I use it with the guard it is very VERY loud.  -guards really shouldn&#x27;t make that much noise. Otherwise great.  The trimmers are good too.  great for cleaning up the edges and/or cleaning up my client&#x27;s facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after reading some reviews on the internet.  It has a pivot motor inside, which is supposed to be more powerful than a magnetic motor (found in cheaper hair clippers) but not as strong as a rotary motor (found in heavy duty, professional clippers).  The clippers overall feel sturdier and more well balanced in your hand compared to entry level $30 clippers.  They come with thick extension cords.    The hair clipper cuts through thick hair quickly, evenly, smoothly.  The blades are sharp and came well oiled.  The T-trimmer makes quick and easy work of any edging you have to do.  It gives a nice clean look to the sides, edges, and back.      The only thing I didn&#x27;t like right out of the box was the styrofoam casing.  I wish they had used recycled molded cardboard or something more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Clippers worked better than planned. Cut my own hair as I have for the last decade. These clippers only require one go around for the high n tight....</li>
            <li> Oster makes good products.  This set is well worth the price.  The price here was better than I found anywhere else.  My husband is very happy with this set of haircutting instruments.</li>
            <li> Great clippers but Ill rather use another brand of clippers.. The liners are my best finishers.. So that at least made a home on my barber table.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after careful review of other sets. The best thing I like about this set is the trimmers. It runs quiet and cool! The clippers seem to have a clean cut, but just about par with the other name brands. This set wont disappoint!</li>
            <li> Love these, first they are very light. Second the trimmer works so good, I mostly use it for cutting most hair. And have to use the larger clipper from time to time. Highly recommed them.</li>
            <li> We use it for our whole family every week. Just great. Good quality. We are very satisfied with it since years.</li>
            <li> My friend and I have been giving each other haircuts for about a year. The clippers we were using not only did a bad job at cutting hair, but also mad a very loud noise while doing so. The Oster clippers are definitely a step up, I would recommend a few more blade guards of different lengths though.</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feed hairclippers are the very best I have ever had, very professional, i can&#x27;t wait for my next haircut, so that i can use them again. The oster T-finish trimmer could be better. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat them. Thanks Amazon.  Keep up the great work Oster.  Juan M.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for well over 4 years now and they&#x27;re still going strong. I have not experienced any issues what so ever with them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother because I always call him for a haircut and so does 20 other people, and I got tired of hearing him talk about replacing his buzzer every few months or so. So I bought him this, and it&#x27;s been a few months and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint but more compliments about his new buzzer. Which leads me to think that he loves it or likes it a lot and I don&#x27;t have to hear him @#$%* about the buzzer when he gives me my haircut.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He seems to like it so far no complaints.</li>
            <li> They &#x27;re not bad just don&#x27;t think that they are worth $120.00. The Oster nametag&lt;br /&gt;fell off after using them twice. I bought this set of clippers to replace a set of Andis&lt;br /&gt;clippers. Which were about a third the cost. I should have stuck with the Andis again.&lt;br /&gt;They say heavy feed. I see no difference between this and the Andis.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt of this combo, the boxes did not include any of the accessories (blades, etc) that were indicated as included on the boxes and in the description.</li>
