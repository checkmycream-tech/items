            <li>Everything great.  </li>
            <li>They are great for cleaning up nail polish</li>
            <li>Great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great-- I don&#x27;t have a lot of orange stick experience with which to compare -</li>
            <li>Good product, too:  one slanted end</li>
            <li>Good service and product</li>
            <li>Good products for the price.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality of these orange sticks sold by Salon Supply Store.</li>
            <li>the sticks are a nice length, in good condition.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember why I stopped using orange sticks for my fingernails, but now I remember why I love them!  </li>
            <li>Received fast, and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>These worked great and were a good price for a decent quantity.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>Cheap, good quality, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Havent had occasion to use them yet, but I am sure they will be fine.</li>
            <li>Strong wood.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine anyway for nails --</li>
            <li>Quick ship!</li>
            <li>When they start to fray I just use them to scoop any gel from under the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with these.</li>
            <li>I orderd 200 originally and because I give em away in my business ...</li>
            <li>These sticks are good for taking double sided tapes off or even strip eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This smaller size is also good as travel size cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>Good to use for a short while</li>
            <li>Big cuticle sticks, I love these!</li>
            <li>so nice to get such a bargain.  </li>
            <li>You could also stick the point into a potted plant and attach a card or sticker near the top for a fun room or gift accent.</li>
            <li>These particular sticks are smooth, (</li>
            <li>Much better price, same quality.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, just as advertised!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but rough enough to hold onto), the flat edge is at the perfect angle for pushing back cuticles (then to tidy under nails after using a nail scrub brush), and the pointed tip cleans corners and edges.</li>
            <li>This size is much easier to handle than its longer counterpart.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to write a novel here, but Amazon makes me.  </li>
            <li>The ones I received were much longer and have 2 spade ends, not one pointed and one spade.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>They smell pretty alright, I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to have a strong orange smell, but I was hoping.</li>
            <li>&amp; Other Uses&lt;br /&gt;(It is easy to clean off the surface with a cotton ball and hydrogen peroxide, then you can use it again, or try the same stick for your toenails!)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Plus being able to get 100 will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>100 will probably last me pretty long, I like to use the pointed ends to pick at whatever gets under may nails, but I mainly bought these to be cuticle pushers</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy and don&#x27;t have splinters hanging off of them like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not like splintering just a rough spot or miscut that&#x27;s only say 5% off normal.</li>

            <li> Timely delivery. They are what I expected.</li>
            <li> 100 will probably last me pretty long, I like to use the pointed ends to pick at whatever gets under may nails, but I mainly bought these to be cuticle pushers so I can paint my nails and have them not look like butt, and they work for their purpose. They smell pretty alright, I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to have a strong orange smell, but I was hoping. The packaging was pretty flimsy, the bag had split open by the time I got them, but it&#x27;s just this little thin plastic. I just taped it back together because I was too lazy to get another bag.

            <li> This package of orange sticks should last me quite a long time...so nice to get such a bargain.  I have plenty to share!</li>
            <li> great value, great product.</li>
            <li> There are enough here to last me about forever.  Good product, too:  one slanted end, one pointed end.  Strong wood.  I&#x27;m very happy with these, and with the seller.  Everything great.  Highly recommend.</li>

When the edges wear down or get too dirty, throw the stick away, or use flower cutters to snip off the used ends. You could also stick the point into a potted plant and attach a card or sticker near the top for a fun room or gift accent. (If you paint the stick for a plant, use non-toxic water-based acrylic craft paint.)&lt;br /&gt;Review by Carolyn Bragg</li>
            <li> Good service and product</li>
            <li> Great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described. I used to buy cuticle sticks of the same quality from Target in a package of 6 for about $2! Much better price, same quality. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy and don&#x27;t have splinters hanging off of them like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Very good product and I will be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to write a novel here, but Amazon makes me.  All I can say about orange sticks is that they were just as described and came in the length of time as promised.</li>
            <li> The item I received was not what is described. The ones I received were much longer and have 2 spade ends, not one pointed and one spade. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Cheap, good quality, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> They were just as advertised.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to complain about.  Received fast, and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Good products for the price. Slow on shipping</li>
            <li> Orange sticks as ordered. Fast service. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> Editing previous review due to getting long sticks instead of the half size ones. Was contacted by vendor as they were upset with my 1st review. They said they would refund me the wrong sticks delivered and they sent me the half size sticks on 2nd delivery. These sticks are good for taking double sided tapes off or even strip eyelashes. This smaller size is also good as travel size cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> Big cuticle sticks, I love these!</li>
            <li> Just as expected! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good to use for a short while but these lost a star due to how rapidly the chisel end frays.  When they start to fray I just use them to scoop any gel from under the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of these orange sticks sold by Salon Supply Store. Uniform, and very little splintering on the flat ends.</li>
            <li> These worked great and were a good price for a decent quantity. I find these shorter sticks easier to use on my nails.</li>
            <li> Great-- I don&#x27;t have a lot of orange stick experience with which to compare - the sticks are a nice length, in good condition. As described. I used them in my hair and also for my nails/cuticles. Occasionally one of the 100 will have an imperfect cut on the end like a little extra wood or a jagged point. Not like splintering just a rough spot or miscut that&#x27;s only say 5% off normal. It&#x27;s simple as pie to use a nail file to touch up the end and i&#x27;m ready to go. They work just fine anyway for nails -- I don&#x27;t like any rough spots when I stick em in my hair cuz it can snag-- again i&#x27;d say that happens only say one out of every 30 sticks. For the cost even with shipping - you can&#x27;t beat what you&#x27;re getting. I orderd 200 originally and because I give em away in my business ... I am ordering another 400 now.</li>
