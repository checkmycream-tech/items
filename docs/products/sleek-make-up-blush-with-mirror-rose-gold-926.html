            <li>I cannot wait to try out more color possibilities!</li>
            <li>Nars orgasm is 4.8g for 30 dollars, and rose gold is an AMAZING dupe.</li>
            <li>This blush is amazing</li>
            <li>I got rose gold, flamingo, lifes a peach, and pomegranate.</li>
            <li>Got the rose gold</li>
            <li>ive been trying to find a rose gold...</li>
            <li>, it has pretty good pigmentation and the gold in it gives off this beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>If I had to describe it, I would say it is very much Rose Gold as the name states (there are a million swatches online if you feel inclined to search for them).</li>
            <li>Great color if you don&#x27;t want something too bold.</li>
            <li>good strong color - can be blended with others</li>
            <li>THIS IS A WONDERFUL BLUSH, LASTING A GOOD 8 HOURS.  </li>
            <li>absolutely the most wonderful blush ever!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a natural sun kissed look!</li>
            <li>ive seen blogs that show that rose gold is actually MORE pigmented.</li>
            <li>This rose gold is a dupe, really, for the famous Nars Orgasm which I never even bothered to buy as this is soooo beautiful on one&#x27;s cheeks.</li>
            <li>it was a good economiccal dupe for NARS Orgasm blush, and the reviews were right!  </li>
            <li>The product itself looks amazing true to picture shown!</li>
            <li>It doesnt have the color pay out that Orgasm does, but It is beautiful and has a high gold sheen.</li>
            <li>I REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE FROM SLEEK MAKE UP ...</li>
            <li>I love Sleek products, this blush is no exception.</li>
            <li>This is a great seller,  they ship fast</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>This blush is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the color is lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>so I only have much wonderful things to say...</li>
            <li>Now to collect more colors :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blush.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased many colors from Sleek and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love this blush a lot.</li>
            <li>The pigment lasts most of the day although there is some fading.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The color is said by many is a dupe for NARS Orgasm.</li>
            <li>This Sleek color is more pigmented and leaves a goldy sheen on my skin.</li>
            <li>I do believe this color is BETTER than Nars Orgasm.</li>
            <li>I love it and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on.</li>
            <li>i am in love</li>
            <li>I love the sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful natural glow.</li>
            <li>The wear time is pretty good given the price, I probably get 4 hours out of it</li>
            <li>The blush is a great color and gives skin a natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li>this makeup brand is my top favorite and to find them on here on Amazon is a true blessing.</li>
            <li>I love how with the light you can see the gold shimmer and the coral undertone.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>but I have to go over orgasm several times for it to swatch as good as the sleek rose gold.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this blush, it is a good dupe for Orgasm by Nars.</li>
            <li>I think this will look better as a highlight other than that very beautiful and worth a try.</li>
            <li>It has good pigment with a nice gold undertone, and the blush doesn&#x27;t crumble like many other cheaper ones do.  </li>
            <li>but it is silky smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you look light</li>
            <li>I have purchased many sleek products because I love them so much</li>
            <li>Its my favorite blush right now</li>
            <li>I feel like this shade will look great on almost everyone that wants a natural look!!</li>
            <li>Blush &amp; their eyeshadows need just a light touch for full color, so pigmented.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>very bright for my taste, exaggerated blush for fair skin during the day a lot of ...</li>
            <li>I HAD BEEN A FOLLOWER OF ANOTHER BLUSH FAN FAVORITE, BUT I BRUSHED THAT ASIDE FOR THE ROSE GOLD.  </li>
            <li>It is nice color and looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li>or like you&#x27;ve gone for a run because of the cool undertones in it.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t really true to picture for all of the sleek blushes on amazon.</li>
            <li>This color in particular is pretty darn amazing....</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super pigmented and can be used as eyeshadow as well.  </li>
            <li>, it gives you a very pretty glow ...</li>
            <li>as someone who has absolutely so color in the face this not only makes me look alive but happy!</li>
            <li>I dropped it the very first day</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand for blush.  </li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE, AND GO TO.</li>
            <li>Although it is bright, it is pretty sheer and buildable</li>
            <li>very pigmented, use a light hand when applying is my advise.</li>
            <li>the color is a warm toned coral with micro SHIMMER NOT GLITTER of light pink and gold running through it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got a kind of glittery shade that highlights the cheeks without being too obvious.</li>
            <li>but I fixed it love the color pay off</li>
            <li>Shows up great on pale skinned people.</li>
            <li>they are so rich and the only one thats extremely shimmery is rose gold which is why its such a good dupe.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is pretty, but arrived cracked after a month of waiting for it.</li>
            <li>My favorite blush was discontinued recently</li>
            <li>Love it, came earlier than I thought it would, no damage to the product.</li>
            <li>, i actually like this so much better than my nars orgasm blush because there&#x27;s no glitter and since its a bit warmer</li>
            <li>nice glow, pink and gold.</li>
            <li>And it made me breakout on the first day.  </li>
            <li>Talk about a NARS Super Orgasm dupe for a third of the price and it shipped surprisingly quickly !</li>
            <li>HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ON MY LIPS, BUT COULD BE PRETTY.  </li>
            <li>Still really pretty and gives you a shimmery glow without needing to add another highlighter.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but this goes exactly where I put it.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this brand and it is very pigmented and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I thought it would be too much as a blush</li>
            <li>The compact is a bit small, but the blush is good quality.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty light skin tone with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I is highly pigmented so you might wanna try it on your arm first.</li>
            <li>wet is more intense.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I really have to pack it on to have the color show up.  </li>
            <li>I have light to medium olive skin with yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li>I think it is very flattering.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blush</li>
            <li>it might be too much for the daytime ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very shimmering</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m really fair-skinned.)  </li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think so.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li>Nicely pigmented, not a strong color</li>
            <li>Looks pretty natural to me!</li>
            <li>My skin is a very pale olive and the slight gold sheen blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Besides, the seller (Lucky Girl) had the same price+shipping as an official web-site and the shipping  from the UK was super fast (only 6 days).</li>
            <li>I blend with a Wet N Wild shade that&#x27;s brighter for a pop more of color.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S HIGHLY BLENDABLE, WITH A HINT OF GOLD, NOTHING GARISH ON YOUR CHEEKS.  </li>
            <li>Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M A GOLDEN TAN OF MIXED RACE,</li>
            <li>The pink color is very pretty and you will have a slight gold shimmer on top.  </li>
            <li>I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK.</li>
            <li>I think you see more of the gold shimmer than the actual pink blush.</li>
            <li>This is very, very shimmering with low pigment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same</li>
            <li>It is a TRUE pink gold blush.</li>
            <li>When swatched, it&#x27;s very pigmented and the color is similar to Nars&#x27; Orgasm</li>
            <li>AND IT LOOKS SO SOFT AND NATURAL</li>
            <li>AS SHEER AS YOU WANT, BUT IT IS ALSO VERY BUILDABLE FOR A DEEPER COLOR.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with the outcome on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Had the right amount of pink and peach with a hint of gold shimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got large pores on my cheeks which love to pick up chunks of glitter and make me look like I&#x27;m getting ready to attend a roller blading party with the other 7th graders from 1996 but the shimmer in this diffuses on the skin, leaving a subtle glow.</li>
            <li>but since my skin is very oily this is on par with how long high end and longwear blushes last on me.</li>
            <li>I love that it doubles as a highlighter, but the shimmer does mean you have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li>So, there is not only more product inside, but it is also small enough to carry it in your purse or take it on a trip.</li>
            <li>I CAN BARELY SEE IT ON MY FACE</li>
            <li>Not really pink or peachy for me.</li>
            <li>you need to look at the swatches online, there are plenty that look SCARY in the pic but come off so beautiful, and they are small but it is 8g of product.</li>
            <li>In a swatch, depending on how you position your hand, it looks pink with a golden undertone and others it looks gold with a pink undertone.</li>
            <li>very pretty color, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Really nice subtle shimmer if you have pale skin!</li>

            <li> I love this blush a lot.</li>
            <li> The pigment lasts most of the day although there is some fading.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The color is said by many is a dupe for NARS Orgasm.</li>
            <li> This Sleek color is more pigmented and leaves a goldy sheen on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do believe this color is BETTER than Nars Orgasm.</li>
            <li> I love it and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on.</li>
            <li> i am in love</li>
            <li> I love the sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> It gives a beautiful natural glow.</li>
            <li> The wear time is pretty good given the price, I probably get 4 hours out of it</li>
            <li> The blush is a great color and gives skin a natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li> this makeup brand is my top favorite and to find them on here on Amazon is a true blessing.</li>
            <li> I love how with the light you can see the gold shimmer and the coral undertone.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> but I have to go over orgasm several times for it to swatch as good as the sleek rose gold.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this blush, it is a good dupe for Orgasm by Nars.</li>
            <li> I think this will look better as a highlight other than that very beautiful and worth a try.</li>
            <li> It has good pigment with a nice gold undertone, and the blush doesn&#x27;t crumble like many other cheaper ones do.  </li>
            <li> but it is silky smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you look light</li>
            <li> I have purchased many sleek products because I love them so much</li>
            <li> Its my favorite blush right now</li>
            <li> I feel like this shade will look great on almost everyone that wants a natural look!!</li>
            <li> Blush &amp; their eyeshadows need just a light touch for full color, so pigmented.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> very bright for my taste, exaggerated blush for fair skin during the day a lot of ...</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN A FOLLOWER OF ANOTHER BLUSH FAN FAVORITE, BUT I BRUSHED THAT ASIDE FOR THE ROSE GOLD.  </li>
            <li> It is nice color and looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li> or like you&#x27;ve gone for a run because of the cool undertones in it.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t really true to picture for all of the sleek blushes on amazon.</li>
            <li> This color in particular is pretty darn amazing....</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super pigmented and can be used as eyeshadow as well.  </li>
            <li> , it gives you a very pretty glow ...</li>
            <li> as someone who has absolutely so color in the face this not only makes me look alive but happy!</li>
            <li> I dropped it the very first day</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brand for blush.  </li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE, AND GO TO.</li>
            <li> Although it is bright, it is pretty sheer and buildable</li>
            <li> very pigmented, use a light hand when applying is my advise.</li>
            <li> the color is a warm toned coral with micro SHIMMER NOT GLITTER of light pink and gold running through it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a kind of glittery shade that highlights the cheeks without being too obvious.</li>
            <li> but I fixed it love the color pay off</li>
            <li> Shows up great on pale skinned people.</li>
            <li> they are so rich and the only one thats extremely shimmery is rose gold which is why its such a good dupe.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but arrived cracked after a month of waiting for it.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush was discontinued recently</li>
            <li> Love it, came earlier than I thought it would, no damage to the product.</li>
            <li> , i actually like this so much better than my nars orgasm blush because there&#x27;s no glitter and since its a bit warmer</li>
            <li> nice glow, pink and gold.</li>
            <li> And it made me breakout on the first day.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a NARS Super Orgasm dupe for a third of the price and it shipped surprisingly quickly !</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ON MY LIPS, BUT COULD BE PRETTY.  </li>
            <li> Still really pretty and gives you a shimmery glow without needing to add another highlighter.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but this goes exactly where I put it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this brand and it is very pigmented and the color is pretty.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I thought it would be too much as a blush</li>
            <li> The compact is a bit small, but the blush is good quality.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty light skin tone with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I is highly pigmented so you might wanna try it on your arm first.</li>
            <li> wet is more intense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I really have to pack it on to have the color show up.  </li>
            <li> I have light to medium olive skin with yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li> I think it is very flattering.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blush</li>
            <li> it might be too much for the daytime ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shimmering</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m really fair-skinned.)  </li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think so.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented, not a strong color</li>
            <li> Looks pretty natural to me!</li>
            <li> My skin is a very pale olive and the slight gold sheen blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Besides, the seller (Lucky Girl) had the same price+shipping as an official web-site and the shipping  from the UK was super fast (only 6 days).</li>
            <li> I blend with a Wet N Wild shade that&#x27;s brighter for a pop more of color.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HIGHLY BLENDABLE, WITH A HINT OF GOLD, NOTHING GARISH ON YOUR CHEEKS.  </li>
            <li> Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A GOLDEN TAN OF MIXED RACE,</li>
            <li> The pink color is very pretty and you will have a slight gold shimmer on top.  </li>
            <li> I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK.</li>
            <li> I think you see more of the gold shimmer than the actual pink blush.</li>
            <li> This is very, very shimmering with low pigment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same</li>
            <li> It is a TRUE pink gold blush.</li>
            <li> When swatched, it&#x27;s very pigmented and the color is similar to Nars&#x27; Orgasm</li>
            <li> AND IT LOOKS SO SOFT AND NATURAL</li>
            <li> AS SHEER AS YOU WANT, BUT IT IS ALSO VERY BUILDABLE FOR A DEEPER COLOR.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with the outcome on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Had the right amount of pink and peach with a hint of gold shimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got large pores on my cheeks which love to pick up chunks of glitter and make me look like I&#x27;m getting ready to attend a roller blading party with the other 7th graders from 1996 but the shimmer in this diffuses on the skin, leaving a subtle glow.</li>
            <li> but since my skin is very oily this is on par with how long high end and longwear blushes last on me.</li>
            <li> I love that it doubles as a highlighter, but the shimmer does mean you have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> So, there is not only more product inside, but it is also small enough to carry it in your purse or take it on a trip.</li>
            <li> I CAN BARELY SEE IT ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> Not really pink or peachy for me.</li>
            <li> you need to look at the swatches online, there are plenty that look SCARY in the pic but come off so beautiful, and they are small but it is 8g of product.</li>
            <li> In a swatch, depending on how you position your hand, it looks pink with a golden undertone and others it looks gold with a pink undertone.</li>
            <li> very pretty color, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Really nice subtle shimmer if you have pale skin!</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow, but the product was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the color last all day which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> This, for me, is a little better, because the NARS one was a little dusty while applying</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the case is hard to open.</li>
            <li> Very subtle color, won&#x27;t really show up on olive/latina skin tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 other colors.  </li>
            <li> even though the pan is small it should last for quite some time !</li>
            <li> So, no success at all with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be surprised if you got a broken item from this seller.</li>
            <li> (I prefer other cheaper brands!</li>
            <li> I ALSO TOUCH MY CHIN, NOSE, AND FOREHEAD WITH MY BRUSH, TO GIVE ME A SLIGHTLY FLUSHED, ALL AROUND COLOR.  </li>
            <li> wish there was less gold</li>
            <li> maybe just add a little bit of your powder after you applied the brush just to minimize the shimmer ...</li>
            <li> But... it is very hard to open.</li>
            <li> use dry for subtle..</li>
            <li> For me Sleek is the Big Secret in makeup.</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the blush was all broken up when I received it.</li>
            <li> There is a bit less glitter, but it works in my favor!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pale so for me</li>
            <li> To people who are saying that the Sleek blushes are small, I&#x27;d like to respond that they are just compact.</li>
            <li> I brought this to replace, but I think I almost prefer the subtle youthful glow this creates.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never received anything broken.</li>
            <li> i am a lover of all things coral and saw some pictures of this online, i was skeptical that it would be chalky or powdery</li>
            <li> , i feel like sometimes this blush can make you look cold</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing, because each time I use it a bunch ends up on the floor. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> omg this thing is tinnyyyy&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS SO NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE I CAN BARELY SEE IT ON MY FACE AND I HAVE TO DIP MY BRUSH LIKE 5 TIMES INTO THIS BLUSH IT HAS NO PIGMENTATION WHATSOEVER I REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE FROM SLEEK MAKE UP ...</li>
            <li> For me Sleek is the Big Secret in makeup. It is imho the BEST for eyeshadows and blush and not too shabby for lipstick either. This rose gold is a dupe, really, for the famous Nars Orgasm which I never even bothered to buy as this is soooo beautiful on one&#x27;s cheeks. Blush &amp; their eyeshadows need just a light touch for full color, so pigmented. The e/s stays on forever, I never bother with primer when I use Sleek. Have never noticed the blush smearing or wearing off either, works well whether I use liquid or powder foundation. And the price? Unbeatable! Only wish they would sell in drugstores in the US. Will def buy again here if I want faster delivery lol.</li>
            <li> I love Sleek products, this blush is no exception. It&#x27;s super pigmented and can be used as eyeshadow as well.  This is a great seller,  they ship fast and I&#x27;ve never received anything broken. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This coral shade is very warm with a sandy brown-orange shade... I feel like this shade will look great on almost everyone that wants a natural look!!</li>
            <li> This blush is beautiful it does have a bit of shimmer but its gorgeous. I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> This blush is just okay.  When swatched, it&#x27;s very pigmented and the color is similar to Nars&#x27; Orgasm but when applied, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very pigmented.  I feel like I really have to pack it on to have the color show up.  I think you see more of the gold shimmer than the actual pink blush. It&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to Nars Orgasm but I&#x27;ll continue to stick to Nars.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, but arrived cracked after a month of waiting for it. That&#x27;s disappointing, because each time I use it a bunch ends up on the floor. :( Otherwise, the color is lovely. I blend with a Wet N Wild shade that&#x27;s brighter for a pop more of color.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush was discontinued recently so I have been searching for something comparable. I found this and it is a perfect match to the $20 blush that I used to buy!</li>
            <li> Love it, came earlier than I thought it would, no damage to the product. The product itself looks amazing true to picture shown!</li>
            <li> very pigmented, use a light hand when applying is my advise.</li>
            <li> you need to look at the swatches online, there are plenty that look SCARY in the pic but come off so beautiful, and they are small but it is 8g of product. Nars orgasm is 4.8g for 30 dollars, and rose gold is an AMAZING dupe. ive seen blogs that show that rose gold is actually MORE pigmented. I got rose gold, flamingo, lifes a peach, and pomegranate. they are so rich and the only one thats extremely shimmery is rose gold which is why its such a good dupe. I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sleek product so I only have much wonderful things to say... from the pigmentation to the wonderful thoughtful packaging .... this makeup brand is my top favorite and to find them on here on Amazon is a true blessing. I&#x27;m very happy with this blushâ™¥ Now to collect more colors :)</li>
            <li> I have light to medium olive skin with yellow undertones.  This blush looks very good with my skin tone.  A little goes a long way and the color last all day which is a definite plus.  The pink color is very pretty and you will have a slight gold shimmer on top.  I think it is very flattering.  This is my new favorite brand for blush.  I&#x27;ve ordered 2 other colors.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the case is hard to open.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush, it gives you a very pretty glow ... it might be too much for the daytime ... maybe just add a little bit of your powder after you applied the brush just to minimize the shimmer ... I don&#x27;t have a problem with that but just in case you don&#x27;t like it, that&#x27;s my advice. I is highly pigmented so you might wanna try it on your arm first.</li>
            <li> Sleek products are always good quality. It is nice color and looks amazingly natural. But... it is very hard to open.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful. Came very quickly. Love it</li>
            <li> Great color if you don&#x27;t want something too bold. Really nice subtle shimmer if you have pale skin!</li>
            <li> It arrives way sooner the order said it would. The color is beautiful!  color payoff is awesome and it is smooth going on  I love Sleek brand! ill be ordering a lot more of this brand</li>
            <li> I like this blush, but it does have a lot of shimmer though. I think this will look better as a highlight other than that very beautiful and worth a try.</li>
            <li> this is the most beautiful blush, i have ever seen. i am a lover of all things coral and saw some pictures of this online, i was skeptical that it would be chalky or powdery but it is silky smooth to the touch. the color is a warm toned coral with micro SHIMMER NOT GLITTER of light pink and gold running through it. as someone who has absolutely so color in the face this not only makes me look alive but happy! its the perfect shade for anyone in my opinion, i actually like this so much better than my nars orgasm blush because there&#x27;s no glitter and since its a bit warmer, i feel like sometimes this blush can make you look cold or like you&#x27;ve gone for a run because of the cool undertones in it. i will be repurchasing this when i am out although it might be a while since this is so pigmented and the packaging is so durable. hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s very shimmering (:</li>
            <li> good strong color - can be blended with others</li>
            <li> I think this color is beautiful. It is a TRUE pink gold blush. In a swatch, depending on how you position your hand, it looks pink with a golden undertone and others it looks gold with a pink undertone. When I first got it, I thought it would be too much as a blush but it reflects beautifully. Also, looks great as an eyeshadow. Got to love make up with duality!</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous!!! Got the rose gold..use it on eyes and cheeks. use dry for subtle..wet is more intense. ive been trying to find a rose gold... Jackpot! Love this!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blush. Perfect for a natural sun kissed look!</li>
            <li> very bright for my taste, exaggerated blush for fair skin during the day a lot of ... I applied escharcha time before leaving home ... &#x3D; (I prefer other cheaper brands! good packaging good time of arrival at my destination.</li>
            <li> This blush is amazing I love how with the light you can see the gold shimmer and the coral undertone. Its my favorite blush right now</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented, not a strong color and it&#x27;s got a kind of glittery shade that highlights the cheeks without being too obvious. Perfect product.</li>
            <li> nice glow, pink and gold. love it!</li>
            <li> This is very, very shimmering with low pigment.  You have to apply a lot to get any color and then you wind up looking like a disco ball (and I&#x27;m really fair-skinned.)  And it made me breakout on the first day.  So, no success at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Talk about a NARS Super Orgasm dupe for a third of the price and it shipped surprisingly quickly ! It is very pigmented and even though the pan is small it should last for quite some time !</li>
            <li> I love this blush! Received this item within 3 days of ordering it. This was my first time using this brand and it is very pigmented and the color is pretty. I have since purchased many colors from Sleek and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very subtle color, won&#x27;t really show up on olive/latina skin tones. Shows up great on pale skinned people.</li>
            <li> The color is great as well as the pigmentation ...the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the blush was all broken up when I received it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BLUSH!!  I HAD BEEN A FOLLOWER OF ANOTHER BLUSH FAN FAVORITE, BUT I BRUSHED THAT ASIDE FOR THE ROSE GOLD.  I&#x27;M A GOLDEN TAN OF MIXED RACE, AND IT LOOKS SO SOFT AND NATURAL ON E.  IT CAN GO ON AS SHEER AS YOU WANT, BUT IT IS ALSO VERY BUILDABLE FOR A DEEPER COLOR.  IT&#x27;S HIGHLY BLENDABLE, WITH A HINT OF GOLD, NOTHING GARISH ON YOUR CHEEKS.  I ALSO TOUCH MY CHIN, NOSE, AND FOREHEAD WITH MY BRUSH, TO GIVE ME A SLIGHTLY FLUSHED, ALL AROUND COLOR.  I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ON MY LIPS, BUT COULD BE PRETTY.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL BLUSH, LASTING A GOOD 8 HOURS.  MY NEW FAVORITE, AND GO TO.</li>
            <li> Very nice color &amp; packaging!</li>
            <li> very pretty color, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this blush, it is a good dupe for Orgasm by Nars. It doesnt have the color pay out that Orgasm does, but It is beautiful and has a high gold sheen. If you like that sheen get it, it is not glittery at all which I like.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I dropped it the very first day but I fixed it love the color pay off</li>
            <li> I love this blush a lot. I have a pretty light skin tone with yellow undertones. The pigment lasts most of the day although there is some fading. Buildable application and not noticeably shimmery. Looks pretty natural to me! I picked this up because it was compared to NARS Orgasm blush. No idea if it&#x27;s a good dupe but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Had the right amount of pink and peach with a hint of gold shimmer. Pleasantly surprised with the outcome on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Just as pictured &amp; described. The color is said by many is a dupe for NARS Orgasm. I don&#x27;t really think so. This Sleek color is more pigmented and leaves a goldy sheen on my skin. Not really pink or peachy for me. Still really pretty and gives you a shimmery glow without needing to add another highlighter. Thanks! Fast shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li> Beautiful gorgeous blush arrive packaged well protected.</li>
            <li> I just got this blush and tried it on, it has pretty good pigmentation and the gold in it gives off this beautiful glow. I can definitely see me wearing this as my summer blush.</li>
            <li> This is one of the prettiest blushes I&#x27;ve come across.  It&#x27;s the perfect shade for highlighting the tops of your cheeks!  The peachy coral shade is gorgeous with the perfect amount of gold shimmer.  Great summer shade.</li>
            <li> OMG! I do believe this color is BETTER than Nars Orgasm. It&#x27;s exactly the same but I have to go over orgasm several times for it to swatch as good as the sleek rose gold. I love it and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on. It gives a beautiful natural glow. You must get it!</li>
            <li> This blush is very lovely and pigmented. It has a glow to it but no chunks of glitter which i love! The color isn&#x27;t really true to picture for all of the sleek blushes on amazon. Instead I would recommend looking at the shades on the official sleek website but still coming back and buying from this seller! I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK. I was amazed. Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally. I&#x27;d be surprised if you got a broken item from this seller. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many sleek products because I love them so much and you can&#x27;t find them in the U.S.  This color in particular is pretty darn amazing....and I&#x27;m going to say works well for the majority of skin color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
            <li> absolutely the most wonderful blush ever! i am in love</li>
            <li> The blush is a great color and gives skin a natural, healthy look. I love that it doubles as a highlighter, but the shimmer does mean you have to be careful not to apply too much. Otherwise, you look light you&#x27;ve sprayed your cheeks with metallic paint. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The color of this blush is gorgeous, both in the pan and on the skin. If I had to describe it, I would say it is very much Rose Gold as the name states (there are a million swatches online if you feel inclined to search for them). I&#x27;ve got large pores on my cheeks which love to pick up chunks of glitter and make me look like I&#x27;m getting ready to attend a roller blading party with the other 7th graders from 1996 but the shimmer in this diffuses on the skin, leaving a subtle glow. Although it is bright, it is pretty sheer and buildable (I&#x27;m pale so for me this is a good thing). The wear time is pretty good given the price, I probably get 4 hours out of it but since my skin is very oily this is on par with how long high end and longwear blushes last on me.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as the cream NARS blush I brought this to replace, but I think I almost prefer the subtle youthful glow this creates. Shipping was slow, but the product was worth the wait. I love the sturdy packaging. My skin is a very pale olive and the slight gold sheen blends wonderfully. I think the multifaceted color dimension would work on a variety of skin tones too! I cannot wait to try out more color possibilities!</li>
            <li> To people who are saying that the Sleek blushes are small, I&#x27;d like to respond that they are just compact. There is just no extra plastic framing the product. For a comparison: Nars Orgasm blush looks larger than the Sleek packaging, BUT there are 0,27 oz of the product in Sleek, while only 0.16oz  in Nars. So, there is not only more product inside, but it is also small enough to carry it in your purse or take it on a trip. Finally, loved-loved the color. Gorgeous! Besides, the seller (Lucky Girl) had the same price+shipping as an official web-site and the shipping  from the UK was super fast (only 6 days).</li>
            <li> verrrryyyy pigmented. wish there was less gold</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have NARS Orgasm, and this is a perfect dupe! There is a bit less glitter, but it works in my favor! This, for me, is a little better, because the NARS one was a little dusty while applying but this goes exactly where I put it.</li>
            <li> Indeed this is a good dupe for NARS Org. And I will always order Sleek Makeup. It is a Gorgeous Blush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I read it was a good economiccal dupe for NARS Orgasm blush, and the reviews were right!  So glad I bought this.  The compact is a bit small, but the blush is good quality.  It has good pigment with a nice gold undertone, and the blush doesn&#x27;t crumble like many other cheaper ones do.  Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
