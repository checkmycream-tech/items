    <ol>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Introducing is GREAT as a pre mascara for lengthening lashes and getting lower lashes also!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Perfect to get in the lash line.</li>
            <li>I was not at all impressed with the brush on this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara you can find.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>A good product!</li>
            <li>I am happy about the product and the way it works, however I was quite dissatisfied with the size of it for the price.</li>
            <li>One coat works great for day wear</li>
            <li>I like the idea and wand is great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s AMAZING!)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this but wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product from IT.I</li>
            <li>The absolute best lash product available.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>this product does an OK job at enhancing eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>(I bought thinking it would do better), so</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara at bringing out smaller eyelashes at corners of eyes.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for that maybe I would love it like everyone else.</li>
            <li>Gives more definition to your mascara.</li>
            <li>Pulled out many of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used before and was happy to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Not any better than cheap drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>It does glide on quite easily</li>
            <li>I found it easy to remove it using Noxzema and a damp paper towel.  </li>
            <li>Love for eyeliner and mascara doesn&#x27;t make lashes as full as Mally;s</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>This product does give your lashes great length and extra volume.  </li>
            <li>I love the little brush, it works great</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care for it, nothing special</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much product, so requires dipping into the tube many times while applying.  </li>
            <li>I Usually love all &#x27;It cosmetics&#x27; and get the results they claim to accomplish, but this product seems &#x27;whimpy&#x27; and cost too much to continue to purchase without the results the company is claiming.</li>
            <li>You can also get close to lashes for full coverage.</li>
            <li>love IT cosmetics and highly recommend them to anybody and this product</li>
            <li>I review makeup and heard great things about the IT Cosmetics Tightline Full Lash Length Black Primer.</li>
            <li>This mascara is a cool concept, but for the price i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, I am extremely sensitive to many things and most mascara in particular.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara, gets all your lashes in a few swipes and never clumps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price at all for the amount you get -</li>
            <li>It is well worth it for the eyelash enhancement alone.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, light eyelashes that are long</li>
            <li>I love this mascara -- I use it as my only mascara -- primer and all.  </li>
            <li>it flakes, but love the tiny brush!</li>
            <li>but I have also put on a layer regular mascara on top.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t always see because they are more blonde.</li>
            <li>I love the final effect.</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>When this first came out I tried it and have never stopped.  </li>
            <li>Loved the small brush, but couldn&#x27;t tell there was any line.</li>
            <li>I know this is a great product, but when I received the item, it was apparently too old to use and was dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and makes for a good look to lining you upper lid without being too dramatic.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your eyes pop</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and It Cosmetics Tightline</li>
            <li>reflection on the seller as item was delivered fast, thank youâ˜º</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as a primer that also lines your eyes by getting very close to the lashline.  </li>
            <li>Even when I get close to the lashline, I don&#x27;t see much lining capability.  </li>
            <li>Their Real and Miss Manga mascaras (I forget who makes the Miss Manga mascara, I think</li>
            <li>It really makes your lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>I really like Tightline and often use it alone and don&#x27;t add additional mascara.</li>
            <li>so it gets used fast.</li>
            <li>Yes it does get closer to the root of your lashes and the brush separates the lashes really well, but it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; or tightline effect it should have.</li>
            <li>wand is more than pencil thin &amp; after many applications you still have no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never spent this amount of money on a makeup product other than foundation, and bought it from Amazon because I know they are great about taking back items.  </li>
            <li>Tiny brush allows you to get right up on the lid, enhancing even the tiniest of lashes!</li>
            <li>this particular cosmetic is not at all what it is advertised.  </li>
            <li>The look of eyeliner has not yet been achieved, however I may need to practice my application skills in order to see that particular feature.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of a learning curve to learn how to do the &amp;#34;tightline&amp;#34; but with a little practice it works great as a liner as well as a mascara.</li>
            <li>I can live without this product.</li>
            <li>I love the small brush on this for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes look natural.</li>
            <li>I am getting the product directly from the Make-up co. on-line.</li>
            <li>especially since you can get 2 of the same exact product</li>
            <li>Generally within a minute of applying something I am sensitive to, I will get a headache and have to remove it.  </li>
            <li>and I put on an additional coat for more dramatic eyes if I want them at night.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are not careful with the brush, you will end up with primer on your upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li>Generally when you buy mascara the bigger portion is the product and the smaller portion is the brush/applicator.</li>

            <li> Generally when you buy mascara the bigger portion is the product and the smaller portion is the brush/applicator.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews all I can think of is maybe I received some that were old.  </li>
            <li> No thick heavy lashes.</li>
            <li> This really gets all the lashes without clumping or being very heavy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t much product in the tube</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced similar to other products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> yet you have a long brush.</li>
            <li> it irritated my eyes 2 maybe because I already have long thick lashes it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
            <li> but i recieved the product king of dry</li>
            <li> The flaw is that is smudges/smears so if you are not constantly checking your eyes you&#x27;ll have black smudge under your bottom eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not only does it prime your lashes in black, but it looks as if you applied eye liner.  </li>
            <li> and you can get down to the very base of the lash which is great.</li>
            <li> Other primers work just as well</li>
            <li> The brush is unique, but not worth the crazy price.</li>
            <li> a hard time doing my left las h line without poking myself in eye!!!!</li>
            <li> Good base mascara for thin lashes like mine.</li>
            <li> The brush is small to help to reach all your lashes, however the brush is not strong enough, it is actually very weak so getting to all your lashes and actually extending them to make them look fuller does not really happens.  </li>
            <li> I am not used to applying 2 coats of mascara, so it is a little time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Their are a few reasons I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something lighter to use everyday.</li>
            <li> product seemed to be dried out</li>
            <li> product is dried out, does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I wore this all day, no headache or any other negative reaction.  </li>
            <li> Although I do not find it to be quite as dramatic as the infomercial touts, it definitely enhances all my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I had 2 small flakes, much less than ordinary mascara and not anything I would complain about.  </li>
            <li> With this product it&#x27;s reversed so you get very little product</li>
            <li> Primer.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using IT COSMETICS for quite sometime and must say, I find this product not only expensive, but does not do what it claims it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this,</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The brush is very thin and the bristles are tiny.  </li>
            <li> This mascara primer is not supposed to turn hard and crunchy on your lashes</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First complaint I have had with IT COSMETICS~</li>
            <li> Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very thin with no bristles.  </li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the results and would not purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> tighline was disappointing.</li>
            <li> if its like that or the one i got was bad</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe I got a bad tube.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
            <li> I bought it here because qvc was sold out but was very disappointed when I received it.</li>

            <li> Good base mascara for thin lashes like mine.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  You can use it as a primer or just as a mascara.  Even if I am running out of the house, I stop and put some on.  It really makes your eyes pop</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and It Cosmetics Tightline Primer.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using IT COSMETICS for quite sometime and must say, I find this product not only expensive, but does not do what it claims it does.&lt;br /&gt;I like the HELLO LASHES MASCARA..stick with the mascara everyone.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and you do not need this primer if used with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The wand is more than pencil thin &amp; after many applications you still have no results.&lt;br /&gt;No reflection on the seller as item was delivered fast, thank youâ˜º&lt;br /&gt;First complaint I have had with IT COSMETICS~</li>
            <li> this product does an OK job at enhancing eye lashes.  Other primers work just as well (I bought thinking it would do better), so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best product on the market.  It&#x27;s priced similar to other products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I am happy about the product and the way it works, however I was quite dissatisfied with the size of it for the price. Generally when you buy mascara the bigger portion is the product and the smaller portion is the brush/applicator. With this product it&#x27;s reversed so you get very little product yet you have a long brush. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price at all for the amount you get - especially since you can get 2 of the same exact product/same size/same price on qvc. I bought it here because qvc was sold out but was very disappointed when I received it. I think that &amp;#34;It Cosmetics&amp;#34; should offer all of their customers the same deal that they give on qvc. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a TV shopping network.  It&#x27;s advertised as a primer that also lines your eyes by getting very close to the lashline.  As a primer it&#x27;s good.  Even when I get close to the lashline, I don&#x27;t see much lining capability.  The brush is very thin with no bristles.  It doesn&#x27;t hold much product, so requires dipping into the tube many times while applying.  I can live without this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the It Cosmetics Tightline Mascara Primer from a television shopping network.  I actually got a three-pack of them.  The brush is very thin and the bristles are tiny.  This mascara primer is not supposed to turn hard and crunchy on your lashes but it did on my lashes.  Reading the other reviews all I can think of is maybe I received some that were old.  It does glide on quite easily and you can get down to the very base of the lash which is great.</li>
            <li> Love for eyeliner and mascara doesn&#x27;t make lashes as full as Mally;s but it&#x27;s a nice product from IT.I will not order another one!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have a hard time doing my left las h line without poking myself in eye!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara -- I use it as my only mascara -- primer and all.  One coat works great for day wear and I put on an additional coat for more dramatic eyes if I want them at night.  There is a little bit of a learning curve to learn how to do the &amp;#34;tightline&amp;#34; but with a little practice it works great as a liner as well as a mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on just as described.  The flaw is that is smudges/smears so if you are not constantly checking your eyes you&#x27;ll have black smudge under your bottom eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this, but I don&#x27;t hate it either. I&#x27;m going to use it up before deciding if I&#x27;ll buy again maybe by that time I&#x27;ll be convinced. I Usually love all &#x27;It cosmetics&#x27; and get the results they claim to accomplish, but this product seems &#x27;whimpy&#x27; and cost too much to continue to purchase without the results the company is claiming.</li>
            <li> it flakes, but love the tiny brush!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I love the little brush, it works great, it doesn&#x27;t run, it stays on all day and all night. I use it by itself quite a bit but I have also put on a layer regular mascara on top. I would suggest this for anybody. I have fine, light eyelashes that are long but you can&#x27;t always see because they are more blonde. This really gets all the lashes without clumping or being very heavy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she stated that the product did not work, no difference when using this product with mascara or not.  Why use it if it does not make any difference.</li>
            <li> I love the small brush on this for my lower lashes. No clumps. My eye lashes look natural. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I like the idea and wand is great but i recieved the product king of dry im not sure if its like that or the one i got was bad</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in excellent condition. No problems at all. Would do business with them again.&lt;br /&gt;I love IT cosmetics and highly recommend them to anybody and this product&lt;br /&gt;Introducing is GREAT as a pre mascara for lengthening lashes and getting lower lashes also!</li>
            <li> This product does give your lashes great length and extra volume.  I am not used to applying 2 coats of mascara, so it is a little time consuming.  Also, if you are not careful with the brush, you will end up with primer on your upper eye lid.  I love the final effect.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara at bringing out smaller eyelashes at corners of eyes. You can also get close to lashes for full coverage. I will definatley use this again</li>
            <li> Loved the small brush, but couldn&#x27;t tell there was any line. Looked like regular mascara. Woudn&#x27;t buy it again. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes water but it might just be me.  It did make my lashes look fuller.  A good product!</li>
            <li> I like this product and only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> this particular cosmetic is not at all what it is advertised.  I am unhappy with the results and would not purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I review makeup and heard great things about the IT Cosmetics Tightline Full Lash Length Black Primer. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Their are a few reasons I didn&#x27;t like this product. 1 it irritated my eyes 2 maybe because I already have long thick lashes it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me. The mane reason I don&#x27;t like it is that it makes my eyes burn. If it wasn&#x27;t for that maybe I would love it like everyone else. Who knows, maybe I got a bad tube.  For now I&#x27;ll stick to my Benifit Their Real and Miss Manga mascaras (I forget who makes the Miss Manga mascara, I think Maybelline. Either way for a drugstore mascara it&#x27;s AMAZING!)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Tiny brush allows you to get right up on the lid, enhancing even the tiniest of lashes!</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes look longer. I was looking for something lighter to use everyday. And this makes the trick.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, gets all your lashes in a few swipes and never clumps.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using this product.  I am very pleased with the outcome.  Although I do not find it to be quite as dramatic as the infomercial touts, it definitely enhances all my lashes.  The look of eyeliner has not yet been achieved, however I may need to practice my application skills in order to see that particular feature.  At any rate, even if my eyes don&#x27;t appear to have eyeliner when using this product, I will still continue to use it.  It is well worth it for the eyelash enhancement alone.  I applied the product alone as I found it to be sufficient.  Also, I am extremely sensitive to many things and most mascara in particular.  Generally within a minute of applying something I am sensitive to, I will get a headache and have to remove it.  I wore this all day, no headache or any other negative reaction.  Some reviewers stated that the product flaked.  I had 2 small flakes, much less than ordinary mascara and not anything I would complain about.  I found it easy to remove it using Noxzema and a damp paper towel.  I have never spent this amount of money on a makeup product other than foundation, and bought it from Amazon because I know they are great about taking back items.  This item will not be going back!</li>
            <li> Perfect to get in the lash line. Gives more definition to your mascara. I will definitely not be without it!</li>
            <li> I was not at all impressed with the brush on this mascara.  The brush is small to help to reach all your lashes, however the brush is not strong enough, it is actually very weak so getting to all your lashes and actually extending them to make them look fuller does not really happens.  I WILL NOT RECCOMED THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> When this first came out I tried it and have never stopped.  Not only does it prime your lashes in black, but it looks as if you applied eye liner.  Try it once and you will never stop using it!!</li>
            <li> I know this is a great product, but when I received the item, it was apparently too old to use and was dry.  I am getting the product directly from the Make-up co. on-line.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size.  Pulled out many of my lashes.  The wand is flimsy and bent shortly after I purchased it.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is fine. Not any better than cheap drugstore brand. The brush is unique, but not worth the crazy price.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this 10 stars plus. The absolute best lash product available. Lengthens and lines all in one.</li>
            <li> I really like Tightline and often use it alone and don&#x27;t add additional mascara. My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t much product in the tube so it gets used fast. It is the way to go however if you want to define each lash.</li>
            <li> tighline was disappointing. did not make my lashes look any longer or thicker than regular mascara. product seemed to be dried out</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for it, nothing special</li>
            <li> Best mascara you can find. Gives color and separation without clumping. No thick heavy lashes. I love it! Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy and makes for a good look to lining you upper lid without being too dramatic.  I&#x27;ve used before and was happy to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a cool concept, but for the price i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. I was so excited to try this but wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the results. Yes it does get closer to the root of your lashes and the brush separates the lashes really well, but it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34; or tightline effect it should have. I&#x27;m not sure if i will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread. Love it. Thank u</li>
            <li> product is dried out, does not perform as advertised. I think I got an old one, it is not even wet nor does it leave a tightline when applied as instructed.</li>
