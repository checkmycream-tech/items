    <ol>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>For the price this is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent I will order again.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best colognes i have ever  used..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Agree with everyone else&#x27;s assessment... Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li>Great price smells good</li>
            <li>This is a must buy great quality for price and gets me a lot of compliments also this lasts about 8 hours or more..</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m in love with this one, however I do think it is a very nice quality fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it is a pretty calm fragrance and very pleasant to wear.  </li>
            <li>I know there are a lot of comparisons to Creeds Silver Mountain Water which costs 10 times more.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference to me is this one has just a bit more metallic smell to it and is more linear of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>people would not be able to.</li>
            <li>Much more synthetic.</li>
            <li>Great price very affordable.</li>
            <li>Yes, ofcourse Creed is better than this</li>
            <li>but it costs 10-20x more than this perfume.</li>
            <li>Projection and longevity is actually better on my skin than with SMW.</li>
            <li>and I must say it is the best smelling fragrance I have smelled for such a price point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another 2-3 more.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, not too strong and not too light</li>
            <li>I bought this after researching cheap colognes that smell great and this one really is a gem.  </li>
            <li>the guy on youtube who said that it smells just like or really close to &amp;#34;Creed silver mountain water&amp;#34; made a really good joke.</li>
            <li>It then settles into a nice, fresh, clean, alpine, outdoorsy scent.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this perfume for a long time , is amazing and good price</li>
            <li>The item was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great initially.</li>
            <li>I feel very fresh and clean with this one.  </li>
            <li>When you first spray it it is very potent and almost too much</li>
            <li>Very strong and last all day dont like the top note but</li>
            <li>Oh, and make sure you don&#x27;t put too much on as you can give yourself a headache as well as everyone else in the room.</li>
            <li>Very nice projection in first 5 hours and later on</li>
            <li>so it is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>One more for myself and another 1-2 as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin and after the first spray I did feel a slightly hot sensation.</li>
            <li>I can tell you this stuff smells good and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I will be trying multiple ones from the Al Rahab line now because of how amazing this one is.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for 35ml.</li>
            <li>Smell very good last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Smell just like creed and bond 9 and last longer love it.</li>
            <li>It is a close skin scent after the first hour or so but really does quite well for me.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, smells good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain on the street</li>
            <li>A lot of people compare this Creed&#x27;s Silver Mountain Water and they do smell very close.</li>
            <li>Goes on smelling very synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived very promptly</li>
            <li>It absolutely smells like something that a designer may put out and is even compared to niche fragrances.</li>
            <li>Unique scent, wish it came in a larger bottle</li>
            <li>Was kicking back watching TV when I caught the sweet smell.</li>
            <li>the dry down smell really good</li>
            <li>It is much more earthy and green.  </li>
            <li>but it settles down very quickly, like within five minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>you could still smell it near the skin.</li>
            <li>There is still snow at the summit but it is melting and a stream is running through fresh grass and new spring flowers on the way down to the valley below.  </li>
            <li>Just a personal note for those with sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>Very close scent to Silver Mountain water by Creed for much less.</li>

            <li> i had it for the price they don&#x27;t relive, it last a long time on ur body</li>
            <li> This is an easy blind buy because of the price</li>
            <li> i could barrely find it essential for use with any of my other fregrances.</li>
            <li> I even went to Neimen Marcus to try Creed Silver Mountain Water and there is no difference in the opening notes, even the dry down is also similar.</li>
            <li> This little guy should not be past over just because of the small bottle, plain packaging, and cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I only gave this four stars because I&#x27;m just not sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe a little on the dry down.  </li>
            <li> The opening note is a little chemical, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smells like india, heavy musk and spices...</li>
            <li> Slightly less longevity at least on my skin.</li>
            <li> I dont usually write alot of reviews but this one warrants one.</li>
            <li> it is extremely hard to pick out the differences</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find this in a department store.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what it smells like to me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take that to mean it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> just disgusting and a waste of money and time</li>
            <li> its really bad</li>
            <li> The smell is putrid and sickening.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great price smells good</li>
            <li> Smells great! I know there are a lot of comparisons to Creeds Silver Mountain Water which costs 10 times more. I couldn&#x27;t tell you because I have never smelled Silver Mountain Water. I can tell you this stuff smells good and lasts a very long time. Oh, and make sure you don&#x27;t put too much on as you can give yourself a headache as well as everyone else in the room.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, smells good. I would buy it again for the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is putrid and sickening. Smells like india, heavy musk and spices...just disgusting and a waste of money and time</li>
            <li> The item was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great initially. However, it only lasts for 10 minutes on my skin before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> A lot of people compare this Creed&#x27;s Silver Mountain Water and they do smell very close. I&#x27;d say in the 90-95% similar range. The biggest difference to me is this one has just a bit more metallic smell to it and is more linear of a fragrance. Don&#x27;t take that to mean it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s awesome! Spraying one on either arm it is extremely hard to pick out the differences and I&#x27;m certain on the street people would not be able to. For the price this is one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I see no reason to purchase Silver Mountain Water again after owning this. I will be trying multiple ones from the Al Rahab line now because of how amazing this one is.</li>
            <li> close to SMW. Much more synthetic. I got 0 compliments</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy great quality for price and gets me a lot of compliments also this lasts about 8 hours or more..I would definitely buy again..... Kevin from Jamaica</li>
            <li> I used it once and then gave it away.</li>
            <li> Goes on smelling very synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it to be similar to Creed Silver Mountain Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little on the dry down.  Otherwise reminds me of grandmothers house.</li>
            <li> Smell just like creed and bond 9 and last longer love it.</li>
            <li> Smell very good last for a long time. Great price very affordable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes i have ever  used.. I even went to Neimen Marcus to try Creed Silver Mountain Water and there is no difference in the opening notes, even the dry down is also similar. Yes, ofcourse Creed is better than this but it costs 10-20x more than this perfume. I will buy it again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> i have been using this perfume for a long time , is amazing and good price .sometimes when i tell my friends i had it for the price they don&#x27;t relive, it last a long time on ur body</li>
            <li> Save your money on Creed&#x27;s Silver Mountain Water and Bond No.9&#x27;s Hamptons. This smells JUST like it. Projection and longevity is actually better on my skin than with SMW.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, not too strong and not too light</li>
            <li> Very close scent to Silver Mountain water by Creed for much less. Slightly less longevity at least on my skin. Very nice projection in first 5 hours and later on you could still smell it near the skin. The opening note is a little chemical, but you get what you pay for. Well worth the money for 35ml.</li>
            <li> its really bad i could barrely find it essential for use with any of my other fregrances. the guy on youtube who said that it smells just like or really close to &amp;#34;Creed silver mountain water&amp;#34; made a really good joke.</li>
            <li> This little guy should not be past over just because of the small bottle, plain packaging, and cheap price.  I bought this after researching cheap colognes that smell great and this one really is a gem.  This is eau de parfum so it is pretty strong.  When you first spray it it is very potent and almost too much but it settles down very quickly, like within five minutes or so.  It then settles into a nice, fresh, clean, alpine, outdoorsy scent.  I picture a mountain in spring time.  There is still snow at the summit but it is melting and a stream is running through fresh grass and new spring flowers on the way down to the valley below.  I did four sprays and this lasted all day.  It is a close skin scent after the first hour or so but really does quite well for me.  People say this smells like Silver Mountain Water from Creed.  I don&#x27;t know what that smells like.  If I can save $300 and buy this guy I&#x27;ll do that all day.  This could be a unisex fragrance and some guys may find this too flowery but it is a pretty calm fragrance and very pleasant to wear.  I feel very fresh and clean with this one.  It is not an aquatic.  It is much more earthy and green.  This is an easy blind buy because of the price and you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find this in a department store.  I only gave this four stars because I&#x27;m just not sure if I&#x27;m in love with this one, however I do think it is a very nice quality fragrance.</li>
            <li> I dont usually write alot of reviews but this one warrants one. I purchased this because of the online comparisons to the much more expensive silver mountain water, which I dont have to compare, but for the price I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very promptly and I tried it the very next day and I must say it is the best smelling fragrance I have smelled for such a price point. It absolutely smells like something that a designer may put out and is even compared to niche fragrances. Dont hesitate, buy this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Very strong and last all day dont like the top note but the dry down smell really good</li>
            <li> Unique scent, wish it came in a larger bottle</li>
            <li> Ordered it on a Tuesday, received it by Friday afternoon. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree with everyone else&#x27;s assessment... Great buy for the price! I&#x27;m pleased. Sprays on with a semi- metallic smell but somewhere between 40-60 mins it evens out into an almost like raspberries/light metal type finish. At least that&#x27;s what it smells like to me (on me). Was kicking back watching TV when I caught the sweet smell. Took me a minute to realize it was me (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is so dang affordable I&#x27;m going to buy another 2-3 more. One more for myself and another 1-2 as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin and after the first spray I did feel a slightly hot sensation. Just a personal note for those with sensitive skin as well. It went away after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased!</li>
            <li> Smells just like creed SMW, but last longer on my skin.</li>
