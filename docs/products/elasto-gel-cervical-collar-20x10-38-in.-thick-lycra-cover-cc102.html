            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great idea, need a bit more refinement to be&lt;br /&gt;really effective.</li>
            <li>Immediately it felt better!  </li>
            <li>I kept this on for 30 minutes, it was comfortable, and worked great.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely</li>
            <li>Neither is effective.</li>
            <li>me tell you the results have been spectacular.</li>
            <li>Handy and effective</li>
            <li>okay, not as good as the two shoulder ones we bought.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helpful in dealing with the pain of cervical erosion (not THAT kind</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome - I&#x27;d love to own all the different sizes and shapes they offer, but I&#x27;ve been able to make greatly versatile use of just one.</li>
            <li>She loved how comfortable it was and the ease with which it could be heated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great way to ice my neck - much easier than dishtowels wrapped around gel packs!</li>
            <li>Conforms, fits most persons, comforting and helpful for many types of pain.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something similar to what is used at PT places and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I like the Lycra better</li>
            <li>Wish it conformed to my neck better, but I think it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Everything advertised and more best6 pain relieve I have found for my neck injury  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind picking up a couple more one day</li>
            <li>I should have bought more they work so well.</li>
            <li>I purchased the cervical collar for my recent shoulder surgery and it works great for the shoulder!</li>
            <li>So glad I got it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>However, she is pleased with the relief it gives.</li>
            <li>Also, the inside part of the collar that touches your neck is made of some type of satin material which is okay.  </li>
            <li>It happened to me many times already on accident</li>
            <li>(it could have been designed better), it serves itâ€™s purpose.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this cervical collar.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more comfortable it feels.  </li>
            <li>This works well but would be a bit better if the fit could be tighter and if it got colder.  </li>
            <li>Love the fit and the heat.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it for neck and shoulder tension, but I use it for so much more.</li>
            <li>Easy to heat at home in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Good design that fits average size person well, pleasant to touch, does not require cover.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>thing is trully deserving of more than five stars so the best I could come up with is naming the review as devine intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this purchase she has also purchased the Elasto Gel wrap for her sister&#x27;s knee and the pad for the upper back.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic ice pack.  </li>
            <li>And once on, the light sense of coolness disappears within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Really comfortable pack to use</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>So comfortable that my sister, the super lite sleeper, can fall asleep with it on and stays asleep till morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar has a shape that allows it to fit just right for someone with neck and shoulder pain.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but the price was too high.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stuffed into a tube, it&#x27;s comfy, flexible and I&#x27;ve never heated it because heat is not good for my nerve damage, but from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s great heated too!</li>
            <li>I wrote down the name and found it on Amazon for a great price.  </li>
            <li>really helps pain and is comfortable</li>
            <li>when I have a sinus headache, I actually secure the collar around my face and neck and it works really well.</li>
            <li>The collar works great but a few things to note.  </li>
            <li>It would be far better though if there was a longer Velcro lined access flap that would make it easier to remove the gel pack.</li>
            <li>She claims it helps so it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth waiting for refreeze</li>
            <li>THIS COLLAR RIGHT FROM THE FREEZER</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND ITS COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>Bought a second one I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s funtionality of an ice/gel pack for cooling isn&#x27;t very satisfying as their other products.</li>
            <li>Our first one has lasted four years and is still useable .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great warm but cold not so much.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I use it alot, hold the heat well and gets sufficiently hot.</li>
            <li>Wish it would stay hot longer.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, flexible and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its safe to ice too long</li>
            <li>this is perfect for both cold and hot applications.</li>
            <li>With her particular microwave 2 minutes on high seems to about right</li>
            <li>In addition to being useful as a cervical collar, this is the perfect configuration to drape over a painful shoulder.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cold pack I&#x27;ve found (and I have a whole drawer in my freezer of nothing but neck/back ice packs).</li>
            <li>There is a plastic bag that you put the whole neck wrap in</li>
            <li>you cannot feel the Heat/Cold that much.</li>
            <li>Upon hearing that helped some I thought this might work as well and be much easier to use</li>
            <li>I really like this collar.  </li>
            <li>For the price,  I expected so much more.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;great item thanks</li>
            <li>I injured my shoulder this week, and the shape of this ice pack also works very well for my shoulder.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and makes icing much easier.</li>
            <li>My PT office uses your products and highly recommends them!</li>
            <li>, I keep it with me at work for when there&#x27;s no heat in the office, under the blankets to keep warm and cozy when watching movies, and I even keep it on me in the car while I wait for it to heat up in the morning.</li>
            <li>All type are available will give you my personal recommendation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this product!</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to receiving this and using it for herniated cervical disk and my pain.  </li>
            <li>I admit that I should have replaced it several years back, but it was no longer available from my original dealer.</li>
            <li>Really eases the muscles after a PT/gym workout, covers well and doesn&#x27;t want to slide off as so many other cooling packs seem to.  </li>
            <li>Then I found a new physical therapist, and he used this frozen neck wrap on me and it was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Very effective and practical allowing me to move about and proceed with other tasks instead of holding to other contraptions I tried bebore.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>Purchased this for an older family member who had severe neck pain.</li>
            <li>My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective.</li>
            <li>Not like it was fresh out of the freezer, but cool enough that I can put it back on my neck.</li>
            <li>outside material is not as soft as the one I currently own, nor is it as high or long.</li>
            <li>High quality products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>As advertised great for neck hot or cold.</li>
            <li>Instead of having to wait for symptoms to go away she can now treat them quickly and effectively and return to her activities in less than a half hour.</li>
            <li>and I have a pretty big neck, so</li>
            <li>If you are of the short necked group of people this will be useful, but does not fit as comfortably as pictured.  </li>
            <li>It really works well, especially out of the freezer, stays cool a long time.</li>
            <li>I tried mine in frozen mode for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Has not melted down like others i&#x27;ve bought like the ones filled with mud do or scorch like the ones with seeds in them.</li>
            <li>Perhaps making one in a small (less tall collar) would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>and there is no need to let it completely cool before reheating again due to the gel packs it</li>
            <li>This neck brace works great for heating to relax the muscles, and for cold to decrease inflammation.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use the collar nearly every day , our second one owned, using it for arthritis of the neck and spine and shoulder rotor cuff replacement surgery for myself, I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate them but reduced them dramatically and without any medications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please tell me how I can return, I did not get far in your return area.</li>
            <li>She has frequent neck pain and uses this.</li>
            <li>and it goes directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>This probably will not fit in the smaller table top microwave unless you fold it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and it is the only brand my therapist office uses.</li>
            <li>Not sure why some people were saying it didn&#x27;t fit snug.</li>
            <li>But if removed from your body heat, it will cool down enough to be worn again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two so far and am likely buying this again</li>
            <li>I keep it in it&#x27;s original bag in the freezer, and it helps immensely with my neck, and I can lay down in it if I need to!!</li>
            <li>It also took a few days to find the right setting to use in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>This gel collar holds heat much longer than other collars.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase for myself (good to have a cold \\&quot;spare\\&quot;), and bought one for a relative.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tightened it as far as the Velcro will allow, and it&#x27;s still loose.</li>
            <li>Since there is no front view pictured I wonder if the model has the velcro strap fastened at the very ends of the strips, widest open, which would allow it to fall further down the back.  </li>
            <li>These cold packs are amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells like old socks or a gym looker room straight out of the box and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away (at least after a year).</li>

            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND ITS COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li> Bought a second one I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s funtionality of an ice/gel pack for cooling isn&#x27;t very satisfying as their other products.</li>
            <li> Our first one has lasted four years and is still useable .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great warm but cold not so much.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I use it alot, hold the heat well and gets sufficiently hot.</li>
            <li> Wish it would stay hot longer.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, flexible and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its safe to ice too long</li>
            <li> this is perfect for both cold and hot applications.</li>
            <li> With her particular microwave 2 minutes on high seems to about right</li>
            <li> In addition to being useful as a cervical collar, this is the perfect configuration to drape over a painful shoulder.  </li>
            <li> This is the best cold pack I&#x27;ve found (and I have a whole drawer in my freezer of nothing but neck/back ice packs).</li>
            <li> There is a plastic bag that you put the whole neck wrap in</li>
            <li> you cannot feel the Heat/Cold that much.</li>
            <li> Upon hearing that helped some I thought this might work as well and be much easier to use</li>
            <li> I really like this collar.  </li>
            <li> For the price,  I expected so much more.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;great item thanks</li>
            <li> I injured my shoulder this week, and the shape of this ice pack also works very well for my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and makes icing much easier.</li>
            <li> My PT office uses your products and highly recommends them!</li>
            <li> , I keep it with me at work for when there&#x27;s no heat in the office, under the blankets to keep warm and cozy when watching movies, and I even keep it on me in the car while I wait for it to heat up in the morning.</li>
            <li> All type are available will give you my personal recommendation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this product!</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to receiving this and using it for herniated cervical disk and my pain.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I should have replaced it several years back, but it was no longer available from my original dealer.</li>
            <li> Really eases the muscles after a PT/gym workout, covers well and doesn&#x27;t want to slide off as so many other cooling packs seem to.  </li>
            <li> Then I found a new physical therapist, and he used this frozen neck wrap on me and it was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Very effective and practical allowing me to move about and proceed with other tasks instead of holding to other contraptions I tried bebore.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for an older family member who had severe neck pain.</li>
            <li> My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective.</li>
            <li> Not like it was fresh out of the freezer, but cool enough that I can put it back on my neck.</li>
            <li> outside material is not as soft as the one I currently own, nor is it as high or long.</li>
            <li> High quality products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> As advertised great for neck hot or cold.</li>
            <li> Instead of having to wait for symptoms to go away she can now treat them quickly and effectively and return to her activities in less than a half hour.</li>
            <li> and I have a pretty big neck, so</li>
            <li> If you are of the short necked group of people this will be useful, but does not fit as comfortably as pictured.  </li>
            <li> It really works well, especially out of the freezer, stays cool a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried mine in frozen mode for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Has not melted down like others i&#x27;ve bought like the ones filled with mud do or scorch like the ones with seeds in them.</li>
            <li> Perhaps making one in a small (less tall collar) would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> and there is no need to let it completely cool before reheating again due to the gel packs it</li>
            <li> This neck brace works great for heating to relax the muscles, and for cold to decrease inflammation.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use the collar nearly every day , our second one owned, using it for arthritis of the neck and spine and shoulder rotor cuff replacement surgery for myself, I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate them but reduced them dramatically and without any medications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please tell me how I can return, I did not get far in your return area.</li>
            <li> She has frequent neck pain and uses this.</li>
            <li> and it goes directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> This probably will not fit in the smaller table top microwave unless you fold it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and it is the only brand my therapist office uses.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people were saying it didn&#x27;t fit snug.</li>
            <li> But if removed from your body heat, it will cool down enough to be worn again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two so far and am likely buying this again</li>
            <li> I keep it in it&#x27;s original bag in the freezer, and it helps immensely with my neck, and I can lay down in it if I need to!!</li>
            <li> It also took a few days to find the right setting to use in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> This gel collar holds heat much longer than other collars.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase for myself (good to have a cold \\&quot;spare\\&quot;), and bought one for a relative.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tightened it as far as the Velcro will allow, and it&#x27;s still loose.</li>
            <li> Since there is no front view pictured I wonder if the model has the velcro strap fastened at the very ends of the strips, widest open, which would allow it to fall further down the back.  </li>
            <li> These cold packs are amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells like old socks or a gym looker room straight out of the box and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away (at least after a year).</li>
            <li> They stay cold just the right amount of time, stay soft and are ready to use again in just 10, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product will not last long.</li>
            <li> First, the collar does not fit properly around your neck (for an average sized person).Second, Even after you strap the collar</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of the elasto-gel cold packs.  </li>
            <li> Better for cold then heat.</li>
            <li> Given that you have to re-freeze it in a ziplock back, the overall hassle is not really worth the benefit.  </li>
            <li> I even use it just to hold my head up for long car rides.</li>
            <li> She said it has a long neck area so it folds over onto her shoulders.</li>
            <li> The shape, design and texture is great, but other posters are correct, the thermal material does not hold the cold for very long, not nearly as long as normal cold packs you can buy.  </li>
            <li> but does not hold heat very long.</li>
            <li> The cons listed that it only stays cold for 15-20 minutes is accurate, but is a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> This wraps my neck in heat or cold, and is comfortable enough that I can go about my day with it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to stuff a normal cold back in there, if that works then I will really like this collar, otherwise, not really...</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t get cold enough.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> I needed cold therapy that comfortably wrapped around my neck</li>
            <li> Item is all scratched up from minimal use from the Velcro straps.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t get you wet.</li>
            <li> It has a Velcro strap that sticks from one side to the other side of the wrap.  </li>
            <li> She reports extreme satisfaction with all three.</li>
            <li> that side of my neck, which also has muscle tension due to the shoulder injury.  </li>
            <li> Never really thought of getting it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something super cold</li>
            <li> Definitely, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is the same company, at least that is what I thought I ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in the freezer just long enough to get cold; we use this cervical collar as an ice compress on a daily bases and we find ourselves begging each other to use it.</li>
            <li> Truly a thumbs down</li>
            <li> TAKES THE PAIN LEVEL DOWN</li>
            <li> I tried both Hot &amp; cold therapy using this.</li>
            <li> You can a adjust it to be quite tight.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not get cold, it barely even cools.</li>
            <li> Must be stretching out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have to lie down on my back, so there will be pressure on the wrap, to feel the cold on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that.</li>
            <li> I have chronic pain in my neck and have always had trouble applying ice (or heat) to the side of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Secures firmly around the neck and molds to your body .</li>
            <li> DRASTICALLY WITH IN A FEW MINUTES</li>
            <li> The product worked well for a few times.</li>
            <li> Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck.</li>
            <li> so when I need really cold therapy, I still use the old fashioned method.</li>
            <li> I find that after even 10-15 minutes it feels like the cold is completely gone from it.</li>
            <li> The middle flap goes down my should to ensure it gets the cold relief all over, or I can flip it over and ice my should and</li>
            <li> It is actually a joke how little cold this holds.</li>
            <li> Also, the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes (Max. 5).</li>
            <li> He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that.</li>
            <li> So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks.</li>
            <li> it is cold enough.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T GET COLD ENOUGH</li>
            <li> I kept my shoulder cold for up to 20mins. and helped decrease tendinitis pain after physical therapy</li>
            <li> Anyway, I only use it for cold therapy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 10 years!</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t stay cold as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay cold as long as an ice pack, but is so convenient to wear</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t stay cold for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Soft,pliable collar but doesn&#x27;t stay cold long.  </li>
            <li> : Does not keep cold for very long, 15-20 minutes max.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a few uses it melted and smoked in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t ever get cold enough.  </li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> Works well, as with any cold pack it only stays cold for up to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Not as cold and doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, It did not.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO GO TO SLEEP.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> However whatever the gel is made of does a horrible job retaining cold which leaves the effectiveness of the product very low.</li>
            <li> Does not get cold after storing 24 hours in freezer.</li>
            <li> The gel shoulder sleeve gets twice as cold as this cervical collar does.</li>
            <li> disappointing</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend of mine who was in a car accident and suffers from a concussion and whiplash both.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t get as cold as an ice pack</li>
            <li> stays cold .</li>
            <li> it losses its cold just on time to remove it for 20 minutes of rest while it refreezes.  </li>
            <li> so I can ice two areas while keeping one cold in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it cold however..</li>
            <li> It stays flexible, and it gets cold, and stays cold, but isn&#x27;t so extremely cold that it hurts your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will have to try it at its widest opening, however, I think that might make the cold parts lose contact with skin/muscles of neck and some benefits would be lost.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the cold yet.</li>
            <li> I use it on my abdomen for cramps and abdominal pain, I put it around my forehead or over my face for sinus headaches, I put in on my feet when they get cold at night</li>
            <li> It stays cold for the recommended 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off for the both of us to use.</li>
            <li> The satin side looks bad.</li>

            <li> Conforms, fits most persons, comforting and helpful for many types of pain.  Easy to heat at home in the microwave.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use the collar nearly every day , our second one owned, using it for arthritis of the neck and spine and shoulder rotor cuff replacement surgery for myself, I recommend it highly! Our first one has lasted four years and is still useable . Just wanted a back up.</li>
            <li> As advertised great for neck hot or cold. Works nicely</li>
            <li> Once we finally rec&#x27;d the correct item ( orig order not from this company, so no reflection on them).....my husband loves it. He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that. So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks. I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that. He loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough. He uses it for chronic neck pain. Just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed: it has a Velcro strap to keep it in place. Almost like having a neck pillow on, but not as bulky. FABU product!!!</li>
            <li> Does not get cold after storing 24 hours in freezer. Too bad because it is very comfortable. Might be good for heat, but I needed an ice pack.</li>
            <li> great delivery time and price you cant beat!</li>
            <li> The collar is well-made and works well.  It would be far better though if there was a longer Velcro lined access flap that would make it easier to remove the gel pack.</li>
            <li> In addition to being useful as a cervical collar, this is the perfect configuration to drape over a painful shoulder.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s a dog hair magnet - but you deal with it. This is my second purchase for myself (good to have a cold \\&quot;spare\\&quot;), and bought one for a relative.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect solution to any neck pains.</li>
            <li> I have chronic pain in my neck and have always had trouble applying ice (or heat) to the side of my neck.  This wraps my neck in heat or cold, and is comfortable enough that I can go about my day with it on.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I can not brag enough about these. I use them manly for heat and they are perfect. i have had one of these for several years and can&#x27;t wear it out. I bought these as presents for family members</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. I use it as a heat pack and it works great.</li>
            <li> Just what the dr ordered for a herniated disk</li>
            <li> Fits great! However it&#x27;s funtionality of an ice/gel pack for cooling isn&#x27;t very satisfying as their other products. It&#x27;s great warm but cold not so much. The gel shoulder sleeve gets twice as cold as this cervical collar does. They&#x27;re both in the same freezer in their separate bags as they should be when I tested this theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something super cold I&#x27;d try another product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for an older family member who had severe neck pain. She loved how comfortable it was and the ease with which it could be heated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic ice pack.  I have a severe neck injury and I get immediate relief from this.  I was looking for something similar to what is used at PT places and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have had neck and shoulder issues for years.  I had been putting a heating pad on it every night.  Then I found a new physical therapist, and he used this frozen neck wrap on me and it was a huge difference.  He said ice only, no heat for my issues.  I wrote down the name and found it on Amazon for a great price.  There are two different options for the neck wrap:  The style number for the cotton-poly fabric collar is CC102B and the Lycra is CC102. I like the Lycra better cause it&#x27;s silky and cooler.  You may like the cotton.  I don&#x27;t notice any smell like some of the ones I have used.  It has a Velcro strap that sticks from one side to the other side of the wrap.  It is recommended by my therapist to keep it on for 20 minutes, then off for 2 hours, so I put it back in the freezer after each use.  There is a plastic bag that you put the whole neck wrap in and it all goes in the freezer.  I highly recommend it, and it is the only brand my therapist office uses.</li>
            <li> Item is all scratched up from minimal use from the Velcro straps. I&#x27;ve only used it maybe 6 times total. This product will not last long. Very poorly made. disappointing</li>
            <li> I bought this after looking at the description hoping that this will be the answer for ease my neck pain. Unfortunately, It did not. I tried both Hot &amp; cold therapy using this. Neither is effective. First, the collar does not fit properly around your neck (for an average sized person).Second, Even after you strap the collar you cannot feel the Heat/Cold that much. Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck. Also, the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes (Max. 5). Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed. Definitely, not worth the money. My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective.</li>
            <li> Works well, as with any cold pack it only stays cold for up to 15 minutes.  I don&#x27;t think its safe to ice too long anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy.  Wish it conformed to my neck better, but I think it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend of mine who was in a car accident and suffers from a concussion and whiplash both. While at a friends house her neck muscles started to spasm and her friend had her try a heating pad made with rice. Upon hearing that helped some I thought this might work as well and be much easier to use so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you the results have been spectacular. It not only stops the pain from growing but has resulted in an improvement in all of her symptoms from the accident. It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate them but reduced them dramatically and without any medications. She even wears it while vacuuming and driving. She states it fits her perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t heat the back at all but just the neck. Instead of having to wait for symptoms to go away she can now treat them quickly and effectively and return to her activities in less than a half hour. With her particular microwave 2 minutes on high seems to about right and there is no need to let it completely cool before reheating again due to the gel packs it uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is trully deserving of more than five stars so the best I could come up with is naming the review as devine intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this purchase she has also purchased the Elasto Gel wrap for her sister&#x27;s knee and the pad for the upper back. She reports extreme satisfaction with all three.</li>
            <li> I really like this collar.  I heat the collar in the microwave and use it instead of taking pain pills.  I have RA in my neck and the collar ly relaxes my neck and makes a good brass at night so I&#x27;m not waking in pain.  This is the second one for me.  I simply wore out my 1st one.</li>
            <li> Very effective and practical allowing me to move about and proceed with other tasks instead of holding to other contraptions I tried bebore. The design, contour allows for flexibility.</li>
            <li> For the price,  I expected so much more. Not only does it not get cold, it barely even cools. And once on, the light sense of coolness disappears within 15 minutes.  Truly a thumbs down ðŸ‘Ž. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Everything advertised and more best6 pain relieve I have found for my neck injury  excellent quality  do not hesitate to buy</li>
            <li> This works well but would be a bit better if the fit could be tighter and if it got colder.  Great idea, need a bit more refinement to be&lt;br /&gt;really effective.</li>
            <li> I would like to return this item&lt;br /&gt;The outside material is not as soft as the one I currently own, nor is it as high or long. It is the same company, at least that is what I thought I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me how I can return, I did not get far in your return area. I guess I need a return authorization # and an address to send this to. I do not have a printer but I can go to the library and print from there.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;M. O&#x27;Donnell</li>
            <li> Oh, this is a God Sent.  I had a whip lash in 2009 and this wonderful Collar hit my areas of discomfort perfectly. When the pain/pressure starts, I heat the collar 45 seconds on each side, put it on and it&#x27;s heaven.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Great way to ice my neck - much easier than dishtowels wrapped around gel packs! However, it doesn&#x27;t get as cold as an ice pack would, so when I need really cold therapy, I still use the old fashioned method.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She has frequent neck pain and uses this. She claims it helps so it is worth the buy. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Gives some pain relief for two members of family</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted. stays cold . comes with specific instructions on how to care for it.&lt;br /&gt;great item thanks</li>
            <li> I initially bought this months ago for my neck.  It has worked incredibly well!  The cons listed that it only stays cold for 15-20 minutes is accurate, but is a plus for me.  Since I should not be icing longer than 20 minutes at a time, I don&#x27;t  have to watch the time...it losses its cold just on time to remove it for 20 minutes of rest while it refreezes.  I injured my shoulder this week, and the shape of this ice pack also works very well for my shoulder.  The middle flap goes down my should to ensure it gets the cold relief all over, or I can flip it over and ice my should and that side of my neck, which also has muscle tension due to the shoulder injury.  Everything I&#x27;ve used this pack for, it has performed well!  I wouldn&#x27;t mind picking up a couple more one day so I can ice two areas while keeping one cold in the freezer.</li>
            <li> High quality products.Very well made.Best product for releif of pain.</li>
            <li> I use it alot, hold the heat well and gets sufficiently hot. Has not melted down like others i&#x27;ve bought like the ones filled with mud do or scorch like the ones with seeds in them. I recommend. I haven&#x27;t used it cold however.. Secures firmly around the neck and molds to your body .</li>
            <li> It smells like old socks or a gym looker room straight out of the box and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away (at least after a year). However, functionally (only used it for heat) it is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a petite woman, and this wrap is too big for my neck. I&#x27;ve tightened it as far as the Velcro will allow, and it&#x27;s still loose. I have to lie down on my back, so there will be pressure on the wrap, to feel the cold on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> Works great on my neck.  Just wish it was a little bigger and I have a pretty big neck, so for me it was a bit snug.  The more I use it the more comfortable it feels.  Must be stretching out a little bit.  I like that I can put it on and still go about my business.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the price was too high. Also it doesn&#x27;t stay cold as long as I would like. It is very durable and makes icing much easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these one for a friend and myself. I should have bought more they work so well.</li>
            <li> This neck brace works great for heating to relax the muscles, and for cold to decrease inflammation. I even use it just to hold my head up for long car rides.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this device at my physical therapist&#x27;s.  I loved it there and still do.  Really eases the muscles after a PT/gym workout, covers well and doesn&#x27;t want to slide off as so many other cooling packs seem to.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t get you wet.</li>
            <li> really helps pain and is comfortable</li>
            <li> It stays flexible, and it gets cold, and stays cold, but isn&#x27;t so extremely cold that it hurts your skin.  I kept this on for 30 minutes, it was comfortable, and worked great.  I will be purchasing more of the elasto-gel cold packs.  This is the best cold pack I&#x27;ve found (and I have a whole drawer in my freezer of nothing but neck/back ice packs).</li>
            <li> If you are of the short necked group of people this will be useful, but does not fit as comfortably as pictured.  Since there is no front view pictured I wonder if the model has the velcro strap fastened at the very ends of the strips, widest open, which would allow it to fall further down the back.  Mine does not fall that low on my back.  I will have to try it at its widest opening, however, I think that might make the cold parts lose contact with skin/muscles of neck and some benefits would be lost.  Perhaps making one in a small (less tall collar) would make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I HAVE STENOSIS IN MY NECK WHICH AT NIGHT CAN BRING PAIN THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO GO TO SLEEP. THIS COLLAR RIGHT FROM THE FREEZER TAKES THE PAIN LEVEL DOWN DRASTICALLY WITH IN A FEW MINUTES SO I CAN GET TO SLEEP. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND ITS COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T GET COLD ENOUGH</li>
            <li> This was a gift. My mother enjoys it a great deal.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on. Handy and effective</li>
            <li> Love the fit and the heat.  Wish it would stay hot longer.  I&#x27;ve owned two so far and am likely buying this again but beware that eventually it does catch fire in the microwave.  Mine gets heated 2-6 times a day for about a year before doing this but beware of this safety hazard.</li>
            <li> The heat is soothing -- helps prevent tension headaches. I had one, before, but wore it out. Warmth lasts about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> These cold packs are amazing. They stay cold just the right amount of time, stay soft and are ready to use again in just 10, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It really works well, especially out of the freezer, stays cool a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described. I needed cold therapy that comfortably wrapped around my neck and this did the trick!</li>
            <li> okay, not as good as the two shoulder ones we bought. Not as cold and doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long. Thought it was the same as the shoulder ones. It was not</li>
            <li> Really comfortable pack to use and it goes directly on the skin.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s shape allows for different uses and there is velcro to wrap it around your neck.  I wish it would stay colder for longer.  I find that after even 10-15 minutes it feels like the cold is completely gone from it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cervical collar for my recent shoulder surgery and it works great for the shoulder! My PT office uses your products and highly recommends them! Thanks for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> The product worked well for a few times. Unfortunately after a few uses it melted and smoked in the microwave.  The warranty did not cover this.</li>
            <li> Soft and pliable. I used it for my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I love this Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar!! I keep it in it&#x27;s original bag in the freezer, and it helps immensely with my neck, and I can lay down in it if I need to!! It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;choke&#x27; me, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stuffed into a tube, it&#x27;s comfy, flexible and I&#x27;ve never heated it because heat is not good for my nerve damage, but from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s great heated too! I&#x27;m getting another one for back up when my stenosis flares up. I&#x27;m getting the ones for the feet and the lumbar area as well...I cannot wait to get them!!!!</li>
            <li> I am short, so the flap between the shoulders caused it to gap on my neck.  So I just gold the flap under to ensure my neck gets touched all the way around.  It doesn&#x27;t stay cold as long as an ice pack, but is so convenient to wear it&#x27;s worth waiting for refreeze</li>
            <li> Just got this today. Had severe neck pain. Already have been through a double disc fusion and do not want to do another one. Heated this guy up and put it on. Immediately it felt better!  So glad I got it. Haven&#x27;t tried the cold yet. The heat is what I got.it for. I might get another one as a backup. Not sure why some people were saying it didn&#x27;t fit snug. You can a adjust it to be quite tight.</li>
            <li> Work okay but does not hold heat very long. Better for cold then heat.</li>
            <li> awesome, feels great around my neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned about 5 of these. For me, they tend to wear out after about a year, but that&#x27;s only because I reheat it literally like 50 times a day and often heat it longer than is recommended. I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this! I originally bought it for neck and shoulder tension, but I use it for so much more. I use it on my abdomen for cramps and abdominal pain, I put it around my forehead or over my face for sinus headaches, I put in on my feet when they get cold at night, I keep it with me at work for when there&#x27;s no heat in the office, under the blankets to keep warm and cozy when watching movies, and I even keep it on me in the car while I wait for it to heat up in the morning. This thing is awesome - I&#x27;d love to own all the different sizes and shapes they offer, but I&#x27;ve been able to make greatly versatile use of just one.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for both cold and hot applications. when I have a sinus headache, I actually secure the collar around my face and neck and it works really well. it&#x27;s helpful in dealing with the pain of cervical erosion (not THAT kind, Ladies!)and feels good.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this but the bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t get cold enough. It is actually a joke how little cold this holds. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> best portable ice pack</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for her neck and back pain. It is frozen gel so it doesn&#x27;t stay cold for a really long time. She said it has a long neck area so it folds over onto her shoulders. However, she is pleased with the relief it gives.</li>
            <li> these are the best ice packs I&#x27;ve tried.  All type are available will give you my personal recommendation.</li>
            <li> Soft,pliable collar but doesn&#x27;t stay cold long.  Fair for the price.comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Pros: Good design that fits average size person well, pleasant to touch, does not require cover.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not keep cold for very long, 15-20 minutes max.</li>
            <li> I have a disease which inflects a lot of pain. This helpful for both pain and support! I highly recommend  this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best for neck pain and spasms between the shoulders. Used it after neck surgery. Was a life saver. Bought a second one I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> The collar works great but a few things to note.  The gel on the inside seems to be shaped to the collar.  I had the gel on the inside fold over and had to struggle with it flip back.  Also, the inside part of the collar that touches your neck is made of some type of satin material which is okay.  But the collar stays on by Velcro that is meant to fasten to the outside.  When it accidentally touches the satin side, it will grab and tear up the satin.  It happened to me many times already on accident and Iâ€™ve only had it for a week.  The satin side looks bad. It also took a few days to find the right setting to use in the microwave.  This probably will not fit in the smaller table top microwave unless you fold it but the instructions is to nuke it on both sides.  Over all, once I knew itâ€™s flaws and how to take care of it (it could have been designed better), it serves itâ€™s purpose.  Should this get damaged or lost, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I kept my shoulder cold for up to 20mins. and helped decrease tendinitis pain after physical therapy</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cervical collar. Between my sister and I it&#x27;s in the freezer just long enough to get cold; we use this cervical collar as an ice compress on a daily bases and we find ourselves begging each other to use it. I think I will buy another one soon. I highly recommend this product to everyone. It stays cold for the recommended 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off for the both of us to use. It&#x27;s soft, flexible and comfortable to wear. So comfortable that my sister, the super lite sleeper, can fall asleep with it on and stays asleep till morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, there is no limit to where you can wear this cervical collar...if it fits you can wear it anywhere!</li>
            <li> The Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar has a shape that allows it to fit just right for someone with neck and shoulder pain. However whatever the gel is made of does a horrible job retaining cold which leaves the effectiveness of the product very low. I have not tried to use it as a heating pad; so I can not make any statements about it&#x27;s effectiveness for that use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 10 years! This is my second purchase. I admit that I should have replaced it several years back, but it was no longer available from my original dealer. Never really thought of getting it on Amazon! Duh! Anyway, I only use it for cold therapy. Thecold will generally last for about an hour. But if removed from your body heat, it will cool down enough to be worn again. Not like it was fresh out of the freezer, but cool enough that I can put it back on my neck.</li>
            <li> I tried mine in frozen mode for the first time last night. Perfect. Got ride of my nech muscle pain in about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to receiving this and using it for herniated cervical disk and my pain.  It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t ever get cold enough.  Well made but doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot. Her daughter who also has neck problems tried it and loved it too so this year I am sending one to her as well. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This gel collar holds heat much longer than other collars. It fits well and I can even sleep with it.</li>
