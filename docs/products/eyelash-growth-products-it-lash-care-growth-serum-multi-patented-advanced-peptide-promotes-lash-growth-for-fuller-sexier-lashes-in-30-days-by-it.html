            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my eye lashes fall off even more .</li>
            <li>I have used many products for eyelashes, but none have done the job for me.</li>
            <li>It was about 2 weeks when I noticed the most visible evidence that the product was doing as advertised.</li>

            <li>For anyone woman who wants to be always beautiful, I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Do far this product seems to be amazing.</li>
            <li>it takes 30 days to work, but after 2 weeks of using it my natural lashes are more longer,fuller, but most important more natural.</li>
            <li>She has tried to buy many products but none really helped him.</li>

            <li>I just cant say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>It does state if it gets into your eyes to wash immediately with cool water.</li>
            <li>Very neat and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really works for me , my lashes are looks better than before, and i just recommended this to my sister.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t need to pay for full service at a beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>I do love not having them fall out as much.  </li>
            <li>far this is nice</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks, as the product claims 30 days will reveal the full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for now not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant amount of growth yet, I have definitely noticed how much more healthy and nourished my eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>The serum is pretty strong</li>
            <li>I have used other kinds and they&#x27;ve worked great.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s a great product as it really seems to make my lashes nice and smooth and soft, but I&#x27;m just not sure this is my favorite lash growth product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I love how growth and large they are right now.</li>
            <li>I apply twice a day as instructed and it dries quickly so I can apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith initially that this product was going to do anything more than cost more money.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Could be that I am older than most people to use this.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any quick results since I wear it after I have removed my make up for the night</li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and it is clear colored.</li>
            <li>I did notice more new growth on the outer eyebrow and plan on continuing to use to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy the results as much as I am!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but it&#x27;s real easy to put on</li>
            <li>Mascara looks better and more fluffy because of how healthy my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>I already  have long lashes this just made them look longer all in all good product</li>
            <li>Worked good for me and gave me long lashes to die for:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and you really don&#x27;t need much per application.</li>
            <li>And i noticed my mascara goes on more clean and vibrant and makes my eyes pop thanks to this!</li>
            <li>:) Make sure to have your eyes partly open when you apply this to the base of your lashes, I experimented with the best way to apply it (without getting it in your eye) and having my eyes slightly open and looking downward was the best method.</li>
            <li>If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!!</li>
            <li>, today she is happy with her strong and thick lashes, wearing a radiant and glamorous look.</li>
            <li>product will not make your lashes any darker, but it made my a lot longer and thicker, so I can put a little bit of mascara on to darken them, and they look great.</li>
            <li>I want to know if a product is safe near my eyes first, and enhances my lashes or brows thereafter!</li>
            <li>when she finish the gift i gonna bought for her few many of this amazing product.</li>
            <li>love the results so far.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is it is hypo allergenic sensitivity tested with no artificial color.</li>
            <li>, so I thought trying this one was worth the shot.  </li>
            <li>Love this so far.  </li>
            <li>but in 3 weeks it was amazing the outcome long and full .</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>After 1 month of use, I see my lashes longer and more lush.</li>
            <li>the wait worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more .</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Helps your lashes to grow pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face.</li>
            <li>Do not apply directly on lashes use on clean skin free of any makeup or eyecreams.</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>The seller sent this product to me right away</li>
            <li>I put it on at night right before bed</li>
            <li>this price for the eyelash growth is extremnly good, is so cheaply for how GOOD it is, and with 15 days using it you can note change, it is not necessary to use mascara because you gain so much more volume and are more long lashes, really if you&#x27;re not happy with your eyelashes purchase</li>
            <li>She was surprised when her lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to review this item.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to put on as much mascara in the mornings to get them to look as full as I want them to.</li>
            <li>a few weeks ago they used this product and the change has been remarkable</li>
            <li>I love this product , I no longer use false eyelashes or masks so that my eyes look more striking .</li>
            <li>I love this product , I no longer use false eyelashes or masks so that my eyes look more striking .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t argue about its effectiveness though, it really does work quickly.</li>
            <li>so had to quit using it  thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li>The application was pretty easy since I am used to applying mascara/having things near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars not only for effectiveness but how quickly it worked as well!!</li>
            <li>watch my full video review that will go live soon!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I purchased Lash Care Growth Serum as one more final attempt to have the full, long, sexy lashes that I always wanted.</li>
            <li>You must use the product for 30 days and be regular in use and you will see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>It is marketed as a prescription free alternative to enhance lash growth and encloses specific instructions on directions and usage, also stating it is paraben and fragrance free, free of harsh dyes, and safe for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li>from the first señana of use I could see the results.</li>
            <li>Its funny becouse</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so much thicker and longer!</li>
            <li>also love that you only have to apply the serum once a day</li>
            <li>I have purchased at least 5 eyelash growth serums from Amazon that ALL had great reviews.</li>
            <li>You could have someone apply it for you or keep your eye closed that your applying it to and have a towel handy just in case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Latisse before, and this is very comprable without irritation!</li>
            <li>I will say to take caution when applying and swipe the brush against the opening of the tube to wipe off any additional serum before touching it to your lid because this stuff definitely BURNS if it gets into your eye.</li>
            <li>The only difference is i was able to start seeing difference in a week by using this product.</li>
            <li>The Eyelash growth was delivered in protective packaging and is exactly as described on product page.</li>
            <li>but i have noticed my eyelashes are much stronger!</li>
            <li>This product Is of the highest quality which is evident once you try it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 5 weeks straight and nothing has changed!</li>
            <li>Ok, Latisse is definitely sex in a bottle, but this stuff does the trick if you don&#x27;t have the finances.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my regular makeup over the Eyelash growth Serum.</li>
            <li>Works fast!</li>
            <li>Promotes Healthy follicles and soothes fragile eyelashes and eyebrows Las para improve elasticity</li>
            <li>She was pretty before, now the longer lashes just adds to her beauty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and after the first 24hrs my lashes grew(;*~} .</li>
            <li>I barely received it, and It is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, so first of all let&#x27;s start by saying that a lash growth serum is NOT going to make you grow lashes as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I found this product and decided to try it because it&#x27;s price was much more reasonable than some of the similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>They have grown very slightly, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Now they are thinner and more sparse and don&#x27;t look as long as they used to.  </li>
            <li>At first it took some getting the hang of it; if you apply too much it will run into your eyes and burn.</li>
            <li>At first glance it shows the change since the last time I saw her eyelashes, she looks more natural!</li>
            <li>make sure to let dry between applications, you DONT want this stuff in your eye.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far and can not wait to see the full results.</li>
            <li>The brush is similar to a liquid eyeliner brush, and since I wear that a lot, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My lashes are so beautiful its ridiculous!</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t be certain til</li>
            <li>Instead of having to go to a professional and pay a pretty penny!</li>
            <li>and I can say that this Serum really works.</li>
            <li>I recommend so much</li>
            <li>Eyes really stand out and no clumping.</li>
            <li>And very affordable.</li>
            <li>that much she was like telling every girlfriend we have..</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>Did not appear to strengthen lashes much.  </li>
            <li>She´s seen a real change in her lashes</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in the length.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much yet in the fullness</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, just know to keep your expectations real</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much of a difference in fact</li>
            <li>I have reactions to so much stuff</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer but they aren&#x27;t so much thicker</li>
            <li>Fast forward to now</li>
            <li>and I find they are much thicker and their length is increasing.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It is working fast</li>
            <li>my eye lashes are so much thicker and longer</li>
            <li>No irritations and you can really see the difference with your lashes.</li>
            <li>This product makes my eyes really stand out.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>My sister actually suggested I try this one out, said she saw one of her friends had been using it with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Burns and doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable ..</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much growth since I started using it,  </li>
            <li>since I have issues really applying it.</li>
            <li>My lashes seem to be shinier and I do not feel like they are falling out as much as they were.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical</li>
            <li>my girlfriend really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in length</li>
            <li>Given how fast the lashes grow (about quarter of inch per month), there should be a visible change already, if IT has any power.</li>
            <li>I found that twice a day was too much for me.</li>
            <li>She no longer has to use as much mascara using this serum.  </li>
            <li>She did recommend that with this, do not overdue it and use too much</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that wants longer looking lashes and for those that have spots without lashes.  </li>
            <li>it’s very helpful</li>
            <li>After much debate, I tried it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the invention if this product.</li>
            <li>The product really work.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in a few weeks, and now keep purchasing to maintain nice lashes.</li>
            <li>There is not a HUGE improvement, but enough to make me happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I also liked that I could apply my mascara once this had dried.</li>
            <li>Good price for a product that will gives results in one wee, and from a trusted brand, comparable to other lash products that provide similar results.</li>
            <li>My normal lashes are short and fine...</li>
            <li>if lasting and just is unique.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my sister she was having trouble growing full lashes and had went through many products before this by far</li>
            <li>seems simple and easy to use, i like it so far !</li>
            <li>Better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Price: Very reasonable compared to other high end products I have used prior for the same purpose.</li>
            <li>Now if you do not have a steady hand this can be a little overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li>It has only been a few applications, the solution is clear and brushes onto eyebrows easily with a very fine brush.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about puchasing LASH CARE GROWTH SERUM, simply because I have tried so many different products that claim to help your lashes grow.</li>
            <li>I was only using it only on one eye because I really wanted to be able to have a comparison</li>
            <li>The product I used for 4 weeks, twice daily, I cannot really say my lashes grew a lot longer, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized.</li>
            <li>has been remarkable and also takes you approximately eight weeks to finish the product and its hypoalergenic.</li>
            <li>Nothing is sexier than big and full eyelashes, THIS is the product for that.</li>
            <li>, her eyelashes have grown stronger naturally, now they are very happy because they no longer use such false eyelashes that are so difficult to place, including that are manic beauty and I who am your faithful admirer recommend this product to all the girls who want to look naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li>Is very easy to use, long lasting and she has fuller lashes again .</li>
            <li>Is very easy to use, long lasting and she has fuller lashes again.</li>
            <li>and they keep that way for the longest time, it is excelent!&lt;br /&gt;hightly recomended for all that lady that thinks his eyelashes needs a new view!</li>
            <li>I love my lashes now and I can use less mascara because I now have fuller and thicker lashes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are more noticeable even though I have been using less than a week.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Supports lashes of Being more flexible and less prone to breakage&lt;</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older they seem to have stopped growing.</li>
            <li>So far our experience has been positive.</li>
            <li>This product gave my eyelashes and eyebrows high gloss and flexibility.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>Self- driven , its vibrating brush gives you all the effects, all in high volume uno.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s co-workers highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>saw the high rating on this product and ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Eyelash Growth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend you buy these IT Lash card as I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results, i used to have short and weak lashes, they used to fall, but this definitely this worked for me.</li>
            <li>Lashes appear so fast it totally surprised me.</li>
            <li>first impression of the outer packaging was that it was clear and concise.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, once in the morning before my normal make up routine and again at night after removing my make up.</li>
            <li>Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>No negative reaction at all.</li>
            <li>The first photo shows just a week ago and as you can see I have very sparse and short lashes.  </li>
            <li>After it dries, I put my makeup on like normal.</li>
            <li>and I might get there in a few more weeks</li>
            <li>This product my wife have been using it, thanks to a gift I received, but at first she wasn&#x27;t convinced to use it, but later she started using Lash Care Growth Serum</li>
            <li>Eye growth serum makes her lashes longer, shinier, fuller, healthier, and more fluffy looking.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum if your lashes need a lot of help to look longer and start new growth!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li>I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li>I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li>Price wise, I found it to be in the same range for other similar products, so</li>
            <li>, I was wrong this product is amazing , I don&#x27;t need false lashes anymore :) love it</li>
            <li>but they do feel a little more lush .</li>
            <li>Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I believe that they will take a bit longer to stimulate new growth but the results of the lengthening is noticeable.</li>
            <li>This eyelash growth product was new to me</li>
            <li>so I have a dread every time I try a new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had eye lashes but now after using Eye Growth it definitely has changed my appearance for the BETTER...</li>
            <li>After using this particular brand for a week, have not noticed a significant difference in any new lash growth, but lashes do seem fuller and slightly longer.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, long lasting, and I have fuller lashes again!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, long lasting, and I have fuller lashes again!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, long lasting, and I have fuller lashes again!</li>
            <li>Can see that it will be the first product to be used ,now , future and seemingly forever.</li>
            <li>So far it works!</li>
            <li>; Not to mention all the typos in the reviews as if the poster doesn&#x27;t use English as a first language.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, and this product does not bother them one bit!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My surprise was unexpected!</li>
            <li>So far I approve and zero irritation!</li>
            <li>and if you do it in the morning you can still wear makeup as long as you make sure the serum is dry!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, it beats the hundreds of dollars spent going to professionals and high dollar products.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple days now and while I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes I can tell that my lashes are growing a little bit and are actually stronger since I used to lose eyelashes more than I would like.</li>
            <li>Was reluctant at first but after using it for the last 2 weeks I already see a major difference.</li>
            <li>The liquid is clear.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Are my eyelashes really that different than someone else&#x27;s, for a product to never work on me?</li>
            <li>Lash Care growth serum naturally helps promote longer lashes.</li>
            <li>This product is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not heavy eyelash compare to others.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes, naturally are the slowest growing hairs in the body, and for that reason they don&#x27;t often slough off.</li>
            <li>I might have to wait 30 days to see any real noticeable difference in growth thought.&lt;br /&gt;Irritation: only if you let it go in your eyes.</li>
            <li>But so far I like it</li>
            <li>Do not waste anymore time, get it today.</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Formula Growth Revolutionary Infinity Lash tabs esta impregnated Of A Mix of vitamins , minerals , polypeptides, and botanicals nourish and rejuvenate ITS para natural lashes .</li>
            <li>Also contains natural antioxidants that protect against dryness and damage .</li>
            <li>Every woman at one  time need this, I&#x27;m 70 year old.</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough about this product!</li>
            <li>but that was when I was young.  </li>
            <li>and they are all natural.</li>
            <li>They say it takes 30 days, but two weeks WITHIN natural lashes of my wife were longer and healthier.</li>
            <li>According to the Package,  It will take some time before I really see results, and I have only used it for a week, so I&#x27;m still unsure of whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li>This Eyelash Growth Product made by IT is by far the nicest one I ever try that does not irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It says it takes 30 days but withing two weeks my natural lashes were longer and healthier.</li>
            <li>It says that it takes 30 days but within two weeks my girlfriend natural lashes were longer and healthier.</li>
            <li>that’s why the naturally growth of lashes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about beauty supplies (what guy does?), but I definitely noticed which feels like she had</li>
            <li>Nor marks of, and although I have heard name a few who are famous, I think this will be my next choice.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give a full review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my normal stuff!</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are very important for a woman sexyness, so they should take the this issue seriously and buy this serum.</li>
            <li>I also applied it to the less full areas on my eyebrows as stated in the direction.</li>
            <li>No mess at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely give it time to dry but then feel free to apply your regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not used it on my eyebrows like it suggests but only because I don&#x27;t particularly want or need thicker brows.</li>
            <li>Maybe work a tiny bit but mainly it would just darken my lashes and make them appear fuller.</li>
            <li>I would have thought she was crazy, until I saw it with my own eyes!</li>
            <li>Large and conspicuous tabs in a single product</li>
            <li>It is not sticky or oily and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear contacts but because I had a bit irritation in eyes on the first day when product actually did slightly went in my eyes, I had avoided contacts for the rest of the times.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice results, but I am very hopeful.  </li>
            <li>but apparently was discontinued</li>
            <li>and i can actually feel the length and see the difference from my natural eyelashes after applying it.</li>
            <li>Finally a mascara that looks natural on and does not clump.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually skeptic about products like this and always think that spending money for this kind of product is just a waste.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and look forward to the dramatic results:))</li>
            <li>After having my third child I have experienced the typical hormonal post partem hair loss, and unfortunately I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes have taken a hit too.</li>
            <li>This is the best Lash product I have ever used you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>The slight irritation is why I gave it three stars, but I will update this review if I adjust to the irritation and receive positive results.</li>
            <li>I recently lost some bottom lashes due to a certain mascara causing them to break off.</li>
            <li>Certainly, this product it won´t let you down.</li>
            <li>Just starting using had a little tingling and itchy at first..</li>
            <li>Once you put those suckers on its not coming out unless you go back to the salon to have a special chemical wash the glue.  </li>
            <li>Then, I recently read this article and it confirms my thoughts and many of others, that the reviews really are fake!</li>
            <li>New lashes have come in and taken up the empty places.  </li>
            <li>It also really burns my eyes if I get even a slight amount in my eyes.</li>
            <li>The company posts a lot of FAKE overenthusiastic reviews, trying to hide the newest, true and critical reviews which are results of real purchase.</li>
            <li>She has a hard time growing long full lashes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For anyone woman who wants to be always beautiful, I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Do far this product seems to be amazing.</li>

            <li> I just cant say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> It does state if it gets into your eyes to wash immediately with cool water.</li>
            <li> Very neat and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really works for me , my lashes are looks better than before, and i just recommended this to my sister.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to pay for full service at a beauty salon.  </li>
            <li> I do love not having them fall out as much.  </li>
            <li> far this is nice</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks, as the product claims 30 days will reveal the full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for now not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant amount of growth yet, I have definitely noticed how much more healthy and nourished my eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> The serum is pretty strong</li>
            <li> I have used other kinds and they&#x27;ve worked great.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s a great product as it really seems to make my lashes nice and smooth and soft, but I&#x27;m just not sure this is my favorite lash growth product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I love how growth and large they are right now.</li>
            <li> I apply twice a day as instructed and it dries quickly so I can apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith initially that this product was going to do anything more than cost more money.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Could be that I am older than most people to use this.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any quick results since I wear it after I have removed my make up for the night</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and it is clear colored.</li>
            <li> I did notice more new growth on the outer eyebrow and plan on continuing to use to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy the results as much as I am!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but it&#x27;s real easy to put on</li>
            <li> Mascara looks better and more fluffy because of how healthy my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> I already  have long lashes this just made them look longer all in all good product</li>
            <li> Worked good for me and gave me long lashes to die for:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and you really don&#x27;t need much per application.</li>
            <li> And i noticed my mascara goes on more clean and vibrant and makes my eyes pop thanks to this!</li>
            <li> :) Make sure to have your eyes partly open when you apply this to the base of your lashes, I experimented with the best way to apply it (without getting it in your eye) and having my eyes slightly open and looking downward was the best method.</li>
            <li> If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!!</li>
            <li> , today she is happy with her strong and thick lashes, wearing a radiant and glamorous look.</li>
            <li> product will not make your lashes any darker, but it made my a lot longer and thicker, so I can put a little bit of mascara on to darken them, and they look great.</li>
            <li> I want to know if a product is safe near my eyes first, and enhances my lashes or brows thereafter!</li>
            <li> when she finish the gift i gonna bought for her few many of this amazing product.</li>
            <li> love the results so far.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is it is hypo allergenic sensitivity tested with no artificial color.</li>
            <li> , so I thought trying this one was worth the shot.  </li>
            <li> Love this so far.  </li>
            <li> but in 3 weeks it was amazing the outcome long and full .</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of use, I see my lashes longer and more lush.</li>
            <li> the wait worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more .</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Helps your lashes to grow pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face.</li>
            <li> Do not apply directly on lashes use on clean skin free of any makeup or eyecreams.</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> The seller sent this product to me right away</li>
            <li> I put it on at night right before bed</li>
            <li> this price for the eyelash growth is extremnly good, is so cheaply for how GOOD it is, and with 15 days using it you can note change, it is not necessary to use mascara because you gain so much more volume and are more long lashes, really if you&#x27;re not happy with your eyelashes purchase</li>
            <li> She was surprised when her lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to review this item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to put on as much mascara in the mornings to get them to look as full as I want them to.</li>
            <li> a few weeks ago they used this product and the change has been remarkable</li>
            <li> I love this product , I no longer use false eyelashes or masks so that my eyes look more striking .</li>
            <li> I love this product , I no longer use false eyelashes or masks so that my eyes look more striking .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t argue about its effectiveness though, it really does work quickly.</li>
            <li> so had to quit using it  thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li> The application was pretty easy since I am used to applying mascara/having things near my eyes.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars not only for effectiveness but how quickly it worked as well!!</li>
            <li> watch my full video review that will go live soon!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I purchased Lash Care Growth Serum as one more final attempt to have the full, long, sexy lashes that I always wanted.</li>
            <li> You must use the product for 30 days and be regular in use and you will see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> It is marketed as a prescription free alternative to enhance lash growth and encloses specific instructions on directions and usage, also stating it is paraben and fragrance free, free of harsh dyes, and safe for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> from the first señana of use I could see the results.</li>
            <li> Its funny becouse</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so much thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> also love that you only have to apply the serum once a day</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 eyelash growth serums from Amazon that ALL had great reviews.</li>
            <li> You could have someone apply it for you or keep your eye closed that your applying it to and have a towel handy just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse before, and this is very comprable without irritation!</li>
            <li> I will say to take caution when applying and swipe the brush against the opening of the tube to wipe off any additional serum before touching it to your lid because this stuff definitely BURNS if it gets into your eye.</li>
            <li> The only difference is i was able to start seeing difference in a week by using this product.</li>
            <li> The Eyelash growth was delivered in protective packaging and is exactly as described on product page.</li>
            <li> but i have noticed my eyelashes are much stronger!</li>
            <li> This product Is of the highest quality which is evident once you try it on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 weeks straight and nothing has changed!</li>
            <li> Ok, Latisse is definitely sex in a bottle, but this stuff does the trick if you don&#x27;t have the finances.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply my regular makeup over the Eyelash growth Serum.</li>
            <li> Works fast!</li>
            <li> Promotes Healthy follicles and soothes fragile eyelashes and eyebrows Las para improve elasticity</li>
            <li> She was pretty before, now the longer lashes just adds to her beauty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and after the first 24hrs my lashes grew(;*~} .</li>
            <li> I barely received it, and It is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all let&#x27;s start by saying that a lash growth serum is NOT going to make you grow lashes as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I found this product and decided to try it because it&#x27;s price was much more reasonable than some of the similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> They have grown very slightly, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Now they are thinner and more sparse and don&#x27;t look as long as they used to.  </li>
            <li> At first it took some getting the hang of it; if you apply too much it will run into your eyes and burn.</li>
            <li> At first glance it shows the change since the last time I saw her eyelashes, she looks more natural!</li>
            <li> make sure to let dry between applications, you DONT want this stuff in your eye.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far and can not wait to see the full results.</li>
            <li> The brush is similar to a liquid eyeliner brush, and since I wear that a lot, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so beautiful its ridiculous!</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t be certain til</li>
            <li> Instead of having to go to a professional and pay a pretty penny!</li>
            <li> and I can say that this Serum really works.</li>
            <li> I recommend so much</li>
            <li> Eyes really stand out and no clumping.</li>
            <li> And very affordable.</li>
            <li> that much she was like telling every girlfriend we have..</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> Did not appear to strengthen lashes much.  </li>
            <li> She´s seen a real change in her lashes</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in the length.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much yet in the fullness</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, just know to keep your expectations real</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much of a difference in fact</li>
            <li> I have reactions to so much stuff</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer but they aren&#x27;t so much thicker</li>
            <li> Fast forward to now</li>
            <li> and I find they are much thicker and their length is increasing.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It is working fast</li>
            <li> my eye lashes are so much thicker and longer</li>
            <li> No irritations and you can really see the difference with your lashes.</li>
            <li> This product makes my eyes really stand out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> My sister actually suggested I try this one out, said she saw one of her friends had been using it with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Burns and doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable ..</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much growth since I started using it,  </li>
            <li> since I have issues really applying it.</li>
            <li> My lashes seem to be shinier and I do not feel like they are falling out as much as they were.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical</li>
            <li> my girlfriend really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in length</li>
            <li> Given how fast the lashes grow (about quarter of inch per month), there should be a visible change already, if IT has any power.</li>
            <li> I found that twice a day was too much for me.</li>
            <li> She no longer has to use as much mascara using this serum.  </li>
            <li> She did recommend that with this, do not overdue it and use too much</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that wants longer looking lashes and for those that have spots without lashes.  </li>
            <li> it’s very helpful</li>
            <li> After much debate, I tried it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the invention if this product.</li>
            <li> The product really work.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in a few weeks, and now keep purchasing to maintain nice lashes.</li>
            <li> There is not a HUGE improvement, but enough to make me happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I also liked that I could apply my mascara once this had dried.</li>
            <li> Good price for a product that will gives results in one wee, and from a trusted brand, comparable to other lash products that provide similar results.</li>
            <li> My normal lashes are short and fine...</li>
            <li> if lasting and just is unique.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister she was having trouble growing full lashes and had went through many products before this by far</li>
            <li> seems simple and easy to use, i like it so far !</li>
            <li> Better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Price: Very reasonable compared to other high end products I have used prior for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> Now if you do not have a steady hand this can be a little overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few applications, the solution is clear and brushes onto eyebrows easily with a very fine brush.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about puchasing LASH CARE GROWTH SERUM, simply because I have tried so many different products that claim to help your lashes grow.</li>
            <li> I was only using it only on one eye because I really wanted to be able to have a comparison</li>
            <li> The product I used for 4 weeks, twice daily, I cannot really say my lashes grew a lot longer, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized.</li>
            <li> has been remarkable and also takes you approximately eight weeks to finish the product and its hypoalergenic.</li>
            <li> Nothing is sexier than big and full eyelashes, THIS is the product for that.</li>
            <li> , her eyelashes have grown stronger naturally, now they are very happy because they no longer use such false eyelashes that are so difficult to place, including that are manic beauty and I who am your faithful admirer recommend this product to all the girls who want to look naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li> Is very easy to use, long lasting and she has fuller lashes again .</li>
            <li> Is very easy to use, long lasting and she has fuller lashes again.</li>
            <li> and they keep that way for the longest time, it is excelent!&lt;br /&gt;hightly recomended for all that lady that thinks his eyelashes needs a new view!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes now and I can use less mascara because I now have fuller and thicker lashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are more noticeable even though I have been using less than a week.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Supports lashes of Being more flexible and less prone to breakage&lt;</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older they seem to have stopped growing.</li>
            <li> So far our experience has been positive.</li>
            <li> This product gave my eyelashes and eyebrows high gloss and flexibility.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Self- driven , its vibrating brush gives you all the effects, all in high volume uno.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s co-workers highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> saw the high rating on this product and ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Eyelash Growth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend you buy these IT Lash card as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results, i used to have short and weak lashes, they used to fall, but this definitely this worked for me.</li>
            <li> Lashes appear so fast it totally surprised me.</li>
            <li> first impression of the outer packaging was that it was clear and concise.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, once in the morning before my normal make up routine and again at night after removing my make up.</li>
            <li> Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li> No negative reaction at all.</li>
            <li> The first photo shows just a week ago and as you can see I have very sparse and short lashes.  </li>
            <li> After it dries, I put my makeup on like normal.</li>
            <li> and I might get there in a few more weeks</li>
            <li> This product my wife have been using it, thanks to a gift I received, but at first she wasn&#x27;t convinced to use it, but later she started using Lash Care Growth Serum</li>
            <li> Eye growth serum makes her lashes longer, shinier, fuller, healthier, and more fluffy looking.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum if your lashes need a lot of help to look longer and start new growth!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li> I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li> I have paid far more for much less at salons.</li>
            <li> Price wise, I found it to be in the same range for other similar products, so</li>
            <li> , I was wrong this product is amazing , I don&#x27;t need false lashes anymore :) love it</li>
            <li> but they do feel a little more lush .</li>
            <li> Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I believe that they will take a bit longer to stimulate new growth but the results of the lengthening is noticeable.</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth product was new to me</li>
            <li> so I have a dread every time I try a new product.</li>

            <li> and they are all natural.</li>
            <li> They say it takes 30 days, but two weeks WITHIN natural lashes of my wife were longer and healthier.</li>
            <li> According to the Package,  It will take some time before I really see results, and I have only used it for a week, so I&#x27;m still unsure of whether it works or not.  </li>

            <li> Nor marks of, and although I have heard name a few who are famous, I think this will be my next choice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give a full review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my normal stuff!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are very important for a woman sexyness, so they should take the this issue seriously and buy this serum.</li>
            <li> I also applied it to the less full areas on my eyebrows as stated in the direction.</li>
            <li> No mess at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely give it time to dry but then feel free to apply your regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used it on my eyebrows like it suggests but only because I don&#x27;t particularly want or need thicker brows.</li>
            <li> Maybe work a tiny bit but mainly it would just darken my lashes and make them appear fuller.</li>
            <li> I would have thought she was crazy, until I saw it with my own eyes!</li>
            <li> Large and conspicuous tabs in a single product</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or oily and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear contacts but because I had a bit irritation in eyes on the first day when product actually did slightly went in my eyes, I had avoided contacts for the rest of the times.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice results, but I am very hopeful.  </li>
            <li> but apparently was discontinued</li>
            <li> and i can actually feel the length and see the difference from my natural eyelashes after applying it.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that looks natural on and does not clump.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptic about products like this and always think that spending money for this kind of product is just a waste.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and look forward to the dramatic results:))</li>
            <li> After having my third child I have experienced the typical hormonal post partem hair loss, and unfortunately I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes have taken a hit too.</li>
            <li> This is the best Lash product I have ever used you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The slight irritation is why I gave it three stars, but I will update this review if I adjust to the irritation and receive positive results.</li>
            <li> I recently lost some bottom lashes due to a certain mascara causing them to break off.</li>
            <li> Certainly, this product it won´t let you down.</li>
            <li> Just starting using had a little tingling and itchy at first..</li>
            <li> Once you put those suckers on its not coming out unless you go back to the salon to have a special chemical wash the glue.  </li>
            <li> Then, I recently read this article and it confirms my thoughts and many of others, that the reviews really are fake!</li>
            <li> New lashes have come in and taken up the empty places.  </li>
            <li> It also really burns my eyes if I get even a slight amount in my eyes.</li>
            <li> The company posts a lot of FAKE overenthusiastic reviews, trying to hide the newest, true and critical reviews which are results of real purchase.</li>
            <li> She has a hard time growing long full lashes</li>
            <li> I finally had the full thick lashes I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long.</li>

            <li> eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes .</li>
            <li> My lashes are a little longer and new lashes are starting to appear.</li>
            <li> This product is packaged very well and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get in your eye because it burns like no other.</li>
            <li> My Lashes growing like crazy, Super fast</li>
            <li> Short lashes, long lashes,  doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> length is short since my lashes were not that long to begin with.</li>
            <li> Now I want my long lashes back</li>
            <li> i dont typically have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Tres fibers create a bold effect of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Only downside I do get red eyes if I apply every day, so I do every other day.</li>
            <li> She is going to keep using it and see how it does long term.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look so long</li>
            <li> So this purchase is a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers.</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long anyways</li>
            <li> The tube lasts a long time, even using it on my eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it longer for those long term effects hoping for long lashes!</li>
            <li> I have tried some other products that were supposed to do the same, but they were all just a fraud.</li>
            <li> it makes me look sexy without wearing fake eyelash!</li>
            <li> Many of these reviews must be fake!</li>
            <li> It was unavoidable while waiting for them to dry, even though the package says to avoid that at all costs.</li>
            <li> Let dry fully before you apply any makeup on.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t interfere with my make up just let it dry before you apply make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it after showering, letting it dry, then applying my mascara over it.</li>
            <li> Even a few posts have Spanish words mixed in.</li>
            <li> I came back from being out of town only to discover my time had run out by a few days to return it.</li>
            <li> but since she buy this product  has seen worked initially slow approximately six weeks to see effects but already has sexy eyelashes that enhance her beatiful eyes.</li>
            <li> The only thing i&#x27;m a little worried about is that whenever it goes to your eyes, it burns a little and it made me teary eyed for the next couple of hours, be careful, only apply enough to your lashes.</li>
            <li> You have to use it every single night &amp; in a couple of weeks you&#x27;ll notice fullness &amp; length increase in your lashes.</li>
            <li> when I noticed one morning, while puting on my makeup, it was starting to work, my lashes were actually starting to look a little longer, a little fuller, and now it has been several months</li>
            <li> I received a small discount for my review and I admit I am pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li> As long as it looks wet, it&#x27;s enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that not one would actually work for me.</li>
            <li> Then, she keeps them closed for about 3 seconds after application to allow them to dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the results vary with different hair types of colors, but it worked for me and I have pretty thick, black lashes.</li>
            <li> I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance.</li>
            <li> I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for a little over a week and can actually tell a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell like most chemicals have.</li>
            <li> On top of that this stuff stings really badly when you apply</li>
            <li> Knowing everyone is different and has different results I would recommend using this for at least 1 month to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was born with long dark eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so, be careful.</li>
            <li> and I have not really seen a change yet to my lashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing that happened was I wasted money on this lying ass product.</li>
            <li> widely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> it stings (so apply carefully)</li>
            <li> I was careful not to get it in my eyes, but the instructions say that if that were to happen, wash thoroughly sigh water.</li>
            <li> It does burn slightly as it is applied, but it was minor and there was no visible</li>
            <li> This product helped me with so unpleasant problem of sparse lashes , my hairdresser had told me the product but never had borrowed antencion until we probe the truth takes a little more than what the poster</li>
            <li> she was not very motivated!</li>
            <li> No damage to your eyes or other adverse effects.</li>
            <li> And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you buy this product with that expectation you will be for sure disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other eyelash enhancement before and they worked.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, so I hope to see some results soon, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Im using this one on one side and smartlash on the other and this one is beating it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products and lashes lengthened, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with this product.</li>
            <li> , i have  tried with other 2 brands than didn&#x27;t work out so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three other lash serums and haven&#x27;t had any luck.</li>
            <li> So I went into this with a very open mind not sure it would work at all</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s actually tried a few of this, she has very thin eyelashes that are very difficutl to work with.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these types of products but it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one was less but ends up being a total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to jump to any conclusions, but I am quite certain that this seller is using FAKE REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some were reasonably priced and some were ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> they are not worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different growth serums and this one has been the one that has been the least problematic in the sense that if I accidently get it inside my eye it doesn&#x27;t burn like others have.</li>
            <li> It was a relief, all the doubts that i have in mine was wrong, this thing really works.</li>

            <li> my wife WHO has always suffered from having a short lashes and slow to grow</li>
            <li> I have thin light lashes that make me look tired everyday</li>
            <li> Few months back I went to a salon and got some individual false lash extensions glued on.</li>
            <li> There goes money down the drain.</li>
            <li> This is a product from which you can see from the reviews is one that will not let you down.</li>
            <li> I have natural long but very thin lashes myself, so I&#x27;ve always been about growth serums and enhancers.</li>
            <li> They do grow a little (much less than other brands I&#x27;ve tried) but they keep falling, no strength at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not very thick, so I had artificial individual lashes applied to add volume and length.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not very thick, so I had artificial individual lashes applied to add volume and length.  </li>
            <li> I found it though to be a bit irritating when it by accident goes into your eye, so I had to be extra careful in the application.</li>
            <li> There is slight changes that I have noticed and the product seems to be working.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed less eye lashes falling out.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly tingly until it dries.</li>
            <li> It does burn the eye slightly if you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess serum.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I have used high-priced salon grade products in the past w/o results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product, I have long, thick, but still blond eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative to RapidLash which I usually purchase (and works really well, but is expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Directions are easy shake before use aplly it twice a day morning and night at the base of your lashes.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using IT (a little over a month now)  </li>
            <li> Read through the reviews and see for yourself, all the 5-star reviews seem a little fishy.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money!</li>

            <li> I GAVE THIS TO MY MOM BECAUSE SHE HAS TROUBLE GROWING LASHES AND BROWS.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> it will take a few days to see the effect that ur eyelashes look thicker and longer..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lash serum for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It was completely ineffective, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had always thin and short eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really short thin lashes</li>
            <li> have been using it a few weeks and seen no results</li>
            <li> I want to say first off that I have always been very skeptical over eyelash growth products.</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> When all the false lashes were gone I was left with some bald spots on my eyelash.</li>
            <li> But it took less!</li>
            <li> I hate my boyfriend one, lol, has been very difficult to carry.</li>
            <li> If you get it in your eye,  it does burn pretty bad,  but you can just wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> I have put on my lashes morning and night for the past few days</li>
            <li> She has no more missed places where some of her lashes were missing.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while to see the results but you won&#x27;t be disappointed and worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Not very nice at all</li>
            <li> The applicator glides swiftly across the eyelid at the base of the eyelash and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Saw very little growth and thickness.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little and still will work with very little.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t cause a bad irritation of last long.</li>
            <li> Could it be possible that EVERY product I bought from Amazon, had a FAKE review?</li>
            <li> The brush is small which is a plus for applying this product.</li>
            <li> Still i found that to be a bit questionable when it comes to future purchases.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying eyelash growth products, but couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand and got this one.&lt;br /&gt;Results are underwelming.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The serum doesn’t have any color or small to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the product truly works or not ):</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks :/</li>
            <li> seen a small difference in 1 week</li>
            <li> No more any itch to my eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes were so short and lame before.</li>
            <li> Results are usually within 30 days</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that I have lost fewer lashes than I usually do.</li>
            <li> Ive always hated my eye leashes but after useing this I cant stop looking at my eyes!! :)</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think of this?</li>
            <li> She says me that no need to try other products like this that are on the market but with poor quality.</li>
            <li> I wont know any serious results for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I had thin lashes and always been using false lashes, I was tired of wasting the same amount of money for false lashes, I finally found this product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I hated my eyelashes as they were very short and very little volume had to use false eyelashes every day, which made me spend much money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very effective!</li>
            <li> and you would never know that I once hardly had any lashes at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a product that works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have any bad reaction  </li>
            <li> You have to keep using at least 3-4 tines a week to maintain look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy, but it is just enough that I like what I&#x27;m seeing</li>
            <li> The artificial lashes only lasted about two weeks</li>
            <li> this product sucks.</li>
            <li> She has not had any irritation or negative effects from IT Lash Care.</li>
            <li> She is a fanatic when it comes to her make-ups and her eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This product is not effective at all - it is almost two months</li>
            <li> The artificial lashes only lasted about two weeks</li>
            <li> so I was a little sloppy putting it on.</li>
            <li> My lashes grew very little!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried a few of these that are on the market, I have very thin eyelashes that are difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I just got mine few days ago - will update this review when I see the results.&lt;br /&gt;For now - it is causing burning sensation and irritation - it lasts for few seconds only, but is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Its not a huge dramatic difference</li>
            <li> Very small difference</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have made a very small improvement, but it is an improvement nonetheless.</li>
            <li> but I am seeing subtle results from using the product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping I see so subtle difference where I can have longer, thicker lashes without needing makeup.  </li>
            <li> I find that this lash care growth serum is a little difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find it a little tough to get it only on the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about this product is how badly it hurts if it gets in your eye</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to put it directly on the eyelashes, but rather on the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was desperate for something besides putting on messy, hard to remove mascara each day.</li>
            <li> The noticeable difference in just a short period of time in crazy!  </li>
            <li> i wish i can get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I usually use this type of product, because my lashes are very thin</li>
            <li> Very slow,</li>
            <li> she has really thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The product can also be applied to eyebrows for those that have thin eyebrows that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Was not happy, I used it for 6 weeks and could not tell a difference at all</li>
            <li> I had thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Made my lashes worse.</li>
            <li> The tabs are thin.</li>
            <li> I never get tired of saying it</li>
            <li> To apply the serum, you apply it just like you would eyeliner, as close to the lash base as possible.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it works, but it was irritating to my eyes</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> apply the eyelash serum on the base of her eyelashes twice daily: morning and night after she has cleansed her face.</li>
            <li> I had thin lashes and tried usingfalse lashes</li>
            <li> It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking.</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had to use false lashes.</li>
            <li> care looked, I had the problem that anybody else seem to have they were weak and thin!</li>
            <li> I quit using the fake lashes and started using lash care growth and the result was unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> I quit using the fake lashes and started using lash care growth and the result was unbelievable!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and have noticed some slight growth, the base of my lashes are darker than before and seem to be thicker, The serum does sting a slig&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is fake</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already saved money by not having to buy fake lashes for my weekly date night.</li>
            <li> Ill keep using it to see if they grow longer.</li>
            <li> i lost after my fake eyelash experiment 😃</li>
            <li> So people who say its fake maybe all things dont work for all people.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anymore of those fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used to put on the fake lashes but don&#x27;t have to anymore since using Lash Care</li>
            <li> Forget buying fake eyelashes the solution is here and is called Lash Growth Serum Care</li>
            <li> The reviews are all fake.</li>
            <li> Fake reviews, beware.</li>
            <li> Also, you can tell by how these reviews are written, they are fake.</li>
            <li> (My lashes have actually decreased in volume!).</li>
            <li> Those who used fake eyelash of the market and suffered a lot can take this as panacia.</li>
            <li> ( I have very thin ones.)</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes, very disappointed with the amount I paid for this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like crazy glue .</li>
            <li> They are not the crazy lashes</li>
            <li> This will be my secret &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;..beauty product!!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Fake customers lure you into buying a worthless thing.</li>
            <li> which was quite impossible for me even 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> Getting a refund is virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> but this irritated my eyes so bad</li>
            <li> Anyway, some of the lashes were rubbed off by accident or painfully pulled off .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always had very thin eyelashes that I hated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always worried about using eyelash serums as I&#x27;m afraid of anything bad happening to my eyes but with this serum I have had no problems what so ever!</li>
            <li> she says it makes her eye lashes grow like crazy and makes them thicker!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed, since a lot of people seem to like the product.</li>
            <li> It got expensive!!</li>
            <li> It got expensive!!  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful about trying this product</li>
            <li> You just swipe the brush at the base of the lashes once in the morning once at night.</li>
            <li> Also, you will apply this twice a day to the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> My wife used this serum, and boy was she shocked!  </li>
            <li> who I can say, I comprenlo not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Worst eyelash enhancement I had ever used.</li>
            <li> I have gotten it in my eyes and it does sting, but nothing terrible happened.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> did not notice any difference on my eyelashes after using it for 2 months</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was born with long dark eyelashes. But not everyone is! I was having a talk with my roommate and she said how she wasn&#x27;t a fan of her short lashes. For her birthday I ordered her this Eyelash Growth Serum. I mean, what more says Happy Birthday than makeup and serum to help her have long beautiful lashes? I know, nothing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy for her to put on. But boy did it hurt like the dickens when it got in her eyes. It was unavoidable while waiting for them to dry, even though the package says to avoid that at all costs. Whoops! Her lashes were a tad bigger, didn&#x27;t notice a big change like what we were expecting. She is going to keep using it and see how it does long term.</li>
            <li> I used several serums on my eye lashes but nothing was like this. I feel very organized now as my lashes are now beautiful which was quite impossible for me even 2 months ago. I will definitely buy 1 next time and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This gives you those sexy lashes just like the stars! Instead of having to go to a professional and pay a pretty penny! Its amazing!!</li>
            <li> Great price for great results! Beautiful longer and fuller lashes.  No clumping as of yet.</li>

            <li> I usually use this type of product, because my lashes are very thin and I can say that this Serum really works. This product gave my eyelashes and eyebrows high gloss and flexibility. I really liked a lot. I recommend so much it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now, and have already seen progress with my lashes. I don&#x27;t have a problem with thin lashes, but did want some more length to eliminate the need for mascara all the time. Now, when I remove my mascara at night, it feels as though I still have some on because my lashes look longer than they did when I started.</li>
            <li> My grilfriend said If you are overwhelmed by the list of things to consider when searching for an eyelash product, then don&#x27;t worry, because this product it´s excellent, so i have to buy it. But, seriously she got larger eyelashes in a few weeks using this product.</li>

She says me that no need to try other products like this that are on the market but with poor quality. I said it before and repeat again. i LOVE her eyes!!</li>
            <li> The Eyelash Growth Products is a great mascara to use. It glides on easily and makes your eyelashes long and beautiful. It&#x27;s an amazing product to use.</li>
            <li> I barely received it, and It is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about puchasing LASH CARE GROWTH SERUM, simply because I have tried so many different products that claim to help your lashes grow. Nothing has ever worked. I purchased Lash Care Growth Serum as one more final attempt to have the full, long, sexy lashes that I always wanted. I was starting to give up hope when I noticed one morning, while puting on my makeup, it was starting to work, my lashes were actually starting to look a little longer, a little fuller, and now it has been several months and you would never know that I once hardly had any lashes at all. My close friends have started to notice. I just cant say enough good things about this product. I will never be without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product because my wife has sold using and has seen extraordinary results in no time, no longer have to stand the uncomfortable false eyelashes to highlight its beauty. She says that Lash Growth Serum Care makes her feel comfortable and radiant with makeup. In addition, no side effects on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Fragile eyelashes aren&#x27;t a problem anymore. I have tried some other products that were supposed to do the same, but they were all just a fraud. Since i&#x27;m using this one, my lashes have grown strong and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;[7:59:20] Leonardo Vargas: toma ahí, mameh</li>
            <li> My mother and sister are grateful with me because it found this wonderful product. The eyelashes are very important for a woman sexyness, so they should take the this issue seriously and buy this serum. You&#x27;ll not regret.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter because she had so much time asking to buy it, because all her friends have it, I seemed good price and reliable, so buy one to try, my daughter is now using it two weeks and is very happy now annoys me because she wants to buy another. No damage to your eyes or other adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Love product, great service</li>
            <li> You must use the product for 30 days and be regular in use and you will see a huge difference! My eyelashes are so much thicker and longer! I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Before and after are amazing. This will be my secret &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34;..beauty product!!</li>
            <li> After a three week usage period already see fuller , more luxurious lashes. Can see that it will be the first product to be used ,now , future and seemingly forever.</li>
            <li> I have, (or should say, had) thin, short, blond eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I have long, thick, but still blond eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;This increased the length and thickness by about 50 %. I am very happy with it and would order again.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 47 yo red headed female.&lt;br /&gt;This product will not make your lashes any darker, but it made my a lot longer and thicker, so I can put a little bit of mascara on to darken them, and they look great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always worried about using eyelash serums as I&#x27;m afraid of anything bad happening to my eyes but with this serum I have had no problems what so ever! It&#x27;s very easy to apply and you really don&#x27;t need much per application. I have been using it for a couple days now and while I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes I can tell that my lashes are growing a little bit and are actually stronger since I used to lose eyelashes more than I would like. Since using the IT serum I haven&#x27;t noticed any eyelashes falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you only have to apply the serum once a day and if you do it in the morning you can still wear makeup as long as you make sure the serum is dry! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Eyelash growth is a must for me and this product is great. Its so easy to apply and I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn.I apply twice a day as instructed and it dries quickly so I can apply my makeup.No mess at all.Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 eyelash growth serums from Amazon that ALL had great reviews. Some were reasonably priced and some were ridiculously expensive. I thought it was odd that not one would actually work for me. Are my eyelashes really that different than someone else&#x27;s, for a product to never work on me? Could it be possible that EVERY product I bought from Amazon, had a FAKE review? Then, I recently read this article and it confirms my thoughts and many of others, that the reviews really are fake! Copy and paste this link to read for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;http://a.msn.com/r/2/AAaFb32?a&#x3D;0&amp;m&#x3D;en-us&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, if someone has a recommendation of an eyelash growth serum that works, that isn&#x27;t an employee of a firm that sells one, please let me know by commenting in this section. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash for my wife. she has really thin eyelashes. she has only been using this for a couple weeks and her lashes are longer and darker already, according to her is of great quality and lasts pretty, the truth is very noticeable change in her beautiful face</li>
            <li> For anyone woman who wants to be always beautiful, I totally recommend this product! It is reasonably priced on amazon, it gives life to captivate keeping them always beautiful, giving them strength to help with the force of weather and sunshine! I wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else!</li>
            <li> Saw very little growth and thickness.  Did not appear to strengthen lashes much.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> My wife likes certain types of products only and i was kind of worried when when i bought this for her to try, and the results have been great.  She´s seen a real change in her lashes and she added this product to one of her must use list.</li>
            <li> Lash Care growth serum naturally helps promote longer lashes. Directions are easy shake before use aplly it twice a day morning and night at the base of your lashes. Do not apply directly on lashes use on clean skin free of any makeup or eyecreams. Let dry fully before you apply any makeup on. Basically you want to put it on like you do eyeliner. Avoid getting into your eyes. Apply enough to moisten your eyes but not drip into them.It does state if it gets into your eyes to wash immediately with cool water. The product can also be applied to eyebrows for those that have thin eyebrows that is a plus. What I like about it is it is hypo allergenic sensitivity tested with no artificial color. The product is fragrance free and not tested on animals. Now if you do not have a steady hand this can be a little overwhelming at first. You could have someone apply it for you or keep your eye closed that your applying it to and have a towel handy just in case. The brush is small which is a plus for applying this product. The liquid is clear. It does not leave your eyes feeling greasy or heavy. Dries fast. This is an 8 weeks supply and it suggest using 30 days to see improvements to your lashes. Comes with instructions on how to use. I was sent this product free to review and test. It does not effect my ratings of this product at all.</li>
            <li> Amazingly enough this product works for me.  I have been using it for about 1 month and will continue to use it as it makes a difference for me.  Knowing everyone is different and has different results I would recommend using this for at least 1 month to see if it works for you.  Follow the instructions and use morning and night.  Good luck fellow &#x27;I have no eyelashes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, longer and thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister she was having trouble growing full lashes and had went through many products before this by far is her fav</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Haven&#x27;t really seen any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried but I heard good things about this product</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product to have fuller longer eyelashes , this product came just as described .It arrived quickly and the packaging was perfect .It arrived in perfect condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a natural eyelash serum , this is the best lash enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes  in about a month. Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth. It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking. This product is made with natural ingredients. And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for awhile and I have seen great results .My eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes . But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more . This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions and you will have beautiful fuller and longer lashes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This eyelash 30 growth is amazing if you got stubby eyelashes then this most definitely is right for you</li>
            <li> good product! wish it worked quicker, but I am satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> Better, fuller and longer lashes is what you want!! This is the best you can find for that!! Really great!</li>
            <li> I am only using it once a day and it calls for twice a day application. Application to bottom lashes and eyebrows is easy. Top lashes not so easy, tends to get in my eyes. Definitely doesn&#x27;t feel great in your eyes but I am seeing subtle results from using the product.</li>
            <li> Loving this! I&#x27;ve used Latisse before, and this is very comprable without irritation!</li>
            <li> these lash growth serums do not work... they are not worth the money</li>
            <li> See results in a matter of days. This product was easy to apply and works for both your eyelashes and eyebrows. I began to see my eyelashes growing in thicker in about 3 days! For my brows it was even faster! This product is packaged very well and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.

            <li> Burns and I haven&#x27;t notice any changes in eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not heavy eyelash compare to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum on my lashes for almost a week now and already am able to see some differences with my lashes. I was only using it only on one eye because I really wanted to be able to have a comparison and I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith initially that this product was going to do anything more than cost more money. Boy was I wrong! I use it twice a day, once in the morning before my normal make up routine and again at night after removing my make up. Just in the 5 or 6 days I&#x27;ve been applying it I can really see a difference in the length. I wish there was a way I could snap a photo that could catch the details well enough to show the differences. I don&#x27;t see much yet in the fullness but they are definitely longer. I believe that they will take a bit longer to stimulate new growth but the results of the lengthening is noticeable. I am definitely starting to use it on my left eye tonight as well so I don&#x27;t end up looking freakish with one super long thick eye and one regular eyelashed eye haha. I will say to take caution when applying and swipe the brush against the opening of the tube to wipe off any additional serum before touching it to your lid because this stuff definitely BURNS if it gets into your eye. BURNS! That was a lesson I only had to learn once! The tube is about the size of a regular mascara tube and the brush is like one from a liquid eyeliner. You brush it across the top of the lid where the lashes begin to grow, basicallyv where you apply your eyeliner. I also apply it underneath where I apply eyeliner on the bottom. I have not used it on my eyebrows like it suggests but only because I don&#x27;t particularly want or need thicker brows. The only thing I would change about this product is how badly it hurts if it gets in your eye and I would reduce it to one application a day for convenience. I can&#x27;t argue about its effectiveness though, it really does work quickly. I hope this information was helpful. I received my bottle at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is based solely on my experience having used it. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to extend their lashes.for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is based solely on my experience having used it.

            <li> looking forward to see in a few months the growth</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter!  I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes, very disappointed with the amount I paid for this product!</li>
            <li> My wife used this serum, and boy was she shocked!  The noticeable difference in just a short period of time in crazy!  I can notice a longer and fuller lash in just a short 2 week period!  The application is simple, and the difference was there just after 5 days!  I would have thought she was crazy, until I saw it with my own eyes!</li>
            <li> I have been using IT lashes eyelash growth products for about 2 weeks now and already my eyelashes look splendid! Longer fuller eyelashes in the palm of your hand I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It works very quickly. I see a difference in two weeks. And now after almost a month it is vey noticeable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.  I love my lashes now and I can use less mascara because I now have fuller and thicker lashes.  The price is right and I&#x27;ve already saved money by not having to buy fake lashes for my weekly date night.</li>
            <li> This product has made my lashes longer and fuller since I have used it. I have had a hard time finding a product that works. I absolutely love this product. Everybody should try this product.</li>
            <li> This product shows incredible results to my lashes, highlighting more my eyes and allowing me to have a deeper look with lashes that impact to be looked at. 100% recommended product worth having if you&#x27;re one of those people who want to have longer and striking lashes.</li>
            <li> if you want to have a long and beautiful eyelashes, and soon this product is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;my wife have 20 days using it. and have  very cute eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;she has tried all kinds of product, but this is the one that has found it much better for her</li>
            <li> GREAT! I was looking for gift for my niece and a friend recommended me a product for the care of eyelashes. I purchased this product for her and she looks beautiful when she use it! She looks different no doubts.</li>
            <li> I do not understand what kind of sorcery is this but works incredibly my wife WHO has always suffered from having a short lashes and slow to grow but since she buy this product  has seen worked initially slow approximately six weeks to see effects but already has sexy eyelashes that enhance her beatiful eyes.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the results my sister got. She was surprised when her lashes started becoming stiffer and thicker right away. She was looking for a product to help you regrow, thicken, and enhance your lashes but with this gift i gave her, her problem ended. Fast Shipment.</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all let&#x27;s start by saying that a lash growth serum is NOT going to make you grow lashes as long as Rapunzel&#x27;s hair. Eyelashes, naturally are the slowest growing hairs in the body, and for that reason they don&#x27;t often slough off. So if you buy this product with that expectation you will be for sure disappointed.  I was actually given this product to try and write a review on. I have natural long but very thin lashes myself, so I&#x27;ve always been about growth serums and enhancers. I had been using one, that I kept bringing back from overseas for quite a while but apparently was discontinued, so I thought trying this one was worth the shot.  The product is very appealing, easy to use and same method as others, apply twice daily on a clean face. I found it though to be a bit irritating when it by accident goes into your eye, so I had to be extra careful in the application. It would sting for like 15 seconds and then it was ok. Still i found that to be a bit questionable when it comes to future purchases.  The product I used for 4 weeks, twice daily, I cannot really say my lashes grew a lot longer, but I can definitely say they look more luscious and volumized. When applying mascara they do seem to go out a bit further than before, and like I mentioned they looked fuller. For me it does the trick. Like I said, you can&#x27;t expect miracles, but if we see this product as an enhancer you will definitely see a difference in time, which in my opinion makes it worth it.  Price wise, I found it to be in the same range for other similar products, so I think it&#x27;s just right.  I would recommend this product, just know to keep your expectations real and you will actually notice results.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 weeks ago and l see results already. They say u start to see results in 30 days, l started seeing my lashes getting thicker and a lil longer within two weeks. U will not be disapointed !</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth product was new to me and i was very excited to use it and i can actually feel the length and see the difference from my natural eyelashes after applying it. The seller sent this product to me right away and i  was very impressed on how fast i recieved this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and have noticed some slight growth, the base of my lashes are darker than before and seem to be thicker, The serum does sting a slig&lt;br /&gt;ht bit but doesn&#x27;t cause a bad irritation of last long. it is easy to apply and I use it per directions twice a day morning and night I do wear eye make up over this and it is fine doesn&#x27;t interfere with my make up just let it dry before you apply make up. I was sent this for review but will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very small difference</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give a full review but I can attest to how it causes me no irritation and applies easily. I&#x27;m excited to continue use and hope it helps my lashes grow. I recently lost some bottom lashes due to a certain mascara causing them to break off. I&#x27;ve also been applying this to spots in my eyebrows that could use some hair growth *Sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS TO MY MOM BECAUSE SHE HAS TROUBLE GROWING LASHES AND BROWS.  SHE LOVES IT.  SHE HAS HAD A MORE NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT IN HER EYEBROWS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Was not happy, I used it for 6 weeks and could not tell a difference at all</li>
            <li> Is not what I was expecting!!</li>
            <li> Saw results soonly after I started applying this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying eyelash growth products, but couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand and got this one.&lt;br /&gt;Results are underwelming. They do grow a little (much less than other brands I&#x27;ve tried) but they keep falling, no strength at all.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> big results great stuff</li>
            <li> I had received this product at discounted rate for review, however, that in no way compromises my opinion. I have tried this product for a week on eye lashes as well as eye brows for now. There is slight changes that I have noticed and the product seems to be working. I might have to wait 30 days to see any real noticeable difference in growth thought.&lt;br /&gt;Irritation: only if you let it go in your eyes. so, be careful. I normally wear contacts but because I had a bit irritation in eyes on the first day when product actually did slightly went in my eyes, I had avoided contacts for the rest of the times. Better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Price: Very reasonable compared to other high end products I have used prior for the same purpose. The only difference is i was able to start seeing difference in a week by using this product.</li>
            <li> This eyelash growth serum truly works. I have noticed results in only a week. My lashes are a little longer and new lashes are starting to appear. I am truly amazed at the effectiveness of this serum.I highly recommend this serum if your lashes need a lot of help to look longer and start new growth!!&lt;br /&gt; https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?asin&#x3D;B014A5631K#</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much of a difference in fact I&#x27;ve noticed that my eye lashes fall off even more .</li>
            <li> Horrible product! No change. I&#x27;m going back to my normal stuff! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> So far it works! Ive noticed in just 1 week my lashes are fuller! Love this so far.  Will update with change&lt;br /&gt;This was sent to me for reviewing purposes.  All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a week and I have not really seen a change yet to my lashes. But so far I like it and I dont have any side effects. I am applying it like a liner and a mascara as well. I will definitely update after I run out to see if it made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a promotional price to test and review.</li>
            <li> faithfully using and no noticeable results after three weeks.  I think it may moisturizer your lashes but does not help them grow.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother who has a little problem with her eyelashes, so my girlfriend told me she bought for her also, I like to please that encata me, every morning now looks more beautiful thanks to product</li>
            <li> This product lives up to marketing claims. I have paid far more for much less at salons. The product is easy to use, long lasting, and I have fuller lashes again! When you step out you want to look and feel your best. This product will give you that feeling every time.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! it makes me look sexy without wearing fake eyelash!</li>
            <li> I have used many products for eyelashes, but none have done the job for me. and then I found this product and decided to try it because it was recommended and the truth has worked very well at a great price that helps me to see much more beautiful.</li>
            <li> Lashes appear so fast it totally surprised me. It is an amazing product. It was about 2 weeks when I noticed the most visible evidence that the product was doing as advertised. Do not waste anymore time, get it today.</li>
            <li> The Eyelash growth was delivered in protective packaging and is exactly as described on product page. We purchased this eyelash serum in a promotion for testing and review. After using this particular brand for a week, have not noticed a significant difference in any new lash growth, but lashes do seem fuller and slightly longer.  Will return and update with further results...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these types of products but it actually works pretty well. I have put on my lashes morning and night for the past few days and I have noticed a difference. Its not a huge dramatic difference but you can see it. I suggest taking before and after pictures so you can truly see the difference. My lashes look thicker and fuller. Be careful not to get in your eye because it burns like no other. Make sure you wipe off any excess serum to make sure that it doesn’t get into your eyes and you should be good. The serum doesn’t have any color or small to it. The package states its good for an 8 week supply. I am excited to see the difference in a month.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This product is really simple to apply. You just swipe the brush at the base of the lashes once in the morning once at night. I have reactions to so much stuff so I have a dread every time I try a new product. This had no odor or burn. No negative reaction at all. I have thin light lashes that make me look tired everyday so I was desperate for something besides putting on messy, hard to remove mascara each day. My lashes are more noticeable even though I have been using less than a week. My lashes are darker. I would say I am satisfied with this and glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very effective! My lashes grew very little!</li>
            <li> I love it! I definitely notice a difference. I&#x27;ll be buying this product again when I run out. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this i havent noticed a huge difference but i have noticed my eyelashes are much stronger! Ill keep using it to see if they grow longer.</li>
            <li> Read through the reviews and you find the same story: &amp;#34;I bought it for my wife/girlfriend/daughter and she loves it.&amp;#34; Not to mention all the typos in the reviews as if the poster doesn&#x27;t use English as a first language. Even a few posts have Spanish words mixed in. All of the reviews are posted around the same time by men&#x27;s names as well. I&#x27;m not sure of the product truly works or not ):</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses and likes this product, after a.couple she noticed fuller, thicker lashes, and ordering this product from amazon is easy and hassle free,  recommend..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference yet. I will feel better giving a review after a month or so.</li>
            <li> Better, fuller and longer lashes is what you want!! This is the best you can find for that!! Really great!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, and this product does not bother them one bit!  I use it once a day, in the morning after I shower.  Very easy to apply with the applicator.  I like to think that I&#x27;ve seen results, but haven&#x27;t yet.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days.  I will continue to use and look forward to the dramatic results:))</li>
            <li> This products works....I noticed a difference in a few weeks, and now keep purchasing to maintain nice lashes. My normal lashes are short and fine...with this product when I add mascara my lashes are showy and look great. However....You have to keep using at least 3-4 tines a week to maintain look.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I got this product on a promotional price in exchane for a honest Review&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product Is of the highest quality which is evident once you try it on. No irritation. No smell. Actual results! watch my full video review that will go live soon! There will be in depth review, and progression pics to see results for yourself! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJEgjDt2WRn3_pnbqeVzAQ/videos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and have noticed fuller, thicker, &amp; longer lashes already! I&#x27;ve been applying it after showering, letting it dry, then applying my mascara over it. I give this product 5 stars not only for effectiveness but how quickly it worked as well!! Don&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase you will definitely be glad you bought it. :) Make sure to have your eyes partly open when you apply this to the base of your lashes, I experimented with the best way to apply it (without getting it in your eye) and having my eyes slightly open and looking downward was the best method. I hope you enjoy the results as much as I am! I received a slight discount for my review but all opinions are ENTIRELY my own! :)</li>
            <li> It made a nice difference in my lashes in 1 months use. My lashes are longer but they aren&#x27;t so much thicker</li>
            <li> Actually have noticed some length in my lashes. Nothing crazy, but it is just enough that I like what I&#x27;m seeing and I&#x27;m going to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> It works!  Lashes are thicker.  My lashes were sparse but growing to fill in gaps. Noticeably more lashes but length is short since my lashes were not that long to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving growing my own lashes back. As I&#x27;ve gotten older they seem to have stopped growing. Do far this product seems to be amazing. I revived this product in honor of my review in a discount.</li>
            <li> Does this product sting a bit, yes, but so what IF IT HAD WORKED.  It didn&#x27;t work. And they only give you 30 days to return, I gave it longer because hair growth can take a while - now I can&#x27;t get a refund.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Get the Rx stuff.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, no irritation</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product a week ago and I can already see great results! The first photo shows just a week ago and as you can see I have very sparse and short lashes.  Fast forward to now and I find they are much thicker and their length is increasing.  I am so impressed with this product I can&#x27;t wait to see the results at the end of a month!</li>
            <li> Worst eyelash enhancement I had ever used. Bought 2 of these because of the positive reviews. I had been using this for over 3weeks now and did not get any kind of result. In addition it stings awe fully when placed on the lash line. I had tried other eyelash enhancement before and they worked. So this purchase is a complete waste.</li>
            <li> it will take a few days to see the effect that ur eyelashes look thicker and longer..it is very easy to apply and u can wear mascara right away</li>
            <li> comes with easy instructions ! easy to apply  don&#x27;t have smell I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have any bad reaction  and I love how well packaged it comes great product working really good !</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 weeks straight and nothing has changed! I think they should refund my money because now I have to start over with a different serum and I wanted longer lashes for summer. I have used other kinds and they&#x27;ve worked great. This one was less but ends up being a total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Did I get the only bunk bottle out of all of these reviews? Nothing happened to my lashes. The only thing that happened was I wasted money on this lying ass product.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a ZERO rating I would. It did absolutely nothing. My lashes are actually falling out! There goes money down the drain. Getting a refund is virtually impossible. Do NOT buy!</li>
            <li> What an awesome product!!!! I now have thicker, longer lashes!!! Where has this product been!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months with zero results.</li>
            <li> My medications have made me lose my hair and I was very pleased with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My eyelashes do not look like they used to. The results were remarkable five days of using it, my eyelashes are longer and fuller. I can not wait to see how will my eyelashes be at the end of the treatment. Thanks for giving me the chance to review this product with a great discount! I am so happy!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a week but so far I like it. It is too soon to see if I have any changes in my lashes. The product comes in a wand with a little brush applicator. It is easy to apply except that you are not supposed to get it in your eyes which is kind of tricky. I have gotten it in my eyes and it does sting, but nothing terrible happened. I will update my review once I have had enough time to see if it works. The product says that it will take 30 days before results are noticed.  I have received this product for an exchange of a review.</li>
            <li> I have seen a big difference in my lashes. They get fuller and longer faster. Only downside I do get red eyes if I apply every day, so I do every other day.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this product! she says it makes her eye lashes grow like crazy and makes them thicker! great! she&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> i dont typically have sensitive eyes but this irritated my eyes so bad so if you have sensitive eyes this isnt for you for sure, be cautious.</li>
            <li> so far so good, thought i would have better results, but happy with it./</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lash serum for a few weeks now and I can already notice the difference. It is very easy to apply. I put it on at night right before bed so it stays on untouched all night. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t bother or irritate my eye lips. I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change in the length of my eye lashes and will continue to use this product every night.</li>
            <li> Few months back I went to a salon and got some individual false lash extensions glued on. It&#x27;s like crazy glue . Once you put those suckers on its not coming out unless you go back to the salon to have a special chemical wash the glue.  Anyway, some of the lashes were rubbed off by accident or painfully pulled off . When all the false lashes were gone I was left with some bald spots on my eyelash. This lash growth grew my lashes back from the bald area!! Yes it grew hair but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make them longer. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks :/ since I got it .</li>
            <li> been using it for 5 weeks and no changes!!! i wish i can get my money back :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  However, it just does not stay in stock when I need it.</li>
            <li> i love this product :)</li>
            <li> I just received this so I cannot fully review yet but I must admit this looks very nice. It goes on easily and nicely and I am very happy with it for the few days that I have used it. I received a small discount for my review and I admit I am pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li> I am on the 4th day of using IT&#x27;s lash growth serum. First let me say that I am quite impressed with this product. It is working fast and it&#x27;s working like it said it would. I was given the product and asked for a review. I can&#x27;t wait to see what lengths my lashes go to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the outer packaging was that it was clear and concise. Very neat and appealing to the eye. Inside the box were the instructions and the tube of serum. The golden tube is beautiful and elegant looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> make sure to let dry between applications, you DONT want this stuff in your eye. results take id say two weeks but are comparable to a week on Latisse. Ok, Latisse is definitely sex in a bottle, but this stuff does the trick if you don&#x27;t have the finances. also lattise gives you pigmented eyelids if applied too often, with this stuff i have found no such problem</li>
            <li> I just got mine few days ago - will update this review when I see the results.&lt;br /&gt;For now - it is causing burning sensation and irritation - it lasts for few seconds only, but is very unpleasant. I have been using LiLash for years and know what to expect from a similar product - but this burning sensation makes me think twice about using this product</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to review this item. I really like it so far and can not wait to see the full results. It is very easy to apply. I did not have any burning feeling or irritation. The product did not have a smell. I was able to apply my regular makeup over the Eyelash growth Serum. I also applied it to the less full areas on my eyebrows as stated in the direction. I am so excited I was able to review this item and I recommend it for eyelash and eyebrow hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve exchanged this for a review. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Was reluctant at first but after using it for the last 2 weeks I already see a major difference. Definitely purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Works really good my eye lashes are so much thicker and longer I&#x27;ve been using it for a month seen a small difference in 1 week but in 3 weeks it was amazing the outcome long and full . Lost one star because even if you get a little bit in your eyes it&#x27;s burns... So just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes hhah so along with this review I put before and after photo</li>
            <li> Loving the results that this has gave me. I will definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but it&#x27;s real easy to put on and it dries pretty quickly. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, so I hope to see some results soon, but other than that I like it. I did receive this product for a review.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product but am reticent to try unknown products in or near my eyes. It says it can be used to enhance eyebrow growth as well, so I thought I would start there and see how I reacted to it. It has only been a few applications, the solution is clear and brushes onto eyebrows easily with a very fine brush. It is not runny so I can see it staying along an eyelash line well without dripping after you get the hang of it. It does burn slightly as it is applied, but it was minor and there was no visible irritation- not enough to run to the bathroom to wipe it all off. Maybe the tingle means it is working? The slight irritation is why I gave it three stars, but I will update this review if I adjust to the irritation and receive positive results. It is marketed as a prescription free alternative to enhance lash growth and encloses specific instructions on directions and usage, also stating it is paraben and fragrance free, free of harsh dyes, and safe for contact lens wearers. As it has not been 30 days I won&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s performance quite yet, but if after continued application I notice a difference on my eyebrows, one way or another, I&#x27;ll update this review and add details- I want to know if a product is safe near my eyes first, and enhances my lashes or brows thereafter!</li>
            <li> It helped me get my lashes back i lost after my fake eyelash experiment 😃</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different growth serums and this one has been the one that has been the least problematic in the sense that if I accidently get it inside my eye it doesn&#x27;t burn like others have. It has definitely helped the growth of my eyelashes. I have begun to apply it to my eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> My Lashes growing like crazy, Super fast and i can really say, it is an effective product. The only thing i&#x27;m a little worried about is that whenever it goes to your eyes, it burns a little and it made me teary eyed for the next couple of hours, be careful, only apply enough to your lashes.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product but wanted to post my review during the process. I was a little skeptical at first because I have used high-priced salon grade products in the past w/o results. I must say I am thus far very impressed with the product. It is easy to apply and does not irritate my eyes which is usually pretty easy to do. It does not have a bad smell like most chemicals have. After approx 3 weeks of use, my eye lashes do appear thicker, fuller. I don&#x27;t have to put on as much mascara in the mornings to get them to look as full as I want them to. Definitely worth trying. Not sure if the results vary with different hair types of colors, but it worked for me and I have pretty thick, black lashes. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Based of the reviews, I ordered this for my friend &amp; I, gave it over 1 month following directions, &amp; it did not produce ANY growth for either of us. I came back from being out of town only to discover my time had run out by a few days to return it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the entire product yet , but I can already see my eyebrows getting fuller ( I have very thin ones.) My eyelashes have made a very small improvement, but it is an improvement nonetheless. It is very easy to apply and it is clear colored. I put it on at night before I go to bed and again in the morning after I wash my face. After it dries, I put my makeup on like normal. I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a couple weeks !!</li>
            <li> After one month of usage I have not noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, fuller and look awesome after using this product!!! It works great!!</li>
            <li> As I child with glasses I made the mistake of trimming my lashes so they didn&#x27;t hit the lense every time I blinked. Now I want my long lashes back and I&#x27;m hoping this will stimulate the growth again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptic about products like this and always think that spending money for this kind of product is just a waste. Good thing about it is that the seller gave me this under a promotional value just for me to try it and see it for myself. It was a relief, all the doubts that i have in mine was wrong, this thing really works. It&#x27;s very easy to use, just follow the instructions. No irritations and you can really see the difference with your lashes. It grows and become thicker than before. No foul smell nor itchiness. I&#x27;m very glad that i tried it because its really worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! The price couldn&#x27;t be any better and I would definitely use it again. Not clumpy and gives my eyelashes length I never had before.</li>
            <li> Good price for a product that will gives results in one wee, and from a trusted brand, comparable to other lash products that provide similar results.</li>
            <li> this price for the eyelash growth is extremnly good, is so cheaply for how GOOD it is, and with 15 days using it you can note change, it is not necessary to use mascara because you gain so much more volume and are more long lashes, really if you&#x27;re not happy with your eyelashes purchase this product is a good price and very good, no longer need to spend so much money by using lots of mascara to look nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around evening time for most of the month and have stunning results. My lashes are longer, as well as thicker and darker as well! I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance. Don&#x27;t expect changes to happen overnight. It took around 4 weeks for me to see a difference and now it is remarkable! I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers. I hope Amazon will always carry this product, go get yours ladies!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago and already notice my lashes have gotten significantly longer! Works fast!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice results, but I am very hopeful.  There is no irritation and it is very simple to apply.  Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Saw zero difference after a month. Used twice a day. No change in growth or fullness.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using it for 5 weeks but it looks like it is working. Wanted more and I might get there in a few more weeks but for now not bad. And i used it on my brows. So people who say its fake maybe all things dont work for all people. Im using this one on one side and smartlash on the other and this one is beating it . They are not the crazy lashes but they are a little bit longer and a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought it for myself and for my mother. We both didn&#x27;t think it would take 30 days. But it took less! I had fuller sexier lashes in 25 days!</li>
            <li> Wow! This product makes my eyes really stand out. Easy to apply. I just love it.</li>

            <li> I had thin eyelashes I thought that there is no product for my problem , I was wrong this product is amazing , I don&#x27;t need false lashes anymore :) love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around evening time for most of the month and have stunning results. My lashes are longer, as well as thicker and darker as well! I used other lash products partially in the past, and fellt that this item is far better...cost, and performance. Don&#x27;t expect changes to happen overnight. It took around 4 weeks for me to see a difference and now it is remarkable! I get comments all the time about how long my lashes are, even from strangers. I hope Amazon will always carry this product, go get yours ladies!</li>
            <li> Looking through the reviews, all comments suggested that I was a good product, so I decided to try it. My surprise was unexpected! than excellent just perfect! who I can say, I comprenlo not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend wants to be a makeup artist and needed a good product for eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this for her and she loves him, this product is good with good quality and made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is better than care Lash Growth Serum? I love and she loves it.</li>
            <li> No more any itch to my eyes, it&#x27;s really works for me , my lashes are looks better than before, and i just recommended this to my sister. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used this product which was a little cheaper so I thought I would try it but something in the ingredients burned my eyes.  I will stick with what I know.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anymore of those fake eyelashes. This product really works and perfect for my wife&#x27;s eyes. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> Let each tab with volume. stretched on a lift 360 ° bend thick looking , sensual curves and full of seduction. The brush does everything. Self- driven , its vibrating brush gives you all the effects, all in high volume uno.Tres fibers create a bold effect of false eyelashes. Bright color makes it look more seductive than ever your eyes.</li>
            <li> I teared up and it got into my left eye and caused a lot of redness, which stayed for about four days. I am still using the product, just making sure it doesn&#x27;t get into my eyes any more. I do like the product I have noticed some regrowth in my lashes, I have also noticed when I stopped using it until the redness went away my lashes began to fall out again.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough about this product! My lashes were so short and lame before. They are fuller and longer now! Everyone always asks if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. It is great.</li>
            <li> This can cause a Burning sensation if you get it in your eye. So I would suggest you wipe off any excess before you use it. But it is easy to apply. It does not change the color of your lashes. Plus it states you can use it twice a day but I only had to use it once and in three days I did notice a difference. It actually made my lashes look longer and fuller. Plus they did not break off as easily when I added mascara  which I can do with the Serum being on my lashes. If you would like to know more about what I thought Please check out my review at: MommiesPointofView.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Works. Just have to remember to use without makeup.</li>
            <li> Not seeing results yet</li>
            <li> Works like a dream, be sure to wipe excess before applying, it will burn your eye if not careful, will see a difference in 1 week tops, mascara goes beautifully and lashes look like  almost unreal! will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> My wife is amazing and now I have a perfect gift for her to use&lt;br /&gt;over and over.  She said she loves this one.</li>
            <li> This product does not work</li>
            <li> Need a couple more weeks to see more results. Very slow, but I do think they are better. I would use all for about eight more week and then let you know. Could be that I am older than most people to use this.  But I am still going to see.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try an eyelash serum for a while now.  I used to have long, thick eyelashes but that was when I was young.  Now they are thinner and more sparse and don&#x27;t look as long as they used to.  I put mascara on and it helps but that is just a cover up to the problem.  This eye lash growth serum is easy to use and over 95% have effective results.  It is easy to use.  I do not have super good hand-eye-face-in-the-mirror coordination so I was a little sloppy putting it on. It is not sticky or oily and dried quickly.  I am a bit of a slacker at my morning routine of sleep being more important than beauty but I am going to try to put this on twice a day (instructions say once in morning and once in evening).  It can be used on eyebrows as well, but I sorta have Oscar-the-Grouch eyebrows so don&#x27;t need them to have any help in growing.  Results are usually within 30 days so I&#x27;m hoping I see so subtle difference where I can have longer, thicker lashes without needing makeup.  Container has 8-week supply so I&#x27;m unsure if I continue after my eyelashes look dashingly awesome or just reuse when those lashes grow out and I want to make sure the new ones are just as awesome.  Love that it is fragrance-free too since a lot of skin creams both my allergies.  Definitely can&#x27;t wait to see how soon until others notice as well.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to pay for full service at a beauty salon.  I will order my next supply today.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found a product that really works on my eye lashes. Since using Lash Care Growth Serum my lash are fuller, stronger and sexier than they ever have been. I used to put on the fake lashes but don&#x27;t have to anymore since using Lash Care and they are all natural. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this lash care growth serum for my sister because shes hoping for a longer and fuller lashes. She just started using it and she likes it since it is easy to apply and she doesn&#x27;t feel any irritations from it. There&#x27;s no problem applying mascara and makeup afterwards and seems like its nothing there. She felt like her lashes are stronger and saw some tiny lashes already! Yay! As of now she is happy with the product and will definitely keep you posted after 30 days of use. Very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> This was so easy to apply and to use. I wont know any serious results for a few weeks I imagine but they do feel a little more lush . So far I approve and zero irritation!</li>
            <li> nice product!price is reasonable,very recommended</li>
            <li> This product lives up to marketing claims. I have paid far more for much less at salons. The product is easy to use, long lasting, and I have fuller lashes again! When you step out you want to look and feel your best. This product will give you that feeling every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried a few of these that are on the market, I have very thin eyelashes that are difficult to work with. My sister actually suggested I try this one out, said she saw one of her friends had been using it with fantastic results. Needless to say I haven&#x27;t had to try any more inferior brands, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to ever again.</li>
            <li> Forget buying fake eyelashes the solution is here and is called Lash Growth Serum Care i checked thanks to my sister who already has a few months using this product and the change has been remarkable and also takes you approximately eight weeks to finish the product and its hypoalergenic.</li>
            <li> Burns and doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE! Made my lashes worse. The reviews are all fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 5-6 weeks and no growth observed. I&#x27;ve used other products and lashes lengthened, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with this product. It was completely ineffective, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been using it for many days and will update review as I see results, I do feel it has thickened amd strengthened my lashes. I am looking forward to using it longer for those long term effects hoping for long lashes!</li>
            <li> Great lash serum helps lashes look full n promotes growth simply in love</li>
            <li> seems simple and easy to use, i like it so far ! haven&#x27;t noticed big difference yet but will add to review as i use it longer !</li>
            <li> will have to wait to see if it works. but for now its good!</li>
            <li> i loved it it is awesome helped my lashes grow!</li>
            <li> Since BIG lashes seem to be all the craze these days I decided to buy and review this product. The application was pretty easy since I am used to applying mascara/having things near my eyes. I haven&#x27;t seen any quick results since I wear it after I have removed my make up for the night and I have only been applying it for a weeks. However, I have noticed that I have lost fewer lashes than I usually do. This is great for people who wear mascara on a regular basis because the mascara thins out lashes and makes them fall out and this serum acts as a sort of protectant/growth supplement.</li>
            <li> Helps your lashes to grow pretty quickly. You should purchase if that&#x27;s what you want</li>
            <li> This is a product from which you can see from the reviews is one that will not let you down.</li>
            <li> Im so happy that I found this product that really works for my girlfriend&#x27;s eyes. She&#x27;s actually tried a few of this, she has very thin eyelashes that are very difficutl to work with. Greate price for greate results. Is very easy to use, long lasting and she has fuller lashes again. She never haven&#x27;t to had to try any more inferior brand.</li>
            <li> birthday gift from my sister who became fascinated because in just weeks I observe the change, today she is happy with her strong and thick lashes, wearing a radiant and glamorous look. widely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is just too cool! I never thought in a million years you could grow your lashes! Both me and a friend have short lashes and after 3 weeks of seeing her use it, I &amp;#34;permanently borrowed&amp;#34; it from her. If you know anyone who wants longer lashes tell them to use this!! Love it</li>
            <li> This product helped me with so unpleasant problem of sparse lashes , my hairdresser had told me the product but never had borrowed antencion until we probe the truth takes a little more than what the poster but it works, is the perfect solution for those women who wear much makeup</li>
            <li> I am very happy because my wife regale Care Lash Serum par, because the lashes are very thin and can say that this serum really works and it works great! using it takes four weeks and your eyelashes look spectacular, Give your lashes a thicker and stronger appearance !! I would recommend this product to anyone who has problems with her lashes, I recommend.    My wife is very pleased that makes her look more beautiful and the excellent quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product. I had thin lashes and always been using false lashes, I was tired of wasting the same amount of money for false lashes, I finally found this product and decided to try it. The price is really affordable,  and it&#x27;s about the same amount of money you waste when purchasing lashes that you will toss out that night. This product grantees it takes 30 days to work, but after 2 weeks of using it my natural lashes are more longer,fuller, but most important more natural. I am in love with this product and recommend it to everyone suffering with the lashes..</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. The tabs are thin. I found this product and decided Buy it for my wife and of course it proved. The price is reasonable .. They say it takes 30 days, but two weeks WITHIN natural lashes of my wife were longer and healthier. My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product at a reduced price, but my opinion is my own.  I have not noticed much growth since I started using it,  but I have noticed less eye lashes falling out. According to the Package,  It will take some time before I really see results, and I have only used it for a week, so I&#x27;m still unsure of whether it works or not.  I do love not having them fall out as much.  If you get it in your eye,  it does burn pretty bad,  but you can just wipe it off.  Product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Effective! You have to use it every single night &amp; in a couple of weeks you&#x27;ll notice fullness &amp; length increase in your lashes. They also feel softer! My only gripe is if you get a drop in your eye it stings (so apply carefully) I like this because it&#x27;s much more affordable than what I used to use!</li>
            <li> After having my third child I have experienced the typical hormonal post partem hair loss, and unfortunately I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes have taken a hit too. I&#x27;m writing this review at the start of my use of this product, and will update in 30 days as the product promises to give results by then. I&#x27;m expecting this product to make my eyelashes look fuller and darker, and hopefully help them grow to my pre-children length. This serum is in a tube that looks a bit like a mascara tube. The brush is similar to a liquid eyeliner brush, and since I wear that a lot, it is easy to apply. It feels slightly tingly until it dries. I was careful not to get it in my eyes, but the instructions say that if that were to happen, wash thoroughly sigh water. I also applied it to my eyebrows. I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to update with my results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greaaaaaat! All life I have complained to have short lashes. I hate my boyfriend one, lol, has been very difficult to carry. But thanks to this product I make competition until unmasked my eyelashes look amazing!</li>
            <li> I never get tired of saying it but whenever I write about these products I have to say I do it for my wife and her sister they are a manic Beauty and use any number of different products for skin care and embellishment, from a few weeks ago they used this product and the change has been remarkable, her eyelashes have grown stronger naturally, now they are very happy because they no longer use such false eyelashes that are so difficult to place, including that are manic beauty and I who am your faithful admirer recommend this product to all the girls who want to look naturally beautiful.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy that I found this product that really works, and since she buy this product has sexy eyelashes that enhance her eyes, looks very beautiful, in just two weeks her natural lashes were longer and healthier. I recommend this product to all women who want to look and feel good. This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not very thick, so I had artificial individual lashes applied to add volume and length. The artificial lashes only lasted about two weeks and then I had to do it again. It got expensive!! Thank God I found this product!! I quit using the fake lashes and started using lash care growth and the result was unbelievable!! I finally had the full thick lashes I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long. It&#x27;s so easy to use...</li>
            <li> I am loving this so much! My lashes are so beautiful its ridiculous! I have tried a lot of growth serums and I am 100% pleased with this one and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave this product to my sister&#x27;s birthday and she love it! She looks great, her lashes look more longer and beautiful,  It seems to be safe and very effective, now I will never doubt in buy this product for my girls, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had always thin and short eyelashes so i started to search for a solution for her, i have  tried with other 2 brands than didn&#x27;t work out so, this was my third an last option  and for my surprise it work!, now she have sexy eyelashes all thanks to this eyelash growth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three other lash serums and haven&#x27;t had any luck. Finally tried this and thank goodness I did! I&#x27;ve always had really short thin lashes so I used falsies. Since I&#x27;ve been using IT (a little over a month now)  I can definitely see fuller, thicker lashes and I haven&#x27;t had to use false lashes.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  My fiance&#x27;s eyes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Fake reviews, beware.</li>
            <li> I find that this lash care growth serum is a little difficult to apply. You aren&#x27;t supposed to put it directly on the eyelashes, but rather on the base of your lashes. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I find it a little tough to get it only on the base of my lashes. It also really burns my eyes if I get even a slight amount in my eyes. I do think it&#x27;s a great product as it really seems to make my lashes nice and smooth and soft, but I&#x27;m just not sure this is my favorite lash growth product I&#x27;ve tried since I have issues really applying it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been using it now for a little over a week and can actually tell a difference in my lashes. My lashes seem to be shinier and I do not feel like they are falling out as much as they were. The lash serum is easy to use, I apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. To apply the serum, you apply it just like you would eyeliner, as close to the lash base as possible. I have not experienced any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I applied it before I go to sleep and it makes white crumbs on my lashes every morning.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product alot of times I am glady to say this works for me! Ive always hated my eye leashes but after useing this I cant stop looking at my eyes!! :)</li>
            <li> I love using Lash Care because I can look at my very natural lashes and smooth, easy to use, can remove with soap and water after a day of use in my work. I am a lover of beauty, and I like to keep my makeup and my skin in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I Bought this product for my bestfriend as a gift and im glad to say that she is very satisfied with the results (not being modest). At first glance it shows the change since the last time I saw her eyelashes, she looks more natural!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think of this?</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical but I&#x27;ve always had very thin eyelashes that I hated so I decided to just try. Im so pleased with the outcome  Amazing product,easy to apply no eye irritation, which was one of my main concerns. I finally love my eyelashes. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with product</li>
            <li> I made her day when I walk in her room with this she was so happy a father dreams to see his child smile every dad should get they daughter one</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, my sister has been using for three weeks and has fuller lashes already, waiting on mine to come in the mail...</li>
            <li> I can’t even remember how my lashes before of IT lash care looked, I had the problem that anybody else seem to have they were weak and thin! So after some research in amazon I found this product and now I’m doing great, I’m not afraid of being seen without make-up anymore!</li>
            <li> An amazing way to take care of your eyelashes it makes it grow up and they keep that way for the longest time, it is excelent!&lt;br /&gt;hightly recomended for all that lady that thinks his eyelashes needs a new view!</li>
            <li> Great product for people like me who always wanted fuller, longer lashes. No need to be jealous anymore. Have the lashes you always wanted</li>
            <li> my girlfriend really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Eyelash Growth IT - This is pretty amazing that you can improve thinning lashes and for me eyebrows as mine started disappearing in my 40&#x27;s.  I did notice more new growth on the outer eyebrow and plan on continuing to use to get the full benefit.  I got this on a promo to try and review and am super glad i did because I was hesitant to spend the money on the product not knowing if it would even work but now that I know it works I will not hesitate to purchase more when I need to.</li>
            <li> Many of these reviews must be fake! What guy buys eyelash stuff foris wife or girlfriend?? Also, you can tell by how these reviews are written, they are fake.</li>
            <li> I already  have long lashes this just made them look longer all in all good product</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s co-workers highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fine and neat product to use. I&#x27;m waiting to see results have only had a couple of days but so excited to get results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff! I can&#x27;t wait for the magic to begin! And longer fuller lashes will set in!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative to RapidLash which I usually purchase (and works really well, but is expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the high rating on this product and ordered it immediately. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it a few weeks and seen no results (My lashes have actually decreased in volume!). On top of that this stuff stings really badly when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to this product to read reviews and realized that all the reviews posted on this product have similar grammatical errors. I don&#x27;t want to jump to any conclusions, but I am quite certain that this seller is using FAKE REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that no one will provide an ingredient list for this product is worrisome. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I made. Read through the reviews and see for yourself, all the 5-star reviews seem a little fishy.</li>
            <li> Those who used fake eyelash of the market and suffered a lot can take this as panacia. This eyelash will solute all the problems related to eyelash. So, go, order, buy and use it a solution to have a beautiful view</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in length but I can tell the a bit thicker</li>
            <li> I think it works, but it was irritating to my eyes so I discontinued using it.  I do have allergies so this could be the problem.</li>
            <li> this product sucks. it burned my eyes and did nothing to help my lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money! The company posts a lot of FAKE overenthusiastic reviews, trying to hide the newest, true and critical reviews which are results of real purchase. Fake customers lure you into buying a worthless thing. The product DOES NOTHING to your lashes. I have been using it twice a day for a month and have not noticed any change in my lashes appearance. They are the same, no thicker nor longer. Given how fast the lashes grow (about quarter of inch per month), there should be a visible change already, if IT has any power. IT does not work. Plus, ban the company that lies to you to steal your money.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes growth. I just started and can tell the difference already. 😍</li>
            <li> I have fine lashes, so even when I wear mascara, I don&#x27;t have great lashes. After 1 month of use, I see my lashes longer and more lush. I have not experienced any irritation. There is not a HUGE improvement, but enough to make me happy with the results. It would be nice if the ingredients were listed somewhere.</li>
            <li> This Eyelash Growth Product made by IT is by far the nicest one I ever try that does not irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it twice though because I just got it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;So far this is nice I like.&lt;br /&gt;I will give thorough review  after couple of weeks to see the result.</li>
            <li> I got this product free as a reviewer. This product is great! It makes my lashes fuller and longer. It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day. I would recommend this to my best friend. Thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am posting a review five days in to keep track of progress but also intend to do edit and update this review at the end of 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/02/2015 5 day update:&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this lash serum every morning when I wake up, before I do my makeup and every night before I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and applies like a liquid eyeliner. Read the instructions! At first it took some getting the hang of it; if you apply too much it will run into your eyes and burn. The instructions say to moisten the lash line, but do not saturate. As long as it looks wet, it&#x27;s enough.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my bottom and top lashlines and sparse areas of my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant amount of growth yet, I have definitely noticed how much more healthy and nourished my eyelashes and eyebrows look.&lt;br /&gt;They feel strong , and not flimsy and have a thicker appearance as well. Mascara looks better and more fluffy because of how healthy my eyelashes look. They have grown very slightly, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased IT Lash Care Growth Serum for my teenage daughter. She has a hard time growing long full lashes so we decided to try this eyelash growth product to see if it would help. She has been using the product for a week now and I can see noticeable results. Her lashes are growing and are thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the eyelash serum on the base of her eyelashes twice daily: morning and night after she has cleansed her face. With short eyelashes I was concerned that the serum would get into her eyes and cause irritation. However, that was not the case at all. The applicator glides swiftly across the eyelid at the base of the eyelash and dries quickly. She closes her eyes while I apply the serum. Then, she keeps them closed for about 3 seconds after application to allow them to dry. She has not had any irritation or negative effects from IT Lash Care. So far our experience has been positive. I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks, as the product claims 30 days will reveal the full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I want to say first off that I have always been very skeptical over eyelash growth products. My eyelashes are long anyways and I haven&#x27;t had any reason to use an eyelash serum but I did once quite a while back and never saw any change. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much and kind of turned me off of buying them. So I went into this with a very open mind not sure it would work at all or if I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial reaction to opening the box was that it would be like my mascara. Maybe work a tiny bit but mainly it would just darken my lashes and make them appear fuller. But I have to admit that this serum more than met my expectations. The box says that it improves the look of lashes and brows within 30 days of use. But after 5 days I was noticing some changes. It did make my lashes longer and I felt that they were fuller. But I couldn&#x27;t be certain til..guess what? They were brushing my eyeglasses!! I have never had them touch my lenses but I had to stop after a week because my lashes kept sweeping my lenses. Not very nice at all but did prove to me that it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no color change at all which I was thankful for. Not that I don&#x27;t mind a bit of a change every now and then but didn&#x27;t want this to change it. The serum is pretty strong so you do not want to get it in your eyes, believe me, it burns! I think any product you get in your eyes will burn to some degree, obviously, but this one stayed around a bit longer so I would caution you to wipe off excess serum before applying to your lashes. Also, you will apply this twice a day to the base of your lashes. But I ended up using it once a day. I found that twice a day was too much for me. I also liked that I could apply my mascara once this had dried. Definitely give it time to dry but then feel free to apply your regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really liked this and I think that for the price it is a good buy. Worked good for me and gave me long lashes to die for:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure* I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

            <li> This Eyelash Growth Product is working for my daughter.  She is a fanatic when it comes to her make-ups and her eyelashes.  She says serum is making her eyelashes grow faster than ever before.  Eye growth serum makes her lashes longer, shinier, fuller, healthier, and more fluffy looking.  She has no more missed places where some of her lashes were missing.  New lashes have come in and taken up the empty places.  She no longer has to use as much mascara using this serum.  She did recommend that with this, do not overdue it and use too much or it would get into the eye.  It takes very little and still will work with very little.  Her eyelashes look beautiful all day long now.  I recommend this to anyone that wants longer looking lashes and for those that have spots without lashes.  I also recommend this for the eyebrows.  My daughter has been using this on her eyebrows as well and it is working on making those look more fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price.  Regardless, all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Wow this is Amazing!. It made my lashes grow and look more healthy. I love it. I put it on everyday. And i noticed my mascara goes on more clean and vibrant and makes my eyes pop thanks to this! thank you. I definately recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look the same, this did nothing that it advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is not effective at all - it is almost two months and there are no results of any growth</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not very thick, so I had artificial individual lashes applied to add volume and length.  The artificial lashes only lasted about two weeks and then I had to do it again. It got expensive!!  Thank God I found this product!!  I quit using the fake lashes and started using lash care growth and the result was unbelievable!!  I finally had the full thick lashes I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long. It&#x27;s so easy to use and so much more affordable!!</li>
            <li> This is another amazing lash product! I love it and you get alot for your money!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I had thin lashes and tried usingfalse lashes but I was allergic to the glue. I found this product and decided to try it because it&#x27;s price was much more reasonable than some of the similar products on the market. It says it takes 30 days but withing two weeks my natural lashes were longer and healthier. I truely love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and in the star she was like , &amp;#34;what are you insinuating to me?&amp;#34; I thought she like it , but she started to used and she love it , i have to say she look great ,very sexy and elegant, my girlfriend recommend this product 100% she is very happy</li>
            <li> It says that it takes 30 days but within two weeks my girlfriend natural lashes were longer and healthier. She is truely in love of this product! Certainly, this product it won´t let you down. I recommended without thinking about it!</li>
            <li> I love this product , I no longer use false eyelashes or masks so that my eyes look more striking . with the use of this product I do not need to acquire others. I am pleased to have bought it , I recommend it 100 % effective</li>
            <li> This Eyelash Growth is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;This has made my lashes fuller and longer and also helped fill in some thinner spots on my brows. It does take a while to see the results but you won&#x27;t be disappointed and worth the wait.The tube lasts a long time, even using it on my eyelashes and brows. I have had no reactions at all. I will be hanging on to this product for a long time and very happy. I would highly recommend this Eyelash Growth.This was based with my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I hated my eyelashes as they were very short and very little volume had to use false eyelashes every day, which made me spend much money. Since I started using this product the positive changes are very noticeable, I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Fake eyelashes are very problematic to use every day, that’s why the naturally growth of lashes it’s very helpful, it turns the look into penetrating eyes and it’s so fancy. The effects take a while to being noticed but the wait worth it.&lt;br /&gt;if you wanna stunned by your gaze, this product it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this product !</li>
            <li> We give this product to my sister, and now I see that you can have better tabs without inflammation of the skin or eyes and she told me she saw he had a good eyelash growth, contributing to a better makeup and better Indeed, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Nothing is sexier than big and full eyelashes, THIS is the product for that. As a fan of make up i tried a lot of products alike, but this one makes the difference, i started seeing the results in one month and i&#x27;ll keep using this because it works!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl because she doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account yet. I don&#x27;t know much about beauty supplies (what guy does?), but I definitely noticed which feels like she had a giant makeover done altogether. She was pretty before, now the longer lashes just adds to her beauty. Guess I&#x27;m no longer anti-makeup; only if it adds to her, and not make her look like a clown. Great product all around.</li>
            <li> I obviously made a big mistake as I ordered this product already without realizing the all 5 star reviews are fake.i have been using it for 3 weeks and zero difference. it is burning my eyes. Dont buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING !! I&#x27;ve been using it for four days now and after the first 24hrs my lashes grew(;*~} . It does burn the eye slightly if you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess serum. But besides that I love it and I will be doing a review on YouTube on this product . Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. When I accidentally cut my eye lashes while trying to trim my eyebrows with and electric eyebrow shaver, I thought I was gonna die. Then my friend suggested I use this product. After much debate, I tried it. I followed the directions and within 30 days, maybe less, my eye lashes were back to normal. Thank you so much for the invention if this product. It saved my lashes and my self esteem.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and spend at the salon if you want but I highly recommend you buy these IT Lash card as I did. Why? The product really work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since Jan. 28, 2015.  It is now Feb. 25, 2015 and I have no change in my lashes.  They are not longer and not darker. I am really disappointed, since a lot of people seem to like the product. I know how to use it - used to work for a cosmetic surgeon. But I notice NO difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Havent seen any growth yet  I dont know if yuou should apply twice a day . Just had cateract surgy on both eyes so had to quit using it  thanks for the quick service. LaRee</li>
