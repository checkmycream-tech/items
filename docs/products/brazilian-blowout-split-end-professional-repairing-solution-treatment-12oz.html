            <li>I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I get the Blowout on my hair about three times per year and using this product helps my hair to stay healthy,</li>
            <li>Can I apply to my whole head for fly aways?  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after using it</li>
            <li>but I was hoping my ends would look better.</li>
            <li>It was literally magic.</li>
            <li>You can easily find the user manual online :)</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I found this product in Amazon , I thought it was exclusive for stylists, I am happy with results</li>
            <li>Nice help my hair look pretty</li>
            <li>My baby fine hair falls about three inches below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Great product - it makes a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product, it won&#x27;t seal and leave your ends feeling silky smooth, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>let the price stop you from purchasing this great treatment; you will only be cheating yourself!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for your ends.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every 2-3 days with sodium chloride free shampoo and a conditioner .I</li>
            <li>My hair looks smooth at the ends.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and it appears to have performed exactly as the original product applied by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>with all the good I heard about the product and the pricey cost I expected more.</li>
            <li>Really repairs the damage and makes it look healthy and smooth</li>
            <li>Still, not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I had this treatment done professionally at a salon about 4 weeks ago and my hair was fabulous!</li>
            <li>It conditioned and repaired my split ends making my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Worth price,</li>
            <li>After she put it on, blew dry and straightened it, my hair was good as new!!!</li>
            <li>My stylist told me it wasn&#x27;t meant for my fine, not thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have damaged hair and this works great as long as you use a generous amount, better than any other temporary product sold in Salons or drugstores for keeping your hair flexible until you get away from continuous damage.  </li>
            <li>Makes my split ends look like they&#x27;ve been given a new life!!!  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>The product does not come with directions, so make sure you print out the &amp;#34;Product Description&amp;#34; found on Amazon&#x27;s  item information page, just above &amp;#34;Product Details&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Tried so many products and none of them have worked for my split ends and frizz except for this product...and it lasts for an entire month.  </li>
            <li>I have such damage hair that I&#x27;m not even sure.</li>
            <li>I had it done the first time at the salon</li>
            <li>I saw more split ends than ever and did not exceed any flat iron heat...</li>
            <li>It really does smooth out frizzies and split ends without giving your hair that weighed down, greasy feeling that most &amp;#34;split end repair&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners do.</li>
            <li>I usually have good hair</li>
            <li>my hair is back to normal and nice and soft, and didn&#x27;t have to cut it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivary</li>
            <li>The initial results were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t straight,  </li>
            <li>It really helped my hair with body and reducing my straight frizzies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li>I used it twice so far and am waiting to see if I see better results in the future</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this product until it said that you cannot use it if you are nursing or pregnant on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Ok, too much trouble, have  to have someone help you.</li>
            <li>My hair was a mest this product gave it live again, My salon specialist recomend it , and it met my expectation</li>
            <li>Can I get a new pump?</li>
            <li>Yes same exact thing -</li>
            <li>Soft, shinny, smooth, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was less</li>
            <li>Shampoo, lightly condition, blow dry then flat iron!  </li>
            <li>but it is soft.</li>
            <li>Brazilian BLowout Acai Professional 10 min Split end repairing solution transformed my split ends and made my hair healthier.  </li>
            <li>get my hair  trimmed professionally every couple months.</li>
            <li>Do I only use it on the very ends?</li>
            <li>and I really missed my blonde hair</li>
            <li>what a complete scam...never again</li>
            <li>Burnt hair can only be cut off to feel new and soft again but this product did wonders without having to cut all my hair off.</li>
            <li>Applying too much protein to your hair will actually dry and cause your hair to break.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and felt my dry ends improved a little bit but seriously not as much as I would have liked for the price.</li>
            <li>The bottle got here, but with the top pump broken.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being nice give this 1 stars, if anything it&#x27;s made my hair worse!</li>
            <li>I have really long, thick, and healthy Asian hair.</li>

            <li> I have really long, thick, and healthy Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Need to do 3-4 passes with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Once I saw the split end repairing solution on Amazon, honestly, I was very skeptical about the authenticity of the product, but I bought it after contacting the reseller.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to use on your own.</li>
            <li> i did not see any good result :(</li>
            <li> The ends feel just as dry as they did prior to using this, but they aren&#x27;t breaking off or splitting like they</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair daily, creating split ends.</li>
            <li> For my first treatment, I used a little less than 1/2 ounce.  </li>
            <li> That last thing I need to loose my hair.</li>
            <li> , I dyed my hair from dark to light and they damaged my hair so bad that when I passed my finger thru my hair it felt like brittles, after the first application I saw the difference and, now I have done it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m trying to grow it out long</li>
            <li> But my ends still get dry</li>
            <li> Shake well before using and half an ounce if product us enough.</li>
            <li> No direction on how often to use or to use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It felt like a bunch of dry split ends that was rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> I searched the Manufacturer&#x27;s website for this product and unfortunately, you can only purchase this product as well as their other treatment based products directly from Brazilian Blowout if you are a licensed hair professional.  </li>
            <li> I applied the split end repair on the lower portion of my hair, blew my hair completely dry with a round brush, then used a flat iron to seal the product per the directions.</li>
            <li> but if you savvy and careful you can do it with A friend.</li>
            <li> The hair is hard to blow dry, do one lil peice at a time, treat, dry flat iron itty bitty sections from nape up. .</li>
            <li> i hope to try other brazilian products.</li>

            <li> Fast delivary but i order for one itam then it shows dicline then i order another now i have three i hope its work good .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Make sure you know how to use it correctly though. It really does smooth out frizzies and split ends without giving your hair that weighed down, greasy feeling that most &amp;#34;split end repair&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners do.</li>
            <li> The initial results were fantastic.  After two washings, my split ends are no longer &amp;#34;repaired&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Ok, too much trouble, have  to have someone help you.</li>
            <li> I have curl hair my hair now it isn&#x27;t straight,  but it is soft.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had this applied as a treatment in a salon and loved how my hair felt and looked for weeks. I did it myself as I&#x27;m in the industry and felt my application turned out just as well. Great product for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Love the texture, the smell...everything!!</li>
            <li> Could u explain to me how can i use it because it does not have any instruction. Please i hope u have the answer</li>
            <li> I had this treatment done professionally at a salon about 4 weeks ago and my hair was fabulous! It felt silky, looked healthy and shiny for about 4 weeks, just as suggested by the manufacturer.  I searched the Manufacturer&#x27;s website for this product and unfortunately, you can only purchase this product as well as their other treatment based products directly from Brazilian Blowout if you are a licensed hair professional.  However, you CAN purchase their shampoos, conditioners and styling products without a license. Once I saw the split end repairing solution on Amazon, honestly, I was very skeptical about the authenticity of the product, but I bought it after contacting the reseller.  I used it for the first time today.  It was very easy to apply and it appears to have performed exactly as the original product applied by my stylist.  At $40 per treatment from my salon, this product will have paid for itself after 2 applications.  I will definitely purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Great product - it makes a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a great product and it was delivered on time. I love Brazilian blow out products because it leave the hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product excellent dhippingvtomr</li>
            <li> Nice to have - my hair dresser used this and charged me $30 for the treatment. I bought the entire bottle for like $70. Yes same exact thing - I took a picture of my hair dressers before I bought this</li>
            <li> Nice help my hair look pretty</li>
            <li> It is quite simple to apply by yourself.  It conditioned and repaired my split ends making my hair soft and healthy looking.  I highly recommend.  Went on line for detail on how to apply.  I applied over all the hair not just ends.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Hair looks smooth and healthy again!</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair and this works great as long as you use a generous amount, better than any other temporary product sold in Salons or drugstores for keeping your hair flexible until you get away from continuous damage.  This will save your hair from breaking off once its been damaged and helps you avoid removing the length when you have a problem</li>
            <li> Soft, shinny, smooth, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating it i hope to try other brazilian products.</li>
            <li> This product did seal my split ends. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, it won&#x27;t seal and leave your ends feeling silky smooth, but it does the job. I haven&#x27;t used this regularly yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful it will help prevent my hear from breaking so I can grow it out longer/faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have washed my hair, styled it, and more since and it&#x27;s still holding up. The ends feel just as dry as they did prior to using this, but they aren&#x27;t breaking off or splitting like they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY fine hair. Found the instructions online to apply. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hate this. Made my hair feel awful.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever......</li>
            <li> Have a friend help you and use the heat setting conservatively. It is meant for professionals but if you savvy and careful you can do it with A friend. The hair is hard to blow dry, do one lil peice at a time, treat, dry flat iron itty bitty sections from nape up. . Use low heat than styling. Be prepared to deep condition after treatment. The protien makes the hair  a lil stiff and dry, but shiny and resilient. Great product just takes attention, time and finesse! I used the Brazilian Blowout masque after and keeps my blowouts longer with less breakage and shorter trims! Awesome :)</li>
            <li> this product is awesome</li>
            <li> In three words only,  try it once. I won&#x27;t say anything, you have to see for yourself. Excellent for frizzy and porous hair.</li>
            <li> I did it myself and the next day my all my coworkers asked me what I had done to my hair cause it looked amazing!! Its the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li> love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair dresser was using it on my hair for keratin treatments every three months and my hair was looking amazing. I decided I could buy it online, apply it myself since the application process is very simple, (and save money) however it doesn&#x27;t look the same. I don&#x27;t know if its me or this product but it doesn&#x27;t give me a dramatic difference that I&#x27;m looking for. I used it twice so far and am waiting to see if I see better results in the future</li>
            <li> It does not work for me. I followed up the step by step guidance to use and I did not get acceptable result.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mest this product gave it live again, My salon specialist recomend it , and it met my expectation, it has given  body to my hair, its shinny , it look awsoom.Love it</li>
            <li> like I said it&#x27;s just okay. with all the good I heard about the product and the pricey cost I expected more. I followed the directions and felt my dry ends improved a little bit but seriously not as much as I would have liked for the price. i recommend you try it if you have money to burn.</li>
            <li> This is a salon level &amp;#34;point of sale&amp;#34; product/treatment that your stylist would give you at the salon for a price.  My friend&#x27;s stylist charged $25.  Now I have this treatment as a staple in my &amp;#34;hair care arsenal&amp;#34; and can easily give myself the treatment at home!  Think of the savings!  At $25, in the salon, you would only be able to get 2.5 treatments for the same price as this entire bottle, which should provide enough product for approximately 30 treatments!  The description states that typically only 1/4th ounce is needed for a treatment.  My baby fine hair falls about three inches below my shoulders.  For my first treatment, I used a little less than 1/2 ounce.  So easy!  Shampoo, lightly condition, blow dry then flat iron!  The very same steps you would probably use anyway!&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT!!!!....The product does not come with directions, so make sure you print out the &amp;#34;Product Description&amp;#34; found on Amazon&#x27;s  item information page, just above &amp;#34;Product Details&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price stop you from purchasing this great treatment; you will only be cheating yourself!</li>
            <li> I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. You can easily find the user manual online :)</li>
            <li> This product is awsome. I am very pleased. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The bottle got here, but with the top pump broken. The bottle of the Brazilian for split end. Can I get a new pump? Thanks!</li>
            <li> Brazilian BLowout Acai Professional 10 min Split end repairing solution transformed my split ends and made my hair healthier.  Brazilian Blowout Acai are the best products on the market.  I get the Blowout on my hair about three times per year and using this product helps my hair to stay healthy,</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for your ends.</li>
            <li> Tried so many products and none of them have worked for my split ends and frizz except for this product...and it lasts for an entire month.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I colour my hair every 4 weeks, Brazilian blowout every 6months. If I could I would do every 4 month but am unable to. I wash my hair every 2-3 days with sodium chloride free shampoo and a conditioner .I get my hair  trimmed professionally every couple months. But my ends still get dry and I want to grow out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is very simple to do at home.( The Brazilian blowout is more complicated to do at home). I applied the split end repair on the lower portion of my hair, blew my hair completely dry with a round brush, then used a flat iron to seal the product per the directions. Need to do 3-4 passes with the flat iron. Hoping this will help my hair. It did look and feel good .</li>
            <li> I like how it feels. I&#x27;ve only used it once. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the directions. Here&#x27;s what is bottle. Shake well before using and half an ounce if product us enough. That&#x27;s it. No direction on how often to use or to use on wet or dry hair. Do I only use it on the very ends? Can I apply to my whole head for fly aways?  My hair dresser told me not to use it too often, maybe every 3 to 4 weeks. Applying too much protein to your hair will actually dry and cause your hair to break. That last thing I need to loose my hair.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me it wasn&#x27;t meant for my fine, not thick hair.  It really helped my hair with body and reducing my straight frizzies.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product until it said that you cannot use it if you are nursing or pregnant on the back of the bottle. I wish they put that information on the description before people purchase it. I am not sure how this product works since I cannot use it so that is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> I died my hair dark dark almost black not to long ago and I really missed my blonde hair so it took forever to get back go where it is today. Therefor my hair is extremely damaged and you can just see the split ends from a mile away but I&#x27;m trying to grow it out long and this product minimized my split ends and made it feel so good. Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use on your own.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and works beautifully.  I have my hair colored and my ends looks great and healthy.  A good investment for those who want to grown their hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being nice give this 1 stars, if anything it&#x27;s made my hair worse! Did just like instructions said and saw no difference. I saw more split ends than ever and did not exceed any flat iron heat... what a complete scam...never again</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair daily, creating split ends. This has immediately transformed my hair. My hair looks smooth at the ends. Never been happier. Worth price, and I can do it myself at home.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> i did not see any good result :(</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using it but I was hoping my ends would look better. I still had to use my split-ender to tame the ends. Still, not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Makes my split ends look like they&#x27;ve been given a new life!!!  Use this about every 3-4 weeks and is soo easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, I used it in the salon and has proven to be what it says it is.  A split End Repair Treatment.  Love It!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work. I have such damage hair that I&#x27;m not even sure. I&#x27;m using it every two weeks. Thats when it seems to wear off.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick, and healthy Asian hair. However, I burnt a section of my hair because my curling iron was on and not used for an hour and I decided to use it. That part of my hair semi-broke off into little pieces and it was disgusting to touch... It felt like a bunch of dry split ends that was rough to the touch. I usually have good hair so I freaked out, went to my salon lady. This is what she used on my hair. After she put it on, blew dry and straightened it, my hair was good as new!!! It was literally magic. Burnt hair can only be cut off to feel new and soft again but this product did wonders without having to cut all my hair off. I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> Great price! I was surprised that I found this product in Amazon , I thought it was exclusive for stylists, I am happy with results</li>
            <li> Product works great, I dyed my hair from dark to light and they damaged my hair so bad that when I passed my finger thru my hair it felt like brittles, after the first application I saw the difference and, now I have done it quite few times adn now my hair is back to normal and nice and soft, and didn&#x27;t have to cut it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  Makes your hair feel great.  Really repairs the damage and makes it look healthy and smooth</li>
            <li> So easy to use &amp; works great.  I had it done the first time at the salon them found it here &amp; ordered it.  I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
