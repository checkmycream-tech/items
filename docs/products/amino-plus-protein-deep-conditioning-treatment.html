    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow I really like this conditioner, it conditions well ,it iworks very well as a deep conditioner.  It defined my curls so well that I just wanted to shake and go without a leave in but I did&#x27;nt.  This is a great protein conditioner that does not leave the hair hard.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner and am thrilled it&#x27;s on Amazon to make my process that much better.  Hair needs protein.  This is a great protein treatment that still left my 4A/4B natural hair soft and with great slip!  I use it every other shampoo with a conditioning cap as the heat.  My hair is not sensitive to protein, but I highly recommend it over other protein treatments.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impress with this product at all..I definitely saw and felt the difference with my hair, but not in a positive way... After one use of the product my hair was extremely dry and hard to the touch.. I would never recommend this product to any one. It is the worst product I ever brought since I&#x27;ve been natural..</li>
            <li> The reason why I choose this rate? Is because once I use it for the first time I can feel and see a different in my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what I like about the product ? Is that for most people right now  finance has change and it&#x27;s a little bite harder for them, so for you to want to have healthy hair but you have a small budget, you are able to buy this product with out breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I tell people about this product? Yes I already told my family members and I come from a big family and I told close friend so yea anyone that would listen I told.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells awesome too</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the protein deep conditioner.  Normally protein treatments leave the hair hard, this one does not.  As with all the Hydratherma products, a  little bit goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t need to use a lot to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Hydratherma product line.</li>
            <li> Shipping and customer service was on point! I finally used it last night and my hair feeels AWESOME!  My scalp and everything just feels great. This product is the truth, it is a must have and I&#x27;m definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Best conditioning product for natural hair ... I have coarse hair and it softens detangles and repairs ... Will order again ... Price not bad either ...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my 4a/b/c hair. It&#x27;s softened upon application and detangles as well. It left my hair soft, detangled and manageable. I give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these produts on You Tube.  I ordered them directly from the company and received them very quickly.  I was super excited to use this conditoner becasue I watched the \\&quot;Shampoo\\&quot; video on YT and she stated the tangles just fall out.  I have a daughter that is 5 and natural with 4A/B/C hair and shampooing weekend was a horriable time for us.( Notice I said WAS) She would always tell me no and run away.  (This made me sad becasue I knew it HAD to be done) The first time I used it, it did exactly like she said.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!!  My Daughter was not screaming and crying as I cleared her hair with a wide tooth comb then a smaller comb. She had a few points of saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; but definatly not like before.  I was nervous about the rinse out and what it would feel like afterwards when it was styling time.  I was nervous for nothing, her hair stayed soft and mangeable. I am completely Loyal to this product.  I have told several of my friends becasue it is the truth.  I also used this product on my relaxed hair and it was great as well.  One day I will transition to Natural and I am glad I found these products which will make the transition easier.</li>
            <li> My only problem is the cost and the Dimethicone. Besides that I love it. It should come in a 16oz for this price.</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my hair after using this conditioner. I especially like the fact that it is PH balanced. My African American hair is super dry and the PH balance really gets rid of the dryness. I don&#x27;t use it often because it is a protein conditioner and I use other procducts with protien in them daily.</li>
            <li> I used this as a protein treatment after shampooing and it&#x27;s left my hair soft, after four days. I used it in addition to my regular regimen. Usually, my hair begins to turn dry after about 2 days and since using this during my last wash and condition, I haven&#x27;t had to re-moisturize with water and product. I know that it&#x27;s made a difference in the amount of moisture my hair follicles are retaining.&lt;br /&gt;It smells awesome and has strengthened my hair, noticeably. I may try and work this into my weekly regimen!</li>
            <li> The best hair care product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The instantaneous manageability  &amp; softness of my hair which is naturally gray &amp; wirey was so rewarding that I washed my hair 2 times in a week just to feel the softness. Thank you Hydrothermals.</li>
            <li> I love this DC because it doesn&#x27;t harden my hair like other Protine DC,my hair is soft yet strong at the same time and I love that about this protine DC I would highly recommend you get it and try it  you won&#x27;t be disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> If your hair is in need of protein to help strengthen it, then this product is great! It&#x27;s not a hard protein but you have to be very careful with the amount of protein you use on your hair. You can cause protein-overload and it can cause your hair to become dry, brittle and damaged. If you purchase this product I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it more than once every 3 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> It work very well with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever need to look for another deep conditioner again! This makes my natural curly hair so easy to manage and SUPER soft. And it smells so yummy. This is my 2nd bottle. I only use this product when I don&#x27;t have weave or extensions in (like once a month) so one bottle lasts me about 8 months. Do not hesitate to get this treatment if you are considering. It is well worth the purchase.</li>
