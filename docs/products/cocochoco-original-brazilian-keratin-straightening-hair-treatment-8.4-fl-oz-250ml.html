            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the negative reviewers are using fake products or just a whole different type of Keratin treatment, but this product left my biracial ethnic hair gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Unlike with other chemical straightening, my hair still looks full and thick using this product.</li>
            <li> it left my hair very soft and takes less than half the time to straighten with flat iron.</li>

            <li> I went to North Carolina last week and it rained almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> Be careful before you buy this product for the $$$ it costs.  </li>
            <li> And if it got wet, or if it was humid, all my flat-ironing work would be undone.</li>
            <li> The fumes weren&#x27;t as bad as other treatments, but i&#x27;m wondering if thats because the formula isn&#x27;t as potent.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have said the same thing about\\&quot;Product\\&quot; missing.  </li>
            <li> It takes less time to wash and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I would say it helped a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done quite a few at home treatments and this did not leave my hair feeling silky at all.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to go back to the frizzy mess</li>
            <li> This is an average but much less expensive type.</li>
            <li> was hoping this would stay for at least 3 m, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Every day was a bad hair day for me.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> , my eyes and throat were irritated during the treatment, but aren&#x27;t they also when I bleach my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after about a month, my hair was again frizzy, damaged, terrible.</li>

            <li> This make my Natural afro curly hair really straight ,soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;[Tips : Blow Dry your hair perfectly before you flat iron or you don&#x27;t feel your hair that much perfect (it happen to me the second week i wash my hair)]</li>
            <li> Wow I used this product on my client and wow was I and she amazed. There is just so much good fact about COCOCHOCO.AMAZING</li>
            <li> This did not work on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the one giving the buyer beware reviews, but this product is great!  I&#x27;m not sure if the negative reviewers are using fake products or just a whole different type of Keratin treatment, but this product left my biracial ethnic hair gorgeous.  It takes less time to wash and blow dry.  If you have African American hair that is coarse and very curly you are not going to be able to just wash and go, but it is going to be a lot easier to do.  I&#x27;ve saved so much money.  I no longer have to go to the salon to get my hair done every week.  Also, I&#x27;m not afraid of humidity.  I went to North Carolina last week and it rained almost everyday.  I had no frizz the entire time and actually got compliments on my hair.  Also, the company recommends that you use their shampoo and conditioner, no need.  Just buy and only use sulfate-free products.  I&#x27;ve had the cocochoco in my hair for 3 months now and I really don&#x27;t feel like I need to get it anytime soon.  Yet, it is summer and I&#x27;m afraid to go back to the frizzy mess my hair was last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Shorter time to do my hair,  No Frizz in humid weather, can be used on color treated and permed hair, and cheaper than most Keratin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Takes a long time to apply and most hair salons don&#x27;t carry it, making it hard to find someone that knows how to apply it.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. Not worst the money at all. It makes your skin and throat itch and the hair stays curly and dry. Sorry but I need to be honest and say the truth. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the product is easy and the result is fantastic</li>
            <li> My friends and me have been using this product for about a year. It works great and each treatment lasts for about 3 months. I highly recommend it to anyone. We usually get 5 treatments from the bottle, so it is excellent value. We absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is easy almost straight all by itself. I wanted this product to make my hair healthier. Did not do that or anything! The minimum efect it had on my hair didn&#x27;t even last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it left my hair very soft and takes less than half the time to straighten with flat iron.I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> it was my fist time doing keratin treatment and at the begging  i was happy with my result ,but after one mounts I got my curly hairs back .I was hoping this would stay for at least 3 m, but it didn&#x27;t ( I think its not an original product  .</li>
            <li> Be careful before you buy this product for the $$$ it costs.  This product is from Israel not Brazil.   6oz came in the 8.4 oz bottle. Other reviews have said the same thing about\\&quot;Product\\&quot; missing.  It is not anything like keratin treatments that I have used before - A definite NO! NO! No!</li>
            <li> Work very well on my hair, like very much the result</li>
            <li> I had my treatment with this product a month ago and I really love the result.  My first keratin treatment was with Coppola but didn&#x27;t last very long. I did this cocochoco treatment at home  and  love the outcome. The only down side is even though does say doesn&#x27;t has formadayle, has other ingredient I think is vanilla, that has a strong smell. But the product does what it says. Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice i like it sow mush.</li>
            <li> Literally. Before I bought it, I&#x27;d struggle every morning with my frizzy, unmanageable hair. I had to flat-iron every day in order for my hair to not be a giant mess. And if it got wet, or if it was humid, all my flat-ironing work would be undone. However after I started using this product, I maybe have to flat-iron my hair once a week, and only in a couple of places. I can wash my hair, let it dry naturally, and it remains un-frizzy and straight, with only a slight, gentle wave that I like. Unlike with other chemical straightening, my hair still looks full and thick using this product. I am not even exaggerating when I say I FINALLY have the hair I have always wanted. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I switched from using qod max to this brand and it didn&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;ve done quite a few at home treatments and this did not leave my hair feeling silky at all.  I would say it helped a little. The fumes weren&#x27;t as bad as other treatments, but i&#x27;m wondering if thats because the formula isn&#x27;t as potent.</li>
            <li> Best keratin product yet!!! Treatment lasted about 2 months.  But hair grew about 2.5 inches and noticeable thickness.  Great protein treatment.</li>
            <li> This is a great  product. The odor is a little strong for me. I wear goggles because it irritates my eyes. It  straightens your hair and leaves it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Whole my life I have struggled with my curly, frizzy but fine hair. Every day was a bad hair day for me. Then I discovered brazilian keratin tretament; I will not name the brand, it was good but soon changed its formulation and became totally uneffective. A waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered CocoChoco, I was amazed by the great customer service they have - Shay, thank you :)!. and very suprised when my treatment came in only 3 days. It is wonderful! My hair is silky, healthy, shiny... and I must say that it was totally damaged because of continuous highlights prior the CocoChoco treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my eyes and throat were irritated during the treatment, but aren&#x27;t they also when I bleach my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after about a month, my hair was again frizzy, damaged, terrible. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of keratin treatments. This is an average but much less expensive type. It will straighten softer textured hair. I would not recommend for course hair. Still better than a relaxer though.</li>
            <li> wonderful product !!!</li>
            <li> different from what i expected</li>
