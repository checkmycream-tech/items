            <li>I love the smell, and women walk by and say who smells so good</li>
            <li>but yep I liked it sp when I saw the price</li>
            <li>I liked a lot</li>
            <li>so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>I am guessing i was sold a knock off of a knock off, Lol because original knock offs&#x27; aint suppose to be this fleeting.</li>
            <li>This fragrancy smells so good that could to compare it with The Original fragrancy from Jean Paul Gaultier, so if you can buy it, do it!</li>
            <li>excellent perfume been wanting this for a while just the price on this is always so high</li>
            <li>it smells very good and the best way I can describe this fragrance is smooth and addictive.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Good bargain for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is every bit as good as the original for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I love it, girls love it on me.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but it goes away really fast.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I will probley buy a couple more and stock up.</li>
            <li>Better cologne than most axe sprays and lasts longer too.</li>
            <li>buy this cologne to resell on my house, and people keep asking me for more...</li>
            <li>Excellent overall experience.</li>
            <li>Cologne arrived on time, and i love the smell.</li>
            <li>im satisfied</li>
            <li>I bought it because it said 100% authentic and stuff, but</li>
            <li>love the spray bottle and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Satisfied Customer here.</li>
            <li>never smelled the real thing but heard it was great</li>
            <li>used them many times and gave some as gifts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts for more than an hour on me.</li>
            <li>Also, I have more than one review on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i have 2 use another top.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and at the price I got it at, ot was practically a steal</li>
            <li>SELLER needs to choose a better shipping style as they chose to use U.S.P.S  (United States Postal Service) and chose to ship the protect can in A USPS Bubble Wrap ENVELOPE which must have been damaged in packing or shipping , the damage that the Eau De Toilette SPRAYER HAS IS THAT IT arrived in a dented can, and has what appears to be pliar/tool scratches/ marks on the SPRAY NOZZLE ON TOP.</li>
            <li>but I was only mildly impressed.</li>
            <li>I own everything from Aqua di Gio to some cheap BOD spray</li>
            <li>Better and stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li>i love jean pual gultier but the one i received</li>
            <li>and I still get compliments of how well I smell. :)</li>
            <li>ok ok</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>ok but dented tin perfume.</li>
            <li>and I have received so many &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li>To be honest, this cologne does not smell good at all compared to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Its better  than original!  </li>
            <li>classic, all-time great</li>
            <li>it must work pretty well so in conclusion good buy.</li>
            <li>Not like original !</li>
            <li>Love it... perfect as expected.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose and this spray is very nice smelling.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the product is incredibly close the Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier.</li>
            <li>it was just an easy decision to buy it</li>
            <li>everything else I ordered is fine.</li>
            <li>but at the beginning you can smell strong alcohol, which evaporates later but good product for the price :)</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE IS NOT THE CORRECT FIT..</li>
            <li>You can tell from the difference in the canisters it arrived in, the bottle itself, and the cologne that everything about it is cheaply made, hence the price.  </li>
            <li>Your just getting a cheap smell.</li>
            <li>so people will know his as cheap as this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was very suprised at how nice this product smelled, almost identical to its competitor and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap</li>
            <li>My wife and my 13 y/o say that the Christian Audigier smells the best and that the Cuba Gold smells better than the Blue, they said the Mambo was ok but</li>
            <li>I would recommend NOT buying this product especially if you&#x27;re looking for great Value for Money.</li>
            <li>I have a genuine bottle</li>
            <li>but it was cheap</li>
            <li>I would recommmend to people who in these economic times who are looking for deals should definitely buy a bottle of this, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>it has a very clean and fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>THE CAN IS DIFFERNET FROM ORIGINAL..</li>
            <li>If I put the original on in the morning, I can still smell it on myself at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance so much that i wear it myself, sometimes!</li>
            <li>like the original to me which i had for years, but saw this and gave it a try considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess, it never said anything about what is the original brand.</li>
            <li>Smells close to the original but the strength wears off faster but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Hangs with me as the original will buy again no question.</li>
            <li>wasnt even close to yhe original</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference at all from the original</li>
            <li>Dear is originally this</li>
            <li>almost as good as the original but the only thing is when you spray it on you..</li>
            <li>I get it out of the can and am happy to see it resembles the last bottle I purchased exactly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all the people looking at this product wants \\&quot;Le</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin you might be able to get longer.    </li>
            <li>This is an OK COPY but NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li>If you like Le Male this is a good inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like it smells way to sweet</li>
            <li>I love it so much it smell soooooooo</li>
            <li>Smell good but does not last</li>
            <li>Case was bent in shipping but overall good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, because we both love the name brand Eau De Toilette but who wants to spend $80 on a cologne.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to tell the difference</li>
            <li>For a knock off it not bad.  </li>
            <li>really cheap smeells awfull too sweet, gets you dissy right away, dont buy this cologne save your money or buy something else</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s not true JPG but smells great and lasted a bit.</li>
            <li>Aroma is not bad but the effects wears off just too quickly for it to make any sense.</li>
            <li>but thats if i&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li>I would stay under my bed for a whole fornight!!</li>
            <li>Smells just like the real cologne!!</li>
            <li>opening, it looks almost exactly like the original.</li>
            <li>It isnt a matter of cheap alcohol, but how much is used.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth</li>
            <li>Product fragrance was mostly alcohol within a year, suspect it was old stock.</li>
            <li>worth the price though</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different from John Paul Gaultier but still nice.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, this perfume is for my personal use &amp; is cheaper than the other brand.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>After that I forget I have it on unless I put my nose right up to it.  </li>
            <li>The first item received had a problem with the spray - didn&#x27;t work - right out of the box.</li>
            <li>You use about double what you would use of the name brand, but it coasts about 25% so its a big win.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that the can container was slightly dented but other than that the Cologne is absolutely awesome and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast .</li>
            <li>this is not the first time I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have sold mens fragrances for many years at a department store and have never heard of a fragrance called Blue.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALLL</li>
            <li>Blue smells exactly like an impression of 212 sexy for men.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s better then enough.</li>
            <li>Go buy a teddy bear instead or don&#x27;t complain for buying an obvious \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product to the one you love.</li>
            <li>smells more of alcohol then of the cologne, and the spray nozzle only sort of works.</li>
            <li>Like the smell the first time they gave me this cologne</li>
            <li>It is exactly as published.</li>
            <li>Not overbearing like most male fragrances.</li>
            <li>I should have been alerted by the ridiculously low price on this, I cannot be 100% sure, but I think it is counterfeit.</li>
            <li>so when it says original and 100% authentic in the description, it&#x27;s not really true.</li>
            <li>While I do definitely recommend this cologne, I hope not too many of you guys out there purchase it because then I won&#x27;t have as much swagger</li>
            <li>than that, it smells exactly the same albeit not quite as strong, which is alright with me.</li>
            <li>Pay the higher price and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>I so love this product, I&#x27;d been using the real one for a long time not knowing about this one, I could have save some money, but</li>
            <li>BECAUSE I HAD THE EXACT SAME ORIGINAL BOUGHT AT THE STORE.</li>
            <li>The bottle appears to be exactly the same as the original as well as the packaging, however it does say that it is not made by Jean Paul Gaultier on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Also i have to add that the smell is exactly the same as the original by jean paul gaultier, just that &amp;#34;lil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Just spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li>1 hour is really all I get out of this</li>
            <li>Very deceptive.</li>
            <li>It dissipates extremely fast.</li>
            <li>My opinion...buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>save your money and get the real thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li>but after an hour or two it fades and fades fast.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li>the real deal costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Jean Paul Gaultier for recognizing that not everyone can afford a brand name, but everyone deserves a brand name</li>
            <li>uses up much perfume.old stock.</li>
            <li>Buy the Nautica Voyage which is available at the same price.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor go to wal mart and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li>thanks for the assistance..</li>
            <li>not the real thing</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two except the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is an obvious cheap knock off</li>
            <li>smell really good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>but I can only give it 4 stars because the top on mine was broken and doesnt spray that good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough for a man but sweet and gentle enough for a woman.</li>
            <li>Smells similar to the original except this one stimulates my gag reflex.</li>
            <li>They both smell generic without a unique smell.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this and knew it wasn&#x27;t the original Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male that everyone likes, but I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li>does not smell the same as original.  </li>
            <li>Same as the original.</li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t last a full 8 hour workday.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t risk ordering this product again but will instead pay full retail for a product that I can actually see what I am purchasing.</li>
            <li>though worth it in my book for less than 1/3 the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>So yes its watered down, but it really doesn&#x27;t take much effort to spray more on; and so far I feel like it lasts.</li>
            <li>This is a replica of the famous &amp;#34;la male&amp;#34;  the bottle here looks the same but its not the same perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>the scent doesnt stay as long as the original...</li>
            <li>Overall I expected more from this from all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Thanks for the being so professional.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, it smells exactly like the real thing, and even comes in the same bottle.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;ve spent $60+ in the store for the original and this appeared to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>AND JUST WANTED A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>The bottle is neat and unique, but I think they could due a little fine tuning to make this cologne really work.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last at all, aroma is off in a matter of few minutues, i carry mine around in my car just to have it handy</li>
            <li>First of all, that&#x27;s a product for 15 dollars, that means you are paying almost the same money for an aftershave cologne.</li>
            <li>I must say that this cologne smells exactly like Le Male</li>
            <li>Smells exactly the same as Jean Paul Gaultier.</li>
            <li>I went to pull the can open and cologne wasn&#x27;t secured in place of the plastic securing device and the first bottle fell onto the floor and broke.</li>
            <li>It seems to be almost the same exact product.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is an imitation and offered the original.</li>
            <li>The last order only cost $15.00 for a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>It does not last as long as the original product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll walk around wreaking of vanilla beans and other extremely soft and sweet odors...if it gets me laid.</li>
            <li>It smells the same and is completely alike all the way down to the little clip to prevent accidental sprays (by the way it sprays better than any other cologne I own).</li>
            <li>The one difference between this and the original is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It clearly said Blue.\\&quot; Yes it did</li>
            <li>but the picture clearly was John Paul.</li>
            <li>Whenever I spray this on I am constantly smelling my wrist and if you havent worn it for a couple days you really start to miss it.      </li>
            <li>This product is the same in every way as the real one, except for the labels.</li>
            <li>Far be it to save some money in hopes of finding something even close to a replacement.</li>
            <li>so I have to replace it with my old cologne...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to use it daily without expecting much.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too far off.</li>
            <li>you are cost conscious and like Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances, you will like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles so far.</li>
            <li>With real Jean Paul fragrance I could spray once or twice and that smell works last all day...</li>
            <li>A complete fraud</li>
            <li>So, after being highly confused by the two different sizes - 4.2 in the title, 1.5 in the description - and not getting an answer from the seller, I decided just to buy it because it was a good</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in the original Jean Paul, this is not it, it&#x27;s a generic product, and regarding quality, i am not sure how close is the smell, since i&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the original Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier and get the quality expected.</li>
            <li>Even if I have to save to purchase the original, I don&#x27;t need to waste money on this product.</li>
            <li>This BLUE cologne smells EXACTLY like the Jean Paul Le Male it imitates.  </li>
            <li>It is a cheap watered down version of Le Male.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male.</li>
            <li>last but not least....</li>
            <li>i agree with the reviews that say it smells like the real stuff but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Product came in broken &amp; all scratched up, the top piece even broke as well.</li>
            <li>I REALLY WANTED TO SMELL GOOD FOR MY DATE THAT PASSED &#x3D;(</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone whos gonna be VERY close to someone like maybe cuddling with your girlfriend, but other than that no one will know you have it on.</li>
            <li>I suggest buy the real one or but other cologne</li>
            <li>My husband says it doesn&#x27;t last very long but still seems to be a decent buy in comparison.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually complain about other reviewers, as each person has their own experiences, but the comments that say this doesn&#x27;t last or that it stinks  and doesn&#x27;t resemble Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances seem quite bogus to me, perhaps from other cologne sellers that don&#x27;t want you to find out that you can get a product that is quite good for just a portion of the big bucks</li>
            <li>He said it must not be the real thing because it seemed watered down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a real gem and has come down in&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li>Loses the smell quickly.</li>
            <li>After first spraying this, I personally thought it smelled a bit feminine for a cologne, but after a few minutes...i started to understand where she was coming from.</li>
            <li>The cap was broken but easy fix.</li>
            <li>THE CAN IS A SLIGHT DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE REAL DEAL,...</li>

            <li> I love the smell, and women walk by and say who smells so good</li>
            <li> but yep I liked it sp when I saw the price</li>
            <li> I liked a lot</li>
            <li> so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> I am guessing i was sold a knock off of a knock off, Lol because original knock offs&#x27; aint suppose to be this fleeting.</li>
            <li> This fragrancy smells so good that could to compare it with The Original fragrancy from Jean Paul Gaultier, so if you can buy it, do it!</li>
            <li> excellent perfume been wanting this for a while just the price on this is always so high</li>
            <li> it smells very good and the best way I can describe this fragrance is smooth and addictive.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Good bargain for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is every bit as good as the original for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love it, girls love it on me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it goes away really fast.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I will probley buy a couple more and stock up.</li>
            <li> Better cologne than most axe sprays and lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> buy this cologne to resell on my house, and people keep asking me for more...</li>
            <li> Excellent overall experience.</li>
            <li> Cologne arrived on time, and i love the smell.</li>
            <li> im satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought it because it said 100% authentic and stuff, but</li>
            <li> love the spray bottle and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Satisfied Customer here.</li>
            <li> never smelled the real thing but heard it was great</li>
            <li> used them many times and gave some as gifts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts for more than an hour on me.</li>
            <li> Also, I have more than one review on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i have 2 use another top.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and at the price I got it at, ot was practically a steal</li>
            <li> SELLER needs to choose a better shipping style as they chose to use U.S.P.S  (United States Postal Service) and chose to ship the protect can in A USPS Bubble Wrap ENVELOPE which must have been damaged in packing or shipping , the damage that the Eau De Toilette SPRAYER HAS IS THAT IT arrived in a dented can, and has what appears to be pliar/tool scratches/ marks on the SPRAY NOZZLE ON TOP.</li>
            <li> but I was only mildly impressed.</li>
            <li> I own everything from Aqua di Gio to some cheap BOD spray</li>
            <li> Better and stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> i love jean pual gultier but the one i received</li>
            <li> and I still get compliments of how well I smell. :)</li>
            <li> ok ok</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> ok but dented tin perfume.</li>
            <li> and I have received so many &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li> To be honest, this cologne does not smell good at all compared to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Its better  than original!  </li>
            <li> classic, all-time great</li>
            <li> it must work pretty well so in conclusion good buy.</li>
            <li> Not like original !</li>
            <li> Love it... perfect as expected.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose and this spray is very nice smelling.  </li>
            <li> The scent of the product is incredibly close the Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier.</li>
            <li> it was just an easy decision to buy it</li>
            <li> everything else I ordered is fine.</li>
            <li> but at the beginning you can smell strong alcohol, which evaporates later but good product for the price :)</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE IS NOT THE CORRECT FIT..</li>
            <li> You can tell from the difference in the canisters it arrived in, the bottle itself, and the cologne that everything about it is cheaply made, hence the price.  </li>
            <li> Your just getting a cheap smell.</li>
            <li> so people will know his as cheap as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very suprised at how nice this product smelled, almost identical to its competitor and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap</li>
            <li> My wife and my 13 y/o say that the Christian Audigier smells the best and that the Cuba Gold smells better than the Blue, they said the Mambo was ok but</li>
            <li> I would recommend NOT buying this product especially if you&#x27;re looking for great Value for Money.</li>
            <li> I have a genuine bottle</li>
            <li> but it was cheap</li>
            <li> I would recommmend to people who in these economic times who are looking for deals should definitely buy a bottle of this, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> it has a very clean and fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> THE CAN IS DIFFERNET FROM ORIGINAL..</li>
            <li> If I put the original on in the morning, I can still smell it on myself at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much that i wear it myself, sometimes!</li>
            <li> like the original to me which i had for years, but saw this and gave it a try considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess, it never said anything about what is the original brand.</li>
            <li> Smells close to the original but the strength wears off faster but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Hangs with me as the original will buy again no question.</li>
            <li> wasnt even close to yhe original</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference at all from the original</li>
            <li> Dear is originally this</li>
            <li> almost as good as the original but the only thing is when you spray it on you..</li>
            <li> I get it out of the can and am happy to see it resembles the last bottle I purchased exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all the people looking at this product wants \\&quot;Le</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin you might be able to get longer.    </li>
            <li> This is an OK COPY but NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li> If you like Le Male this is a good inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it smells way to sweet</li>
            <li> I love it so much it smell soooooooo</li>
            <li> Smell good but does not last</li>
            <li> Case was bent in shipping but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, because we both love the name brand Eau De Toilette but who wants to spend $80 on a cologne.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to tell the difference</li>
            <li> For a knock off it not bad.  </li>
            <li> really cheap smeells awfull too sweet, gets you dissy right away, dont buy this cologne save your money or buy something else</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s not true JPG but smells great and lasted a bit.</li>
            <li> Aroma is not bad but the effects wears off just too quickly for it to make any sense.</li>
            <li> but thats if i&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li> I would stay under my bed for a whole fornight!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the real cologne!!</li>
            <li> opening, it looks almost exactly like the original.</li>
            <li> It isnt a matter of cheap alcohol, but how much is used.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth</li>
            <li> Product fragrance was mostly alcohol within a year, suspect it was old stock.</li>
            <li> worth the price though</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from John Paul Gaultier but still nice.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, this perfume is for my personal use &amp; is cheaper than the other brand.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> After that I forget I have it on unless I put my nose right up to it.  </li>
            <li> The first item received had a problem with the spray - didn&#x27;t work - right out of the box.</li>
            <li> You use about double what you would use of the name brand, but it coasts about 25% so its a big win.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that the can container was slightly dented but other than that the Cologne is absolutely awesome and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast .</li>
            <li> this is not the first time I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have sold mens fragrances for many years at a department store and have never heard of a fragrance called Blue.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALLL</li>
            <li> Blue smells exactly like an impression of 212 sexy for men.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s better then enough.</li>
            <li> Go buy a teddy bear instead or don&#x27;t complain for buying an obvious \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product to the one you love.</li>
            <li> smells more of alcohol then of the cologne, and the spray nozzle only sort of works.</li>
            <li> Like the smell the first time they gave me this cologne</li>
            <li> It is exactly as published.</li>
            <li> Not overbearing like most male fragrances.</li>
            <li> I should have been alerted by the ridiculously low price on this, I cannot be 100% sure, but I think it is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> so when it says original and 100% authentic in the description, it&#x27;s not really true.</li>
            <li> While I do definitely recommend this cologne, I hope not too many of you guys out there purchase it because then I won&#x27;t have as much swagger</li>
            <li> than that, it smells exactly the same albeit not quite as strong, which is alright with me.</li>
            <li> Pay the higher price and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I so love this product, I&#x27;d been using the real one for a long time not knowing about this one, I could have save some money, but</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I HAD THE EXACT SAME ORIGINAL BOUGHT AT THE STORE.</li>
            <li> The bottle appears to be exactly the same as the original as well as the packaging, however it does say that it is not made by Jean Paul Gaultier on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Also i have to add that the smell is exactly the same as the original by jean paul gaultier, just that &amp;#34;lil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> 1 hour is really all I get out of this</li>
            <li> Very deceptive.</li>
            <li> It dissipates extremely fast.</li>
            <li> My opinion...buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> save your money and get the real thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li> but after an hour or two it fades and fades fast.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li> the real deal costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Jean Paul Gaultier for recognizing that not everyone can afford a brand name, but everyone deserves a brand name</li>
            <li> uses up much perfume.old stock.</li>
            <li> Buy the Nautica Voyage which is available at the same price.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor go to wal mart and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> thanks for the assistance..</li>
            <li> not the real thing</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two except the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is an obvious cheap knock off</li>
            <li> smell really good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> but I can only give it 4 stars because the top on mine was broken and doesnt spray that good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough for a man but sweet and gentle enough for a woman.</li>
            <li> Smells similar to the original except this one stimulates my gag reflex.</li>
            <li> They both smell generic without a unique smell.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and knew it wasn&#x27;t the original Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male that everyone likes, but I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> does not smell the same as original.  </li>
            <li> Same as the original.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t last a full 8 hour workday.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t risk ordering this product again but will instead pay full retail for a product that I can actually see what I am purchasing.</li>
            <li> though worth it in my book for less than 1/3 the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So yes its watered down, but it really doesn&#x27;t take much effort to spray more on; and so far I feel like it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is a replica of the famous &amp;#34;la male&amp;#34;  the bottle here looks the same but its not the same perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> the scent doesnt stay as long as the original...</li>
            <li> Overall I expected more from this from all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> Thanks for the being so professional.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it smells exactly like the real thing, and even comes in the same bottle.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;ve spent $60+ in the store for the original and this appeared to be pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> AND JUST WANTED A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> The bottle is neat and unique, but I think they could due a little fine tuning to make this cologne really work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last at all, aroma is off in a matter of few minutues, i carry mine around in my car just to have it handy</li>
            <li> First of all, that&#x27;s a product for 15 dollars, that means you are paying almost the same money for an aftershave cologne.</li>
            <li> I must say that this cologne smells exactly like Le Male</li>
            <li> Smells exactly the same as Jean Paul Gaultier.</li>
            <li> I went to pull the can open and cologne wasn&#x27;t secured in place of the plastic securing device and the first bottle fell onto the floor and broke.</li>
            <li> It seems to be almost the same exact product.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is an imitation and offered the original.</li>
            <li> The last order only cost $15.00 for a full size bottle.</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as the original product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll walk around wreaking of vanilla beans and other extremely soft and sweet odors...if it gets me laid.</li>
            <li> It smells the same and is completely alike all the way down to the little clip to prevent accidental sprays (by the way it sprays better than any other cologne I own).</li>
            <li> The one difference between this and the original is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It clearly said Blue.\\&quot; Yes it did</li>
            <li> but the picture clearly was John Paul.</li>
            <li> Whenever I spray this on I am constantly smelling my wrist and if you havent worn it for a couple days you really start to miss it.      </li>
            <li> This product is the same in every way as the real one, except for the labels.</li>
            <li> Far be it to save some money in hopes of finding something even close to a replacement.</li>
            <li> so I have to replace it with my old cologne...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to use it daily without expecting much.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too far off.</li>
            <li> you are cost conscious and like Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances, you will like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles so far.</li>
            <li> With real Jean Paul fragrance I could spray once or twice and that smell works last all day...</li>
            <li> A complete fraud</li>
            <li> So, after being highly confused by the two different sizes - 4.2 in the title, 1.5 in the description - and not getting an answer from the seller, I decided just to buy it because it was a good</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested in the original Jean Paul, this is not it, it&#x27;s a generic product, and regarding quality, i am not sure how close is the smell, since i&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the original Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier and get the quality expected.</li>
            <li> Even if I have to save to purchase the original, I don&#x27;t need to waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> This BLUE cologne smells EXACTLY like the Jean Paul Le Male it imitates.  </li>
            <li> It is a cheap watered down version of Le Male.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male.</li>
            <li> last but not least....</li>
            <li> i agree with the reviews that say it smells like the real stuff but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Product came in broken &amp; all scratched up, the top piece even broke as well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY WANTED TO SMELL GOOD FOR MY DATE THAT PASSED &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone whos gonna be VERY close to someone like maybe cuddling with your girlfriend, but other than that no one will know you have it on.</li>
            <li> I suggest buy the real one or but other cologne</li>
            <li> My husband says it doesn&#x27;t last very long but still seems to be a decent buy in comparison.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually complain about other reviewers, as each person has their own experiences, but the comments that say this doesn&#x27;t last or that it stinks  and doesn&#x27;t resemble Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances seem quite bogus to me, perhaps from other cologne sellers that don&#x27;t want you to find out that you can get a product that is quite good for just a portion of the big bucks</li>
            <li> He said it must not be the real thing because it seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a real gem and has come down in&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li> Loses the smell quickly.</li>
            <li> After first spraying this, I personally thought it smelled a bit feminine for a cologne, but after a few minutes...i started to understand where she was coming from.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken but easy fix.</li>
            <li> THE CAN IS A SLIGHT DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE REAL DEAL,...</li>
            <li> Even after 5-6 pumps of the spray - the scent is really weak and doesn&#x27;t last for more than half an hour max.</li>
            <li> its looks like its just water in a bottle ,once you sprayed after 10 mins you cant smell anything its looks cheap but in real its very expensive for what you paid for.</li>
            <li> It smells similar, however it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is it doesnt stay with you as long as the cologne you would buy in Macy&#x27;s, Dillards, etc</li>
            <li> This does not last quite as long though</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> People say it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but this is a spray not a cologne.</li>
            <li> and you can tell, it doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> Smell does not stay, it&#x27;s total cheap fake product.</li>
            <li> Projection and longevity is where it loses all its positive comments.  </li>
            <li> very  responsible and  serious staff working</li>
            <li> Does not last long, but a fraction of the price!!!...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stay long on my skin but it has at least 5-6 hours to disappear</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Should have spent the extra cash and got what I had before.  </li>
            <li> But it does linger for a long time.</li>
            <li> There are some discount perfume distributors out there who water down colognes, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case from the two different distributors I bought Blue from on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Scent was slightly harder than my previous last undamaged third order back from another supplier.</li>
            <li> I have the smaller bottle of this same cologne, the container is very different and the scent is not the same (at least to me).</li>
            <li> It was not the original perfume, it was the fake one.</li>
            <li> Other then that, it&#x27;s totally recommended.</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s not exactly the same</li>
            <li> But seriously, don&#x27;t be a fool and expect too much from a perfume that you buy for 15 dollars.</li>
            <li> large 4.2 oz lasts at least a Year!</li>
            <li> I PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THE BLUE COLOGNE</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even last half the day.</li>
            <li> Now, when I sprayed the Blue on myself it smelled a little off.</li>
            <li> so theres really no guilt in buying it if you want to try it out.  </li>
            <li> this one does not fit it properly and makes the nozzle head pop off every time you try to take it off, and it scratches the metal going on and off.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The curious thing is that both times I opened the tin cylinder packaging, the bottle emerged without the spray (which had come off during the opening process - somehow).</li>
            <li> this product may not look or smell a little original, horrible, not recommended at all, not even worth the low price I paid for this colony</li>
            <li> which pushes down, to spray, but if I don&#x27;t get the chance to return this, I WILL BE STUCK WITH A SPRAYER that only goes down..</li>
            <li> it comes in until I was out of my other cologne that I have on hand.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> In all my years of purchasing Jean Paul fragrance , I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> and I have been getting a few different colognes to try to have a little variety.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT OTHER WEBSITE AND EBAY</li>
            <li> However, the collar clip is hardly the same.</li>
            <li> There is more water base on this item.</li>
            <li> I feel that it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY PUSH THE SPRAYER UP AFTER EACH and EVERY SPRAY DOWN</li>
            <li> It has everything the others have but for less than half the money.</li>
            <li> The smell is odd, I rather to threw the bottle into the garbage can than give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> AND COULD NOT TELL IT WAS AN IMITATION VERSION!</li>
            <li> SELLING IT FOR HALF THE PRICE</li>
            <li> It squirts,resulting in mess.</li>
            <li> I am giving this four stars because it could stay a little longer.</li>
            <li> This perfum is not original</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not genuine at all.</li>
            <li> DOESNT SMELL AT ALL AND JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.....  </li>
            <li> After a few sprays it smells like you are all set</li>
            <li> not something I should wear everyday.</li>
            <li> THEY WAN</li>
            <li> I wear this cologne almost everyday</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I read the reviews and some of them seemed pretty bad  ..</li>
            <li> Not original!</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll get the expensive one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake smells like it but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I even compared it to my friend&#x27;s Jean Paul Gaultier and he just got mad because I got the same thing for $40 less.</li>
            <li> IT SUCKS</li>
            <li> oz.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received it FOUR days late.</li>
            <li> Figured it was to late to return or get compensated...</li>
            <li> When I opened my package the pump spray on the bottle was broken; therefore I am not able to spray the cologne out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The glass was dirty, like was used, dispenser don&#x27;t come and the smell don&#x27;t have any smell, less than water...</li>
            <li> This is the worse eau de toilette ever.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> When it came my spray was broken</li>
            <li> I am not happy with that, at all.</li>
            <li> Bootleg cologne</li>
            <li> It came in a box with holes in it  and broken</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it, girls love it on me. I have bought the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; $80 bottles at Macy&#x27;s these are identical.</li>
            <li> This cologne doesn&#x27;t pump. Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> Smells similar to the original except this one stimulates my gag reflex.</li>
            <li> The product came broke. The seal was unattached and some of the fragrance was spread all over the box. Besides that the product is really good this is not the first time I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It smells similar, however it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. The bottle isn&#x27;t of the same quality with a shorter squirt stroke and leaks on your hand when you spray it. I&#x27;ll stick to the original Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier and get the quality expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelt both the origional and this. They smell about the same. This does not last quite as long though but as a great deal.</li>
            <li> It was not the original perfume, it was the fake one.</li>
            <li> I love  this perfum!  Its better  than original!  Hihi</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It&#x27;s not genuine at all. Bottle is not the same, package not the same, and the smell is not the same. Just spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all the people looking at this product wants \\&quot;Le Male\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t want to shell out $50-$70.  Well I&#x27;ve never smelled Le Male before but I can only assume they smell similar.  However, Le Male aside, this cologne just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  Now dont get me wrong it smells very good and the best way I can describe this fragrance is smooth and addictive.  Whenever I spray this on I am constantly smelling my wrist and if you havent worn it for a couple days you really start to miss it.      Projection and longevity is where it loses all its positive comments.  30min - 1 hour is really all I get out of this and i have fairly oily skin.  After that I forget I have it on unless I put my nose right up to it.  Some days it will go for about 2 hours but thats if i&#x27;m lucky.  If you have really oily skin you might be able to get longer.    Projection isn&#x27;t the best either I haven&#x27;t recieved one compliment when wearing this.  Overall I expected more from this from all the positive reviews but I probably wont be buying this again.  The good thing is it&#x27;s cheap and I bought mine from another site for $6.99 + $5 shipping so theres really no guilt in buying it if you want to try it out.  I would recommend this to anyone whos gonna be VERY close to someone like maybe cuddling with your girlfriend, but other than that no one will know you have it on.</li>
            <li> Great product and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> The picture of the fragrance that I ordered is John Paul Gaultier Le Male with the name blue. I thought that was what i was ordering but when I questiond the seller she said \\&quot;what are you talking about, you cant get John Paul for $14.99. It clearly said Blue.\\&quot; Yes it did but the picture clearly was John Paul. Very deceptive. I have sold mens fragrances for many years at a department store and have never heard of a fragrance called Blue. No telling what will show up!! I asked her to cancel my order and she got nasty!!Will never buy anything from this vendor, never. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> excellent perfume, it smell great, satisfaced</li>
            <li> I PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THE BLUE COLOGNE BECAUSE I HAD THE EXACT SAME ORIGINAL BOUGHT AT THE STORE. AND JUST WANTED A NEW ONE BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING SHORT ON IT........... SEENED THAT IT WAS 15 DOLLARS SO I DECIDED TO PURCHASE... WAS HAPPY ABOUT RECEIVING IT AND COULDNT WAIT TO PUT IT ON..... RECEIVED IN MAIL AND OPEND BOX.. FIRST OF ALLL THE CAN IS A SLIGHT DIFFERENT COLOR THAN THE REAL DEAL,... THE CAN IS DIFFERNET FROM ORIGINAL.. INSIDE OF CAN THAT HOLDS THE BOTTLE IS NOT THE CORRECT FIT.. LETTERS ON CAN ARE NOT THE SAME.... AND THE SPRAY SEEMS TO BE LIKE WATER.. DOESNT SMELL AT ALL AND JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.....  IT SUCKS CUZ I REALLY WANTED TO SMELL GOOD FOR MY DATE THAT PASSED &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This is the worse eau de toilette ever.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waist your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only it evaporates after 30 minutes it also&lt;br /&gt;Stains your clothing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for $12.00 with the $4.99 shipping for a total of only $16.99! Compared to others that are $50 this beats them all. However there is a catch to this, but it is nothing to worry about. This product is not Jean Paul Gaultier but is Blue by Blue Perfumes Jean Paul Gaultier. It is still made by the same company (the label on the bottom says so) but is just a different name. Now before you exit to look for others read on. This product is the same in every way as the real one, except for the labels. It has everything the others have but for less than half the money. It smells the same and is completely alike all the way down to the little clip to prevent accidental sprays (by the way it sprays better than any other cologne I own). I even compared it to my friend&#x27;s Jean Paul Gaultier and he just got mad because I got the same thing for $40 less. Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this cologne as I am on disability and truly can&#x27;t afford repurchasing Le Male at this time. Hopeful as I was, my hopes were dashed when I tried this knock off. It is NOTHING like Le Male. It smells different. It dissipates extremely fast. Far be it to save some money in hopes of finding something even close to a replacement. My opinion...buy the real thing. Even if I have to save to purchase the original, I don&#x27;t need to waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> When it came my spray was broken so I have to replace it with my old cologne... There is more water base on this item. I suggest buy the real one or but other cologne</li>
            <li> I bought blue under the impression it was an impression of Jean Paul Gaultier, got it and it smells NOTHING like it! Blue smells exactly like an impression of 212 sexy for men. They both smell generic without a unique smell. Waste of money... :(</li>
            <li> entrega al día mercancía en buen estado responsables los productos que uno compra son los que envían tal cual como se hace el pedido</li>
            <li> The smell is odd, I rather to threw the bottle into the garbage can than give it to a friend. It was the best place for something like this.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and knew it wasn&#x27;t the original Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male that everyone likes, but I ordered it anyway. At $12 I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The bottle appears to be exactly the same as the original as well as the packaging, however it does say that it is not made by Jean Paul Gaultier on the bottom. Either way, I&#x27;ve spent $60+ in the store for the original and this appeared to be pretty much the same. It smells the same, and as I&#x27;m writing this I can still smell it on me after 6+ hours into my day. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. The packaging was all scratched up. It was a gift for my boyfriend and he was apalled. He said it must not be the real thing because it seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> excellent perfume been wanting this for a while just the price on this is always so high and when i saw this price i had to grab it while i can and very pleased i did</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to use it daily without expecting much. First of all, that&#x27;s a product for 15 dollars, that means you are paying almost the same money for an aftershave cologne. It doesn&#x27;t really stay long on my skin but it has at least 5-6 hours to disappear and that&#x27;s better then enough. And the best, it gives me the chance to keep my original perfumes for the nights so they last longer as well. But seriously, don&#x27;t be a fool and expect too much from a perfume that you buy for 15 dollars. And indeed, that&#x27;s not a product to buy as a present, it&#x27;s written \\&quot;blue\\&quot; on the protection case and of course it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s not jean Paul. Go buy a teddy bear instead or don&#x27;t complain for buying an obvious \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product to the one you love. I am giving this four stars because it could stay a little longer. Other then that, it&#x27;s totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I so love this product, I&#x27;d been using the real one for a long time not knowing about this one, I could have save some money, but now I know what I am getting fromnow on!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews on this cologne, I thought I would give it a try as opposed to the more expensive Jean Paul Gaultier - Le Male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not even come close to Jean Paul Gaultier - Le Male.  You can tell from the difference in the canisters it arrived in, the bottle itself, and the cologne that everything about it is cheaply made, hence the price.  To be honest, this cologne does not smell good at all compared to the real thing.  This is the last time I will ever purchase the knock off version of Jean Paul Gaultier - Le Male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34; with this product.</li>
            <li> smells more of alcohol then of the cologne, and the spray nozzle only sort of works. save your money and get the real thing</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it goes away really fast. Anyways its a very low price. Also i have to add that the smell is exactly the same as the original by jean paul gaultier, just that &amp;#34;lil&amp;#34; problem of not lasting enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne exclusively for years. I always get compliments and this was the best price I&#x27;ve gotten it for!</li>
            <li> I figured I would try this item since it was so inexpensive. I have to admit, it smells exactly like the real thing, and even comes in the same bottle. The one difference between this and the original is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. If I put the original on in the morning, I can still smell it on myself at the end of the day. With this version, I can&#x27;t smell it after a couple of hours. If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, than by all means buy it. At this price, it&#x27;s still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> That is just gross... that is FOUL... if my bf or brother walked out of the house smelling like that I would stay under my bed for a whole fornight!!</li>
            <li> A French friend of mine recommend the JP Gaultier cologne, so I looked it up on Amazon. This is an OK COPY but NOT the real thing. The scent lasts about an hour and then I have too re-apply.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the real cologne!! I got is as an affordable alternative for my fiancé for Christmas and he approves, and he is a picky man</li>
            <li> Spray button defective upon opening.</li>
            <li> Loses the smell quickly. Doesn&#x27;t even last half the day.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been wearing Jean Paul Gaultier le male since 1997 I was reluctant to purchase this, but the price was too tempting to pass up so I said what the heck and bought a bottle. I must say that this cologne smells exactly like Le Male and I put some on this morning and I can still smell it tonight. It isnt a matter of cheap alcohol, but how much is used. I would recommmend to people who in these economic times who are looking for deals should definitely buy a bottle of this, it&#x27;s awesome. I will probley buy a couple more and stock up.</li>

            <li> This is a replica of the famous &amp;#34;la male&amp;#34;  the bottle here looks the same but its not the same perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Jean-Paul-Gaultier-Toilette-Spray/dp/B001BAG38G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426693127&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;le+male</li>
            <li> Good transaction product as described&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li> So, after being highly confused by the two different sizes - 4.2 in the title, 1.5 in the description - and not getting an answer from the seller, I decided just to buy it because it was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed 4.2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received it FOUR days late. I am not happy with that, at all. But, thats the sellers doing so I&#x27;m not taking off a star because of that.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, it looks almost exactly like the original. I get it out of the can and am happy to see it resembles the last bottle I purchased exactly. However, the collar clip is hardly the same. this one does not fit it properly and makes the nozzle head pop off every time you try to take it off, and it scratches the metal going on and off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it smells exactly the same albeit not quite as strong, which is alright with me.</li>
            <li> For a knock off it not bad.  The scent is not too far off. I was complemented while out to dinner with friends to it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Just for every ocassion.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s not true JPG but smells great and lasted a bit. Better cologne than most axe sprays and lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> This BLUE cologne smells EXACTLY like the Jean Paul Le Male it imitates.  Now the only problem is its lasting power.  After a few sprays it smells like you are all set but after an hour or two it fades and fades fast.  Great price for this though worth it in my book for less than 1/3 the original fragrance.  If you like Le Male this is a good inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I read the reviews and some of them seemed pretty bad  .. But I decided to give it a go I received it on time and to test the longevity of it i sprayed it on my wrist at 6 and i can still smell it at 12:00 it must work pretty well so in conclusion good buy.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much that i wear it myself, sometimes! It&#x27;s strong enough for a man but sweet and gentle enough for a woman.</li>
            <li> I had a friend how had this and this is not it. The smell is nothing like the real thing. It smells bad. If you see the price and thinks its a deal it&#x27;s not. Your just getting a cheap smell. I let my friends smell it and they told me to go change shirts because it smelled so bad. I think I will find a car sells man and give it to him so people will know his as cheap as this stuff. Don&#x27;t buy this. Pay the higher price and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne, to wear anytime. Is durable, and smell great.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this cologne to resell on my house, and people keep asking me for more... so, is nice to have it around.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly the same as Jean Paul Gaultier. Cannot go wrong with size of bottle and this is the most inexpensive price out there. Excellent overall experience. Speedy and efficient service.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package the pump spray on the bottle was broken; therefore I am not able to spray the cologne out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I know your just hearing about it now. but I didn&#x27;t open the can it comes in until I was out of my other cologne that I have on hand. I opened it up from the Cylinder can about a week ago and seen that it was damaged. Figured it was to late to return or get compensated... other wise everything else I ordered is fine.</li>
            <li> this was great... it was a gift for a friend, but i kept instead and got them something else.&lt;br /&gt;smells like the original to me which i had for years, but saw this and gave it a try considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a real nice smell, you, last but not least.... i haven&#x27;t not any duration problem either.&lt;br /&gt;my wife smells it going out and smelt it when i came back in that night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i think its great.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Bootleg cologne</li>
            <li> This is a knock off but the smell is still very good.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected. I feel that it&#x27;s watered down. It still smelled good. Next time I&#x27;ll get the expensive one</li>
            <li> Product smells just like the actual john Paul gaudier. The shipping was very fast . The only problem I had was with the way that the bottle was in the can. I went to pull the can open and cologne wasn&#x27;t secured in place of the plastic securing device and the first bottle fell onto the floor and broke. I reordered and the second bottle was the same but it didn&#x27;t break because I opened it on the bed.</li>
            <li> Purchase this as a gift, Person really loved it.</li>
            <li> Cologne arrived on time, and i love the smell. Only draw back is it doesnt stay with you as long as the cologne you would buy in Macy&#x27;s, Dillards, etc....... I love the smell, and women walk by and say who smells so good</li>
            <li> really cheap smeells awfull too sweet, gets you dissy right away, dont buy this cologne save your money or buy something else</li>
            <li> Very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose and this spray is very nice smelling.  We used to buy Jean Paul Gaultier colognes, but they are just too expensive for our budgets, so we tried this BLUE and are extremely satisfied.  It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually complain about other reviewers, as each person has their own experiences, but the comments that say this doesn&#x27;t last or that it stinks  and doesn&#x27;t resemble Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances seem quite bogus to me, perhaps from other cologne sellers that don&#x27;t want you to find out that you can get a product that is quite good for just a portion of the big bucks the real deal costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are cost conscious and like Gaultier&#x27;s fragrances, you will like this.  If it turns out you don&#x27;t, I say you need to post the distributor, because perhaps they are giving you a bogus product in its place.  There are some discount perfume distributors out there who water down colognes, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case from the two different distributors I bought Blue from on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is an imitation and offered the original. They are irresponsible</li>
            <li> its looks like its just water in a bottle ,once you sprayed after 10 mins you cant smell anything its looks cheap but in real its very expensive for what you paid for.</li>
            <li> almost as good as the original but the only thing is when you spray it on you..the scent doesnt stay as long as the original...other than that im satisfied</li>
            <li> 3 star for the customer service from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Product is NOT &amp;#34;JEAN PAUL GAULTIER by Jean Paul Gaultier EDT SPRAY&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A SIMILAR PRODUCT, called BLUE Perfumes. so when it says original and 100% authentic in the description, it&#x27;s not really true. It&#x27;s a FAKE Jean Paul Gautier Spray, but it&#x27;s an authentic Blue Perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in the original Jean Paul, this is not it, it&#x27;s a generic product, and regarding quality, i am not sure how close is the smell, since i&#x27;m returning it. I bought it because it said 100% authentic and stuff, but I guess, it never said anything about what is the original brand. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Smokey scent&lt;br /&gt;a real gem and has come down in&lt;br /&gt;price since it&amp;#34;s inception!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the spray bottle and&lt;br /&gt;the large 4.2 oz lasts at least a Year!</li>
            <li> sobre este articulo no tengo critica alguna estoy totalmente conforme y satisfecho, hasta me gustaria comprar otro, cuando aparesca otra oferta.......</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal. I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles so far. The last order only cost $15.00 for a full size bottle. It smells just like the name brand just a bit weaker. You use about double what you would use of the name brand, but it coasts about 25% so its a big win. No one I have encountered out and about can smell the difference.</li>
            <li> The scent of the product is incredibly close the Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier. It seems to be almost the same exact product. Satisfied Customer here.</li>
            <li> This perfum is not original</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it smells way to sweet never smelled the real thing but heard it was great this smells well terrible, at least to me.</li>
            <li> It came in a box with holes in it  and broken</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting at all!!! The fragrance does not last at all!!! In all my years of purchasing Jean Paul fragrance , I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed. With real Jean Paul fragrance I could spray once or twice and that smell works last all day...this doesn&#x27;t even last minutes!!</li>
            <li> Like the smell the first time they gave me this cologne I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like it but yep I liked it sp when I saw the price it was just an easy decision to buy it</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, this perfume is for my personal use &amp; is cheaper than the other brand.</li>
            <li> Beautiful inexpensive Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Have used them many times and gave some as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male.</li>
            <li> This is Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for more than an hour on me. Hell, I sprayed some on myself at 7am and could still smell it at 7pm. The next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I am more than impressed by this \\&quot;value\\&quot; brand. Thanks to Jean Paul Gaultier for recognizing that not everyone can afford a brand name, but everyone deserves a brand name product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t just take my word for it. Check it out for yourself! Also, I have more than one review on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.</li>
            <li> very poor. The spray pump does not work.It squirts,resulting in mess. uses up much perfume.old stock. The supplier was not&lt;br /&gt;very understanding in its reply. Disappointed.. I give one star for prompt delivery .</li>
            <li> choose this rating, because I think it&#x27;s great the processes to bring the product in good condition to my mailbox</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last at all, aroma is off in a matter of few minutues, i carry mine around in my car just to have it handy and even that doesn&#x27;t help! Aroma is not bad but the effects wears off just too quickly for it to make any sense. I am guessing i was sold a knock off of a knock off, Lol because original knock offs&#x27; aint suppose to be this fleeting. 1star from me</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake smells like it but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The Blue 4.2 oz. Eau De Toilette Spray For Men smells great but I can only give it 4 stars because the top on mine was broken and doesnt spray that good so i have 2 use another top.</li>
            <li> Great price and always rapid delivery.</li>
            <li> Be careful! Not original!</li>
            <li> classic, all-time great, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this at all.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and at the price I got it at, ot was practically a steal</li>
            <li> Good bargain for a cheap price. Smells close to the original but the strength wears off faster but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;d buy another bottle.....</li>
            <li> SELLER needs to choose a better shipping style as they chose to use U.S.P.S  (United States Postal Service) and chose to ship the protect can in A USPS Bubble Wrap ENVELOPE which must have been damaged in packing or shipping , the damage that the Eau De Toilette SPRAYER HAS IS THAT IT arrived in a dented can, and has what appears to be pliar/tool scratches/ marks on the SPRAY NOZZLE ON TOP. which pushes down, to spray, but if I don&#x27;t get the chance to return this, I WILL BE STUCK WITH A SPRAYER that only goes down..YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY PUSH THE SPRAYER UP AFTER EACH and EVERY SPRAY DOWN</li>
            <li> I love it so much it smell soooooooo goooooooooooodi bought it for my boyfriend but ended up keeping it for myself</li>
            <li> Smells spot on. Hangs with me as the original will buy again no question. Impressed. I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised !</li>
            <li> I was very suprised at how nice this product smelled, almost identical to its competitor and at a fraction of the cost. Very good purchase</li>
            <li> excelente producto... confiable el vendedor, la entrega se hizo en el tiempo estimado, aunque no vivo en los EEUU, recomiendo al vendedor</li>
            <li> It literally last for 10 minutes.....and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky. I can&#x27;t complain because it was only 15 bucks..... that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and I must say that I am very pleased with the scent. I get lots of compliments on this clean,fresh fragrance any time I wear it and it lasts me all day.  My only issue was that the can container was slightly dented but other than that the Cologne is absolutely awesome and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance, its scent is irresistible, my wife loved this cologne and I also love, is durable and very nice</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST AS GOOD A JEAN PAUL VERSION.  WOMEN TOLD ME HOW GREAT IT SMELLED AND COULD NOT TELL IT WAS AN IMITATION VERSION!</li>
            <li> very good product I liked a lot the take this into account for future purchases and recommendations to friends and acquaintances</li>
            <li> Smell good but does not last</li>
            <li> The glass was dirty, like was used, dispenser don&#x27;t come and the smell don&#x27;t have any smell, less than water... A complete fraud</li>
            <li> Product fragrance was mostly alcohol within a year, suspect it was old stock.</li>
            <li> So I opened this up and I have been getting a few different colognes to try to have a little variety. I put on 4 different colognes Cuba Gold, Blue, Christian Audigier, and Mambo. My wife and my 13 y/o say that the Christian Audigier smells the best and that the Cuba Gold smells better than the Blue, they said the Mambo was ok but not something I should wear everyday. Now, when I sprayed the Blue on myself it smelled a little off. I don&#x27;t know if I had a bad batch, or I needed to shake it or what not but I was only mildly impressed. The smell didn&#x27;t last a full 8 hour workday. I own everything from Aqua di Gio to some cheap BOD spray so I think I can point out quality. I would give this a 6 out of 10 stars. The bottle is neat and unique, but I think they could due a little fine tuning to make this cologne really work.</li>
            <li> It smells good after a while but at the beginning you can smell strong alcohol, which evaporates later but good product for the price :)</li>
            <li> The first item received had a problem with the spray - didn&#x27;t work - right out of the box. The replacement one - didn&#x27;t have the spray problem - but the scent is extremely weak - in comparison to the Original JPG Le Male. Even after 5-6 pumps of the spray - the scent is really weak and doesn&#x27;t last for more than half an hour max. The curious thing is that both times I opened the tin cylinder packaging, the bottle emerged without the spray (which had come off during the opening process - somehow). weird!! I would recommend NOT buying this product especially if you&#x27;re looking for great Value for Money. Buy the Nautica Voyage which is available at the same price. Better and stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> This fragrancy smells so good that could to compare it with The Original fragrancy from Jean Paul Gaultier, so if you can buy it, do it!</li>
            <li> 100% responsable el perfumes me llego en buen estado volvería con este vendedor aaaaaaaa bb c d n d r</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE VERY NICE FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Bought for Dad and he loved the smell. Case was bent in shipping but overall good product.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT OTHER WEBSITE AND EBAY SELLING IT FOR HALF THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I recommend it. It is exactly as published. I arrive at the stipulated time. Good product. Greetings from Mérida - Venezuela</li>
            <li> it said it was jean paul gaultier it wasnt I have a genuine bottle wasnt even close to yhe original</li>
            <li> very  responsible and  serious staff working i n this compan y, I recommend it for any purchase you may have.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, because we both love the name brand Eau De Toilette but who wants to spend $80 on a cologne. It smells just like the name brand one. People say it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but this is a spray not a cologne. So yes its watered down, but it really doesn&#x27;t take much effort to spray more on; and so far I feel like it lasts. The bottle is a good size as well. I will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> i love jean pual gultier but the one i received it is fake i hate this one i got the blue is a fake i hate fake colonges this is 1 hate star</li>
            <li> So great the ladies love it!!</li>
            <li> Items look horrible looks like a fake item and also packaging is the worst ever ship to me</li>
            <li> I brought it for me it has a very clean and fresh scent to it. Not overbearing like most male fragrances.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference at all from the original and I still get compliments of how well I smell. :)</li>
            <li> Product came in broken &amp; all scratched up, the top piece even broke as well. Can&#x60;t even use it now &amp; it just came in.</li>
            <li> Este perfume no huele nada.no good</li>
            <li> Why does anyone even sell this product. It is a cheap watered down version of Le Male. The scent is identical for about 10 min and then it is gone. Do yourself a favor go to wal mart and buy the real deal. 1 bottle of Le Male will last your 2 years all you need is one spray.</li>
            <li> awesome this was supposed to be for my husband but my son also likes its so i will soon be buying another one.</li>
            <li> thanks for the assistance..</li>
            <li> Be carful !!!&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is a knock off !!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this does NOT smell,feel,look like the original.&lt;br /&gt;Pieces break off the bottle,&lt;br /&gt;Printing on bottle is flawed&lt;br /&gt;Smell is horrible ! Not like original !</li>
            <li> i have oredred it several times</li>
            <li> Fragrância estranha a princípio, mas depois melhora um pouco.</li>
            <li> Love it... perfect as expected. Thanks for the being so professional. I will recommend and continue doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Always like this cologne smell so good lots of compliments,great  price bought two this time.</li>
            <li> Spray cap was off and the product leaked again upon delivery. Scent was slightly harder than my previous last undamaged third order back from another supplier. I won&#x27;t risk ordering this product again but will instead pay full retail for a product that I can actually see what I am purchasing.</li>
            <li> Great smell for a Jean Paul knock off.</li>
            <li> ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice,my brother is very happy whit tis product</li>
            <li> not the real thing and you can tell, it doesn&#x27;t last as long but it was cheap and I wasn&#x27;t paying attention</li>
            <li> i agree with the reviews that say it smells like the real stuff but doesn&#x27;t last long. worth the price though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular cologne and this one and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two except the price. I love the way it smells and I would definitely again. Even if it&#x27;s not exactly the same I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to tell the difference it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It brought back memories from n y&lt;br /&gt; A A A STUFF WILL RECOMMEND MY FRIENDS PURCHASE&lt;br /&gt;IF THEY WAN THE SAME RESULTS IM GETTING</li>
            <li> Not the same label and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay at all</li>
            <li> The fragrance is every bit as good as the original for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> packaging (bag ) ok but dented tin perfume. perfume poseira not trigger spray. unusable product</li>
            <li> Smells amazing gratata</li>
            <li> el producto es la calidad que describen y el tiempo de llegada del producto es el estipulado en los parametros</li>
            <li> Awesome. I will use them again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this from the suggestion of a lady friend. After first spraying this, I personally thought it smelled a bit feminine for a cologne, but after a few minutes...i started to understand where she was coming from. I&#x27;ll walk around wreaking of vanilla beans and other extremely soft and sweet odors...if it gets me laid. My suggestion, is buy it.</li>
            <li> Does not last long, but a fraction of the price!!!...</li>
            <li> I should have been alerted by the ridiculously low price on this, I cannot be 100% sure, but I think it is counterfeit. I have the smaller bottle of this same cologne, the container is very different and the scent is not the same (at least to me). This bottle looks like it has been tampered with and there is a sticker on the bottom of this bottle whereas the Macy&#x27;s bought product has the product details engraved in the base, the way its supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! It came earlier than expected. The cap was broken but easy fix. Great customer service</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and we both LOVE it!! for the price, it smells very good. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dear is originally this</li>
            <li> does not smell the same as original.  Should have spent the extra cash and got what I had before.  Close but no cigar.</li>
            <li> this product may not look or smell a little original, horrible, not recommended at all, not even worth the low price I paid for this colony</li>
            <li> Very fake product! Totally disappointed!! Smell does not stay, it&#x27;s total cheap fake product. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> this appears to be already open.badly put back together. the case was dented all over. like its been to a war. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is not  Jean Paul Gaultier cologne, So do not be fooled, it does not smell like it, Maybe alittle but the ladies will not be fooled. Also the bottle is an obvious cheap knock off</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> Same as the original. No difference!!</li>
            <li> el producto es de muy buena calidad y cumplió con todos mis expectativas y mas muy buena calidad  z z</li>
            <li> It does smell very nice.  It&#x27;s different from John Paul Gaultier but still nice.  My husband says it doesn&#x27;t last very long but still seems to be a decent buy in comparison.  John Paul is so expensive so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> I wear this cologne almost everyday and I have received so many &amp;#34;you smell really good&amp;#34; comments from friends, family, and even strangers. While I do definitely recommend this cologne, I hope not too many of you guys out there purchase it because then I won&#x27;t have as much swagger (;</li>
            <li> I like the product &amp; would recommend it. It does not last as long as the original product . But it does linger for a long time.I would definatly buy \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; again.</li>
