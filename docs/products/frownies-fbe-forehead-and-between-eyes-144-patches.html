            <li>My boyfriend has even started wearing them too after seeing the great results!</li>
            <li>Very good price for the amount you receive</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions you will have great results.  </li>
            <li>LOVE my frownies!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and you should give them a try.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the old fashioned way of beautification is still the best way!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I have found an inexpensive and safe alternative to botox.</li>
            <li>work great if you use them consistently.</li>
            <li>but I have definitely experienced positive results.</li>
            <li>I love Frownies.</li>
            <li>Basically nothing more than paper with glue on it.</li>
            <li>By then my moisturizer has been sucked in and the glue adheres better.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>(I think when a man decides to wear facial patches at night that is a lot of proof that they really are a great product, Lol).</li>
            <li>Safe, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and it works.</li>
            <li>They stay on best if I put them on a few hours after returing.</li>
            <li>The frownies are made of cheap paper with cheap glue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now in the habit of using these consistently and have avoided botox for many years.</li>
            <li>If I have a special event, I use them and always look fresher and happier.</li>
            <li>I have been using these on and off as needed for at least 10 years - they work great!</li>
            <li>They rarely made it through the whole night.  </li>
            <li>Noticed an improvement after the first night and these are helping to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my face to relax.</li>
            <li>They are worn overnight and mechanically immobilize your facial muscles which in return smooths out fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea at the time but they hardly even stick to my forehead.</li>
            <li>These patches really work well</li>
            <li>It takes about a week of using them nightly to really see the difference, so don&#x27;t be discouraged if after using them for a night or two that you don&#x27;t immediately see results.</li>
            <li>I can think of other products that would do a better job at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>First nite I got these I used them and when I woke the next morning and took them off</li>
            <li>If you do not use this product frequently you will not achieve the results you want.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d rather purchase these, which are all natural.</li>
            <li>came quickly as presented but after a few days of use my skin seemed stretched ans saggy, flacid</li>

            <li> you need to do this everyday for a lasting effect , of which i do not do on a regular basis</li>
            <li> For those who are not familiar, botox can cost anywhere from $350-$500 a session and there is no proof that it does not cause long term damage as it is still considered relatively &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days</li>
            <li> I wet them and stuck them on.</li>
            <li> You have to apply them properly for them to work - I dab a little water on one, allow it to become tacky by blowing on it for a few seconds, relax my forehead, then apply and hold for about 10 seconds, wiping any excess water/adhesive with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference as long as I use them every night or at least every other night.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expense way to fight the frown lines and came across Frownies.  </li>
            <li> but they have made them less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Slept with the things on for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the worst at keeping a healthy bedtime routine, but because the results are there, I do it without any problem.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and was desperate to find a product that smoothed my forehead wrinkles and the dreaded &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; between my eyes.</li>
            <li> I beg to differ - vehemently - with the negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> I tend to tense my forehead in my sleep and decided to try these out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> These patches really work well and I will definitely re-order them.  They are worn overnight and mechanically immobilize your facial muscles which in return smooths out fine lines.  They also helped train my forehead muscles to relax instead of squinting together all the time thus creating the two vertical lines between my eyes. They do not hurt coming off at all (I saw someone comment about that).  I recommend reading the instructions about placement and removal.  If you follow the instructions you will have great results.  This is an amazing product and you should give them a try.  My boyfriend has even started wearing them too after seeing the great results! (I think when a man decides to wear facial patches at night that is a lot of proof that they really are a great product, Lol).</li>
            <li> I love Frownies. I use them for my deap wrinkles between eyes over night. I can see a difference as long as I use them every night or at least every other night. I can&#x27;t imagine life without them anymore. I can even use one pads twice.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. Basically nothing more than paper with glue on it. It&#x27;s terrible and doesn&#x27;t work. Do you want to wear tape on your face to bed? Ugh...don&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> As long as you can get in the habit of using these every night, it will work. I&#x27;m probably the worst at keeping a healthy bedtime routine, but because the results are there, I do it without any problem. I&#x27;m now in the habit of using these consistently and have avoided botox for many years. Safe, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and it works.</li>
            <li> Frownies did not work for me.  I tried several ways of adhering them to no avail.  They rarely made it through the whole night.  I can think of other products that would do a better job at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> They stay on best if I put them on a few hours after returing. (As in, on my midnight bathroom run.) By then my moisturizer has been sucked in and the glue adheres better. LOVE my frownies!</li>
            <li> I tend to tense my forehead in my sleep and decided to try these out. Noticed an improvement after the first night and these are helping to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my face to relax.</li>
            <li> I use to get botox but it became to costly.  I was looking for a less expense way to fight the frown lines and came across Frownies.  They don&#x27;t work as well as botox (nothing does) but they have made them less noticeable.  I wear them while sleeping and while on the computer when I&#x27;m home and hightly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Have to use all the time to see a difference. If you do not use this product frequently you will not achieve the results you want. Very good price for the amount you receive</li>
            <li> work great if you use them consistently.</li>
            <li> I have been using these on and off as needed for at least 10 years - they work great! Yes, they do look like brown packing tape, but I don&#x27;t know what type of adhesive or paper is used in brown packing tape so I&#x27;d rather purchase these, which are all natural. You have to apply them properly for them to work - I dab a little water on one, allow it to become tacky by blowing on it for a few seconds, relax my forehead, then apply and hold for about 10 seconds, wiping any excess water/adhesive with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I beg to differ - vehemently - with the negative reviews on this product.  I am a 53 year old woman who had used Estee Lauder products religiously - to the tune of $600 every other month - for over 2 years and never saw the results that these simple patches provide.  Not only have I noticed the difference with my deep forehead lines, but others have commented on the change as well (the ultimate proof!)  You do need to use them every night, along with the rosewater spray, to have results, but THEY DO WORK!  It takes about a week of using them nightly to really see the difference, so don&#x27;t be discouraged if after using them for a night or two that you don&#x27;t immediately see results. Sometimes the old fashioned way of beautification is still the best way!</li>
            <li> With daily use, improved my forhead crease</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea at the time but they hardly even stick to my forehead.</li>
            <li> I used it 7 days in a row and saw no change. Maybe the  wrinkles were too deep!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a habit of using them every night. I wake in the morning with no frown lines. After a couple hours around my husband, the frowns are back, but not as deep as if I weren&#x27;t using frownies at all. I love them. If I have a special event, I use them and always look fresher and happier. They are safer, cheaper, and easier than botox. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> came quickly as presented but after a few days of use my skin seemed stretched ans saggy, flacid</li>
            <li> First nite I got these I used them and when I woke the next morning and took them off I couldn&#x27;t wait to go back to bed that nite and use them again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days but I have definitely experienced positive results. I am 34 years old and was desperate to find a product that smoothed my forehead wrinkles and the dreaded &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; between my eyes. I am thrilled that I have found an inexpensive and safe alternative to botox. For those who are not familiar, botox can cost anywhere from $350-$500 a session and there is no proof that it does not cause long term damage as it is still considered relatively &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. I will continue to use these religiously!</li>
            <li> Pulled out eyebrows where my wrinkles are. Stopped using them</li>
            <li> strange to use, too sticky, doesnt actually work</li>
            <li> The frownies are made of cheap paper with cheap glue. I wet them and stuck them on. Slept with the things on for a few days. I did not see a difference in my frown line. Quackery!</li>
            <li> helps .... you need to do this everyday for a lasting effect , of which i do not do on a regular basis</li>
