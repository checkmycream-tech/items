    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this turban.  </li>
            <li>These towels are SO great!</li>
            <li>Great price also!</li>
            <li>Great price for 6!</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to spend the $35 it costs for this pack of 6.  </li>
            <li>The absorption is great in the microfiber materials.</li>
            <li>The quality of these is astounding!  </li>
            <li>Really handy!  </li>
            <li>I had recieved a dollar store hair turban for my birthday and loved the idea of it.  </li>
            <li>I gave the Eurow microfiber turbans a try, and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of cotton terry turbie towels, but I was never all that impressed with how much water they drew out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job and washes nicely, also dries hair faster and therefore protects your hair.</li>
            <li>These turbans are really nice.</li>
            <li>These work great &amp; are very absorbent!  </li>
            <li>The loop and button closure works much better than the elastic loop on the turbies.  </li>
            <li>going to share the 6 pack with my daughter, mom, and mother-in-law.  :)</li>
            <li>I am glad I brought these.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy more for my daughter and granddaughters.</li>
            <li>You have to be sure to wash them according to the directions.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love these hair turbans.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll be able to multitask while drying your hair.</li>
            <li>They stay comfortably on the head and pull a lot of water out of my hair!</li>
            <li>Will be giving them for gifts for my grand daughters.</li>
            <li>I think they will love them.</li>
            <li>They are easy to wrap and button.</li>
            <li>The button closure is also easy to use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they look nice and soft and my daughter loves these kind of hair towels.</li>
            <li>These are so much better at drying hair that it&#x27;s worth the hassle of buttoning and unbuttoning.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time with my free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Perhaps 3 to 4 times more effective than traditional towels.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful and much easier to use and better on hair than usual bath towel.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and shoulder length and these turbans are perfect!</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Luckly, I made a right purchase.</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t dry faster, but it&#x27;s more comfortable and convenient and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used another brand, so I&#x27;m not sure how they compare to others, but they work great for me.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much softer than cotton terry, and the microfiber fabric wicks the water out of my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with my purchase, because I mainly just wanted a soft towel that would stay put after I took a shower.</li>
            <li>They have a button and loop so that they stay on your head with no problem, and I&#x27;m able to twist almost all of my hair into the turban--only the last 2 or 3 inches sticks out</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, dries my hair pretty quickly, and are MUCH lighter than using a regular towel</li>
            <li>My mom and I use them everyday for drying our hair and we love it!</li>
            <li>This is fine if you just want a towel to hold your hair back.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without these lightweight hair towels.  </li>
            <li>They absorb water very well off the hair.</li>
            <li>It would be much easier if the end of the towel could just be pushed through an elastic loop, like on the Turbie Twist.</li>
            <li>These towels work very well.</li>
            <li>So far, the buttons have stayed on well too &amp; I use them a lot!!!  </li>
            <li>This seems like a much better deal per turban than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure anybody needs this many since you put one over clean hair and they dry quickly, but if you have multiple people who could use one in your household I recommend these.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>Because they button in the back, that works so much better than other fasteners that wear out.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair very fast, and it also gets wet quickly.</li>
            <li>I shared some with my sister who has natural hair as well.  </li>
            <li>As far as drying your hair faster, I have not noticed any differnce at all.</li>
            <li>I was estatic to find a six pack for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re small, and don&#x27;t like to stay secure on my head.  </li>
            <li>It never worked that well, but when it bit the dust (shortly after my birthday) I began looking for new ones.  </li>
            <li>so you have dry ones ready.</li>
            <li>Then when I am ready to deal with my hair, it is on its way to being dry!  </li>
            <li>They were very affordable compared to the other microfiber hair turbans.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair, and have no trouble getting it all in the turban and securing it.</li>
            <li>It does not dry any faster than a regular towel.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s long enough to cover it totally.  </li>
            <li> These are gonna last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (waist length), so I usually end up using a second one after the first one is fairly wet.  </li>
            <li> Large enough for lots of long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The other terry cloth type or As Seen On TV brands are so thin and cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> I would guess I&#x27;m doing less damage to my wet hair because it&#x27;s not heavy and dragging on it like a bath towel.</li>
            <li> Gets the water out after washing so my hair is easier to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is down to the middle of my back and these towels are long enough to hold all my hair.</li>
            <li> You can quantify this by noting how wet the towel gets over time compared to traditional (previous) towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I never really thought of twisting a bath towel on my head as a problem.  </li>
            <li> Minus the one I keep for myself.</li>
            <li> The microfiber is so soft and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the other types made of terry cloth and an elastic loop to lock the towel in position but with those the elastic wears out and the cloth is rough.  </li>
            <li> The Eurow turbans are larger than the turbie towels too, which is helpful since I&#x27;m wearing my hair just past shoulder length</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t absorb water faster than any other towel I&#x27;ve got as stated by previous reviews, but they do the job well and stay on my head.</li>
            <li> I was worry about to get the wrong one because i really cant tell by looking at these pictures.</li>
            <li> It is just a little towel with a button and loop to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair too</li>
            <li> We have thick curly (me), thick wavy (daughter) hair.  </li>
            <li> The loop that buttons in place is made of a very thick, non-stretchy thread that holds in place.  </li>
            <li> I use the button to hang it behind my shower curtain on the loops.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried this though, walking around with a bath towel on my head seems silly.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed as I gave some of these with Christmas presents.</li>

The Eurow turbans are larger than the turbie towels too, which is helpful since I&#x27;m wearing my hair just past shoulder length now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to share the 6 pack with my daughter, mom, and mother-in-law.  :)</li>
            <li> I am glad I brought these.  I shared some with my sister who has natural hair as well.  It dries up water without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is down to the middle of my back and these towels are long enough to hold all my hair. They are easy to wrap and button. I am going to buy more for my daughter and granddaughters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with my purchase, because I mainly just wanted a soft towel that would stay put after I took a shower. But it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair very fast, and it also gets wet quickly. So buy the 6-pack so you have dry ones ready.</li>
            <li> This is fine if you just want a towel to hold your hair back. As far as drying your hair faster, I have not noticed any differnce at all. It does not dry any faster than a regular towel. I am a bit disappointed as I gave some of these with Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I bought these so that I wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair by rubbing it with a towel.  They were very affordable compared to the other microfiber hair turbans.  I&#x27;ve never used another brand, so I&#x27;m not sure how they compare to others, but they work great for me.  I have very long hair (waist length), so I usually end up using a second one after the first one is fairly wet.  They have a button and loop so that they stay on your head with no problem, and I&#x27;m able to twist almost all of my hair into the turban--only the last 2 or 3 inches sticks out b/c my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> I had recieved a dollar store hair turban for my birthday and loved the idea of it.  It never worked that well, but when it bit the dust (shortly after my birthday) I began looking for new ones.  I was estatic to find a six pack for such a reasonable price.  I crossed my fingers that they worked, and to my amazement they did!!  Anyone not noticing a faster drying time, probably has washed them incorrectly.  You have to be sure to wash them according to the directions.  My mom and I use them everyday for drying our hair and we love it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to spend the $35 it costs for this pack of 6.  It was worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve had the other types made of terry cloth and an elastic loop to lock the towel in position but with those the elastic wears out and the cloth is rough.  The other terry cloth type or As Seen On TV brands are so thin and cheap feeling.  The quality of these is astounding!  The microfiber is so soft and thick. The loop that buttons in place is made of a very thick, non-stretchy thread that holds in place.  These are gonna last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The absorption is great in the microfiber materials. Perhaps 3 to 4 times more effective than traditional towels. You can quantify this by noting how wet the towel gets over time compared to traditional (previous) towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the buttons, however, have fallen off after one or two uses. They are not well attached / sewn.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these hair turbans.  We have thick curly (me), thick wavy (daughter) hair.  They keep our hair from getting frizzy.  They suck out the moisture so that our hair is just damp after several minutes.</li>
            <li> This seems like a much better deal per turban than some of the other brands. I&#x27;m not sure anybody needs this many since you put one over clean hair and they dry quickly, but if you have multiple people who could use one in your household I recommend these. I have very long hair, and have no trouble getting it all in the turban and securing it. The button closure is also easy to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these. What a simple product but so essential. It is just a little towel with a button and loop to keep it in place. Gets the water out after washing so my hair is easier to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased after seeing one used by a friend.  These are wonderful and much easier to use and better on hair than usual bath towel.  Gave them as gifts and kept two for myself!  Your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without these lightweight hair towels.  They are so easy to use, dries my hair pretty quickly, and are MUCH lighter than using a regular towel so you&#x27;ll be able to multitask while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> These work great &amp; are very absorbent!  Because they button in the back, that works so much better than other fasteners that wear out.  So far, the buttons have stayed on well too &amp; I use them a lot!!!  Very happy with this turban.  I have very thick, long hair too &amp; it&#x27;s long enough to cover it totally.  Washes well.</li>
            <li> These towels are SO great! They absorb water very well off the hair. The only downside is that the end of the towel has a loop which has to be hooked onto a button. It would be much easier if the end of the towel could just be pushed through an elastic loop, like on the Turbie Twist. These are so much better at drying hair that it&#x27;s worth the hassle of buttoning and unbuttoning.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and shoulder length and these turbans are perfect! They stay comfortably on the head and pull a lot of water out of my hair! Great price also!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than I expected. It does it&#x27;s job and washes nicely, also dries hair faster and therefore protects your hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they look nice and soft and my daughter loves these kind of hair towels. I got her 3 and me 3 so I  won&#x27;t have to steal hers! Great price for 6! Arrived on time with my free prime shipping.</li>
            <li> there are 2 type of this drying fabric. one doesnt work well. I was worry about to get the wrong one because i really cant tell by looking at these pictures. Luckly, I made a right purchase. The fabric works well!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem like something I needed.  I never really thought of twisting a bath towel on my head as a problem.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried this though, walking around with a bath towel on my head seems silly.  Hair doesn&#x27;t dry faster, but it&#x27;s more comfortable and convenient and stays put.  I would guess I&#x27;m doing less damage to my wet hair because it&#x27;s not heavy and dragging on it like a bath towel.</li>
            <li> These are so helpful - I put it on my head - and off I go for 10 - 30 mins without worry..  Then when I am ready to deal with my hair, it is on its way to being dry!  Really handy!  I use the button to hang it behind my shower curtain on the loops.</li>
            <li> These towels work very well. They don&#x27;t absorb water faster than any other towel I&#x27;ve got as stated by previous reviews, but they do the job well and stay on my head.</li>
            <li> These turbans are really nice. Large enough for lots of long thick hair. Will be giving them for gifts for my grand daughters.Minus the one I keep for myself. I think they will love them.</li>
