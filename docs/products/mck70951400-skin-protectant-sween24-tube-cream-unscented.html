            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>leg.&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my legs seems to always be thirsty for more moisture</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be needing more soon.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>

            <li>What is nice about it is it works remarkably fast to soften your skin</li>
            <li>She has tried so many different brands that I can&#x27;t keep track of them, but this si by far the best her skin condition.  </li>
            <li>I think the important opinion is from the person using it, not the person applying it.    </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hand cream for dry cracked and bleeding winter hands like mine!</li>
            <li>The absolute best for dry flaky skin!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin during the winter.  </li>
            <li>It has a high concentration of glycerin and is one of the best cures/treatments for dry hands</li>
            <li>I bought the large size and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Using this on our 94 year old WWII Vet and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great for rough heels</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a luxurious, thick body lotion that has no scent which is perfect for someone like me who has some allergies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extraordinary and keep my crusty lower legs from cracking.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, before I was released, they gave me a tube to take with me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not thick at all...very easy to apply and smooth on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my recent order.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or too oily, good product for dry skin (I use it on my feet.)</li>
            <li>It does leave a mild greasy film until it is fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>Fast service!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, really works on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Light and non greasy, it really was soothing to her skin post hospitalization and during rehab.</li>
            <li>apply it at night to my legs only and it honestly has softened, moisturized, and improved the texture of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 89 year old mother suffered from cellulitis on her lower legs for many months.  </li>
            <li>l&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Really good for chaffing areas and real dry skin.</li>
            <li>Maintaining skin integrity is vital to staying healthy.</li>
            <li>I purchased some right away.</li>
            <li>Skin on legs and arms is very smooth and no dry or sore spots.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it to anyone for the kind of skin problems I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless, too - that can be important for people who are sensitive to perfumed moisturizers.</li>
            <li>IF THE PRICE IS A BIT HIGHER,  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to it while I was hospitalized.</li>
            <li>First time ever something worked on them.</li>
            <li>Our podiatrist recommended Coloplast Sween 24 for helping to break down rough tissue on feet, so I was very happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, within a few days, my feet were pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams, primarily for hands, over the years, from low-end to very expensive, and this very affordable cream truly is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>But the extra wait is worth it because you will love how soft it leaves you feeling.</li>
            <li>Soaks into skin quickly and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This size tube will last a long time: the moisturizer looks like petroleum jelly as it comes out, but surprisingly isn&#x27;t oily on your hands after application: just wipe off and wash your hands as you would with any cream.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this product .</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>Coloplast Sween really helps keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>she works in a hospital and needed to wash her hand and arms a lot and this product seemed to really help.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;24&amp;#34; in the name means it lasts 24 hours, and it really does.</li>
            <li>Works very well at protecting my hands.</li>
            <li>It lived up to its hype and my skin is much healthier.</li>
            <li>The nurses don&#x27;t seem to like it too much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Customer service was fast and responsive after shipment arrived damaged.</li>
            <li>24 really means 24.</li>
            <li>, i asked again and the nurse was so sweet to actually check and brought me a tube  </li>
            <li>Similar consistency to vasoline but seems to soak in quickly.</li>
            <li>Super creamy lotion which makes a big difference in the skin of my husband&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will by again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just like another review of the large size, love this product, can&#x27;t live without it in the winter time, had to have a small carry on with me.  </li>
            <li>The tween24 really keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>you still have this cream?&amp;#34;  most always the answer was  a firm</li>
            <li>It does feel heavy going on, but after that, you can wash your hands and they will still be moist and lovely.</li>
            <li>I now alternate this with my other favorite and it really has done the job I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And since a little goes a long way, the price and the value are exceptional.</li>
            <li>AMAZON,,,, MY NEW HERO....</li>
            <li>The Sween protected her \\&quot;new born\\&quot; skin as it grew and somehow prevented the problems from returning.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions and creams in the past that don&#x27;t even compair to this Sween hand Cream</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and takes a few extra minutes to be fully absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li>but we still keep some of this on hand as an excellent moisturizer and skin protector for cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream and in only a week, her scales have dramatically reduced and I&#x27;m positive they will completely disappear in another couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>instead i was sent 5 ounces of baza clear moisture barrier</li>
            <li>I started using this product upon recommendation form my youthful 85 year old mother in-law who received it in the hospital.</li>
            <li>Her skin never peeled or flaked and was always soft.</li>
            <li>This product makes them soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and now they are soft.</li>
            <li>Daily trips to the wound clinic, antibiotics, compression stockings and many other treatments did not work the heal her very fragile skin.  </li>
            <li>This was used at the wound center the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I was first exposed to it when I was in the hospital for a major arm fracture and all of my skin was rough and sloughing off.</li>
            <li>So far it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly protects my skin in the winter!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate.  </li>

            <li> Skin on legs and arms is very smooth and no dry or sore spots.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it to anyone for the kind of skin problems I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless, too - that can be important for people who are sensitive to perfumed moisturizers.</li>
            <li> IF THE PRICE IS A BIT HIGHER,  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to it while I was hospitalized.</li>
            <li> First time ever something worked on them.</li>
            <li> Our podiatrist recommended Coloplast Sween 24 for helping to break down rough tissue on feet, so I was very happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, within a few days, my feet were pretty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams, primarily for hands, over the years, from low-end to very expensive, and this very affordable cream truly is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> But the extra wait is worth it because you will love how soft it leaves you feeling.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin quickly and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This size tube will last a long time: the moisturizer looks like petroleum jelly as it comes out, but surprisingly isn&#x27;t oily on your hands after application: just wipe off and wash your hands as you would with any cream.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product .</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> Coloplast Sween really helps keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> she works in a hospital and needed to wash her hand and arms a lot and this product seemed to really help.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;24&amp;#34; in the name means it lasts 24 hours, and it really does.</li>
            <li> Works very well at protecting my hands.</li>
            <li> It lived up to its hype and my skin is much healthier.</li>
            <li> The nurses don&#x27;t seem to like it too much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Customer service was fast and responsive after shipment arrived damaged.</li>
            <li> 24 really means 24.</li>
            <li> , i asked again and the nurse was so sweet to actually check and brought me a tube  </li>
            <li> Similar consistency to vasoline but seems to soak in quickly.</li>
            <li> Super creamy lotion which makes a big difference in the skin of my husband&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will by again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like another review of the large size, love this product, can&#x27;t live without it in the winter time, had to have a small carry on with me.  </li>
            <li> The tween24 really keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> you still have this cream?&amp;#34;  most always the answer was  a firm</li>
            <li> It does feel heavy going on, but after that, you can wash your hands and they will still be moist and lovely.</li>
            <li> I now alternate this with my other favorite and it really has done the job I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And since a little goes a long way, the price and the value are exceptional.</li>
            <li> AMAZON,,,, MY NEW HERO....</li>
            <li> The Sween protected her \\&quot;new born\\&quot; skin as it grew and somehow prevented the problems from returning.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions and creams in the past that don&#x27;t even compair to this Sween hand Cream</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and takes a few extra minutes to be fully absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li> but we still keep some of this on hand as an excellent moisturizer and skin protector for cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and in only a week, her scales have dramatically reduced and I&#x27;m positive they will completely disappear in another couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> instead i was sent 5 ounces of baza clear moisture barrier</li>
            <li> I started using this product upon recommendation form my youthful 85 year old mother in-law who received it in the hospital.</li>
            <li> Her skin never peeled or flaked and was always soft.</li>
            <li> This product makes them soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> and now they are soft.</li>
            <li> Daily trips to the wound clinic, antibiotics, compression stockings and many other treatments did not work the heal her very fragile skin.  </li>
            <li> This was used at the wound center the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I was first exposed to it when I was in the hospital for a major arm fracture and all of my skin was rough and sloughing off.</li>
            <li> So far it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly protects my skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin to begin with, but holding files and dealing with the dust all day makes my hands crack at times (especially in winter).  </li>
            <li> I had dry chapped gross feet.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the results, and have been using it daily as I have had years of dry cracking skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that will heal my cracked and dry fingertips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream now as a help against dry skins (legs and back) and as a help against itchiness caused by allergies to the elastic in my socks.  </li>
            <li> after using all in that tube  we were going crazy trying to find more...</li>
            <li> Over the years, after several bumps and cuts, her legs have become EXTREMELY scaly.  </li>
            <li> I brought it home with me and much later began reusing due to chronic dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I also had stubborn dry patches on my hands.</li>
            <li> At 60, I&#x27;m just getting patches of dry skin-this works.</li>
            <li> It works in dry climate as well as moist.</li>
            <li> My daughter had some really dry itchy patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is/was so dry.  </li>
            <li> Ed  Dry skin can hurt you.</li>
            <li> works well on my daughters extremely dry skin/eczema.</li>
            <li> really dry his hand out to where they peel.</li>
            <li> The nurses would bathe me and then afterwords used this  moisturizer to keep my skin from getting dry or irritated from the bed sheets.  </li>
            <li> would buy this again for our dry skin</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes my year round dry fingers from peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li> I got a lot for very little at Amazon (three giant tubes)</li>
            <li> I have had dry elbows since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> My grandmother has very dry, sensitive, thin skin.  </li>
            <li> It starts greasy but rapidly absorbs with a little rubbing.  </li>
            <li> I need heavy duty and this keeps the eczema away.  </li>
            <li> I recently suffered a broken leg and had to spend 3 days in the hospital.  </li>
            <li> Her hands are so dried,</li>
            <li> were a few \\&quot;sample packets\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The doctor recommended this cream, and within a few weeks his skin was healed.  </li>
            <li> Children&#x27;s hospital gave me a small bottle to use on my newborn little girl a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Eventually I get a very slight oiliness and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Got a small tube of this when I was I the hospital.</li>
            <li> No more</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t as bad as hers, but it&#x27;s always been sensitive and I needed a skin cream.</li>
            <li> for someone who washes hands at least 20x day at work, this is a skin-saver.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s SOO thick...</li>
            <li> My hands have a hard time with the dry winter cold and this lotion saved my hands from the dry painful cracking that i usually deal with.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with poor circulation and edema around my ankles and lower legs.  </li>
            <li> Since replacing the Cetaphil with Sween Cream, we have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in her skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> best moisturizing ever</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great for itching skin.  Actually recommended to a friend and she has also ordered.</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician and have tried many, many hand lotions.  This is the WINNER! I have dry skin to begin with, but holding files and dealing with the dust all day makes my hands crack at times (especially in winter).  I put this lotion on at night and the cracks are healed in the morning! No kidding. Best buy ever!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hand cream for dry cracked and bleeding winter hands like mine! I have tried so many lotions and creams in the past that don&#x27;t even compair to this Sween hand Cream</li>
            <li> Our podiatrist recommended Coloplast Sween 24 for helping to break down rough tissue on feet, so I was very happy to find it here.  This size tube will last a long time: the moisturizer looks like petroleum jelly as it comes out, but surprisingly isn&#x27;t oily on your hands after application: just wipe off and wash your hands as you would with any cream.  It&#x27;s odorless, too - that can be important for people who are sensitive to perfumed moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Great item - I used this while in the hospital and bought this after using up my hospital supply. Not greasy or too oily, good product for dry skin (I use it on my feet.)</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital and began to break out in a rash.  I asked for something for that and they suggested this product.  They gave me some and I purchased some at a retail store and then ordered on line.</li>
            <li> I had dry chapped gross feet. Then I tried Coloplast 24. It started healing overnight! Amazingly, within a few days, my feet were pretty! I also had stubborn dry patches on my hands. This product softened these areas, too!  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this item!</li>
            <li> for someone who washes hands at least 20x day at work, this is a skin-saver.  works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product . I&#x27;m on my feet a lot, being a cosmetologist. ? So my feetbuilds dead skin fast..  which make themhust. The tween24 really keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> This was used at the wound center the first time I tried it. They use it with another ointment to keep the wound moist for healing.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  My hands have a hard time with the dry winter cold and this lotion saved my hands from the dry painful cracking that i usually deal with.  So far it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly protects my skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> Used this as a nurse on patients in the hospital....works very well</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate.  Coloplast Sween really helps keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great!! Fast service!!</li>
            <li> Similar consistency to vasoline but seems to soak in quickly. Great for feet.</li>
            <li> the best that I&#x27;ve ever used............Still using after 6 month&#x27;s treating of lower leg skin abrasion. Good looks and feel of skin oan arms and legs. Try it, you will like it...........</li>
            <li> Got a small tube of this when I was I the hospital. It has a high concentration of glycerin and is one of the best cures/treatments for dry hands I&#x27;ve found and I have tried just about all of them. The hosp staff &amp; constant Purell users are onto something. I bought the large size and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased Sween Cream for my 91-year-old grandmother on the recommendation of a nurse who was treating a wound on her leg.  My grandmother has very dry, sensitive, thin skin.  Over the years, after several bumps and cuts, her legs have become EXTREMELY scaly.  I purchased this cream and in only a week, her scales have dramatically reduced and I&#x27;m positive they will completely disappear in another couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after showers, she was using Cetaphil as her regular skin cream.  After applying that cream, the skin on her back and shoulders would still have the sandpaper texture it did before.  Since replacing the Cetaphil with Sween Cream, we have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in her skin.  No more sandpaper!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic results. Works great for ezcema.</li>
            <li> I got this on recommendation of my 92 yo mother.  My skin wasn&#x27;t as bad as hers, but it&#x27;s always been sensitive and I needed a skin cream. At 60, I&#x27;m just getting patches of dry skin-this works.</li>
            <li> family member was in hospital. gave us a tube of this cream. family member has severe skin scaling.  with this cream it was 99 % better. after using all in that tube  we were going crazy trying to find more... each time he was in a hospital we would ask &amp;#34;so you still have this cream?&amp;#34;  most always the answer was  a firm no....&lt;br /&gt;upon his last admissionin Slidell Memorial Hospital , i asked again and the nurse was so sweet to actually check and brought me a tube  but it was only 1.5 percent dimethecone.  which we were grateful to get... just to use more than once a day...&lt;br /&gt;lesson here is ..... WHEN YOU CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE.... GO TO AMAZON.... IF THE PRICE IS A BIT HIGHER,  THE SHIPPING WELL MAKES UP FOR IT...  AMAZON,,,, MY NEW HERO.... P. W. Hadley....</li>
            <li> The absolute best for dry flaky skin!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it every day and will order this forever I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Sween 24 is the only moisturizer I have ever used that works for an entire day.  It works in dry climate as well as moist.</li>
            <li> Both my girls have ezcema....and before purchasing this I was using Euclid on them...but it&#x27;s SOO thick...it was a chore putting it on them.  Then I came across the Sween 24 cream. I love that you can use it once a day and it&#x27;s not thick at all...very easy to apply and smooth on the skin.  I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I started using this product upon recommendation form my youthful 85 year old mother in-law who received it in the hospital. It did amazing things to her parched and injured leg.&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my legs seems to always be thirsty for more moisture so I was willing to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at night to my legs only and it honestly has softened, moisturized, and improved the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it also leaves a residue which does not sink into my skin so this is definitely best applied at night covered by some kind of clothing so as not to rub off on bedding. I now alternate this with my other favorite and it really has done the job I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with poor circulation and edema around my ankles and lower legs.  I have tried just about every product on this problem--the greasy ones and the vanishing ones.  Sween worked the best of them all.  It starts greasy but rapidly absorbs with a little rubbing.  Eventually I get a very slight oiliness and it is not sticky.  Soothes my skin and has no odor.  I got a lot for very little at Amazon (three giant tubes) so I won&#x27;t be needing more soon.  I can recommend this product.  I haven&#x27;t tried the regular version so I can&#x27;t compare them.</li>
            <li> Cant beat this cream. Same cream used in hospitals. That is why I bought it. Lasts all night. My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> My daughter had some really dry itchy patches of skin.  she works in a hospital and needed to wash her hand and arms a lot and this product seemed to really help.  She will order more!</li>
            <li> I chose coloplast sween 24 moisturizing skin protectant cream because I had been given a tube of the cream while a patient in a hospital. I like the way it made my skin feel so soft,silky and smooth. It is one of the best creams I have ever had.</li>
            <li> My 89 year old mother suffered from cellulitis on her lower legs for many months.  Daily trips to the wound clinic, antibiotics, compression stockings and many other treatments did not work the heal her very fragile skin.  Finally the therapists used Sween 24 and the healing process began.  The Sween protected her \\&quot;new born\\&quot; skin as it grew and somehow prevented the problems from returning.  She has been free of problems for over a year but we still keep some of this on hand as an excellent moisturizer and skin protector for cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li> I recently had to spend some days in the hospital.  My skin is/was so dry.  One of the nurses brought me some of this cream and with one application I could tell the difference in my skin and appearances.  When I returned home I researched to find where I could by it.  And Amazon had it...super!  I purchased some right away.</li>
            <li> Grand father loves this cream!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the skin</li>
            <li> Using this on our 94 year old WWII Vet and it is amazing.  Skin on legs and arms is very smooth and no dry or sore spots. Has been the best of all creams tried and is very easy to apply and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream ever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Children&#x27;s hospital gave me a small bottle to use on my newborn little girl a year and a half ago. Her skin never peeled or flaked and was always soft. The 2 ounce bottle lasted me three months for her and I promtly ordered another one. I also use it for my hands and feet once in awhile and it works wonders. Now expecting my second child I will be using it yet again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin and this has worked wonders for me.  I highly recommend it and will by again.</li>
            <li> Great for rough heels</li>
            <li> This is amazing!! I have been using this for years and years! The only thing that makes my year round dry fingers from peeling and cracking. I have tried it ALL. This is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin during the winter.  Ed  Dry skin can hurt you. It can keep you from having a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dermotoligist at Cleveland Clinic recommended this and gave us a sample.  My husband had graft versus host disease of the skin after his bone marrow transplant and this cream is wonderful for it as well as my dry skin in the winter!  We tried to find it around NW Ohio but no one carried it...but I knew I could get it on Amazon!  We will be reordering this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I first was introduced to it while I was hospitalized. What is nice about it is it works remarkably fast to soften your skin but it also does not leave any greasy residue which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample in the hospital and it worked so great that I wanted to buy it!  Great hand lotion - better than anything else I can find in the stores!  I wash my hands multiple times/day and this lotion holds up great!!</li>
            <li> Sween 24 cream is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I was first exposed to it when I was in the hospital for a major arm fracture and all of my skin was rough and sloughing off. They gave me this product, and my skin was healed in one day. I&#x27;ve tried tons of creams, primarily for hands, over the years, from low-end to very expensive, and this very affordable cream truly is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. The &amp;#34;24&amp;#34; in the name means it lasts 24 hours, and it really does. It does feel heavy going on, but after that, you can wash your hands and they will still be moist and lovely.</li>
            <li> One of the few skin creams that really works. I was hospitalized for palpitations and arrhythmia which turned out to be low potassium levels. While there (3 days) I was given a package which contained the Coloplast Sween 24 Moisturizing skin cream. I was amazed at the results, and have been using it daily as I have had years of dry cracking skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> works well on my daughters extremely dry skin/eczema. it has the consistency of vaseline, but rubs in nicely and is scent free. l&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Found this when my mom was in the hospital. Works very well at protecting my hands. I wash my hands and then put it on when try are still damp and it keeps them moisturized</li>
            <li> Very good skin moisturizer. It relay work, I have been using it for 3 years. Go for it you will not lose</li>
            <li> The only skin cream I use.  Been using it for a couple years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Even started getting my daughter to use it.</li>
            <li> I intended on getting the accu train cream and ordered this by mistake. It came up under the same search and looks the same.  But it is wonderful for dry skin and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have lymphedema from lyme disease and my physical therapist suggested this cream.  It&#x27;s extraordinary and keep my crusty lower legs from cracking.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like another review of the large size, love this product, can&#x27;t live without it in the winter time, had to have a small carry on with me.  Regular lotions don&#x27;t cut it for me.  I need heavy duty and this keeps the eczema away.  Thank you Swen for creating this product.</li>
            <li> An excellent skin cream.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a two pack but only one came</li>
            <li> Super creamy lotion which makes a big difference in the skin of my husband&#x27;s legs.  It moisturizes them and relieves itching for day to day living.  Great in conjunction with leg wrap to give relief to his legs.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping. Works great on my husbands hands. He has a masonry business and the bricks and mortar really dry his hand out to where they peel. This product makes them soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered a broken leg and had to spend 3 days in the hospital.  The nurses would bathe me and then afterwords used this  moisturizer to keep my skin from getting dry or irritated from the bed sheets.  Luckily, before I was released, they gave me a tube to take with me and I was able to locate it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a luxurious, thick body lotion that has no scent which is perfect for someone like me who has some allergies.  It goes on smooth and takes a few extra minutes to be fully absorbed into your skin.  But the extra wait is worth it because you will love how soft it leaves you feeling. And since a little goes a long way, the price and the value are exceptional.</li>
            <li> My wife was given this in the hospital and liked it so well that I bought it for her. Amazon was the only place I could find it. Light and non greasy, it really was soothing to her skin post hospitalization and during rehab. We continue to order it and use it because it is really a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I have had dry elbows since I was a little girl. When I was in Tucson visiting my mother in law in the hospital, I tried this lotion. Its what they use for their patients.  I couldn&#x27; t believe it!  I was so embarrassed about my elbows and now they are soft. First time ever something worked on them.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a Nurse Practitioner.  It lived up to its hype and my skin is much healthier.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Coloplast Sween 24 Superior Moisturizing Skin Protectant Cream 9 Ounce - Model 7095 (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;I ordered coloplast sween moisturing skin cream 9 ounces instead i was sent 5 ounces of baza clear moisture barrier ointment.i would like to return this and i will never order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my recent order. It is fully doing the job my podiatrist recommended it for.</li>
            <li> Really good for chaffing areas and real dry skin. Found out about this product when I was in the hospital for a month.</li>
            <li> would buy this again for our dry skin me and my wife both use it  even my grand daughter  uses it</li>
            <li> My wife is a nurse who constantly washes her hands at work.  Her hands are so dried, the skin cracks.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best she has found so far.  She has tried so many different brands that I can&#x27;t keep track of them, but this si by far the best her skin condition.  She is really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My mom just had surgery at Stanford Hospital and this is what they use there.  The nurses don&#x27;t seem to like it too much.  They say it&#x27;s \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but my mom loves it!  It stops the itch.  I think the important opinion is from the person using it, not the person applying it.    I bought her a tube of this lotion because all the hospital gave her were a few \\&quot;sample packets\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that will heal my cracked and dry fingertips. Highly recommended! Amazing stuff! Great price also.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin quickly and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Customer service was fast and responsive after shipment arrived damaged. This is a really good product; excellent moisturizer for hands and body...one of the best we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best moisturizing cream I have ever had.  It is wonderful and I can&#x27;t do without it now that I have used it.  I will continue to shop with AMAZON, they are the best!</li>
            <li> I discovered Coloplast Sween 24 during a hospital stay. I brought it home with me and much later began reusing due to chronic dry, itchy skin. I  continue to use it daily. It works wonderfully. 24 really means 24. Maintaining skin integrity is vital to staying healthy. Coloplast Sween 24 is my eay-to-apply tool for achieving this.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My infant son had to wear an apnea monitor, and ended up with some skin breakdown where the pads touched his skin.  The doctor recommended this cream, and within a few weeks his skin was healed.  It does go on a bit greasy, but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really works on dry skin.  It does leave a mild greasy film until it is fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> I apply after my morning shower and it actually lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skinn mosit and stops the need to scratch all the time</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream now as a help against dry skins (legs and back) and as a help against itchiness caused by allergies to the elastic in my socks.  This cream works great.  I&#x27;ve consulted with my skin doctor and again he gave it a good review based just on the ingredients listed on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone for the kind of skin problems I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
