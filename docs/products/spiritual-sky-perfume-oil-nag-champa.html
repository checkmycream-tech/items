            <li>this perfume is exactly what you need!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other nag champa perfume oils and nothing smells as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>Right when I opened it it smelled like incense</li>
            <li>Very Soothing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the incense.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like nag champa.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I sneezed immediately when I first smelled it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED Spiritual Sky lavender oil years ago, and when I reordered a couple of years ago, I found the smell, consistency, and staying power very different than the product I remembered.</li>
            <li>But it becomes a little more user friendly once you apply it or diffuse it or anything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>it smells very much like the extra rich nag champa by gonesh.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very centering.</li>
            <li>this smells so much like the nag champa</li>
            <li>This product really does ease the mind</li>
            <li>and this does not smell much like it at all.  </li>
            <li>i really like it &amp; wear it often.</li>
            <li>It also works well on the skin if you are lucky enough to get a massage.</li>
            <li>you a little of it and mix with others, by itself you&#x27;ll smell like hot topic!!!</li>
            <li>Stays true to sense all day long.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been trying for ages to find a perfume oil that smells like the old nag champa stick incense before the reformulation.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain over the years I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of different versions of nag champa and to me this is just another version.</li>
            <li>The first impression is definitely nag champa, but the finish is just as definitely baby powder.</li>
            <li>i was so afraid that this oil was not going to smell as good as the incense</li>

            <li> very harsh and not a pleasing aroma.</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> This product is not good at all for a skin oil</li>
            <li> it is very weak can hardly smell it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s simply too annoying to the senses.</li>
            <li> and I am a bit disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Spiritual Sky and Nag Champa ... my favorite place to buy oils and my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume it is like heaven!!!paradise!!!Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Right when I opened it it smelled like incense but the next time just smelled like baby powder. Now even the baby powder smell is fading. I would try a different one if I were you.</li>
            <li> I love to use aromatherapy oils anytime I can.  The Nag Champa Scent is an especially nice scent to use when in the bath, or just using it anytime.  I&#x27;m a big user and believer in oils produced by Spiritual Sky.  Very Soothing!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Love the smell.  I got it cause my husband loves the smell of nag champa.  Now he loves to smell it on me.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> you a little of it and mix with others, by itself you&#x27;ll smell like hot topic!!! over all good. I love these oil brands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for candles and as an incense oil. I sometimes wear it as a cologne when I go out. The girls love it! lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close to Nag Champa as I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> This is my daily perfume. I get so many compliments on it. I&#x27;ve tried other nag champa perfume oils and nothing smells as good as this stuff. I wish it came in a larger bottle with a spray nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it makes me sneeze sometimes so I don&#x27;t use it often. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm I wear this ALL the time, sometimes layering it with Nag Champ or Frankincense n Myrrh. I get compliments.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this smells like baby powder. I LOVED Spiritual Sky lavender oil years ago, and when I reordered a couple of years ago, I found the smell, consistency, and staying power very different than the product I remembered. I decided to give this a chance and I am a bit disappointed. The first impression is definitely nag champa, but the finish is just as definitely baby powder. Not pleased. If someone knows of a good one that smells like the Satya Sai Baba incense sticks, let me know!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Exact musk scent I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This makes the third Nag Champa perfume oil I have and each has a slightly different scent. I like the Spiritual Sky because it isn&#x27;t overpowering. However, it isn&#x27;t as long-lasting on my skin as another brand.</li>
            <li> For anyone who loves the smell of Nag Champa incense this perfume is exactly what you need! My only complaint is that it does not come with a roll on applicator.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a warm spicy scent.  I like to wear it as perfume. The scent is very centering. Love it!</li>
            <li> great scent, brings back memories from the 70&#x27;s. I love to put this in a oil burner, it fills the house!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this sensual scent</li>
            <li> This product is not good at all for a skin oil it is very weak can hardly smell it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this Nag Champa scent is a real nice pleasant scent. As described it is great for body, bath and  aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been trying for ages to find a perfume oil that smells like the old nag champa stick incense before the reformulation.  this smells so much like the nag champa i remember buying.  it smells very much like the extra rich nag champa by gonesh.  the only problem i have with it is that i wish the scent lasted a little longer, but for the price it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Smelling it from the bottle it smells like an insanely strong nag. But it becomes a little more user friendly once you apply it or diffuse it or anything. I had smelled spiritual sky&#x27;s sandlewood before so I kind of knew what I was walking into when I got to this and I like it. I can&#x27;t really complain over the years I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of different versions of nag champa and to me this is just another version.</li>
            <li> I wear this as perfume. One small dab on each of my wrists lasts the entire day. It smells wonderful and I&#x27;ve had several people tell me I smell great.</li>
            <li> One of the best oils I haver used. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Have purchased different vendors but LOVE Spiritual Sky Nap Champa the BEST!  Stays true to sense all day long. Get lots of compliments when I wear this oil.</li>
            <li> Great smell and quality. Thank you</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like the incense. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product really does ease the mind and I love the scent.  It is great to use in baths as it completely takes you away to a relaxing place after a busy day and it helps relieve all your stresses and strains. It also works well on the skin if you are lucky enough to get a massage. Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I like this multi-purpose scented oil.  Although it&#x27;s a relatively small bottle, you can use it for body, bath and perfumery.  Pretty good product!</li>
            <li> if you love the smell of nag champa then this oil is for you!! it does not smell like baby powder like some of the other nag champa oils out there. i wish they had a larger bottle to buy!!</li>
            <li> Had a strong chemical smell. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Never had it before but I like the smell .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Very good scent in my warmer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from some of the reviews, but extremely satisfied. Smells exactly like nag champa. Seriously.... this stuff is the bomb. Would absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the incense, love it!</li>
            <li> This is not what I anticipated.  I have a bottle of Nag Champa oil I bought somewhere else and this does not smell much like it at all.  It has a perfume odor.  I don&#x27;t know what happened to it but it is not at all what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance.  This item is easy to use and the fragrance is nice and light not too overpowering.  A must have.</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s a rather harsh smelling nag champa. I sneezed immediately when I first smelled it. I&#x27;ve been wearing the dark brown nag champa oil that is very mellow and rather intoxicating. this one is not like that at all. it&#x27;s simply too annoying to the senses. very harsh and not a pleasing aroma. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> i was so afraid that this oil was not going to smell as good as the incense but i was pleasantly suprised. i really like it &amp; wear it often.</li>
