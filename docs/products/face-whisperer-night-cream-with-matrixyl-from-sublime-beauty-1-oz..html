            <li>In my honest opinion this night cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Face Whisperer Night Cream with the Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum at night and the Face Whisperer Day Cream along with the Hyaluronic Serum for just over two weeks and the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>And the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Sublime beauty products are amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with my skin; I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after I&#x27;ve been the products for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>Quite a nice night cream but nothing</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>A bit thinner than I would like but does a nice job hydrating.</li>
            <li>I received the cream to try and I am sharing my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a light, pleasant scent</li>
            <li>I find this cream to be the most effective and fairly priced anti-aging treatment available.</li>
            <li>Although I have good skin to start with, I edging tell enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Matrixyl 3000:&lt;br /&gt;It is known to be the most effective anti aging ingredient, for use in anti-aging creams, in the world, today.</li>
            <li>Lovely light lotion, pleasant to apply at night.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and i think im even seeing the fine lines disappearing!</li>
            <li>You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
            <li>so I may love it eventually.  </li>
            <li>if I had to guess which products in this line are doing the most repair work, I would guess Whisperer &amp; the Retinol.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and the cream was amazing.</li>
            <li>And it was a couple dollars more as well in just a month apart.</li>
            <li>I love that this product does not have a scent.</li>
            <li>but perhaps I need a bit more time.</li>
            <li>So I am &#x27;winging&#x27; it by applying it around my eyes, between my eyebrows and around the mouth, where most of the lines and wrinkles are prominent.  </li>
            <li>A lovely attention to detail</li>
            <li>Nice light weight product.</li>
            <li>Love how this feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the way this night cream works on my face,.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this product at a promotional price.</li>
            <li>and I love that this moisturizes my skin, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy since it contains no oil.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel and SHINE.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look better than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can see there are many benefits for the skin when using Matrixyl</li>
            <li>Glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many fabulous things about Matrixyl, this night cream has it all !</li>
            <li>I LOVE using this night cream.</li>
            <li>I am very excited about this line of skin care products.</li>
            <li>founder of the company is also very nice and professional and checks in with you to make sure you received the product, have questions etc...</li>
            <li>I love how light it feels on your face before you go to bed and how you wake up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look fresher, younger or more beautiful</li>
            <li>t really moisturizes my face and makes it look and feel good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good non-irritating and reasonably moisturising cream.</li>
            <li>A true must for all 35+!</li>
            <li>This night cream goes on easily and feels like it is doing it&#x27;s thing from the start.  </li>
            <li>This is a easy to apply cream.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice texture, absorbs very quickly and leaves the skin smooth and soft for all night.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>They arrive today wrapped in beautiful white pouches with satin ribbons.  </li>
            <li>ingredients have the power to improve the elasticity of your skin, and at the same time, give your skin a beautiful tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this in the daytime, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb all the way, which is fine for&lt;br /&gt;me at night.</li>
            <li>I can see some of my fine wrinkles around my eyes doing the disappearing act or atleast reducing in depth.</li>
            <li>so I am going to look into the day time cream to see if it absorbs more quickly.</li>
            <li>From the very first days I have seen my face magically regain shape and tone.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth,</li>
            <li>I was given this product free for review and have used it for a week or so now.</li>
            <li>Then I ordered another night cream, day cream with argireline, and a advanced eye gel.</li>
            <li>I have used several of the products from this company and they are all great</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Sublime Beauty products and I have had great results with everything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I always receive a thank you e-mail after I order, along with a detailed description of the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>It can be applied freely, without fear on all parts of the body, because, side effects have never been a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to get this cream in exchange for an unbiased beauty product review.  </li>
            <li>And we are both very pleased with our new product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this product, as it was packaged beautifully and shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>Her follow up and follow through demonstrated that she places a high priority on excellent customer service and that will keep me coming back time and time again.</li>
            <li>I can now say that the quality, potency and amount of active ingredients in the night cream are incredible.</li>
            <li>The product, recommended by my son, applies easily, absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I love face creams and oils, and I love trying to new ones.</li>
            <li>You know it is fresh and the seller cares !  </li>
            <li>, I have to admit, largely because I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>special-</li>
            <li>find this a good product to use regularly.</li>
            <li>That was cool.</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free or reduced prince in exchange for an honest review as seen above.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Non greasy, Absorbs quickly, has No scent.</li>
            <li>Yes a night cream that provides adequate moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was a great opportunity to ask my &#x27;detailed&#x27; questions, which were answered within an unbelievable minute.</li>
            <li>...to tell if this will live up to it&#x27;s reputation, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Sublime Products go on fast, are light and sink into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are really softening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream was easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt more comfortable trying this product, since I have not had any skin irritation using any of the Sublime Beauty products.</li>
            <li>But well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My eyes look more youthful and fresh, crow&#x27;s feet nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>It was like the laugh lines around my mouth, fine-lines on my neck and cheeks packed up their bags and took a vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pump style bottle with a cap to keep fresh.  </li>
            <li>Gives your skin a pampered and fresh experience.  </li>
            <li>So far this is OK, and if I really see a significant improvement I&#x27;ll be sold.  </li>
            <li>The Face Whisperer cream arrived packaged inside a beautiful blue sheer case.  </li>
            <li>This is a great night cream which leave my skin soft and ready for the next morning.</li>
            <li>As I get older though, I notice more and more wrinkles, especially around my eyes and mouth, so I felt that using a moisturizer at night would be very beneficial to me.</li>
            <li>So far the Sublime facial products have been wonderful, I would recommend them to anyone who wants soft smooth, clear, skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and looks very hydrated and healthy.  </li>
            <li>old &#x27;girl&#x27; with olive toned skin and icky skin at best.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Feels so good going on, saw no major improvement but it contained all natural ingredients which attracted me to the product .  </li>
            <li>Try this first.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more products from Sublime Beauty in the future.</li>
            <li>use 30 days without fail &amp; you will see changes for the best.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth, and the wrinkles just as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel incredibly soft and smooth with each use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is light, not greasy and it absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>No weird residue</li>
            <li>I replied and reported a tiny issue that was meant to be more of an FYI than a complalint</li>
            <li>The seller is a treasure, highly recommend her!!</li>
            <li>First off it arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised to discover that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better, softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li>In the last months I have bought many matrixyl based products but this has really made the difference to me.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the day cream and liked it so much I had to purchase this as well!</li>
            <li>It is great value when compared with other night creams with similar anti-wrinkle power.  </li>
            <li>and it works it&#x27;s magic all night long.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, however, there was a slight smell to it</li>
            <li>Wow, woke up this morning with ever soft lips, smooth</li>
            <li>I am really into skincare</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the night cream with Matrixyl.</li>
            <li>Really like the way it makes my skin feel too.</li>
            <li>, it really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very silky, leaves skin feeling Dewey.</li>
            <li>non-greasy, fast absorb.....</li>
            <li>It is very greasy and made my face break out</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference yet</li>
            <li>Really hydrating.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother, lines seem to be diminished</li>
            <li>Ready, really like the whisperer.</li>
            <li>Already recommended that to my close friends, and will recommend that to anybody who wants to minimize pores and want to have smoother, relaxed, and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>This cream really does deliver everything it says it</li>
            <li>Sublime Beauty seems to really care about their customers.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how fast the products arrive after you order them.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft right away</li>
            <li>As a 53 year old woman, I have tried many anti wrinkle products and spent a small fortune as most woman probably have, trying to find that miracle product that promises to restore our once wrinkle free skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it makes my face very smooth and has helped to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li>The product is very nice a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly like it says, and to me that is worth the investment:) I could tell the difference within the first week as my wrinkles gradually decreased.  </li>
            <li>Let me break it down from the top.</li>
            <li>I gave it a rather high rating because I am picky about face creams and have tried and passed on a number through the years.</li>
            <li>It is competitively priced and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(OK, something with a little efficacy.)</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels OK, not greasy or heavy, and after a week or so of use it is not aggravating my face.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my skin is still feeling fresh &amp; hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I am always looking for new products that do not cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>That is why I needed a new night cream.  </li>
            <li>But I thought it was time to branch out and try something new.  </li>
            <li>Skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it is soothing and SO very soft when applied.  </li>
            <li>the night cream wasn&#x27;t same as I got it the first time.</li>
            <li>in the first place, boy I found out differently!</li>
            <li>I knew instantly I would be married to this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>much that they will not reduce to normal size no matter what topical treatment I provide.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am completely sold on this company, their products and their customer service!</li>
            <li>I am a girly girl, and love make up and such, but I don&#x27;t mess around with taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>My face has become so soft since using products from Sublime Beauty.</li>
            <li>She immediately took action and sent me replacement products.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face feel soft not greasy.</li>
            <li>now I feel I have to seek professional help to fix this problem.</li>
            <li>I have sun damaged skin and my skin is 63 years old.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and soft.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I can see such a difference in the lines around my mouth and eyes especially the fresh glow that this has brought out in my face.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say whether or not it does all it claims because I have not used it long enough, but for someone who uses (tries) everything under the sun, I would put this in my top ten products for gentle and non greasy face creams.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews of other people who have tried Matrixyl products and if you are convince then, try them on your skin and see if they are really worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not the first item I&#x27;ve purchased from Sublime Beauty, and it definitely won&#x27;t be the last.  </li>
            <li>I never knew I had and that they enlarged not only old pores that will no longer reduce but the new pores will not respond to treatment as well - .so</li>
            <li>Even though I am in my late 40s, I still have sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and just a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>-  after 2 months pores will not shrink back to normal size .</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  </li>
            <li>what my major concern is that it brought about pores</li>
            <li>The key to young looking skin is to start at puberity so educate your kids and always wear sunscreen during the day, even during the winter.</li>
            <li>Finally, the skin feels soft and silky after application, before and after sleep.  </li>
            <li>It arrived nearly a week later than the day cream.  </li>
            <li>Left on overnight and woke up to soft skin with no dryness.  </li>
            <li>Not terrible but not great.  </li>
            <li>It is an expensive product and I expected more from it right from the start, but I will continue to use it and then write a review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a very &#x27;high grade&#x27; product line for the last 4-5 years with no real results.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle, and I think I am beginning to see some new lightness and brilliance to my skin, will touch back after next bottle</li>
            <li>usually the first night I try the product!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and almost every product I have ever tried</li>

            <li> In my honest opinion this night cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Face Whisperer Night Cream with the Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum at night and the Face Whisperer Day Cream along with the Hyaluronic Serum for just over two weeks and the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> And the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Sublime beauty products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with my skin; I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after I&#x27;ve been the products for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> Quite a nice night cream but nothing</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> A bit thinner than I would like but does a nice job hydrating.</li>
            <li> I received the cream to try and I am sharing my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a light, pleasant scent</li>
            <li> I find this cream to be the most effective and fairly priced anti-aging treatment available.</li>
            <li> Although I have good skin to start with, I edging tell enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Matrixyl 3000:&lt;br /&gt;It is known to be the most effective anti aging ingredient, for use in anti-aging creams, in the world, today.</li>
            <li> Lovely light lotion, pleasant to apply at night.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and i think im even seeing the fine lines disappearing!</li>
            <li> You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
            <li> so I may love it eventually.  </li>
            <li> if I had to guess which products in this line are doing the most repair work, I would guess Whisperer &amp; the Retinol.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and the cream was amazing.</li>
            <li> And it was a couple dollars more as well in just a month apart.</li>
            <li> I love that this product does not have a scent.</li>
            <li> but perhaps I need a bit more time.</li>
            <li> So I am &#x27;winging&#x27; it by applying it around my eyes, between my eyebrows and around the mouth, where most of the lines and wrinkles are prominent.  </li>
            <li> A lovely attention to detail</li>
            <li> Nice light weight product.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the way this night cream works on my face,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this product at a promotional price.</li>
            <li> and I love that this moisturizes my skin, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy since it contains no oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and SHINE.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look better than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can see there are many benefits for the skin when using Matrixyl</li>
            <li> Glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many fabulous things about Matrixyl, this night cream has it all !</li>
            <li> I LOVE using this night cream.</li>
            <li> I am very excited about this line of skin care products.</li>
            <li> founder of the company is also very nice and professional and checks in with you to make sure you received the product, have questions etc...</li>
            <li> I love how light it feels on your face before you go to bed and how you wake up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look fresher, younger or more beautiful</li>
            <li> t really moisturizes my face and makes it look and feel good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good non-irritating and reasonably moisturising cream.</li>
            <li> A true must for all 35+!</li>
            <li> This night cream goes on easily and feels like it is doing it&#x27;s thing from the start.  </li>
            <li> This is a easy to apply cream.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice texture, absorbs very quickly and leaves the skin smooth and soft for all night.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> They arrive today wrapped in beautiful white pouches with satin ribbons.  </li>
            <li> ingredients have the power to improve the elasticity of your skin, and at the same time, give your skin a beautiful tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this in the daytime, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb all the way, which is fine for&lt;br /&gt;me at night.</li>
            <li> I can see some of my fine wrinkles around my eyes doing the disappearing act or atleast reducing in depth.</li>
            <li> so I am going to look into the day time cream to see if it absorbs more quickly.</li>
            <li> From the very first days I have seen my face magically regain shape and tone.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth,</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for review and have used it for a week or so now.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered another night cream, day cream with argireline, and a advanced eye gel.</li>
            <li> I have used several of the products from this company and they are all great</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Sublime Beauty products and I have had great results with everything I have tried.</li>
            <li> I always receive a thank you e-mail after I order, along with a detailed description of the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> It can be applied freely, without fear on all parts of the body, because, side effects have never been a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to get this cream in exchange for an unbiased beauty product review.  </li>
            <li> And we are both very pleased with our new product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product, as it was packaged beautifully and shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> Her follow up and follow through demonstrated that she places a high priority on excellent customer service and that will keep me coming back time and time again.</li>
            <li> I can now say that the quality, potency and amount of active ingredients in the night cream are incredible.</li>
            <li> The product, recommended by my son, applies easily, absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I love face creams and oils, and I love trying to new ones.</li>
            <li> You know it is fresh and the seller cares !  </li>
            <li> , I have to admit, largely because I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> special-</li>
            <li> find this a good product to use regularly.</li>
            <li> That was cool.</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free or reduced prince in exchange for an honest review as seen above.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Non greasy, Absorbs quickly, has No scent.</li>
            <li> Yes a night cream that provides adequate moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was a great opportunity to ask my &#x27;detailed&#x27; questions, which were answered within an unbelievable minute.</li>
            <li> ...to tell if this will live up to it&#x27;s reputation, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Sublime Products go on fast, are light and sink into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are really softening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream was easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt more comfortable trying this product, since I have not had any skin irritation using any of the Sublime Beauty products.</li>
            <li> But well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My eyes look more youthful and fresh, crow&#x27;s feet nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> It was like the laugh lines around my mouth, fine-lines on my neck and cheeks packed up their bags and took a vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pump style bottle with a cap to keep fresh.  </li>
            <li> Gives your skin a pampered and fresh experience.  </li>
            <li> So far this is OK, and if I really see a significant improvement I&#x27;ll be sold.  </li>
            <li> The Face Whisperer cream arrived packaged inside a beautiful blue sheer case.  </li>
            <li> This is a great night cream which leave my skin soft and ready for the next morning.</li>
            <li> As I get older though, I notice more and more wrinkles, especially around my eyes and mouth, so I felt that using a moisturizer at night would be very beneficial to me.</li>
            <li> So far the Sublime facial products have been wonderful, I would recommend them to anyone who wants soft smooth, clear, skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and looks very hydrated and healthy.  </li>
            <li> old &#x27;girl&#x27; with olive toned skin and icky skin at best.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Feels so good going on, saw no major improvement but it contained all natural ingredients which attracted me to the product .  </li>
            <li> Try this first.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more products from Sublime Beauty in the future.</li>
            <li> use 30 days without fail &amp; you will see changes for the best.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth, and the wrinkles just as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel incredibly soft and smooth with each use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is light, not greasy and it absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> No weird residue</li>
            <li> I replied and reported a tiny issue that was meant to be more of an FYI than a complalint</li>
            <li> The seller is a treasure, highly recommend her!!</li>
            <li> First off it arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks clear and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised to discover that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better, softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> In the last months I have bought many matrixyl based products but this has really made the difference to me.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the day cream and liked it so much I had to purchase this as well!</li>
            <li> It is great value when compared with other night creams with similar anti-wrinkle power.  </li>
            <li> and it works it&#x27;s magic all night long.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, however, there was a slight smell to it</li>
            <li> Wow, woke up this morning with ever soft lips, smooth</li>
            <li> I am really into skincare</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the night cream with Matrixyl.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it makes my skin feel too.</li>
            <li> , it really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very silky, leaves skin feeling Dewey.</li>
            <li> non-greasy, fast absorb.....</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and made my face break out</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference yet</li>
            <li> Really hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother, lines seem to be diminished</li>
            <li> Ready, really like the whisperer.</li>
            <li> Already recommended that to my close friends, and will recommend that to anybody who wants to minimize pores and want to have smoother, relaxed, and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This cream really does deliver everything it says it</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty seems to really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how fast the products arrive after you order them.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft right away</li>
            <li> As a 53 year old woman, I have tried many anti wrinkle products and spent a small fortune as most woman probably have, trying to find that miracle product that promises to restore our once wrinkle free skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it makes my face very smooth and has helped to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly like it says, and to me that is worth the investment:) I could tell the difference within the first week as my wrinkles gradually decreased.  </li>
            <li> Let me break it down from the top.</li>
            <li> I gave it a rather high rating because I am picky about face creams and have tried and passed on a number through the years.</li>
            <li> It is competitively priced and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (OK, something with a little efficacy.)</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels OK, not greasy or heavy, and after a week or so of use it is not aggravating my face.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my skin is still feeling fresh &amp; hydrated.  </li>
            <li> and I am always looking for new products that do not cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> That is why I needed a new night cream.  </li>
            <li> But I thought it was time to branch out and try something new.  </li>
            <li> Skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it is soothing and SO very soft when applied.  </li>
            <li> the night cream wasn&#x27;t same as I got it the first time.</li>
            <li> in the first place, boy I found out differently!</li>
            <li> I knew instantly I would be married to this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> much that they will not reduce to normal size no matter what topical treatment I provide.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am completely sold on this company, their products and their customer service!</li>
            <li> I am a girly girl, and love make up and such, but I don&#x27;t mess around with taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> My face has become so soft since using products from Sublime Beauty.</li>
            <li> She immediately took action and sent me replacement products.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face feel soft not greasy.</li>
            <li> now I feel I have to seek professional help to fix this problem.</li>
            <li> I have sun damaged skin and my skin is 63 years old.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and soft.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I can see such a difference in the lines around my mouth and eyes especially the fresh glow that this has brought out in my face.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say whether or not it does all it claims because I have not used it long enough, but for someone who uses (tries) everything under the sun, I would put this in my top ten products for gentle and non greasy face creams.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews of other people who have tried Matrixyl products and if you are convince then, try them on your skin and see if they are really worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not the first item I&#x27;ve purchased from Sublime Beauty, and it definitely won&#x27;t be the last.  </li>
            <li> I never knew I had and that they enlarged not only old pores that will no longer reduce but the new pores will not respond to treatment as well - .so</li>
            <li> Even though I am in my late 40s, I still have sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and just a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> -  after 2 months pores will not shrink back to normal size .</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  </li>
            <li> what my major concern is that it brought about pores</li>
            <li> The key to young looking skin is to start at puberity so educate your kids and always wear sunscreen during the day, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> Finally, the skin feels soft and silky after application, before and after sleep.  </li>
            <li> It arrived nearly a week later than the day cream.  </li>
            <li> Left on overnight and woke up to soft skin with no dryness.  </li>
            <li> Not terrible but not great.  </li>
            <li> It is an expensive product and I expected more from it right from the start, but I will continue to use it and then write a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a very &#x27;high grade&#x27; product line for the last 4-5 years with no real results.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, and I think I am beginning to see some new lightness and brilliance to my skin, will touch back after next bottle</li>
            <li> usually the first night I try the product!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and almost every product I have ever tried</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 63 years old with very dry skin.</li>

            <li> I have to say that I will only use this as a night cream as it feels very thick on my face and took a while to feel like it had completely absorbed.</li>

            <li> I used to dry brush, but want to get back into it and am looking forward to the body oil, as I have moved to a dryer area.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Whew, this serum worked wonders on my lips, and I thought nothing was wrong with them in the first place, boy</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I started noticing my skin has become drier, with fine lines and less elasticity, of late.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can see such a difference in the lines around my mouth and eyes especially the fresh glow that this has brought out in my face.  I just recently turned 51 and finally feel like I have a product that truly works!!  I am trying to put off injections with the dreaded needles as long as possible can and at last I CAN.  Try this first.  You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
            <li> I have so many great things to say about this product.  I am really into skincare and I am always looking for new products that do not cost an arm and a leg.  I decided to try this after reading the reviews.  I really like it.  I have had it for about 3 weeks now and my skin looks great.  The night cream I was using before was making my face breakout.  It was expensive and I was never happy with it.  That is why I needed a new night cream.  My skin is clear and looks very hydrated and healthy.  I will be buying more products from Sublime Beauty in the future.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It works exactly like it says, and to me that is worth the investment:) I could tell the difference within the first week as my wrinkles gradually decreased.  A MUST TO PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth, Can&#x27;t tell if anyone has noticed yet.  The key to young looking skin is to start at puberity so educate your kids and always wear sunscreen during the day, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> Feels so good going on, saw no major improvement but it contained all natural ingredients which attracted me to the product .  Don&#x27;t think I will purchase as it doesn&#x27;t last long and is quite expensive .</li>
            <li> I really like the night cream with Matrixyl. t really moisturizes my face and makes it look and feel good.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  Haven&#x27;t used it very long so I may love it eventually.  Really like the way it makes my skin feel too.</li>
            <li> I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  I have now used the following products by Sublime Beauty for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Serum&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Face WhispererÂ® Neck &amp; Decollete&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt; Face WhispererÂ® Day Cream with Argireline&lt;br /&gt; Face WhispererÂ® Night Cream with Matrixyl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t take away lines and wrinkles completely, but my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable.  Another biggie for me is that my neck looks younger.  I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
            <li> ...to tell if this will live up to it&#x27;s reputation, but so far so good.  It feels OK, not greasy or heavy, and after a week or so of use it is not aggravating my face.  I do wish it had a light, pleasant scent, it really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.  The slight scent it does have dissipates quickly but is slightly chemical to my nose.  Not everyone smells things the same way though.  The cream I have used for years I use, I have to admit, largely because I love the smell.  But I thought it was time to branch out and try something new.  (OK, something with a little efficacy.) So far this is OK, and if I really see a significant improvement I&#x27;ll be sold.  I&#x27;m giving it a thorough try.  I gave it a rather high rating because I am picky about face creams and have tried and passed on a number through the years.</li>
            <li> I love face creams and oils, and I love trying to new ones. When I was given the opportunity to try the Face Whisperer Night Cream I knew that I was in for a great treat as I have already used the day cream. In my honest opinion this night cream is amazing. I love how light it feels on your face before you go to bed and how you wake up and your face doesnâ€™t feel all greasy like some creams make you feel. My face has become so soft since using products from Sublime Beauty. This is the product line that I am going to stick with. Thank you Sublime Beauty for making a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face looking refreshed in the morning and is a great night moisturizer!  No complains over here.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for review and have used it for a week or so now. I like how its not oily/greasy and rubs in smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Ive noticed my skin feels tighter already and i think im even seeing the fine lines disappearing! I will definitely recommend this product, as it was packaged beautifully and shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now several weeks into the nighttime application of Face Whisperer Night Cream.  The product, recommended by my son, applies easily, absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.  Finally, the skin feels soft and silky after application, before and after sleep.  How delightful to have something working on your behalf during the sleeping hours!</li>
            <li> Goes on very silky, leaves skin feeling Dewey.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised to discover that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better, softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. This cream was easily absorbed. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it makes my face very smooth and has helped to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, and I think I am beginning to see some new lightness and brilliance to my skin, will touch back after next bottle</li>
            <li> I have the Day &amp; Night Whisperer....if I had to guess which products in this line are doing the most repair work, I would guess Whisperer &amp; the Retinol. Creams are non-greasy, fast absorb.....use 30 days without fail &amp; you will see changes for the best. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Lovely light lotion, pleasant to apply at night. Leaves skin soft and smooth, and the wrinkles just as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this a good product to use regularly. It is competitively priced and high quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect night cream!!</li>
            <li> After reading good reviews , decided to give it a try. I ordered night cream with Matrixyl. I like it very much. My skin was smooth and the cream was amazing. I started to tell my friends and neighbors about this cream.Then I ordered another night cream, day cream with argireline, and a advanced eye gel. Guess what!! the night cream wasn&#x27;t same as I got it the first time. it was like a hand lotion and did not do anything to my skin. And it was a couple dollars more as well in just a month apart.I was so disappointed, what a rip off... Is this a fraud company or what.. am not going to buy any sublime beauty products.. not a going to recommend either.</li>
            <li> I do like this as a night cream. I&#x27;m a bit confused as to why the directions say to apply it twice a day since&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a night cream. I can&#x27;t use this in the daytime, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb all the way, which is fine for&lt;br /&gt;me at night. I&#x27;m not a real fan of the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and made my face break out and I&#x27;m 63 years old with very dry skin. Sorry.</li>
            <li> So far the Sublime facial products have been wonderful, I would recommend them to anyone who wants soft smooth, clear, skin.  Very good product...</li>
            <li> I love that this product does not have a scent. The ones that do sometimes bother me and give me headaches. I have to say that I will only use this as a night cream as it feels very thick on my face and took a while to feel like it had completely absorbed. For this reason only I could not use it during the day as it says on the bottle. I have used several of the products from this company and they are all great so I am going to look into the day time cream to see if it absorbs more quickly. It makes my face feel incredibly soft and smooth with each use. The amount dispensed with one pump was the perfect amount so you do not have to try to guess. It is also not oily and it has not caused me to break out at all.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free or reduced prince in exchange for an honest review as seen above.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It did not work as advertised. I have taken good care of my skin, however, it needed a boost and this did not work for me. Very disappointed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have not used this very long but I look forward to continued use of Sublime Beauty products.</li>
            <li> No change yet. Haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference yet but perhaps I need a bit more time. Skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the same time I purchased the Day Cream.  It arrived nearly a week later than the day cream.  Apparently because it was shipped from a different distribution center?  I began using it immediately.  I don&#x27;t remember to use it some nights, but have been using it fairly regularly.  I like the fact that it is light, not greasy and it absorbs completely.  Since I use it in conjunction with the Day Cream I&#x27;d have to give both products a two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a shipping issue, through Amazon, NOT SUBLIME BEAUTY, I was unable to read the directions on how to use it.  So I am &#x27;winging&#x27; it by applying it around my eyes, between my eyebrows and around the mouth, where most of the lines and wrinkles are prominent.  I do see results.  The finer lines have all but disappeared, the deeper set wrinkles have softened.  I just ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am urging my husband to try these products as well.  But you know men.  Bet he&#x27;ll sneak some when I&#x27;m not looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sublime Beauty for a product that does what is says it&#x27;s going to do.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> This night cream is wonderful.  I have been using it for two weeks and already feel like my skin is responding to the treatment.  What I want to comment on however, is the quality of the customer service from Face Whisperer.  The product I received from Amazon was damaged.  I ordered the day and night face cream and the serum.  All three arrived with sticky tape over the surface and dented tops.  I didn&#x27;t make the time to return them, but when the owner of the company contacted me with a follow up email asking if I had received the product I sent a message back informing her of the condition the product arrived in.  She immediately took action and sent me replacement products.  They arrive today wrapped in beautiful white pouches with satin ribbons.  A lovely attention to detail that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  Truly above and beyond what I expected.  A lovely touch!</li>
            <li> I am a 53 yr. old &#x27;girl&#x27; with olive toned skin and icky skin at best. I&#x27;ve used a very &#x27;high grade&#x27; product line for the last 4-5 years with no real results. I have the oiliest skin ever, so I am always concerned about it getting oilier. That is my number 1 issue. I just started using this line, Night &amp; Day Whisperer, hyaluronic, collagen, retinol, and vit. c serums. They DO NOT make my skin oilier, yay! I have also ordered the Vit. C toner and body oil. I used to dry brush, but want to get back into it and am looking forward to the body oil, as I have moved to a dryer area. I also am hypo-thyroid (low thyroid, ie. dry skin). One of the best things I like about these products is that they are contained in pump style containers. Every time you use the product, you get the same amount and you don&#x27;t contaminate it by having to dip your fingers in the product. I also received an email from the owner asking if I had received my products. That was cool. It was a great opportunity to ask my &#x27;detailed&#x27; questions, which were answered within an unbelievable minute. I can see some of my fine wrinkles around my eyes doing the disappearing act or atleast reducing in depth. I am so looking forward to see my face in 1, 2 and 3 months. I am very excited about this line of skin care products. I am a girly girl, and love make up and such, but I don&#x27;t mess around with taking care of my skin. I am diligent about removing my makeup nightly even if I am not sober. Sublime Products go on fast, are light and sink into your skin quickly. No weird residue and it doesn&#x27;t increase the oil in my oily skin. So far, I am completely sold on this company, their products and their customer service! And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company, I&#x27;m just a happy girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - thought I would try this serum on my lips last night, just cuz. Wow, woke up this morning with ever soft lips, smooth, I didn&#x27;t need any chapstick at bedtime. Whew, this serum worked wonders on my lips, and I thought nothing was wrong with them in the first place, boy I found out differently!s wrong with them in the first place, boy I found out differently!</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth in the morning. Really hydrating. The fine lines are really softening.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel soft not greasy.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not great.  I did not see the results this product claimed to make.  Plus, for the price there is barely any product :(</li>
            <li> In the last months I have bought many matrixyl based products but this has really made the difference to me. It has a very nice texture, absorbs very quickly and leaves the skin smooth and soft for all night. From the very first days I have seen my face magically regain shape and tone. A true must for all 35+! Paired with the collagen serum by Sublime Beauty it is simply stunning!</li>
            <li> all that I noticed :  that it plumped up my face like I was stung by a bee... for within a minimal amount of time  the wrinkles were reduced by facial swelling -  only to be momentary.  what my major concern is that it brought about pores I never knew I had and that they enlarged not only old pores that will no longer reduce but the new pores will not respond to treatment as well - .so much that they will not reduce to normal size no matter what topical treatment I provide.  -  after 2 months pores will not shrink back to normal size . now I feel I have to seek professional help to fix this problem.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with this product. It was very thick and did not go well with foundation</li>
            <li> Nice light weight product.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> This is not the first item I&#x27;ve purchased from Sublime Beauty, and it definitely won&#x27;t be the last.  This night cream goes on easily and feels like it is doing it&#x27;s thing from the start.  I like it!</li>
            <li> I have sun damaged skin and my skin is 63 years old.  There was no difference from the moment I used it, nightly, till I finished the product.  After an entire bottle I would have expected some even slight change and there was none.  I rated it two stars since it did maintain what I already had for appearance.</li>
            <li> Great product  -- Use  with Face Whisperer Argireline.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and soft. No big results yet only used just over a week.</li>
            <li> I have used this night cream for about four weeks and my skin looks and feels great. I wake up with radiant, hydrated skin every morning. My skin feels tighter and my wrinkles have diminished drastically. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way this night cream works on my face,. I am a big fan of Sublime Beauty products and I have had great results with everything I have tried. Even though I am in my late 40s, I still have sensitive skin that breaks out easily. I have used a day moisturizer for a few years, but I have always been nervous about using a moisturizer at night due to my acne problem. As I get older though, I notice more and more wrinkles, especially around my eyes and mouth, so I felt that using a moisturizer at night would be very beneficial to me. I definitely felt more comfortable trying this product, since I have not had any skin irritation using any of the Sublime Beauty products. I only have to use a small amount to cover my entire face. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. It did not leave my face greasy. My face is also not an oil slick when I get up in the morning, which is what I was worried about. I have been using this night cream for 3 weeks and it has not caused my face to break out. It actually helped heal the acne that I did have. My wrinkles have greatly diminished and my face looks very healthy and nourished. This company has great customer service too. I always receive a thank you e-mail after I order, along with a detailed description of the product. I was happy to be able to try this night cream for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I am rating the product with 4 starts but would give the customer service 5 stars.  The product is very nice a little goes a long way.  It absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling soft.  I haven&#x27;t seen the miraculous wrinkle disapearing act the way other reviewers have described but will continue to use the product and plan to reorder in the future.  Now, let&#x27;s talk about customer service.  I received an email from Kathy, the founder of the company, a few days after ordering to ensure I had received my order and all was well.  I replied and reported a tiny issue that was meant to be more of an FYI than a complalint but she went above and beyond to resolve the issue.  Her follow up and follow through demonstrated that she places a high priority on excellent customer service and that will keep me coming back time and time again.</li>
            <li> Very good night cream to put over the Retinol serum before going to bed. Made my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I turned 40 a month ago. Needless to say, I started noticing my skin has become drier, with fine lines and less elasticity, of late. I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this product at a promotional price. My skin feels much smoother, lines seem to be diminished and I love that this moisturizes my skin, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy since it contains no oil. Thanks for reading my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have been using face whisperer and all so gave some to my daughter. And we are both very pleased with our new product. Will remain a customer.</li>
            <li> Ready, really like the whisperer. To begin with, even the name makes me relaxed, when I apply that at night. Alone with the clycoloc acid I have been using for a while, my face looks relaxed, hydrated, and shutter in the morning. The whisperer cream was just the perfect addition. Already recommended that to my close friends, and will recommend that to anybody who wants to minimize pores and want to have smoother, relaxed, and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the evening as a good moisturizer over my serum and its working great</li>
            <li> I liked it, however, there was a slight smell to it I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s everything a moisturizer should be. It&#x27;s Non greasy, Absorbs quickly, has No scent. I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer has not broke me out or made my face red or blotchy.  I recommend this moisturizer as part of your daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this night cream! Goes on smooth and just a small amount is needed. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I got this product, not knowing anything about it. But well worth the money. I love the way it makes my skin feel and SHINE. Give it a TRY......you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item only to break me out in big red welts, i asked for a refund, and out of 15.99 i got back ,ten dollars, i would not recommend this product to anyone  because one why did it do that to my skin it&#x27;s still not right,,and i didn&#x27;t sell an item that did that to me i bought it and returned it and they charged me for shipping and i didn&#x27;t pay shipping for it to begin with so because i bought a product that hurt me were i have to go to a dermatologist and pay to sned it back sorry no way buyer beware</li>
            <li> I dont like to give reviews on anti aging products until I have used them for at least one month.I put the product to the test. I can now say that the quality, potency and amount of active ingredients in the night cream are incredible. In 4 weeks my skin has tightened, my wrinkles have softened (I am one of those who used to put baby oil all over my skin and bake). My eyes look more youthful and fresh, crow&#x27;s feet nearly disappeared. It was like the laugh lines around my mouth, fine-lines on my neck and cheeks packed up their bags and took a vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching and testing multiple creams and aging solutions I find this cream to be the most effective and fairly priced anti-aging treatment available. It&#x27;s a safer and much less expensive alternative to BOTOX and facelifts. I will now  recommend this product to my friends and co-workers. This cream really does deliver everything it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The founder of the company is also very nice and professional and checks in with you to make sure you received the product, have questions etc...Not alot of companies care enough to do that nowadays! Thank you Kathy!</li>
            <li> I have just begun this regime, but I am already seeing results.  My skin feels nourished, relaxed, and just healthier.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Read the description and reviews and at 52 I need to nourish my skin day and night, so happy to give it a try. This is a great quality product, not too much is needed and it glides beautifully on my skin.</li>
            <li> As a 53 year old woman, I have tried many anti wrinkle products and spent a small fortune as most woman probably have, trying to find that miracle product that promises to restore our once wrinkle free skin.  I must say, this one comes close!  I&#x27;ve been using Face Whisperer Night Cream with the Sublime Beauty Collagen Serum at night and the Face Whisperer Day Cream along with the Hyaluronic Serum for just over two weeks and the results are truly amazing.  I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and almost every product I have ever tried has broken me out, usually the first night I try the product!  Not so with Sublime Beauty.  And the results are truly amazing.  I am so thrilled with my skin; I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after I&#x27;ve been the products for a longer period of time.  What a blessing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 and Asian.  Although I have good skin to start with, I edging tell enjoy this product.  Absorbs immediately and it&#x27;s so light and my skin seems to appreciate it.  Will continue using it, and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  The next morning my skin is still feeling fresh &amp; hydrated.  Will see how it progresses after using for a while.  The seller is a treasure, highly recommend her!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give an accurate review but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.  It is an expensive product and I expected more from it right from the start, but I will continue to use it and then write a review.</li>
            <li> I am a person of few words so my reviews are short and to the point. I cannot say whether or not it does all it claims because I have not used it long enough, but for someone who uses (tries) everything under the sun, I would put this in my top ten products for gentle and non greasy face creams. And the customer service is the bomb!</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  It&#x27;s only because I have been using it for a couple of weeks I have noticed any dramatic changes but skin does feel softer.</li>
            <li> Quite a nice night cream but nothing special- I don&#x27;t look fresher, younger or more beautiful but it&#x27;s a good non-irritating and reasonably moisturising cream.</li>
            <li> A wonderful NIGHT CREAM. Your skin will look better than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrixyl 3000:&lt;br /&gt;It is known to be the most effective anti aging ingredient, for use in anti-aging creams, in the world, today. It can be applied freely, without fear on all parts of the body, because, side effects have never been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides excellent filling of the wrinkles on the forehead and around the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients have the power to improve the elasticity of your skin, and at the same time, give your skin a beautiful tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This composition rejuvenates the skin cells, by reactivating the production of collagen in the skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see there are many benefits for the skin when using Matrixyl but the ultimate judge is going to be yourself. Read the reviews of other people who have tried Matrixyl products and if you are convince then, try them on your skin and see if they are really worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing.  It is emollient without being greasy.  It is great value when compared with other night creams with similar anti-wrinkle power.  Glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> A bit thinner than I would like but does a nice job hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have been searching long and hard for a night cream.  Yes a night cream that provides adequate moisture to my skin.  This cream is it !!  Let me break it down from the top. I was fortunate to get this cream in exchange for an unbiased beauty product review.  First off it arrived on time.  The Face Whisperer cream arrived packaged inside a beautiful blue sheer case.  The actual bottle:professionally packaged and sealed in plastic.  You know it is fresh and the seller cares !  A pump style bottle with a cap to keep fresh.  It is indeed a cream and it is soothing and SO very soft when applied.  I knew instantly I would be married to this product.  No fragrance and no adverse reaction.  Left on overnight and woke up to soft skin with no dryness.  I have heard so many fabulous things about Matrixyl, this night cream has it all !</li>
            <li> This is a easy to apply cream. I previously purchased the day cream and liked it so much I had to purchase this as well! I got this at a promotional price and boy am I happy I did! This is a great night cream which leave my skin soft and ready for the next morning. I have combination to sensative skin and this gave me no breakouts or rashes.</li>
            <li> Lovely! My skin looks clear and feels smooth. Itâ€™s perfect to apply and treat skin overnight. Gives your skin a pampered and fresh experience.  Sublime beauty products are amazing. I highly recommend it. Sublime Beauty seems to really care about their customers. I received the cream to try and I am sharing my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s made a difference in my face and I use it with Day Whisperer also. They work great together. Love these two products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE using this night cream. It makes your skin feel so soft right away and it works it&#x27;s magic all night long.
