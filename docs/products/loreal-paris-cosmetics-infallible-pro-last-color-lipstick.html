            <li>Honestly, the most BEAUTIFUL COLOUR LIPSTICK THAT I&#x27;VE OWNED IN MY LIFE!!!!</li>
            <li>i wish its not that bright</li>
            <li>The color I got was teaberry and it is WAY too bright for me and</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re gorgeous</li>
            <li>It lasts through the day and is a good product.</li>
            <li>The really excellent aspect of it involves the smooth application and appearance.</li>
            <li>This was a good gloss and good lipstick.</li>
            <li>Good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really loved this color.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to have to re-apply my lipstick many times a day than to have my lips feel this crummy.</li>
            <li>The lip color lasts fairly well, and the color itself is nice, but the applicator is sub-optimal, and the application process is unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is nice and bright so make sure that is what you want!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll keep it in my rotation for sure!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>although even then, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with how the product seemed to cling more to more outer lip line.  </li>
            <li>Through out the day I went about my tidy and pick up, that evening I looked to see the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fairly durable on a night out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The lip color part just glides on, very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty amazing product and wonderful for someone on the go all day, who wants some pretty color on their lips but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about re-applying it over and over and over...nice!</li>
            <li>have very light skin and dark/gray hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for days that I want a more natural, easy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for days that I want a more natural, easy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think this relates to the problems I had with this product, as most of the time, I could NOT get an even application.  </li>
            <li>If you view my attached photos, you&#x27;ll see that immediately after I applied the product, it looks okay--</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my darker color, but I put on a bit more of this one for a darker look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about greasy hamburgers! :&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I wear mac and sleek clinique and this out beats all for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a better lip color</li>
            <li>More&#x27;s the Pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a matte lipstick fan, and glossy lips have never lasted more than 15 minutes on me.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this lipstick is that it doesn&#x27;t feather or dive into the cracks around the mouth.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick is quite an interesting product.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product, with tons of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this lipstick.</li>
            <li>, im satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>In this aspect, it looks more like a gloss.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m old-school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved how well Infallible Never Fail lasted all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an intense &#x27;berry&#x27; and bright but NOT outrageous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an intense &#x27;berry&#x27; and bright but NOT outrageous.</li>
            <li>color is super nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good news that once you get it on the way you like it, you&#x27;re good to go and it will last &#x27;till you call it quits!</li>
            <li>Now, I can abandon that nonsense and just focus on buying even MORE of this extraordinary lip product!</li>
            <li>Now, I can abandon that nonsense and just focus on buying even MORE of this extraordinary lip product!</li>
            <li>There was maybe one occasion when the lipcolor went on more smoothly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of it compares just as well to my more pricey Tom Ford &amp; Guerlain lipstick(s) except this lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see that despite use of the &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; as directed, the color has faded significantly and is even more patchy.  </li>
            <li>This lipstick comes in a dual sided tube, with one side having the wand/brush to apply the color, and the other side having the color sealer to apply to lips after 2 minutes of applying the color, for best results.</li>
            <li>but it did apply easily as well and did not take the color off with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy Peasy.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Almost too easily (see below.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smear where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing, considering how I toss and turn and even drool during the night!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really surprised and impressed by this lipstick - I am so used to spending a lot of  money on brand names at department stores that I did&#x27;n&#x27;t have high expectations for this one.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries a bit</li>
            <li>But, I find that It leaves my lips completely smooth for application.  </li>
            <li>: The color is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My lips looked dramatically wrinkled (my son said my lips looked mummified and had a good laugh) with the color very pronounced in the wrinkle lines.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it applies so easily and QUICKLY</li>
            <li>and lasted most of the day, but otherwise, my experience was pretty spotty.  </li>
            <li>The first step is to apply the lipstick, I applies it on top of my hand</li>
            <li>It left my lips feeling smooth  and good.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, the product itself is compact with one end holding the gloss and the other</li>
            <li>Keep the balm side handy and reapply frequently!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to wearing lipstick that just kind of slides around &#x27;till I can get it right that this one is a real surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Toujour Teaberry color is a great shade that I think will be pretty universally flattering</li>
            <li>This lip gloss is a nice, natural color.  </li>
            <li>The color was stunning and the lipstick did lock in for hours and didn&#x27;t fade too much even after I ate and drank.</li>
            <li>The lip color went on smoothly and easily with the large application brush.</li>
            <li>Unless you have the perfect skill of a Ninja makeup artist, you could be walking around all day with whatever your shaky hand created at dawn as you were running for the subway.</li>
            <li>I do have to say though that this one takes a bit more work and more upkeep to have it last all day</li>
            <li>A quick trip to the ladies room and</li>
            <li>Love this so much had to share cause its really worth it to try.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have super staying power.</li>
            <li>The color is true to screen (which I know can be tricky when buying a lipstick online) and is a nice, slightly bright pop of color without being HOT PINK, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I am intrigued and was impressed enough to try a different color.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and stays on.  </li>
            <li>It felt silky smooth when first applied and even after two hours, my lips still felt freshly lipsticked.  </li>
            <li>, you can really make a mistake and if you do, it&#x27;s not all that easy to correct.</li>
            <li>its like a bright glossy pink.</li>
            <li>prefer the old packaging because it was more compact.</li>
            <li>The color does not stay fresh for 24 hours like it says</li>
            <li>far as I am concerned, this is my favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not any more bother than the old lipstick&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is strange to me as so very many rave about the length of time they wear it.?  </li>
            <li>it looked freshly applied in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is pretty true to what&#x27;s on the screen.</li>
            <li>It has some of the quirks of other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried (dryness, fading, etc) but overall the best one I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>This is a reputable company and I haven&#x27;t looked up the meaning of each ingredient, but I&#x27;ve always wondered if long lasting lipsticks are good for you.  </li>
            <li>The color I received, Teaberry, was an attractive pink, although a little bright for my liking and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely a make up junkie and love to try new products.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that I notice about this lipstick is that it&#x27;s a gorgeous pastel pink color for the spring!  </li>
            <li>It really makes my face shine and brings out the blue of my eyes really nicely.  </li>
            <li>In a lighter, more natural or blush shade,  I think this might really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips continued to feel very soft and smooth, not like I was wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li>The teaberry is a very pretty rose pink, a shade I do wear &amp; love, especially for Spring.</li>
            <li>Great for us older ladies as it doesn&#x27;t bleed into our little wrinkles.</li>
            <li>started with clean lips and applied the new Toujour Teaberry to one side of my lips, and</li>
            <li>I am always interested in the idea of a long-lasting lipcolor, but this product didn&#x27;t perform so well for me in that area.  </li>
            <li>First, this product came with no instructions.  </li>
            <li>I was upset when I went to shop for more recently</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, both sides of my mouth looked exactly</li>
            <li>The lip color is still the same, and I&#x27;m glad it hasn&#x27;t disappeared from the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first applying this, it does feel a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>add the wax coating that goes on top to make it shine and last.  </li>
            <li>and this is just so pretty.  </li>
            <li>If it were a creme it would look polished and professional, instead it looks downright glittery which is nice for clubbing, not so hot if you want something more everyday.</li>
            <li>No weird smell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t, so that was the first thing I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>things first</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m usually not willing to invest that kind of time.</li>
            <li>pigment is very wet, which is nice for an all-day lip color.</li>
            <li>I could see a new display for new packaging, and hoped it would return in the same color that I loved so much.</li>
            <li>should I apply the top coat immediately, or should I allow the color to dry first?  </li>
            <li>It has a faint but very pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li>I could see how this might work better for someone else, particularly for someone with smaller lips.  </li>
            <li>It does tend to dry my lips even more.  </li>
            <li>The wand tapers and you can easily brush off the extra off the tip of the brush, so there&#x27;s no issues there</li>
            <li>find this wand applicator (step #1, so marked on the applicator) to be tricky to get right, and you&#x27;d absolutely have to use a lip liner to keep a crisp edge.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few more from Amazon last month, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really dislike this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>it is very drying, and that shows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the testers at the stores to try..</li>
            <li>I like the effect so much from my reverse order, that I see no reason to apply it, as recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the effect so much from my reverse order, that I see no reason to apply it, as recommended.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes the L&#x27;oreal lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Some color came off, but it was still very visible.  </li>
            <li>and I applied my intense moisturizing chapstick.  </li>
            <li>so I could really tests it wearing.  </li>
            <li>thought that I might have wiped off to much of the balm, so before going to sleep, I applied the lipstick to my lips, color and balm.  </li>
            <li>Now, that has the potential to be fabulous, but note the word \\&quot;Infallible\\&quot; in the name.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>When applying the lipstick, I start on my top lip at the center (the cupid&#x27;s bow) and work my way out to each of the corner&#x27;s of my lips.  </li>
            <li>applied the lipstick at nine in the morning and it lasted all day and straight through dinner.  </li>
            <li>With the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Lipstick, you don&#x27;t really need a lip liner.  </li>

            <li>With the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Lipstick, you don&#x27;t really need a lip liner.  </li>
            <li>Then the product turns very sticky and &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; before you can wipe it off and start over.</li>
            <li>Once sealed, however, it really does stay on, which is what it promises to do.</li>
            <li>However, the applicator wand is not well made, and the bottle top does not remove excess, so the product gets all over your mouth in a sad clown kind of way.</li>
            <li>I occasionally applied the sealer throughout the day to help protect the lip color, especially right before a meal, but only applied the color in the morning.</li>
            <li>The color does still rub off on napkins but the idea of it lasts throughout the day and it stays on much better than any other gloss type products I have tried.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick, Toujour Teaberry has a clear coat really that really makes it stick, and it makes it un-smearable!</li>
            <li>Will only use when going somewhere special.</li>
            <li>(I found out on my own that doing the latter DID cause the color to become sticky, although the Amazon product listing has since added instructions saying to allow the color to dry for 2 minutes before applying the color seal balm.)  </li>
            <li>24 hours later, I did still have some color on my lips (despite vigorous scrubbing), but again it was on some part of my lips and not the full lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, that goes away quickly and all I feel is what I feel with regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li>You better stand there with your mouth hanging open in a big &#x27;O&#x27; for two minutes</li>
            <li>which is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t THAT big a deal, as the gloss side is labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and the clear top coat, or &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; part is labelled &amp;#34;2.&amp;#34;  However, there was no other guidance--e.g.,</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend the color, Tea berry, like the gum of my teens,  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t rate it as high as I might have.</li>
            <li>highly recommend L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Infallible Lipstick to anyone looking to just apply your lipstick once and then forget about it.  </li>

            <li>I tried this thinking I could sure stand to use a little color to brighten up my sixtysomething</li>
            <li>Normally,  I prefer high shine with my lipstick</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the color as I am very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>She says it is really easy to apply and works like other lip gloss products.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricier than what I normally pay for</li>
            <li>normally pay from $15-$25 dollars for lipstick and the obligatory lip liner to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I normally pay from $15-$25 dollars for lipstick and the obligatory lip liner to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But I keep myself hydrated and don&#x27;t normally walk around with &amp;#34;mummified&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I say give it a try, and you&#x27;ll be able to retire the constant reapplication of lipstick all day long.</li>
            <li>Lastly, while it wears for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t look good for a long time.</li>
            <li>but it never SETS it&#x27;s just gross and sticky even with the super moisture clear balm over it.  </li>
            <li>the product is good, just a little lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Who would believe there&#x27;d be something new in lipstick?</li>
            <li>The balm comes off super fast and you are still left with over gross gummy sticky lips all damn day..</li>
            <li>They told me that Infallible Never Fail has been discontinued, and the new Pro Last version was the replacement.</li>
            <li>The colour stayed on ALL DAY, never bled, didn&#x27;t have to be re-applied and my lips are super-duper soft!</li>

            <li>When you first apply this lipstick, it will look and feel like a regular lip gloss.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a long lasting lipstick that looks really glossy and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>It is a shimmery lipstick (I sure wish there were some matte shades here!), but not so frosty as to be unappealing.</li>
            <li>I have never tried to keep on lipstick for that long, but it&#x27;s good to know that if I need to wear this lipstick for a few hours, that it will last.</li>
            <li>I expected a more glossy, sheer-shimmery pink, but at this point, I am reviewing the product quality and not the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; which looks like a clear gloss lasted about 30-60 min per application before disappearing.</li>
            <li>This really does last all day.  </li>
            <li>If I use only the gloss portion it doesn&#x27;t show up well and is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a shade of lipstick that I really like.  </li>
            <li>coloring itself is like an oil paint and once applied with the sponge brush you should let it set for at least two minutes or slightly more then</li>
            <li>/&gt;The balm was amazingly soft, like rubbing a feather over your lips.</li>
            <li>and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>One end is a soft sponge</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The moisturizer (#2), which you are supposed to wait two minutes before applying to allow #1 to set, does feel good (if slightly weird) going on.</li>
            <li>The new Pro Last performed exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>First off, the two minute dry time is no joke.</li>
            <li>After applying the finishing coat the color was less shiny and looked more dry.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer my lips less glossy, so it&#x27;s fine as is....</li>
            <li>The color is a personal preference but this one is vibrant</li>
            <li>The color does brighten up my face, even if I&#x27;m not typically a makeup-wearer.</li>
            <li>I would like to try it in a darker color just to see how long it lasts, because I really could not see, as I don&#x27;t see well, if the color rubbed off or not.  </li>
            <li>and it really does stay on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>The Never Fail formula was slightly thicker and creamier, while the new version felt thinner.</li>
            <li>I honestly forgot that this was allegedly supposed to be a Non-Smudge/Long Lasting lipstick, so when I went to blot off all the extra goo several minutes later, I was gobsmacked when the lipstick was not only SET...</li>
            <li>I do have to reapply the gloss part throughout the day but that&#x27;s because I really don&#x27;t like dry lips.</li>
            <li>As a young girl, watching these gorgeous women, I couldn&#x27;t wait until I got to the age to wear &amp;#34;all of the above.&amp;#34; Sadly, times changed and by time I WAS old enough, NONE of the above were being worn (along with abandoned bras) during the Age of Aquarius.</li>
            <li>I was curious if the new packaging and color name also meant a new formula or a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just about every single one of them tends to be really dry, flakes off (which then leaves a really gritty feel on my lips), and constantly needs to have the balm reapplied to stay somewhat smooth.  </li>
            <li>Throughout the decades, I&#x27;ve tried Lip Primers to lock in the colour, Permanent Stains that just made your lips look sad and tired, and more &amp;#34;24 Hour Lipsticks&amp;#34; than any one woman should own.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how crisp the lip line was with no bleeding, but the parts under inside the lip lines looked dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it was slightly darker than I was expecting, it was still a rich, vibrant pink that didn&#x27;t look like it was too much for an everyday color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically wear light pink lipstick.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, a long lasting lipstick means that, theoretically, you expose your body to less chemicals since you don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying or worry about &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34; it; on the other hand, I do question what kinds of special ingredients are necessary to keep the lipstick from naturally rubbing off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised that this lipstick color actually did last and didn&#x27;t come off on my glass or napkin.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised that this lipstick color actually did last and didn&#x27;t come off on my glass or napkin.</li>
            <li>However the color of this particular shade was stronger than expected.</li>
            <li>There is a very subtle gold shimmer which shows up more in the tube than on the lips.</li>
            <li>I put it on and 18+ hours, a cheesy chili lunch, cups of hot tea and coffee, pizza and beer dinner, tooth brushing, a shower, makeup remover, lots of kissing, and other lip balms being applied on top of it and it was still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last, you apply the sealant on the other side of the stick and you&#x27;re done, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Last, you apply the sealant on the other side of the stick and you&#x27;re done, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, I live in Phoenix, where it&#x27;s very, very dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I bucked the trend of going as &amp;#34;natural and unfettered as possible&amp;#34; and at least wore lipstick...which lasted all of about 20 minutes, if I was lucky.</li>
            <li>I found the first couple of times I used it, it went a tiny bit above my upper lip line and the result was sort of clownish - and it took a little work to get it off.</li>
            <li>I was able to wipe it off with my makeup remover wipes, or at least I thought it all came off, until I woke up this morning with a slight shimmer.  </li>

            <li> i wish its not that bright</li>
            <li> The color I got was teaberry and it is WAY too bright for me and</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re gorgeous</li>
            <li> It lasts through the day and is a good product.</li>
            <li> The really excellent aspect of it involves the smooth application and appearance.</li>
            <li> This was a good gloss and good lipstick.</li>
            <li> Good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really loved this color.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to have to re-apply my lipstick many times a day than to have my lips feel this crummy.</li>
            <li> The lip color lasts fairly well, and the color itself is nice, but the applicator is sub-optimal, and the application process is unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is nice and bright so make sure that is what you want!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep it in my rotation for sure!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> although even then, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with how the product seemed to cling more to more outer lip line.  </li>
            <li> Through out the day I went about my tidy and pick up, that evening I looked to see the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fairly durable on a night out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The lip color part just glides on, very easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty amazing product and wonderful for someone on the go all day, who wants some pretty color on their lips but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about re-applying it over and over and over...nice!</li>
            <li> have very light skin and dark/gray hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for days that I want a more natural, easy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I think this relates to the problems I had with this product, as most of the time, I could NOT get an even application.  </li>
            <li> If you view my attached photos, you&#x27;ll see that immediately after I applied the product, it looks okay--</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my darker color, but I put on a bit more of this one for a darker look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about greasy hamburgers! :&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I wear mac and sleek clinique and this out beats all for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a better lip color</li>
            <li> More&#x27;s the Pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a matte lipstick fan, and glossy lips have never lasted more than 15 minutes on me.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this lipstick is that it doesn&#x27;t feather or dive into the cracks around the mouth.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick is quite an interesting product.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product, with tons of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lipstick.</li>
            <li> , im satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> In this aspect, it looks more like a gloss.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m old-school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved how well Infallible Never Fail lasted all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an intense &#x27;berry&#x27; and bright but NOT outrageous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an intense &#x27;berry&#x27; and bright but NOT outrageous.</li>
            <li> color is super nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good news that once you get it on the way you like it, you&#x27;re good to go and it will last &#x27;till you call it quits!</li>
            <li> Now, I can abandon that nonsense and just focus on buying even MORE of this extraordinary lip product!</li>
            <li> Now, I can abandon that nonsense and just focus on buying even MORE of this extraordinary lip product!</li>
            <li> There was maybe one occasion when the lipcolor went on more smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of it compares just as well to my more pricey Tom Ford &amp; Guerlain lipstick(s) except this lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see that despite use of the &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; as directed, the color has faded significantly and is even more patchy.  </li>
            <li> This lipstick comes in a dual sided tube, with one side having the wand/brush to apply the color, and the other side having the color sealer to apply to lips after 2 minutes of applying the color, for best results.</li>
            <li> but it did apply easily as well and did not take the color off with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Easy Peasy.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is really easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Almost too easily (see below.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smear where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty amazing, considering how I toss and turn and even drool during the night!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really surprised and impressed by this lipstick - I am so used to spending a lot of  money on brand names at department stores that I did&#x27;n&#x27;t have high expectations for this one.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries a bit</li>
            <li> But, I find that It leaves my lips completely smooth for application.  </li>
            <li> : The color is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My lips looked dramatically wrinkled (my son said my lips looked mummified and had a good laugh) with the color very pronounced in the wrinkle lines.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it applies so easily and QUICKLY</li>
            <li> and lasted most of the day, but otherwise, my experience was pretty spotty.  </li>
            <li> The first step is to apply the lipstick, I applies it on top of my hand</li>
            <li> It left my lips feeling smooth  and good.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, the product itself is compact with one end holding the gloss and the other</li>
            <li> Keep the balm side handy and reapply frequently!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to wearing lipstick that just kind of slides around &#x27;till I can get it right that this one is a real surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Toujour Teaberry color is a great shade that I think will be pretty universally flattering</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is a nice, natural color.  </li>
            <li> The color was stunning and the lipstick did lock in for hours and didn&#x27;t fade too much even after I ate and drank.</li>
            <li> The lip color went on smoothly and easily with the large application brush.</li>
            <li> Unless you have the perfect skill of a Ninja makeup artist, you could be walking around all day with whatever your shaky hand created at dawn as you were running for the subway.</li>
            <li> I do have to say though that this one takes a bit more work and more upkeep to have it last all day</li>
            <li> A quick trip to the ladies room and</li>
            <li> Love this so much had to share cause its really worth it to try.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have super staying power.</li>
            <li> The color is true to screen (which I know can be tricky when buying a lipstick online) and is a nice, slightly bright pop of color without being HOT PINK, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I am intrigued and was impressed enough to try a different color.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty and stays on.  </li>
            <li> It felt silky smooth when first applied and even after two hours, my lips still felt freshly lipsticked.  </li>
            <li> , you can really make a mistake and if you do, it&#x27;s not all that easy to correct.</li>
            <li> its like a bright glossy pink.</li>
            <li> prefer the old packaging because it was more compact.</li>
            <li> The color does not stay fresh for 24 hours like it says</li>
            <li> far as I am concerned, this is my favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not any more bother than the old lipstick&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is strange to me as so very many rave about the length of time they wear it.?  </li>
            <li> it looked freshly applied in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is pretty true to what&#x27;s on the screen.</li>
            <li> It has some of the quirks of other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried (dryness, fading, etc) but overall the best one I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This is a reputable company and I haven&#x27;t looked up the meaning of each ingredient, but I&#x27;ve always wondered if long lasting lipsticks are good for you.  </li>
            <li> The color I received, Teaberry, was an attractive pink, although a little bright for my liking and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely a make up junkie and love to try new products.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that I notice about this lipstick is that it&#x27;s a gorgeous pastel pink color for the spring!  </li>
            <li> It really makes my face shine and brings out the blue of my eyes really nicely.  </li>
            <li> In a lighter, more natural or blush shade,  I think this might really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips continued to feel very soft and smooth, not like I was wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li> The teaberry is a very pretty rose pink, a shade I do wear &amp; love, especially for Spring.</li>
            <li> Great for us older ladies as it doesn&#x27;t bleed into our little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> started with clean lips and applied the new Toujour Teaberry to one side of my lips, and</li>
            <li> I am always interested in the idea of a long-lasting lipcolor, but this product didn&#x27;t perform so well for me in that area.  </li>
            <li> First, this product came with no instructions.  </li>
            <li> I was upset when I went to shop for more recently</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, both sides of my mouth looked exactly</li>
            <li> The lip color is still the same, and I&#x27;m glad it hasn&#x27;t disappeared from the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After first applying this, it does feel a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> add the wax coating that goes on top to make it shine and last.  </li>
            <li> and this is just so pretty.  </li>
            <li> If it were a creme it would look polished and professional, instead it looks downright glittery which is nice for clubbing, not so hot if you want something more everyday.</li>
            <li> No weird smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t, so that was the first thing I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> things first</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m usually not willing to invest that kind of time.</li>
            <li> pigment is very wet, which is nice for an all-day lip color.</li>
            <li> I could see a new display for new packaging, and hoped it would return in the same color that I loved so much.</li>
            <li> should I apply the top coat immediately, or should I allow the color to dry first?  </li>
            <li> It has a faint but very pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li> I could see how this might work better for someone else, particularly for someone with smaller lips.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to dry my lips even more.  </li>
            <li> The wand tapers and you can easily brush off the extra off the tip of the brush, so there&#x27;s no issues there</li>
            <li> find this wand applicator (step #1, so marked on the applicator) to be tricky to get right, and you&#x27;d absolutely have to use a lip liner to keep a crisp edge.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few more from Amazon last month, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really dislike this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> it is very drying, and that shows.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the testers at the stores to try..</li>
            <li> I like the effect so much from my reverse order, that I see no reason to apply it, as recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the effect so much from my reverse order, that I see no reason to apply it, as recommended.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes the L&#x27;oreal lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Some color came off, but it was still very visible.  </li>
            <li> and I applied my intense moisturizing chapstick.  </li>
            <li> so I could really tests it wearing.  </li>
            <li> thought that I might have wiped off to much of the balm, so before going to sleep, I applied the lipstick to my lips, color and balm.  </li>
            <li> Now, that has the potential to be fabulous, but note the word \\&quot;Infallible\\&quot; in the name.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> When applying the lipstick, I start on my top lip at the center (the cupid&#x27;s bow) and work my way out to each of the corner&#x27;s of my lips.  </li>
            <li> applied the lipstick at nine in the morning and it lasted all day and straight through dinner.  </li>
            <li> With the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Lipstick, you don&#x27;t really need a lip liner.  </li>

            <li> With the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Lipstick, you don&#x27;t really need a lip liner.  </li>
            <li> Then the product turns very sticky and &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; before you can wipe it off and start over.</li>
            <li> Once sealed, however, it really does stay on, which is what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> However, the applicator wand is not well made, and the bottle top does not remove excess, so the product gets all over your mouth in a sad clown kind of way.</li>
            <li> I occasionally applied the sealer throughout the day to help protect the lip color, especially right before a meal, but only applied the color in the morning.</li>
            <li> The color does still rub off on napkins but the idea of it lasts throughout the day and it stays on much better than any other gloss type products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick, Toujour Teaberry has a clear coat really that really makes it stick, and it makes it un-smearable!</li>
            <li> Will only use when going somewhere special.</li>
            <li> (I found out on my own that doing the latter DID cause the color to become sticky, although the Amazon product listing has since added instructions saying to allow the color to dry for 2 minutes before applying the color seal balm.)  </li>
            <li> 24 hours later, I did still have some color on my lips (despite vigorous scrubbing), but again it was on some part of my lips and not the full lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, that goes away quickly and all I feel is what I feel with regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li> You better stand there with your mouth hanging open in a big &#x27;O&#x27; for two minutes</li>
            <li> which is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.  </li>
            <li> is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t THAT big a deal, as the gloss side is labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and the clear top coat, or &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; part is labelled &amp;#34;2.&amp;#34;  However, there was no other guidance--e.g.,</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend the color, Tea berry, like the gum of my teens,  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t rate it as high as I might have.</li>
            <li> highly recommend L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Infallible Lipstick to anyone looking to just apply your lipstick once and then forget about it.  </li>

            <li> I tried this thinking I could sure stand to use a little color to brighten up my sixtysomething</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the color as I am very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> She says it is really easy to apply and works like other lip gloss products.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricier than what I normally pay for</li>
            <li> normally pay from $15-$25 dollars for lipstick and the obligatory lip liner to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> But I keep myself hydrated and don&#x27;t normally walk around with &amp;#34;mummified&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I say give it a try, and you&#x27;ll be able to retire the constant reapplication of lipstick all day long.</li>
            <li> Lastly, while it wears for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t look good for a long time.</li>
            <li> but it never SETS it&#x27;s just gross and sticky even with the super moisture clear balm over it.  </li>
            <li> the product is good, just a little lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Who would believe there&#x27;d be something new in lipstick?</li>
            <li> The balm comes off super fast and you are still left with over gross gummy sticky lips all damn day..</li>
            <li> They told me that Infallible Never Fail has been discontinued, and the new Pro Last version was the replacement.</li>
            <li> The colour stayed on ALL DAY, never bled, didn&#x27;t have to be re-applied and my lips are super-duper soft!</li>

            <li> First, the color is not lasting all day.</li>
            <li> When you first apply this lipstick, it will look and feel like a regular lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> With my dark hair and blue eyes it is stunning to behold</li>
            <li> With my dark hair and blue eyes it is stunning to behold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting lipstick that looks really glossy and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> It is a shimmery lipstick (I sure wish there were some matte shades here!), but not so frosty as to be unappealing.</li>
            <li> I have never tried to keep on lipstick for that long, but it&#x27;s good to know that if I need to wear this lipstick for a few hours, that it will last.</li>
            <li> I expected a more glossy, sheer-shimmery pink, but at this point, I am reviewing the product quality and not the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; which looks like a clear gloss lasted about 30-60 min per application before disappearing.</li>
            <li> This really does last all day.  </li>
            <li> If I use only the gloss portion it doesn&#x27;t show up well and is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a shade of lipstick that I really like.  </li>
            <li> coloring itself is like an oil paint and once applied with the sponge brush you should let it set for at least two minutes or slightly more then</li>
            <li> /&gt;The balm was amazingly soft, like rubbing a feather over your lips.</li>
            <li> and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> One end is a soft sponge</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The moisturizer (#2), which you are supposed to wait two minutes before applying to allow #1 to set, does feel good (if slightly weird) going on.</li>
            <li> The new Pro Last performed exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> First off, the two minute dry time is no joke.</li>
            <li> After applying the finishing coat the color was less shiny and looked more dry.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer my lips less glossy, so it&#x27;s fine as is....</li>
            <li> The color is a personal preference but this one is vibrant</li>
            <li> The color does brighten up my face, even if I&#x27;m not typically a makeup-wearer.</li>
            <li> I would like to try it in a darker color just to see how long it lasts, because I really could not see, as I don&#x27;t see well, if the color rubbed off or not.  </li>
            <li> and it really does stay on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> The Never Fail formula was slightly thicker and creamier, while the new version felt thinner.</li>
            <li> I honestly forgot that this was allegedly supposed to be a Non-Smudge/Long Lasting lipstick, so when I went to blot off all the extra goo several minutes later, I was gobsmacked when the lipstick was not only SET...</li>
            <li> I do have to reapply the gloss part throughout the day but that&#x27;s because I really don&#x27;t like dry lips.</li>
            <li> As a young girl, watching these gorgeous women, I couldn&#x27;t wait until I got to the age to wear &amp;#34;all of the above.&amp;#34; Sadly, times changed and by time I WAS old enough, NONE of the above were being worn (along with abandoned bras) during the Age of Aquarius.</li>
            <li> I was curious if the new packaging and color name also meant a new formula or a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just about every single one of them tends to be really dry, flakes off (which then leaves a really gritty feel on my lips), and constantly needs to have the balm reapplied to stay somewhat smooth.  </li>
            <li> Throughout the decades, I&#x27;ve tried Lip Primers to lock in the colour, Permanent Stains that just made your lips look sad and tired, and more &amp;#34;24 Hour Lipsticks&amp;#34; than any one woman should own.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how crisp the lip line was with no bleeding, but the parts under inside the lip lines looked dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it was slightly darker than I was expecting, it was still a rich, vibrant pink that didn&#x27;t look like it was too much for an everyday color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear light pink lipstick.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, a long lasting lipstick means that, theoretically, you expose your body to less chemicals since you don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying or worry about &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34; it; on the other hand, I do question what kinds of special ingredients are necessary to keep the lipstick from naturally rubbing off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised that this lipstick color actually did last and didn&#x27;t come off on my glass or napkin.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised that this lipstick color actually did last and didn&#x27;t come off on my glass or napkin.</li>
            <li> However the color of this particular shade was stronger than expected.</li>
            <li> There is a very subtle gold shimmer which shows up more in the tube than on the lips.</li>
            <li> I put it on and 18+ hours, a cheesy chili lunch, cups of hot tea and coffee, pizza and beer dinner, tooth brushing, a shower, makeup remover, lots of kissing, and other lip balms being applied on top of it and it was still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last, you apply the sealant on the other side of the stick and you&#x27;re done, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Last, you apply the sealant on the other side of the stick and you&#x27;re done, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, I live in Phoenix, where it&#x27;s very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I bucked the trend of going as &amp;#34;natural and unfettered as possible&amp;#34; and at least wore lipstick...which lasted all of about 20 minutes, if I was lucky.</li>
            <li> I found the first couple of times I used it, it went a tiny bit above my upper lip line and the result was sort of clownish - and it took a little work to get it off.</li>
            <li> I was able to wipe it off with my makeup remover wipes, or at least I thought it all came off, until I woke up this morning with a slight shimmer.  </li>
            <li> The lip stick has a creamy moisture texture, not greasy, It did take a long time to dry, finally when it set,  I applied the second step of the clear lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> I like light pink, and I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bees for a frosty pink look.  </li>
            <li> my old Teaberry to the other side.</li>
            <li> The second picture I posted was taken only about THREE hours later and after a SINGLE meal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to wait approximately two minutes or until the lipstick is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I saw the Infallible Pro Last in Teaberry Toujour, I wrote the company to ask how it compared to the version I&#x27;ve been using for so long.</li>
            <li> Yet it lasted long enough for me (8-10 hr.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Loreal Infallible in the other packaging (Never Fail), in Teaberry shade, for a few years.</li>
            <li> I can eat, drink, chew on my lips, touch them with my hands, wipe them with a napkin - all the normal everyday things I might do, and the color stays on.  </li>
            <li> Second, I don&#x27;t care for the applicator, it gave a sloppy edge that I had to fix quickly.</li>
            <li> Personally, I still like to apply the balm a couple of times during the day to keep my lips shiny and not too dry.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I still like to apply the balm a couple of times during the day to keep my lips shiny and not too dry.  </li>
            <li> With the right colour and apply thin and evenly it will last all day and yes the shine will go away</li>
            <li> And while it didn&#x27;t last 24 hours, it was still longer lasting than any other lipstick/lip gloss that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - I am a long time user of L&#x27;Oreal (and Lancome) products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a few shades darker than my natural lip color and would work for day or night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But two minutes is a long, long time to wait to finish applying one&#x27;s lipstick.</li>
            <li> Once you apply this according to the directions, be aware that it will look virtually the same at the end of the day, and probably lasting &#x27;till the next morning unless you eat an entire bucket of fried chicken.</li>
            <li> You put on the color let it dry then put on the gloss</li>
            <li> My lips are not chapped or dry before I put this product on.</li>
            <li> dry, stains lips and doesn&#x27;t come off...</li>
            <li> They are overly dry and still have some shimmer on them.  </li>
            <li> Before bed, my lips felt horribly dry</li>
            <li> I generally find cosmetics ordered online to be a little lighter than pictured</li>
            <li> As I stated above, when I woke-up I still had a slight shimmer.  </li>
            <li> After about 6 hours I noticed it was looking cracked and very dry giving my lips an aged look</li>
            <li> I applied about 5 hours ago and after eating lunch, I&#x27;m starting to get that faded look in the middle (which makes it look like I have a very thick lip liner situation going on), and since I left it at home, I&#x27;m using tinted chapstick to balance it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this lipstick and this same color for a few years, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> But, I know when I wear this, I don&#x27;t need to be so careful about what I do with my mouth or worry about it smearing or needing to touch it</li>
            <li> It looked like a shimmery pink lipgloss, something I&#x27;d never wear.</li>
            <li> When it dried it left a stain to your lips and you reapplied the chap stick.  </li>
            <li> You also have to be careful not to do anything to wipe off the lipstick (don&#x27;t blot, as my mother taught me to do) until you can seal it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure what I did differently!)</li>
            <li> The other packaging had two tubes side by side in a slide-out silver container.</li>
            <li> , then you switch to the other side of the wand where a lip balm is located.</li>
            <li> The lipstick went on like every other lipstick that I&#x27;ve ever applied from a tube: ooey and gooey.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers....</li>
            <li> On one end, you have the lipstick, and on the other, the lip balm that &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in the color.</li>
            <li> then other end a chap stick type end.</li>
            <li> Wait about a minute to apply the &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; that&#x27;s on the other end</li>
            <li> I usually have the same problem with these types of lipsticks.</li>
            <li> But the shine only lasts for a few minutes before all the color drys up in to little bits all over my lips and also drys my lips up.</li>
            <li> With other products the lip color has dried out my lips almost immediately or it comes off the moment I finish applying it.</li>
            <li> After I waited about half an hour, I tried blotting my lips on a piece of paper and nothing came off.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t reapply it because I didn&#x27;t have any color on my lips, because I did, but rather because it was slightly faded</li>
            <li> At this price point, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the quality that comes with this long lasting lipstick!ch</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am always interested in the idea of a long-lasting lipcolor, but this product didn&#x27;t perform so well for me in that area.  First, this product came with no instructions.  This wasn&#x27;t THAT big a deal, as the gloss side is labeled &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and the clear top coat, or &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; part is labelled &amp;#34;2.&amp;#34;  However, there was no other guidance--e.g., should I apply the top coat immediately, or should I allow the color to dry first?  (I found out on my own that doing the latter DID cause the color to become sticky, although the Amazon product listing has since added instructions saying to allow the color to dry for 2 minutes before applying the color seal balm.)  The color I received, Teaberry, was an attractive pink, although a little bright for my liking and very pigmented.  I think this relates to the problems I had with this product, as most of the time, I could NOT get an even application.  If you view my attached photos, you&#x27;ll see that immediately after I applied the product, it looks okay--although even then, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with how the product seemed to cling more to more outer lip line.  The second picture I posted was taken only about THREE hours later and after a SINGLE meal.  You&#x27;ll see that despite use of the &amp;#34;color seal balm&amp;#34; as directed, the color has faded significantly and is even more patchy.  This was my usual experience with this product.  There was maybe one occasion when the lipcolor went on more smoothly (I&#x27;m not sure what I did differently!) and lasted most of the day, but otherwise, my experience was pretty spotty.  I could see how this might work better for someone else, particularly for someone with smaller lips.  However, the product was not for me, and I would not recommend or repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Loreal Infallible in the other packaging (Never Fail), in Teaberry shade, for a few years. The other packaging had two tubes side by side in a slide-out silver container. I was upset when I went to shop for more recently and none of the local stores carried it anymore. I could see a new display for new packaging, and hoped it would return in the same color that I loved so much. I ordered a few more from Amazon last month, just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Infallible Pro Last in Teaberry Toujour, I wrote the company to ask how it compared to the version I&#x27;ve been using for so long. They told me that Infallible Never Fail has been discontinued, and the new Pro Last version was the replacement. I was curious if the new packaging and color name also meant a new formula or a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with clean lips and applied the new Toujour Teaberry to one side of my lips, and my old Teaberry to the other side. The color looked identical to me. The consistency of each was slightly different. The Never Fail formula was slightly thicker and creamier, while the new version felt thinner. However, the results looked identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved how well Infallible Never Fail lasted all day. I occasionally applied the sealer throughout the day to help protect the lip color, especially right before a meal, but only applied the color in the morning. The new Pro Last performed exactly the same way. At the end of the day, both sides of my mouth looked exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the old packaging because it was more compact. The lip color is still the same, and I&#x27;m glad it hasn&#x27;t disappeared from the market. I&#x27;ve been wearing this lipstick and this same color for a few years, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> You put on the color let it dry then put on the gloss and it lasts and last, I have to reapply the gloss but not the color. Great for us older ladies as it doesn&#x27;t bleed into our little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry my lips even more.  Will only use when going somewhere special.</li>
            <li> This really does last all day.  The color is very pretty and stays on.  I can eat, drink, chew on my lips, touch them with my hands, wipe them with a napkin - all the normal everyday things I might do, and the color stays on.  I don&#x27;t need to re-apply the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first applying this, it does feel a bit sticky.  But, that goes away quickly and all I feel is what I feel with regular lipstick.  But, I know when I wear this, I don&#x27;t need to be so careful about what I do with my mouth or worry about it smearing or needing to touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazing product and wonderful for someone on the go all day, who wants some pretty color on their lips but doesn&#x27;t want to worry about re-applying it over and over and over...nice!</li>
            <li> I love lipsticks and I am always on the look out for the perfect lip stick. I will admit that I often forget to reapply it throughout the day so having something that will keep the color on my lips all day is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one fits the bill. I do have to reapply the gloss part throughout the day but that&#x27;s because I really don&#x27;t like dry lips. The color does not stay fresh for 24 hours like it says BUT I did have a tint left on my lips the next morning after I woke up. It needed reapplying then but it lasted through everything. What I like is that it does not leave a stain on your glassware after drinking a cup of water/wine/juice. It stays on your lips, not on the glass. It does stay on while you&#x27;re eating and it does stay on when your husband kisses you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned, this is my favorite lipstick. It is a bit pricier than what I normally pay for but I&#x27;ll take it any day. I just love it. And even better, it does not have that weird scent like a lot of lipsticks or gloss have. It has a faint but very pleasant scent to it. It won&#x27;t drive you crazy all day trying to hide that unpleasant scents that some lipsticks have. That is a bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this stuff. It&#x27;s just about the same color as my lips so I need the shine factor for it to be visible. But the shine only lasts for a few minutes before all the color drys up in to little bits all over my lips and also drys my lips up. My lips are not chapped or dry before I put this product on. If I use only the gloss portion it doesn&#x27;t show up well and is very sticky. I would not buy this at all.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is neat, and it has a formula to make it last for 24 hours without fading or bleeding. I have never tried to keep on lipstick for that long, but it&#x27;s good to know that if I need to wear this lipstick for a few hours, that it will last. However I thought that the color would be lighter, since I prefer light/natural shades/colors when I wear lipstick. However the color of this particular shade was stronger than expected. The color shade I received was &amp;#34;Toujour Teaberry&amp;#34;. This lipstick comes in a dual sided tube, with one side having the wand/brush to apply the color, and the other side having the color sealer to apply to lips after 2 minutes of applying the color, for best results. This is a lipstick I&#x27;ll probably wear on some occasions.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a shade of lipstick that I really like.  I received the Teaberry color and it&#x27;s so close to what I use to buy from Avon that I am on cloud nine.  I do have to say though that this one takes a bit more work and more upkeep to have it last all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coloring itself is like an oil paint and once applied with the sponge brush you should let it set for at least two minutes or slightly more then add the wax coating that goes on top to make it shine and last.  You will need to reapply the wax if you have something to drink or eat or just periodically during the day but that&#x27;s not any more bother than the old lipstick&#x27;s.  A quick trip to the ladies room and wa laa you&#x27;re gorgeous again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin and dark/gray hair and this is just so pretty.  It really makes my face shine and brings out the blue of my eyes really nicely.  I will keep on using this for awhile just to see how things go.  Oh and to get the lip color off you will need an oil base makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is a nice, natural color.  One can hardly notice I have it on.  It goes on smooth and dries a bit, then you switch to the other side of the wand where a lip balm is located. Works very well.  I would like to try it in a darker color just to see how long it lasts, because I really could not see, as I don&#x27;t see well, if the color rubbed off or not.  I will try that experiment and get back with you on the results.  I like light pink, and I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bees for a frosty pink look.  Please check back. The lip balm is the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my darker color, but I put on a bit more of this one for a darker look.  It stayed on all day and night!  In the morning it was hugging my left-top lip. ( You might want to reapply again for a fresher look maybe late afternoon, evening. ) One caveat - if you don&#x27;t keep reapplying your lip balm it is very drying, and that shows.  However, the lip balm is verrry soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side benefit is that I wasn&#x27;t picking at my lips all day as I&#x27;ve got a habit to do.  I still like my Burt&#x27;s Bees and mint chapstick for the morning, and every day I go without lipstick and make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can count on this lipstick to stay on when you eat.  I don&#x27;t know about greasy hamburgers! :&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for long-lasting color.</li>
            <li> dry, stains lips and doesn&#x27;t come off... i know that&#x27;s the point but it never SETS it&#x27;s just gross and sticky even with the super moisture clear balm over it.  The balm comes off super fast and you are still left with over gross gummy sticky lips all damn day.. even after you have scrubbed it off once. Go get Stila - that is stuff you can count on.</li>
            <li> This infallible lipstick 24 hour wear is amazing best thing ever came into the makeup industry will change how you think about lipstick. I wear mac and sleek clinique and this out beats all for sure. With the right colour and apply thin and evenly it will last all day and yes the shine will go away but u can use any lip gloss or Vaseline to keep the shiny through the day. Love this so much had to share cause its really worth it to try. Thanks for the testers at the stores to try.. please dont discontinue this product</li>
            <li> the product is good, just a little lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a better lip color so when this one came up for review I decided to request it. With other products the lip color has dried out my lips almost immediately or it comes off the moment I finish applying it. The lip color went on smoothly and easily with the large application brush. I was skeptical about adding the finishing coat but it did apply easily as well and did not take the color off with it. After applying the finishing coat the color was less shiny and looked more dry. It does not come off should I rub my lips together or when I drink from my water bottle. The color does still rub off on napkins but the idea of it lasts throughout the day and it stays on much better than any other gloss type products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the day and age when &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; wore hats, gloves and lipstick. As a young girl, watching these gorgeous women, I couldn&#x27;t wait until I got to the age to wear &amp;#34;all of the above.&amp;#34; Sadly, times changed and by time I WAS old enough, NONE of the above were being worn (along with abandoned bras) during the Age of Aquarius. More&#x27;s the Pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bucked the trend of going as &amp;#34;natural and unfettered as possible&amp;#34; and at least wore lipstick...which lasted all of about 20 minutes, if I was lucky. Throughout the decades, I&#x27;ve tried Lip Primers to lock in the colour, Permanent Stains that just made your lips look sad and tired, and more &amp;#34;24 Hour Lipsticks&amp;#34; than any one woman should own. At best, a product was used for a while and then tossed; at worst, it was used twice and then tossed. I simply gave up and kept my lipstick in a pocket so that I could apply it 5-10 times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris Infallible Pro-Last Color. It was affordable enough, coming in at the mid-zone between Dollar Store and MAC lipstick, which is what I&#x27;ve settled upon. I was sent the &amp;#34;Toujour Teaberry&amp;#34; colour as a sample. When my sample arrived, it was simply shipped in an envelope and wrapped in bubble wrap...no instructions except for a mysterious #1 and #2 on the tube. Having NO instructions and having NO clue on how to apply it, I ended up accidentally REVERSING the recommended order and applied the balm 1st and then went over it with the lipstick. In my defense, I got the package from my post office on the way to work. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm was amazingly soft, like rubbing a feather over your lips. The lipstick went on like every other lipstick that I&#x27;ve ever applied from a tube: ooey and gooey. I honestly forgot that this was allegedly supposed to be a Non-Smudge/Long Lasting lipstick, so when I went to blot off all the extra goo several minutes later, I was gobsmacked when the lipstick was not only SET...but NOTHING came off on the tissue!!!! It wasn&#x27;t until after work, when I could get back to the Amazon product page, that I could read the instructions for the order of applying the lipsticks but also noted that it was, indeed, non-smudge and all day. I like the effect so much from my reverse order, that I see no reason to apply it, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ladies...it IS  All Darn Day Lipstick!!!! My job is a sales person for a garden center, which means that for at least 8 hours a day, I am talking and flapping my lips. The colour stayed on ALL DAY, never bled, didn&#x27;t have to be re-applied and my lips are super-duper soft! And the colour that I was sent (Toujour Teaberry)? Honestly, the most BEAUTIFUL COLOUR LIPSTICK THAT I&#x27;VE OWNED IN MY LIFE!!!! It&#x27;s like an intense &#x27;berry&#x27; and bright but NOT outrageous. With my dark hair and blue eyes it is stunning to behold and I just couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally pay from $15-$25 dollars for lipstick and the obligatory lip liner to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the lipstick. Now, I can abandon that nonsense and just focus on buying even MORE of this extraordinary lip product! I am hoping and praying that I can find this at my local mall so that I can try the colours against my skin rather than gambling on another perfect shade from online. But, if I can&#x27;t locate it at a store, I&#x27;ll just continue to order the shade I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal...PLEASE continue to carry this amazing product! Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;improve it&amp;#34;! Don&#x27;t retire it! Just keep making your ladies happy by offering it for decades to come! :D!

            <li> My wife really likes the L&#x27;oreal lip gloss. This color looks great on her as well. She says it is really easy to apply and works like other lip gloss products. The one thing that is different is that it has a gloss that goes over the color to help maintain the shine and the moisturizer.  It lasts through the day and is a good product.</li>
            <li> It lasts alright.  It has been 16 hours since I have applied it and my lips feel as if I applied fingernail polish to them, not that I know what that feels like, but it&#x27;s not a good feeling.  They are overly dry and still have some shimmer on them.  I applied this as directed 16 hours ago.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the color as I am very fair skinned.  I don&#x27;t typically wear light pink lipstick.  I expected a more glossy, sheer-shimmery pink, but at this point, I am reviewing the product quality and not the color.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to apply.  The container shows the steps by marking the color with a 1 and the sealer with a 2.  Easy Peasy.  It felt silky smooth when first applied and even after two hours, my lips still felt freshly lipsticked.  Unfortunately, I went to look in the mirror and my lips looked like I had applied lipstick to dried prunes.  My lips looked dramatically wrinkled (my son said my lips looked mummified and had a good laugh) with the color very pronounced in the wrinkle lines.  I&#x27;m 42, and I don&#x27;t consider my lips wrinkly.  Yes, I&#x27;m not a twenty-something.  Yes, I live in Phoenix, where it&#x27;s very, very dry.  But I keep myself hydrated and don&#x27;t normally walk around with &amp;#34;mummified&amp;#34; lips.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to wipe it off with a Kleenex.  Some color came off, but it was still very visible.  I was able to wipe it off with my makeup remover wipes, or at least I thought it all came off, until I woke up this morning with a slight shimmer.  Before bed, my lips felt horribly dry and I applied my intense moisturizing chapstick.  As I stated above, when I woke-up I still had a slight shimmer.  Unfortunately, my lips feel awful and they need heavy duty moisturizing, not a good feeling.  I would never apply this product again.  I am happy to have to re-apply my lipstick many times a day than to have my lips feel this crummy.</li>
            <li> How disappointed I was when I received this lipstick! It looked like a shimmery pink lipgloss, something I&#x27;d never wear. I&#x27;m a matte lipstick fan, and glossy lips have never lasted more than 15 minutes on me. Yet I was wrong (!) and pleasantly surprised. This isn&#x27;t a lipgloss at all! It&#x27;s simply packaged like it is. It&#x27;s a long lasting lipstick that looks really glossy and fresh for hours. I agree with the other reviewers....it doesn&#x27;t have super staying power. Yet it lasted long enough for me (8-10 hr.) and that&#x27;s impressive. What I love most about this lipstick is that it doesn&#x27;t feather or dive into the cracks around the mouth. At all. Ever. It is a shimmery lipstick (I sure wish there were some matte shades here!), but not so frosty as to be unappealing. I used my usual Elizabeth Arden lip pencil underneath before applying, and that stayed all day too. My lips continued to feel very soft and smooth, not like I was wearing lipstick. The &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; which looks like a clear gloss lasted about 30-60 min per application before disappearing. I actually prefer my lips less glossy, so it&#x27;s fine as is....as the day wears on. The teaberry is a very pretty rose pink, a shade I do wear &amp; love, especially for Spring. There is a very subtle gold shimmer which shows up more in the tube than on the lips. I will be back for the Cherry Noir &amp; Raisin colors (yes!) since this lipstick doesn&#x27;t feather, I can&#x27;t wait to try some darker colors. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of it compares just as well to my more pricey Tom Ford &amp; Guerlain lipstick(s) except this lasts so much longer. This is an impressive lipstick, one I will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, the product itself is compact with one end holding the gloss and the other end the lipstick.  The first step is to apply the lipstick, I applies it on top of my hand so I could really tests it wearing.  The lip stick has a creamy moisture texture, not greasy, It did take a long time to dry, finally when it set,  I applied the second step of the clear lip gloss.  I do not like the look of greasy lip balm, so I blotted it to take a little off.  Through out the day I went about my tidy and pick up, that evening I looked to see the results.  Gone, could not tell even where it had been.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I might have wiped off to much of the balm, so before going to sleep, I applied the lipstick to my lips, color and balm.  In the morning...gone....I cannot think why this does not work on my skin?  This is strange to me as so very many rave about the length of time they wear it.?  I can highly recommend the color, Tea berry, like the gum of my teens,  But, to purchase again, yes as I like the color and expect nothing else as the product has a creamy moisture but on me, like a regular lipstick.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick is quite an interesting product. Who would believe there&#x27;d be something new in lipstick? The really excellent aspect of it involves the smooth application and appearance. The warning involves the fact that this stuff stays on... and on... and on..., etc. Once you apply this according to the directions, be aware that it will look virtually the same at the end of the day, and probably lasting &#x27;till the next morning unless you eat an entire bucket of fried chicken. Now, that has the potential to be fabulous, but note the word \\&quot;Infallible\\&quot; in the name. Unless you have the perfect skill of a Ninja makeup artist, you could be walking around all day with whatever your shaky hand created at dawn as you were running for the subway. I&#x27;m so used to wearing lipstick that just kind of slides around &#x27;till I can get it right that this one is a real surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news that once you get it on the way you like it, you&#x27;re good to go and it will last &#x27;till you call it quits! This is an interesting product, with tons of colors to choose from. I say give it a try, and you&#x27;ll be able to retire the constant reapplication of lipstick all day long. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lipstick. On one end, you have the lipstick, and on the other, the lip balm that &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in the color. I applied it on in the morning, and after lunch, my lips still shimmered.  After dinner, however, it started to flake a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is long-lasting, but my big concern is the amount of chemicals listed to make this product.  The sheer number of unpronounceable chemicals that L&#x27;Oreal lists is unnerving.  This is a reputable company and I haven&#x27;t looked up the meaning of each ingredient, but I&#x27;ve always wondered if long lasting lipsticks are good for you.  On the positive side, a long lasting lipstick means that, theoretically, you expose your body to less chemicals since you don&#x27;t have to keep re-applying or worry about &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34; it; on the other hand, I do question what kinds of special ingredients are necessary to keep the lipstick from naturally rubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product and I will continue to use it, but these concerns are always on my mind and I thought I&#x27;d just share them.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and bright so make sure that is what you want! The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick, Toujour Teaberry has a clear coat really that really makes it stick, and it makes it un-smearable!</li>
            <li> A long-lasting lipstick product is a treasure every makeup enthusiast should have in her bag and if you&#x27;re looking for one that last all day this is definitely it. I put it on and 18+ hours, a cheesy chili lunch, cups of hot tea and coffee, pizza and beer dinner, tooth brushing, a shower, makeup remover, lots of kissing, and other lip balms being applied on top of it and it was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the flaw? There&#x27;re a few and that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t rate it as high as I might have. First off, the two minute dry time is no joke. You better stand there with your mouth hanging open in a big &#x27;O&#x27; for two minutes or they will get tarred together. Second, I don&#x27;t care for the applicator, it gave a sloppy edge that I had to fix quickly. Lastly, while it wears for a long time, it doesn&#x27;t look good for a long time. Keep the balm side handy and reapply frequently! After about 6 hours I noticed it was looking cracked and very dry giving my lips an aged look I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toujour Teaberry color is a great shade that I think will be pretty universally flattering but I wish it was a creme and not a shimmer. If it were a creme it would look polished and professional, instead it looks downright glittery which is nice for clubbing, not so hot if you want something more everyday.</li>
            <li> it hold at best for 4 hours then i need to reapply the lip gloss with it or reapply the lipcolor sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this color is super nice. its like a bright glossy pink. i wish its not that bright so i can use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, im satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick in Toujour Teaberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is the user of this product and my review is based on a verbal interview with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick provides up to 24h of long-lasting color and moisturization.  Using the wand, the lipcolor is applied to the lips and allowed to dry.&lt;br /&gt;The next step is to use the color seal balm which is the secret to locking in the color for an extended period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the color definitely lasts and lasts when applied in the manner as directed on the packaging.  It is thick so you won&#x27;t need to apply much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the sealer requires some planning.  What I mean is that since you have to wait 2 minutes to apply the color seal balm you will need to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;This is not necessarily lipstick that would be applied on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I am a long time user of L&#x27;Oreal (and Lancome) products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  The color is a personal preference but this one is vibrant&lt;br /&gt;and lasts.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both used this. Its a great color. It was easy to apply. One end is a soft sponge then other end a chap stick type end. It left my lips feeling smooth  and good. When it dried it left a stain to your lips and you reapplied the chap stick.  This was a good gloss and good lipstick.</li>
            <li> The color is true to screen (which I know can be tricky when buying a lipstick online) and is a nice, slightly bright pop of color without being HOT PINK, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it was a breeze. The wand tapers and you can easily brush off the extra off the tip of the brush, so there&#x27;s no issues there (apply carefully - getting it off your skin is NOT easy!). Wait about a minute to apply the &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; that&#x27;s on the other end and you&#x27;re good to go! No weird smell. It isn&#x27;t waxy. Good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am having a couple issues with this product, however. First, the color is not lasting all day. I applied about 5 hours ago and after eating lunch, I&#x27;m starting to get that faded look in the middle (which makes it look like I have a very thick lip liner situation going on), and since I left it at home, I&#x27;m using tinted chapstick to balance it out. Second, I&#x27;m a chapstick junkie and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my lips or the product but they are dryer than usual with this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All day lipcolor? Not for me. BUT would it last through a wedding or a night out? Absolutely. It has some of the quirks of other lip stains I&#x27;ve tried (dryness, fading, etc) but overall the best one I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;ll keep it in my rotation for sure!</li>
            <li> When the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Pro-Last Color Lipstick arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I&#x27;m absolutely a make up junkie and love to try new products.  The first thing that I notice about this lipstick is that it&#x27;s a gorgeous pastel pink color for the spring!  It&#x27;s just a few shades darker than my natural lip color and would work for day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is that it&#x27;s not a traditional lipstick.  At least not by the packaging or the way it&#x27;s applied.  In this aspect, it looks more like a gloss.  I usually have the same problem with these types of lipsticks. By that I mean the type that you need to put on in two steps and claims to be long-wear.  Just about every single one of them tends to be really dry, flakes off (which then leaves a really gritty feel on my lips), and constantly needs to have the balm reapplied to stay somewhat smooth.  If I don&#x27;t continue to reapply the balm, the feeling of it drives me crazy so I immediately have to take it off.  I know I can&#x27;t be the only one with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after testing the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Lipstick, I can honestly tell you that I did not have one of those problems!  This lipstick is really easy to apply.  I always start with a sugar scrub for my lips when I am using a long-wear, dryer lipstick like this one. This is just my personal preference.  But, I find that It leaves my lips completely smooth for application.  When applying the lipstick, I start on my top lip at the center (the cupid&#x27;s bow) and work my way out to each of the corner&#x27;s of my lips.  I finish up by smoothing over my bottom lip. When you first apply this lipstick, it will look and feel like a regular lip gloss.  It then starts to get a tacky/sticky feel and finally dries on your lips matte.  It&#x27;s important to wait approximately two minutes or until the lipstick is completely dry.  If not, when you apply the sealer, it will smear and just mix together.  You will also not get the benefit of all day wear which is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.  Last, you apply the sealant on the other side of the stick and you&#x27;re done, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the lipstick at nine in the morning and it lasted all day and straight through dinner.  I did drink and eat twice with this lipstick on and the color didn&#x27;t wear off at all.  Personally, I still like to apply the balm a couple of times during the day to keep my lips shiny and not too dry.  I was completely surprised that this lipstick color actually did last and didn&#x27;t come off on my glass or napkin. Normally,  I prefer high shine with my lipstick and I also like to use a lip liner.  With the L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Lipstick, you don&#x27;t really need a lip liner.  It doesn&#x27;t feather or bleed.  It&#x27;s perfect for days that I want a more natural, easy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Infallible Lipstick to anyone looking to just apply your lipstick once and then forget about it.  No more touch ups!  At this price point, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the quality that comes with this long lasting lipstick!ch is the main reason you probably chose this lipstick.

            <li> The lip color lasts fairly well, and the color itself is nice, but the applicator is sub-optimal, and the application process is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigment is very wet, which is nice for an all-day lip color. However, the applicator wand is not well made, and the bottle top does not remove excess, so the product gets all over your mouth in a sad clown kind of way. Then the product turns very sticky and &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; before you can wipe it off and start over. On a teenager, the effect might approximate a lush look, but on anyone over 25, it approximates a sloppy drunk look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss is greasy and unpleasant to apply, but it works.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised and impressed by this lipstick - I am so used to spending a lot of  money on brand names at department stores that I did&#x27;n&#x27;t have high expectations for this one. Here are some pros and cons and some advice in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip color part just glides on, very easily. Almost too easily (see below.) One coat with be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting at least two minutes, apply the white/clear gloss over it and it will seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the biggest plus - this color stays on forever. Or I should say at least 12 hours, and that&#x27;s with eating and drinking. I couldn&#x27;t believe it and I even put some on at night before bed and it looked freshly applied in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it applies so easily and QUICKLY, you can really make a mistake and if you do, it&#x27;s not all that easy to correct. I found the first couple of times I used it, it went a tiny bit above my upper lip line and the result was sort of clownish - and it took a little work to get it off. So the quality that is a plus that makes it long-lasting is also a problem if you don&#x27;t apply it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also felt a little bit drying on my lips. I was pleasantly surprised how crisp the lip line was with no bleeding, but the parts under inside the lip lines looked dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I am intrigued and was impressed enough to try a different color. The color I got was teaberry and it is WAY too bright for me and the resulting look as I said was sort of clownish. In a lighter, more natural or blush shade,  I think this might really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, it&#x27;s a great price and it really does stay on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really loved this color.  Easy to use and fairly durable on a night out.  Had to re-apply after eating and drinking.  The product gets a little tacky at times though.</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal Paris lipstick lasts for hours. It doesn&#x27;t come off on your coffee mug, although you probably will have to reapply after lunch. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smear where you don&#x27;t want it. You do have to use the gloss over it, because otherwise it&#x27;s a little sticky. After both steps, though, it looks great and stays for hours. I generally find cosmetics ordered online to be a little lighter than pictured (maybe it&#x27;s my monitor) but this is pretty true to what&#x27;s on the screen.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m old-school. In fact, the last time I wore lipstick was about twenty years ago, and I just used tube lipstick that I could apply without even having to look. I tried this thinking I could sure stand to use a little color to brighten up my sixtysomething face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this wand applicator (step #1, so marked on the applicator) to be tricky to get right, and you&#x27;d absolutely have to use a lip liner to keep a crisp edge. I didn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t, so that was the first thing I didn&#x27;t like. You also have to be careful not to do anything to wipe off the lipstick (don&#x27;t blot, as my mother taught me to do) until you can seal it. Once sealed, however, it really does stay on, which is what it promises to do. After I waited about half an hour, I tried blotting my lips on a piece of paper and nothing came off. You probably should refresh it after you eat, of course. (UPDATE: Wow. Woke up this morning and this lipstick was still on my lips. That&#x27;s pretty amazing, considering how I toss and turn and even drool during the night!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer (#2), which you are supposed to wait two minutes before applying to allow #1 to set, does feel good (if slightly weird) going on. But two minutes is a long, long time to wait to finish applying one&#x27;s lipstick. Maybe for somebody who has a painstaking morning makeup regimen and would spend that two minutes blending and refining their eye shadow or something, I could see it. But I&#x27;m usually not willing to invest that kind of time. If you are, then I think you&#x27;d probably like it. The color does brighten up my face, even if I&#x27;m not typically a makeup-wearer.</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical when I tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Pro-Last Lipstick....or rather I was skeptical of its 24-hour lasting claim.  And while it didn&#x27;t last 24 hours, it was still longer lasting than any other lipstick/lip gloss that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first: The color is fantastic.  While it was slightly darker than I was expecting, it was still a rich, vibrant pink that didn&#x27;t look like it was too much for an everyday color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the 24 hour claim, I debunked that.  I applied this lipstick at 9:30AM and I reapplied it at 4:15.  However, I didn&#x27;t reapply it because I didn&#x27;t have any color on my lips, because I did, but rather because it was slightly faded and I like the darker look of it.  24 hours later, I did still have some color on my lips (despite vigorous scrubbing), but again it was on some part of my lips and not the full lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still recommend L&#x27;Oreal Paris Pro-Last Color Lipstick.  The color was stunning and the lipstick did lock in for hours and didn&#x27;t fade too much even after I ate and drank.</li>
