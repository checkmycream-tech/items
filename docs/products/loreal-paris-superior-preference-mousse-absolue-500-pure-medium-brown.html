    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I thought this reusable dye would work great for touch ups!</li>
            <li>I found this to be one of the best at home hair coloring products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a great savings!</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal Coleur Experte  was the best color i have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The touch up color turned out perfectly and matched what I had already done.  </li>
            <li>I saw the product on a list that said it was one of the best at home hair dye&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Totally LOVE it!!!  </li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, covers gray perfectly, application is a snap</li>
            <li>I usually am happy with L&#x27;Oreal, but judging by the reviews I don&#x27;t think anyone is happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Excellence Cream for years and been happy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Problem is even leaving it on for 30 minuets, the color coverage is to great</li>
            <li>I purchased this with great hopes.</li>
            <li>I have been home dyeing/highlighting my hair for over 30 years, and almost always use L&#x27;oreal products with great results.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how easy it was for me to put in my hair!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product successfully for almost a year.  </li>
            <li>No amount of rinsing with warm water would loosen the product from my scalp and hair so I had to shampoo and rinse the dye out!</li>
            <li>This system although sounding like a good idea does not work.</li>
            <li>It covers well, is easy to use, and covered my greys beautifully.</li>
            <li>More cost effective!</li>
            <li>wait until L&#x27;Oreal (or someone else) comes up with something better!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have much better results!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and had perfect results.  </li>
            <li>I generally love L&#x27;oreal!</li>
            <li>I could see my own color with no change at all.</li>
            <li>Even with a $3.00 clipped coupon when I bought it from a popular retail store, I still paid $13.00, tax included.</li>
            <li>I liked the product look</li>
            <li>Go buy two Nice N Easys</li>
            <li>If you could just buy the conditioner that comes with these hair dyes on its own I&#x27;d buy it all the time.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it took a lot of mousse to cover hair, kind of like oil &amp; water not mixing.  </li>
            <li>All would be forgiven if the color was nice.  </li>
            <li>I tried on my hair (medium brown) and was very happy with the result - it really brought up the shine and multi-tonal colour.</li>
            <li>The color was nice, but faded away after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have anywhere to go after doing my hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have used this product twice, so it is more prevalent with the darker colors.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a coupon supposedly to make up for the loss of my precious hair.  </li>
            <li>A better foam color is the John Frieda precision foam.</li>
            <li>a way better</li>
            <li>I used this last week and was very happy with it!  </li>
            <li>So, I did and this time I made sure to &amp;#34;re-cover&amp;#34; the stubborn areas many times during the process.</li>
            <li>Better than what I used to get.</li>
            <li>With this I can get more than one use out of each batch.</li>
            <li>I wish Amazon.com carried more colors, but the medium brown worked well for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this hair color.  </li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair for 20 years and using Garnier Mousse for many of those.  </li>
            <li>so why is it $10 more on Amazon?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made sure it stayed level by leaving it standing on the countertop and then dispensing it into my hand.  </li>
            <li>I ended up washing my hair with Dawn dish detergent 3 times and was able to get it all out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the economics of it.  </li>
            <li>But bald would be better than looking like a sea hag that allowed a child to magic marker her face.</li>
            <li>, I guess until someone gets REALLY HURT!!!!  </li>
            <li>I loved the first shade I tried.....300.</li>
            <li>The conditioner it comes with is pretty good...</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and has thinned out quite a bit through the years, so I never need a full application of anything.  </li>
            <li>I regularly color my hair and I loved the mousse!</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use</li>
            <li>Application was not that easy</li>
            <li>It was so easy.  </li>
            <li>I should have known from the get go from the strong smell of ammonia.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still strong.</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and is mouse, however, I wish it showed better that I got all the hair.</li>
            <li>As for this item, the first problem with it is the very strong ammonia fumes which made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>I had a huge problem.</li>
            <li>For some reason there aren&#x27;t any light brown with reddish tones in this product line.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase this from Amazon, but fortunately still have my receipt and box</li>
            <li>It sounded important not to tip the applicator.  </li>
            <li>but then I would run my nails through my hair and they would be filled with the product.</li>
            <li>I have had wonderful success covering my gray with other hair color products sold in the store.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and easy and it will save me money since I can do two touch-ups with one bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows very fast and I have a lot of gray so, for me, this is HUGE!</li>
            <li>I saw this rated highly in an online article and liked that it was a reusable application.  </li>
            <li>I just used the leftovers to cover my grays at the temple, making sure I massaged it in very well, and it did not do a thing!  </li>
            <li>The color I used was light golden brown.</li>
            <li>If this many people are complaining, think how much money L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>I shook the bottle vigorously for a full minute when I opened it.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash it out quickly</li>
            <li>and it comes off quickly, even once the dye process is over.  </li>
            <li>Normally I use Healthy Look</li>
            <li>I have been dying my own hair for years and thought it was a good idea that the product is premixed and only needs shaking prior to each application and that the remainder can be saved for my roots.  </li>
            <li>used the second box for two touch-ups and now I love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry now, and I used a good amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li>the next darkest,  try at your own risk.....</li>
            <li>My hair came out a better, shinier version of my natural hair color which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY or PRECIOUS TIME on this garbage product.  </li>
            <li>If I can find a golden brown I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
            <li>like I hade a decades worth of lice.</li>
            <li>I did keep the conditioner, which is nice after regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I was going to an event and quickly needed to color my roots.  </li>
            <li>Will stick with nice and easy, costs less and it works</li>
            <li>I could tell right away it wasn&#x27;t working .</li>
            <li>doing everything right</li>
            <li>still okay, though I&#x27;d like a little more golden highlight.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover grey, it didn&#x27;t even make my own hair a tone darker.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to learn that finally, a no-mix haircolor that can be used several times in variable amounts.  </li>
            <li>It consistently leaves my hair rich in color with natural looking highlights and with a soft healthy texture.  </li>
            <li>I  have used Loreal  Excellence for years and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>But most importantly, it did not really do anything to my hair at all!</li>
            <li>I loved the concept to have hair dye on hand when ever I needed a little touch up.</li>
            <li>But the promise of being able to save some to touch-up later was a siren&#x27;s song</li>
            <li>First time I tried it to touch up my grays and the result...</li>
            <li>AT ALL...WASHED OUT AFTER FIRST SHAMPOO...</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Within 1-2 shampoos my gray roots were showing as if I never dyed them in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>For the record, I followed the instructions and steps exactly for hair that has gray in it.  </li>
            <li>I only touch the top roots on the crown anyway.</li>
            <li>They need to recall this product as they are aware it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>In fact, I agree with another reviewer who thought it actually striped my existing color and made the gray even more pronounced!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>This product is different from other products I&#x27;ve used, and the instructions MUST be followed to get good results!</li>
            <li>First, I did not buy this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I did the roots first, let them process for 20 minutes, and then did the ends and processed another 10 minutes,  </li>
            <li>but I will buy the Mousse if its on sale because it usually costs more than the Healthy Look.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t pay good money, and waste my time, to be their test subject.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake vigorously before spraying each time and hold the container up right as straight as possible when disbursing.  </li>
            <li>To top it off, instead of the dark blonde color it should have been, it is kind of ash brown.  </li>
            <li>In the end, my hair color turned out great but, because of the mess, I would never have repurchased this product and was sorry that I had bought two boxes (I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for years and find it pretty easy to do).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish I read the reviews here first before I bought it.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really covering the greys when I first applied it so</li>
            <li>So I recommended this product to my 2 other friends and they both loved it and continue to use this product so far.</li>
            <li>Their 500 pure medium brown is a joke</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t breathe at certain points during the application.</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;, shaking it vigorously between every spray, massaging it in in large amounts on my roots, etc.</li>
            <li>The number of negative reviews really surprised me because I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!  </li>
            <li>So much of my hair broke off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather buy a cheaper box dye instead of this mousse.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize you had to keep it upright during the whole application.</li>
            <li>They really need to pull it off the shelves.</li>
            <li>It is for a whole head application.</li>
            <li>The color was MUCH darker than depicted on the package.  </li>
            <li>, really, don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>It turned out very even</li>
            <li>It did not cover gray, which was the whole point.</li>
            <li>and my hair is shiny and feels very silky.  </li>
            <li>What really attracted me to this product is the reusability.</li>
            <li>The results were very blotchy coverage.  </li>
            <li>READ the instructions and WATCH the short instructional video available online.  </li>
            <li>feel very cheated by L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li>I also do not review products very often but this one needs a warning.  </li>
            <li>The stench of ammonia and chemicals made me choke, and after rinsing I smelled like a chemical plant until I shampooed with real shampoo (after 24 hours  to try to hold the color).</li>
            <li>I had to really rub my skin and still found discolored specks that remained on my cheek and ear lobe days afterward.  </li>
            <li>Giving one star is too much.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that I have plenty to redo my temples in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve gotten 3 applications to touch up roots and have one more left.  </li>
            <li>Since I have short hair, I was thrilled to find a product that I could use several times.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product when I bought it because I&#x27;m starting to get some gray</li>
            <li>I have, like other reviewers, been coloring my hair myself for many years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>I used other products like that before and had a better result</li>
            <li>Reusable hair color is a unique concept, but this product simply doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a medium golden brown - and despite the fact that this is really more of a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; brown, it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true products at Sally.</li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as directed, and the results were FAR from acceptable.  </li>
            <li>I have used lots of other brands/versions before and been satisfied, so I&#x27;m not hard to please.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments on my hair since I started using this particular hair care product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair regularly for about 5 years, I&#x27;ve tried various products but have had the most luck with excellence by Loreal.  </li>
            <li>I am always cautious with new products, I can&#x27;t imagine if I had left it on the full time or longer.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I was excited about being able to use it for tough ups.  </li>
            <li>It did not cover my grays well, even after leaving it on a little longer and adding more product on the grays.</li>
            <li>My shampoo &amp; conditioner are color-safe and have used the same when I tried other brands of haircolor with MUCH BETTER RESULTS EVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li>I used it in precise accordance with instructions, and my hair shows just the slightest tint of the pure dark brown color</li>
            <li>Great product idea, flawed product...</li>
            <li>I did the normal 20 minutes on the roots and 10 minutes on the remainder of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to go outside for fresh air.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my own hair for 5 years and should have noticed something fishy when there were no little dye spots in my sink/ shower/ counter (inevitable with hair coloring, regardless of how careful you think you have been) and no &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was left with dry hair with more gray than when I started.</li>
            <li>Great concept, but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but the execution is very poor.</li>
            <li>but I could live with that.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear!</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t think of doing this the first time because my floor is white</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that has not even colored it.</li>
            <li>I had the exact same experience as everyone else.</li>
            <li>Well, tell you what, without hearing of their commercial in advance, I&#x27;ve noticed myself that my hair became so shiny and brought out the multi-tonal colour after my first use.</li>
            <li>I was going from a very light blonde and just wanted to change my hair slightly.</li>
            <li>My hair was very shiny and some of the lighter blonde highlights had a nice color, but overall, for the price and how difficult it was to apply, I will stick to my Excellence, which does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>The first indication that this product was off was after shaking the dispenser vigorously, I could clearly see patches of dye not mixed into foam.  </li>
            <li>All of the other comments I read are also true</li>
            <li>Also, the image in the instructions does not make it clear when the product has activated.</li>
            <li>This product is for young people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, my hair is soft, silky and the grays are covered.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>and I had to stand by the window and spray it in my hand far away from my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting my natural oils help my hair before I redye it.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair (always silky soft even after coloring) is indescribable.  </li>
            <li>Just what a 50-something yr old woman needs... another line on her face.    </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>When I began blow-drying my hair, my hair was so sticky and heavy with the product that I had to go back and shampoo some more...</li>
            <li>I believe the color I used was True Dark Brown.  </li>
            <li>As a woman in my mid-40&#x27;s I have a few (OK maybe a moderate amount) of grays growing in.  </li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s a laugh, it barely did anything to the shade of my hair and did not touch the grey hairs at all.</li>
            <li>I was just touching up my roots but because it comes out as a thick  mousse it spreads wider than just using the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The application was easy and much less messy than many other hair dyes I have used.  </li>
            <li>I tried this haircolor because I have very short hair, and I liked the idea of getting 2 applications from one box, instead of dumping the extra like I usually do.  </li>
            <li>I will not buy this product again, I am going back to eSalon, which I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>Shaking the other canister, which was obviously the dye, felt completely full.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the issue of the foam staying white, because I did get some dye on my skin, but not as much as I normally would.</li>
            <li>Waited the full 30 minutes, plus a couple extra.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed, conditioned, towel dried.......</li>
            <li>20 minutes later it was still there pure white mousse, no color change.</li>
            <li>I tried the 500 medium brown with a little 654 light auburn red</li>
            <li>Maybe thinking I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough the first time, I tried again to touch up my roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference colours for a long time but this is the first (and last) time I will use this product.</li>
            <li>Called the L&#x27;Oreal hotline, they refunded my money, sent forms to pay for my Dr&#x27;s bills (scalp burns) but told me that this was the FIRST time they had heard of anything bad about their product...reading more reviews on here (I should have before buying mine!)</li>
            <li>My hair ran clear but I was left with a ton of it in my hair and it would not come out.</li>
            <li>Repeat it barely if anything covers gray.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back and forth between home dye and professional for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s damp but not wet.</li>
            <li>It barely colored the gray on my temples.  </li>
            <li>Stripped my normal color and left a brittle, brassy red.</li>
            <li>idea of reusable hair color is good on paper, the the reality is nothing but disappointing.</li>
            <li>I have been using other L&#x27;Oreal products and they work just fine, but one is a complete misfire.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit dry and hard to be sure</li>
            <li>I used the first box for a complete application and it was a mess!  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is fairly short, and I&#x27;m only touching up my roots, I had at least 1/2 bottle still left.  </li>
            <li>Finally, it does not cover grey , especially around the hairline, and what was covered vanished in about 2 weeks as the color also faded from too dark to orangy light brown.  </li>
            <li>For ease of use I could rate it higher because I dislike a drippy mess.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell where I was putting&lt;br /&gt;the color, because it left no dark stains anywhere.</li>
            <li>And  just the other thought, how do I know how much of a colour left?</li>
            <li>I never expected that a brand such as L&#x27;Oreal would cheat their customers this way.</li>
            <li>My grey is covered completely and my hair has lots of highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have any respiratory issues at all, DO NOT use this product, there are some batches out there that have a higher amount of chemical in them, which explains why some of us, when using it have experienced a horrific chemical reaction, to the point, you almost cannot breathe when using it.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> and I thought this reusable dye would work great for touch ups!</li>
            <li> I found this to be one of the best at home hair coloring products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a great savings!</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal Coleur Experte  was the best color i have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The touch up color turned out perfectly and matched what I had already done.  </li>
            <li> I saw the product on a list that said it was one of the best at home hair dye&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Totally LOVE it!!!  </li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, covers gray perfectly, application is a snap</li>
            <li> I usually am happy with L&#x27;Oreal, but judging by the reviews I don&#x27;t think anyone is happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Excellence Cream for years and been happy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Problem is even leaving it on for 30 minuets, the color coverage is to great</li>
            <li> I purchased this with great hopes.</li>
            <li> I have been home dyeing/highlighting my hair for over 30 years, and almost always use L&#x27;oreal products with great results.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how easy it was for me to put in my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product successfully for almost a year.  </li>
            <li> No amount of rinsing with warm water would loosen the product from my scalp and hair so I had to shampoo and rinse the dye out!</li>
            <li> This system although sounding like a good idea does not work.</li>
            <li> It covers well, is easy to use, and covered my greys beautifully.</li>
            <li> More cost effective!</li>
            <li> wait until L&#x27;Oreal (or someone else) comes up with something better!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have much better results!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and had perfect results.  </li>
            <li> I generally love L&#x27;oreal!</li>
            <li> I could see my own color with no change at all.</li>
            <li> Even with a $3.00 clipped coupon when I bought it from a popular retail store, I still paid $13.00, tax included.</li>
            <li> I liked the product look</li>
            <li> Go buy two Nice N Easys</li>
            <li> If you could just buy the conditioner that comes with these hair dyes on its own I&#x27;d buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it took a lot of mousse to cover hair, kind of like oil &amp; water not mixing.  </li>
            <li> All would be forgiven if the color was nice.  </li>
            <li> I tried on my hair (medium brown) and was very happy with the result - it really brought up the shine and multi-tonal colour.</li>
            <li> The color was nice, but faded away after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t have anywhere to go after doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have used this product twice, so it is more prevalent with the darker colors.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a coupon supposedly to make up for the loss of my precious hair.  </li>
            <li> A better foam color is the John Frieda precision foam.</li>
            <li> a way better</li>
            <li> I used this last week and was very happy with it!  </li>
            <li> So, I did and this time I made sure to &amp;#34;re-cover&amp;#34; the stubborn areas many times during the process.</li>
            <li> Better than what I used to get.</li>
            <li> With this I can get more than one use out of each batch.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon.com carried more colors, but the medium brown worked well for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for 20 years and using Garnier Mousse for many of those.  </li>
            <li> so why is it $10 more on Amazon?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made sure it stayed level by leaving it standing on the countertop and then dispensing it into my hand.  </li>
            <li> I ended up washing my hair with Dawn dish detergent 3 times and was able to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the economics of it.  </li>
            <li> But bald would be better than looking like a sea hag that allowed a child to magic marker her face.</li>
            <li> , I guess until someone gets REALLY HURT!!!!  </li>
            <li> I loved the first shade I tried.....300.</li>
            <li> The conditioner it comes with is pretty good...</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and has thinned out quite a bit through the years, so I never need a full application of anything.  </li>
            <li> I regularly color my hair and I loved the mousse!</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use</li>
            <li> Application was not that easy</li>
            <li> It was so easy.  </li>
            <li> I should have known from the get go from the strong smell of ammonia.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still strong.</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and is mouse, however, I wish it showed better that I got all the hair.</li>
            <li> As for this item, the first problem with it is the very strong ammonia fumes which made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I had a huge problem.</li>
            <li> For some reason there aren&#x27;t any light brown with reddish tones in this product line.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from Amazon, but fortunately still have my receipt and box</li>
            <li> It sounded important not to tip the applicator.  </li>
            <li> but then I would run my nails through my hair and they would be filled with the product.</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful success covering my gray with other hair color products sold in the store.  </li>
            <li> It was quick and easy and it will save me money since I can do two touch-ups with one bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows very fast and I have a lot of gray so, for me, this is HUGE!</li>
            <li> I saw this rated highly in an online article and liked that it was a reusable application.  </li>
            <li> I just used the leftovers to cover my grays at the temple, making sure I massaged it in very well, and it did not do a thing!  </li>
            <li> The color I used was light golden brown.</li>
            <li> If this many people are complaining, think how much money L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> I shook the bottle vigorously for a full minute when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash it out quickly</li>
            <li> and it comes off quickly, even once the dye process is over.  </li>
            <li> Normally I use Healthy Look</li>
            <li> I have been dying my own hair for years and thought it was a good idea that the product is premixed and only needs shaking prior to each application and that the remainder can be saved for my roots.  </li>
            <li> used the second box for two touch-ups and now I love it!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry now, and I used a good amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> the next darkest,  try at your own risk.....</li>
            <li> My hair came out a better, shinier version of my natural hair color which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY or PRECIOUS TIME on this garbage product.  </li>
            <li> If I can find a golden brown I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
            <li> like I hade a decades worth of lice.</li>
            <li> I did keep the conditioner, which is nice after regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I was going to an event and quickly needed to color my roots.  </li>
            <li> Will stick with nice and easy, costs less and it works</li>
            <li> I could tell right away it wasn&#x27;t working .</li>
            <li> doing everything right</li>
            <li> still okay, though I&#x27;d like a little more golden highlight.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover grey, it didn&#x27;t even make my own hair a tone darker.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to learn that finally, a no-mix haircolor that can be used several times in variable amounts.  </li>
            <li> It consistently leaves my hair rich in color with natural looking highlights and with a soft healthy texture.  </li>
            <li> I  have used Loreal  Excellence for years and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> But most importantly, it did not really do anything to my hair at all!</li>
            <li> I loved the concept to have hair dye on hand when ever I needed a little touch up.</li>
            <li> But the promise of being able to save some to touch-up later was a siren&#x27;s song</li>
            <li> First time I tried it to touch up my grays and the result...</li>
            <li> AT ALL...WASHED OUT AFTER FIRST SHAMPOO...</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Within 1-2 shampoos my gray roots were showing as if I never dyed them in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> For the record, I followed the instructions and steps exactly for hair that has gray in it.  </li>
            <li> I only touch the top roots on the crown anyway.</li>
            <li> They need to recall this product as they are aware it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> In fact, I agree with another reviewer who thought it actually striped my existing color and made the gray even more pronounced!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> This product is different from other products I&#x27;ve used, and the instructions MUST be followed to get good results!</li>
            <li> First, I did not buy this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I did the roots first, let them process for 20 minutes, and then did the ends and processed another 10 minutes,  </li>
            <li> but I will buy the Mousse if its on sale because it usually costs more than the Healthy Look.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t pay good money, and waste my time, to be their test subject.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be sure to shake vigorously before spraying each time and hold the container up right as straight as possible when disbursing.  </li>
            <li> To top it off, instead of the dark blonde color it should have been, it is kind of ash brown.  </li>
            <li> In the end, my hair color turned out great but, because of the mess, I would never have repurchased this product and was sorry that I had bought two boxes (I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for years and find it pretty easy to do).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish I read the reviews here first before I bought it.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really covering the greys when I first applied it so</li>
            <li> So I recommended this product to my 2 other friends and they both loved it and continue to use this product so far.</li>
            <li> Their 500 pure medium brown is a joke</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t breathe at certain points during the application.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;, shaking it vigorously between every spray, massaging it in in large amounts on my roots, etc.</li>
            <li> The number of negative reviews really surprised me because I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!  </li>
            <li> So much of my hair broke off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather buy a cheaper box dye instead of this mousse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you had to keep it upright during the whole application.</li>
            <li> They really need to pull it off the shelves.</li>
            <li> It is for a whole head application.</li>
            <li> The color was MUCH darker than depicted on the package.  </li>
            <li> , really, don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It turned out very even</li>
            <li> It did not cover gray, which was the whole point.</li>
            <li> and my hair is shiny and feels very silky.  </li>
            <li> What really attracted me to this product is the reusability.</li>
            <li> The results were very blotchy coverage.  </li>
            <li> READ the instructions and WATCH the short instructional video available online.  </li>
            <li> feel very cheated by L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li> I also do not review products very often but this one needs a warning.  </li>
            <li> The stench of ammonia and chemicals made me choke, and after rinsing I smelled like a chemical plant until I shampooed with real shampoo (after 24 hours  to try to hold the color).</li>
            <li> I had to really rub my skin and still found discolored specks that remained on my cheek and ear lobe days afterward.  </li>
            <li> Giving one star is too much.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that I have plenty to redo my temples in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gotten 3 applications to touch up roots and have one more left.  </li>
            <li> Since I have short hair, I was thrilled to find a product that I could use several times.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product when I bought it because I&#x27;m starting to get some gray</li>
            <li> I have, like other reviewers, been coloring my hair myself for many years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> I used other products like that before and had a better result</li>
            <li> Reusable hair color is a unique concept, but this product simply doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a medium golden brown - and despite the fact that this is really more of a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; brown, it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true products at Sally.</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as directed, and the results were FAR from acceptable.  </li>
            <li> I have used lots of other brands/versions before and been satisfied, so I&#x27;m not hard to please.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments on my hair since I started using this particular hair care product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair regularly for about 5 years, I&#x27;ve tried various products but have had the most luck with excellence by Loreal.  </li>
            <li> I am always cautious with new products, I can&#x27;t imagine if I had left it on the full time or longer.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I was excited about being able to use it for tough ups.  </li>
            <li> It did not cover my grays well, even after leaving it on a little longer and adding more product on the grays.</li>
            <li> My shampoo &amp; conditioner are color-safe and have used the same when I tried other brands of haircolor with MUCH BETTER RESULTS EVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li> I used it in precise accordance with instructions, and my hair shows just the slightest tint of the pure dark brown color</li>
            <li> Great product idea, flawed product...</li>
            <li> I did the normal 20 minutes on the roots and 10 minutes on the remainder of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to go outside for fresh air.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my own hair for 5 years and should have noticed something fishy when there were no little dye spots in my sink/ shower/ counter (inevitable with hair coloring, regardless of how careful you think you have been) and no &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was left with dry hair with more gray than when I started.</li>
            <li> Great concept, but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> The idea is great, but the execution is very poor.</li>
            <li> but I could live with that.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear!</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t think of doing this the first time because my floor is white</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that has not even colored it.</li>
            <li> I had the exact same experience as everyone else.</li>
            <li> Well, tell you what, without hearing of their commercial in advance, I&#x27;ve noticed myself that my hair became so shiny and brought out the multi-tonal colour after my first use.</li>
            <li> I was going from a very light blonde and just wanted to change my hair slightly.</li>
            <li> My hair was very shiny and some of the lighter blonde highlights had a nice color, but overall, for the price and how difficult it was to apply, I will stick to my Excellence, which does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> The first indication that this product was off was after shaking the dispenser vigorously, I could clearly see patches of dye not mixed into foam.  </li>
            <li> All of the other comments I read are also true</li>
            <li> Also, the image in the instructions does not make it clear when the product has activated.</li>
            <li> This product is for young people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, my hair is soft, silky and the grays are covered.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> and I had to stand by the window and spray it in my hand far away from my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting my natural oils help my hair before I redye it.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair (always silky soft even after coloring) is indescribable.  </li>
            <li> Just what a 50-something yr old woman needs... another line on her face.    </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> When I began blow-drying my hair, my hair was so sticky and heavy with the product that I had to go back and shampoo some more...</li>
            <li> I believe the color I used was True Dark Brown.  </li>
            <li> As a woman in my mid-40&#x27;s I have a few (OK maybe a moderate amount) of grays growing in.  </li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s a laugh, it barely did anything to the shade of my hair and did not touch the grey hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I was just touching up my roots but because it comes out as a thick  mousse it spreads wider than just using the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The application was easy and much less messy than many other hair dyes I have used.  </li>
            <li> I tried this haircolor because I have very short hair, and I liked the idea of getting 2 applications from one box, instead of dumping the extra like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again, I am going back to eSalon, which I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Shaking the other canister, which was obviously the dye, felt completely full.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the issue of the foam staying white, because I did get some dye on my skin, but not as much as I normally would.</li>
            <li> Waited the full 30 minutes, plus a couple extra.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed, conditioned, towel dried.......</li>
            <li> 20 minutes later it was still there pure white mousse, no color change.</li>
            <li> I tried the 500 medium brown with a little 654 light auburn red</li>
            <li> Maybe thinking I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough the first time, I tried again to touch up my roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference colours for a long time but this is the first (and last) time I will use this product.</li>
            <li> Called the L&#x27;Oreal hotline, they refunded my money, sent forms to pay for my Dr&#x27;s bills (scalp burns) but told me that this was the FIRST time they had heard of anything bad about their product...reading more reviews on here (I should have before buying mine!)</li>
            <li> My hair ran clear but I was left with a ton of it in my hair and it would not come out.</li>
            <li> Repeat it barely if anything covers gray.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth between home dye and professional for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s damp but not wet.</li>
            <li> It barely colored the gray on my temples.  </li>
            <li> Stripped my normal color and left a brittle, brassy red.</li>
            <li> idea of reusable hair color is good on paper, the the reality is nothing but disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been using other L&#x27;Oreal products and they work just fine, but one is a complete misfire.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit dry and hard to be sure</li>
            <li> I used the first box for a complete application and it was a mess!  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is fairly short, and I&#x27;m only touching up my roots, I had at least 1/2 bottle still left.  </li>
            <li> Finally, it does not cover grey , especially around the hairline, and what was covered vanished in about 2 weeks as the color also faded from too dark to orangy light brown.  </li>
            <li> For ease of use I could rate it higher because I dislike a drippy mess.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell where I was putting&lt;br /&gt;the color, because it left no dark stains anywhere.</li>
            <li> And  just the other thought, how do I know how much of a colour left?</li>
            <li> I never expected that a brand such as L&#x27;Oreal would cheat their customers this way.</li>
            <li> My grey is covered completely and my hair has lots of highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have any respiratory issues at all, DO NOT use this product, there are some batches out there that have a higher amount of chemical in them, which explains why some of us, when using it have experienced a horrific chemical reaction, to the point, you almost cannot breathe when using it.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick long hair and usally buy 4 boxes of dye, 3 isn&#x27;t quite enough.</li>
            <li> Bet the product does not last long as few people have anything positive to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using home products for years and despite being in my late 50s, have very little gray at the temples, mostly.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t applied it correctly or left it in long enough (40-50 minutes!).</li>
            <li> time, not only did it NOT COVER my gray AT ALL, it left my hair feeling SLIMY and strange even before using the enclosed conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, its very difficult to be sure of complete coverage with a mousse.</li>
            <li> did NOT color my hair, left little dark spots of color deposited on my scalp, left me with scalp burns, and when I was using the product, was like breathing pure ammonia.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s featured as &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; but only if you aren&#x27;t doing an all over color with long hair.</li>
            <li> Brown always----this is a flat slate/black.  </li>
            <li> Used as directed and the color took, but the grey was back after one wash.</li>
            <li> , I used extra on the really grey areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color was completely gone in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> but, my eyes did burn slightly (like old school color kits did)  </li>
            <li> I have lots of gray and it barely deposited a tiny bit of color and just made my grays a tad less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product this morning and have gone through the entire day looking like I have left the house with wet hair - literally!</li>
            <li> I found it hard to use because you can&#x27;t really tell where it is on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Result was did not change my blond hair one bit??after paying extra for a product that is already mixed not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT worth the extra money and L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the lab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stay clear and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions carefully, ended up using the entire bottle on my roots because I could still see the grays.</li>
            <li> I got my hair professionally colored a few weeks after that.  </li>
            <li> I have almost all grey around my temples and lots of grey roots.</li>
            <li> I used the second half the next week.</li>
            <li> I tried calling them today, several times, but they were not answering lines, due to &amp;#34;higher call volume&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying two of these due to a sale (2nd one 1/2 off).  </li>
            <li> I have an unopened box and will try to get my money back; there&#x27;s no way I would give this to anyone other than as a joke.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 and have been dying my hair for  a very long time.  </li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair, I&#x27;m feeling all this slimy residue on my hair and even on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It goes on almost dry.</li>
            <li> The result; my gray roots are still gray, the rest of the hair is quite a bit blonder, and quite dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it is coated, and it is dry and brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> The root were a completely different color than the rest of m hair, with the exception of a few strands that were a different color from everything.  </li>
            <li> Yes, convenience is pricey and its diminishing price is proof that the product does not live up to its name.</li>
            <li> I used the Dark Blonde dye (700).</li>
            <li> On Friday, I used the 700 (dark blonde) to touch up/</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and shiny afterwards as per usual with L&#x27;Oreal products.  </li>
            <li> It did a poor job covering my gray roots during the first application.  </li>
            <li> I used half an application on roots only.</li>
            <li> I had been using just 1/2 of other products, saving the other portion for next time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see the mess until later when it had turned into brown streaks all over the tile ).  </li>
            <li> I tried a small black tooth comb (I have thick long hair, it wasn&#x27;t fun) and it was taking a bunch out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see so many people had a hard time with the product.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it didn&#x27;t really want to go on my hair at all, the mousse just sort of disappears and is difficult to control.</li>
            <li> Shaking the one can, which must have been the activator, it felt almost empty.  </li>
            <li> but the color was such a waste of my life...</li>
            <li> Shook the heck out of it to insure &amp;#34;activation.&amp;#34;  Wasted my time because at the end of the process my hair was the same color as when I began, including my gray.  </li>
            <li> A few things I did differently that made all the difference:  </li>
            <li> I followed all directions carefully.  </li>
            <li> Again, I followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> I am naturally dark blonde and had used shade 1021 on my roots and a very few grey hairs (about 10 total), thinking that in a few weeks I could do the roots again and thus save money.</li>
            <li> After 25 minutes I could see that very little to no coloring had actually happened.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to my previous, albeit messy process.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is a problem with the product that Loreal is aware of according to their help line.</li>
            <li> I squeezed a small amount of the mousse on a white cloth, and after 40 minutes, it was still just as I had sprayed it (white, fluffy mousse)!</li>
            <li> Then when applying, the product does not grab the hair like other dyes.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful to thoroughly cover all my hair</li>
            <li> I used the medium brown color and got a flat, very dark, gray/black mess.  </li>
            <li> Way too dark.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not worth even $2 let alone the 22.50 that I paid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit weird at first because the mousse doesn&#x27;t change color for quite a few minutes</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the product, but I am bummed that I wasted an hour and will be going back to the non-mousse version.</li>
            <li> I was forced to sit outside at 4:30 in the morning!</li>
            <li> Good idea, nasty product.  </li>
            <li> perhaps I could call L&#x27;Oreal and ask for a credit to buy one of their other products instead!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve aged 10 years &amp; have been washing my hair with harsh shampoos to try to remove this mess from my head.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to tell if I got every part of my hair and didn&#x27;t notice until the next day that I missed a few areas.</li>
            <li> It does slightly color some of the greys, but does NOT cover them.</li>
            <li> The gray at my temples is slightly lighter than the rest of my hair, but it is that way with every color I use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less slimy but still gummy.  </li>
            <li> it less than 1 star if I could.</li>
            <li> Lighter brown looks almost black.</li>
            <li> They vary slightly in color.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was easy to use, but the end result is very very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The colors are not  true.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with all the other people who wrote horrific reviews, but my hair came out nicely.</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s not worth your time!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, I&#x27;ve colored my hair with different products over 15 years  and have never had any that smelt this strong .</li>
            <li> It is hard to use, you have to keep shaking it, it tends to &amp;#34;fly&amp;#34; around, and because it is white , and takes forever to develop, it is hard to know where you have applied it, or where besides your hair it may have landed.  </li>
            <li> It was very dark purplish-red.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, and I SO wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> Yes, green undertones.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Its messy and does not cover gray.  </li>
            <li> If the price was the trouble with its popularity, they should have marketed the color by itself without the highlighting kit.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The process was messy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> and then gave it a few shakes in between each appication.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this hair colour through Amazon, but used it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just a waste of time, energy and money, it has been detrimental to my hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wasted an hour</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff would NOT rinse out of my hair--Instead it turned into sludge--what a mess!  </li>
            <li> The result is blotchy color with not great grey coverage at the root.  </li>
            <li> As a busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to go to the salon every 5 weeks for a color (let alone time to be writing a review for a terrible product) and was excited to have something quick and reusable, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like a bad wig.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as I was rinsing the color, a very metallic taste came into my mouth, as a result of the odor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased a second box this past week, but after reading the horrible results reviews, I&#x27;m taking the box back to Walmart and asking for my money back.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but felt compelled to do so, so that I could warn others.</li>
            <li> I am sad that I am not the only one, but you can know, it&#x27;s not just me.</li>
            <li> When applying I usually can wipe away dye that drips on skin</li>
            <li> First off, the dispenser is stupid.</li>
            <li> My hair is an oily mess and to make matters worse, I&#x27;m as gray as ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> The color is so dull.</li>
            <li> However, the color looks so bad that I will probably have to go back to the messy type processes.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s fall, so I can wear a hat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews but after seeing all the negative ones here</li>
            <li> Today, I decided to use the rest of the bottle since I have an appointment this afternoon and figured this would at least temporarily cover some of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> and how it was presented - comes with 2 sets of gloves, a thick leave on conditioner, etc, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am afraid to ever not go that long.  </li>
            <li> if you use it on &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair as all colors suggest, your hair will still be dirty no matter how you long you rinse the stuff out.  </li>
            <li> ridiculous product needs to be discontinued and the loser team who created it should be fired.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair feeling greasy and nasty even days later!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as instructed in the guide that came in the box, and results were awful.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and for the price a total loss.</li>
            <li> First, I did not purchase from Amazon, but this stuff is so terrible</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get it on your hair evenly.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair black at home for several years, and I never found an at-home dye that was as horrible as this!</li>
            <li> There was no odor, it didn&#x27;t bother my very delicate scalp, and it covered my grays.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> This is absoluely the worse hair coloring product that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The absolute WORST product I have ever bought...</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed, that I will like boycott LOreal ANYTHING from now on.  </li>
            <li> It really damaged my hair and I have never felt my hair so stringy and nasty after dye like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The color is poor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward because you have to shake every time and it&#x27;s messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking shaking/mixing might be the secret.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling horrible , dull and greasy.</li>
            <li> While I have been disappointed in other products before, I have literally never asked a manufacturer for a refund until now.</li>
            <li> Well, it is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The worse thing is this stupid product cost me $15.00 vs. the $5.00 I usually spend on</li>
            <li> There is something very wrong with their product, and they refuse to take it seriously</li>
            <li> I look silly.</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> but this is the absolue worse!  </li>
            <li> They implied that everything that I did was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like taking it back and it looked like the worst that would happen</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not cover my stubborn gray roots.</li>
            <li> am sorry for anyone using this product.</li>
            <li> It left a coating on my hair that was awful.  </li>
            <li> am I sorry I did.    </li>
            <li> I also must have had a strand of hair touch my forehead because I  ended up having a faint line of brown dye there.  </li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> It did not smell very bad as other reviews say, however,  </li>
            <li> Smells awful and DID NOT cover my grey.</li>
            <li> I hate to be so negative, and wouldn&#x27;t be as angry if the 800 hotline ever picked up to hear my complaints, but they didn&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews, and although I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, I needed a forum to express my disappointment with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to recolor but so afraid too after using that dye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it BURNED like crazy.</li>
            <li> I followed directions and applied to dirty hair.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this dye since I had a coupon and the colors looked enticing, but I am so sorry I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review of any product before but this was just so bad that I had to.</li>
            <li> I would rate their customer service as being as bad s their product.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to leave bad reviews</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> The toxic smell was so bad that it burned my nose</li>
            <li> I knew that was a bad sign because it can&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
            <li> It stunk that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad .</li>
            <li> No multi-tones, no shine &amp; bad gray coverage.  </li>
            <li> odor wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked when it was done.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in l&#x27;Oreal for putting out an expensive inferior product.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> It is an ugly darker brown, with no highlights, unless you consider the gray!</li>
            <li> It is the result that is so sickening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was a terrible gray/light brown/green.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> This color is horrible on me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just horrible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon, however I felt the need to warn everyone that this product is awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is awful!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product once with horrible results to my hair.</li>
            <li> The worst ever!</li>
            <li> THE WORST EVER!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolue awful!!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Terrible Product!</li>
            <li> i predict that L&#x27;Oreal will take this off the market soon because of dreadful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> And worst of all, after going through all that, it didn&#x27;t even cover my gray!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dye I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I agree, the worst product i ever bought.</li>
            <li> but this is the worst and needs to be discontinued immediately.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, but I must say it is the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> I never review products but this is so awful</li>
            <li> So, the color is awful</li>
            <li> Worst hair color ever.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible trying to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how awful my hair felt after using it.  </li>
            <li> If they can put something out this awful and know they have a problem with it and not recall it, I wonder if I should not go to another company..  </li>
            <li> and I really hate that I threw my money away on it---especially since I&#x27;ll be throwing the rest of it away, too!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product!  </li>
            <li> yep- just awful!!</li>
            <li> Worst at home haircolor ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review of any product before but this was just so bad that I had to. I used the Dark Blonde dye (700). I was going from a very light blonde and just wanted to change my hair slightly. My hair did not come out blonde at all. It was a terrible gray/light brown/green. Yes, green undertones. This is the worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;d recommend anything else before this.</li>
            <li> This color is horrible on me. Way too dark. I look silly. Goth doesn&#x27;t work on middle age women. I&#x27;ve already tried too wash it out twice. I like the application process and the fact that you can reuse it. However, the color looks so bad that I will probably have to go back to the messy type processes. For some reason there aren&#x27;t any light brown with reddish tones in this product line. I tried the 500 medium brown with a little 654 light auburn red but it&#x27;s just horrible. If this keeps up I&#x27;m going to have to let my hair turn gray. I usually am happy with L&#x27;Oreal, but judging by the reviews I don&#x27;t think anyone is happy with this product. Sigh... At least it&#x27;s fall, so I can wear a hat.</li>
            <li> Followed directions to the letter. Foam did not even change change from white to brown like it should have. Result was did not change my blond hair one bit??after paying extra for a product that is already mixed not worth it. Glad I didn&#x27;t have anywhere to go after doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.  I have been using this product successfully for almost a year.  It consistently leaves my hair rich in color with natural looking highlights and with a soft healthy texture.  The application is the easiest self coloring I have ever used. Be sure to shake vigorously before spraying each time and hold the container up right as straight as possible when disbursing.  Rinse thoroughly until ALL product is rinsed out, then use the conditioner that comes with the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon, however I felt the need to warn everyone that this product is awful.  I have been dying my own hair for years and thought it was a good idea that the product is premixed and only needs shaking prior to each application and that the remainder can be saved for my roots.  I did the normal 20 minutes on the roots and 10 minutes on the remainder of my hair.  The root were a completely different color than the rest of m hair, with the exception of a few strands that were a different color from everything.  I don&#x27;t think they have perfected this solution and until they do I warn everyone to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> WARNING!!!!!  If you have any respiratory issues at all, DO NOT use this product, there are some batches out there that have a higher amount of chemical in them, which explains why some of us, when using it have experienced a horrific chemical reaction, to the point, you almost cannot breathe when using it.  Now I have used this product twice, so it is more prevalent with the darker colors.  Called the L&#x27;Oreal hotline, they refunded my money, sent forms to pay for my Dr&#x27;s bills (scalp burns) but told me that this was the FIRST time they had heard of anything bad about their product...reading more reviews on here (I should have before buying mine!) I now realize this is a LIE from the company!!!!  There is something very wrong with their product, and they refuse to take it seriously, I guess until someone gets REALLY HURT!!!!  I loved the first shade I tried.....300. the next darkest,  try at your own risk.....did NOT color my hair, left little dark spots of color deposited on my scalp, left me with scalp burns, and when I was using the product, was like breathing pure ammonia.  I think I will stay with hair color I can see and smell before I apply it to my hair next time....</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair black at home for several years, and I never found an at-home dye that was as horrible as this! I followed the directions exactly as instructed in the guide that came in the box, and results were awful. As I rinsed the product out of my hair, I noticed it had congealed on my scalp, even though I left it on for only the 30-minutes I was supposed to. No amount of rinsing with warm water would loosen the product from my scalp and hair so I had to shampoo and rinse the dye out! When I began blow-drying my hair, my hair was so sticky and heavy with the product that I had to go back and shampoo some more... needless to say, I rinsed out just about all of the dye and my roots are still obvious. I would NEVER use this again.</li>
            <li> This is absoluely the worse hair coloring product that I have ever used.  I should have known from the get go from the strong smell of ammonia.  So much of my hair broke off.  I like Loreal products but this is the absolue worse!  I called Loreal and they sent me a coupon supposedly to make up for the loss of my precious hair.  They implied that everything that I did was wrong.  I am 67 and have been dying my hair for  a very long time.  Please don&#x27;t use this product.  I don&#x27;t want anyone else losing their hair and I loss a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a drugstore not from Amazon. If you have a lot of grays to color, I do not recommend this hair color. It did not cover my grays well, even after leaving it on a little longer and adding more product on the grays. A better foam color is the John Frieda precision foam.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product when I bought it because I&#x27;m starting to get some gray and I thought this reusable dye would work great for touch ups! It&#x27;s horrible. I used an entire bottle and it was patchy. My ends were hit and miss and my hair looked striped. It also did not cover the gray. I even left it on for an extra 5-10 minutes. I bought another bottle and reapplied to my ends and gray. It was very dark purplish-red. Not what I consider &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; auburn brown. After two days my ends are fading to a pinkish-blonde. It&#x27;s embarrassing. I do not recommend this product. I&#x27;d much rather buy a cheaper box dye instead of this mousse.</li>
            <li> This product is awful! I am a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal hair color. I&#x27;ve used Excellence Cream for years and been happy. But the promise of being able to save some to touch-up later was a siren&#x27;s song I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;First, its very difficult to be sure of complete coverage with a mousse. it&#x27;s a bit dry and hard to be sure you&#x27;ee saturated ylur aair and won&#x27;t be left with patchy color.&lt;br /&gt;Second, Within 3 days my grays were noticeable at my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, my roots were a lighter shade than the rest of my hair within ONE WEEK! (It takes about 3 weeks for roots &amp; grays to appear after using Excellence Cream)&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product is NOT worth the extra money and L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the lab.&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer: I did not purchase this through Amazon, but I do get Excellence Cream through Subscribe &amp; Save)</li>
            <li> First off, the dispenser is stupid. I didn&#x27;t realize you had to keep it upright during the whole application. Of course you can&#x27;t know that until you buy it and open the box for the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the color itself doesn&#x27;t work at all. After 25 minutes I could see that very little to no coloring had actually happened. I could see my own color with no change at all. The worse thing is this stupid product cost me $15.00 vs. the $5.00 I usually spend on a way better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ridiculous product needs to be discontinued and the loser team who created it should be fired.</li>
            <li> This product did not work, period. I used it in precise accordance with instructions, and my hair shows just the slightest tint of the pure dark brown color or I purchased on the non-gray parts of my hair. The gray roots are literally untouched. I have, like other reviewers, been coloring my hair myself for many years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing and I know what to expect. I did not purchase this from Amazon, but fortunately still have my receipt and box so will be calling L&#x27;Oreal for a refund. While I have been disappointed in other products before, I have literally never asked a manufacturer for a refund until now. Buy something -anything- else. I have used lots of other brands/versions before and been satisfied, so I&#x27;m not hard to please. If I could rate this zero stars, I would. It just does not do what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li> The absolute WORST product I have ever bought...EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product this morning and have gone through the entire day looking like I have left the house with wet hair - literally! My hair is an oily mess and to make matters worse, I&#x27;m as gray as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of reusable hair color is good on paper, the the reality is nothing but disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Waste of time.  Did nothing at all.  I suspected that the two canisters were not both dispensing so I cut the plastic wrap off which holds them together.  Shaking the one can, which must have been the activator, it felt almost empty.  Shaking the other canister, which was obviously the dye, felt completely full.  The dye canister was not dispensing.  Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but after seeing all the negative ones here I felt I should.  I used this last week and was very happy with it!  I prefer to go to the salon to get my hair done but was needing to save money so thought I would try another home product.  I believe the color I used was True Dark Brown.  The application was easy and much less messy than many other hair dyes I have used.  You do have to shake the bottle in between squirts but if you do so you can see that it comes out evenly.  I was very careful to thoroughly cover all my hair and I left it on for 30 minutes.  My hair came out a better, shinier version of my natural hair color which is what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments on it.  All in all I found this to be one of the best at home hair coloring products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to learn that finally, a no-mix haircolor that can be used several times in variable amounts.  First time I tried it to touch up my grays and the result...NOTHING...NO COVERAGE AT ALL...WASHED OUT AFTER FIRST SHAMPOO... but I believe in second chances. So, I did and this time I made sure to &amp;#34;re-cover&amp;#34; the stubborn areas many times during the process. One week &amp; after a second hair wash/shampoo later, grays are showing.  Even with a $3.00 clipped coupon when I bought it from a popular retail store, I still paid $13.00, tax included. My shampoo &amp; conditioner are color-safe and have used the same when I tried other brands of haircolor with MUCH BETTER RESULTS EVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME.  Yes, convenience is pricey and its diminishing price is proof that the product does not live up to its name.</li>
            <li> Works well. Better than what I used to get. With this I can get more than one use out of each batch. More cost effective!</li>
            <li> Dont buy it from anywhere.  Its messy and does not cover gray.  Repeat it barely if anything covers gray.  And i plastered it on my temples and left it an extra 5 min!  Ughhh!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will be purchasing this mousse again</li>
            <li> I have tried this product once with horrible results to my hair. Color was completely gone in less than two weeks. Stripped my normal color and left a brittle, brassy red. I purchased a second box this past week, but after reading the horrible results reviews, I&#x27;m taking the box back to Walmart and asking for my money back. I have lost faith in any L&#x27;Oreal hair color treatments at this point. Their 500 pure medium brown is a joke and I&#x27;m not laughing. They really need to pull it off the shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair color a number of times now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It covers well, is easy to use, and covered my greys beautifully. I&#x27;m sorry to see so many people had a hard time with the product. I think it&#x27;s brilliant! I wish Amazon.com carried more colors, but the medium brown worked well for me and I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments on my hair since I started using this particular hair care product. I especially like that it&#x27;s reusable. That&#x27;s a great savings!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this hair color.  I bought it because I was excited about being able to use it for tough ups.  Problem is even leaving it on for 30 minuets, the color coverage is to great</li>
            <li> The worst ever! Smells awful and DID NOT cover my grey. The conditioner left my hair feeling greasy and nasty even days later! THE WORST EVER!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with great hopes. Unfortunately there is a problem with the product that Loreal is aware of according to their help line. The mix is of color and developer is being dispense incorrectly so the color is not working. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, and although I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, I needed a forum to express my disappointment with this product. As a busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to go to the salon every 5 weeks for a color (let alone time to be writing a review for a terrible product) and was excited to have something quick and reusable, I was very disappointed. On Friday, I used the 700 (dark blonde) to touch up/ cover grays around my face and scalp. There was no difference in my hair/grays, and all weekend, I kept wondering if A.) I hadn&#x27;t applied it correctly or left it in long enough (40-50 minutes!). So, Monday, I decided to try it again. I have dyed my own hair for 5 years and should have noticed something fishy when there were no little dye spots in my sink/ shower/ counter (inevitable with hair coloring, regardless of how careful you think you have been) and no &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; dyed skin around my face/ ears or in my part. So, I decided to experiment: I squeezed a small amount of the mousse on a white cloth, and after 40 minutes, it was still just as I had sprayed it (white, fluffy mousse)! With viable hair colors, you see the color darkening almost immediately. Great product idea, flawed product...wait until L&#x27;Oreal (or someone else) comes up with something better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolue awful!!!!  The foam doesn&#x27;t penetrate all the way to the scalp.  I just used the leftovers to cover my grays at the temple, making sure I massaged it in very well, and it did not do a thing!  The L&#x27;oreal Coleur Experte  was the best color i have ever tried.  If the price was the trouble with its popularity, they should have marketed the color by itself without the highlighting kit.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. The color doesn&#x27;t work. Coloring your hair out of a box shouldn&#x27;t be rocket science. I followed the directons and applied. The color doesn&#x27;t cover grays. The conditioner it comes with is pretty good...but the color was such a waste of my life...ugh.</li>
            <li> This product is for young people. It is for a whole head application. It does slightly color some of the greys, but does NOT cover them. My hair was very shiny and some of the lighter blonde highlights had a nice color, but overall, for the price and how difficult it was to apply, I will stick to my Excellence, which does a fantastic job. Oh, btw, did I mention that Mousse Absolue has AMMONIA? Oh, yes. Aerated ammonia. I couldn&#x27;t breathe at certain points during the application. I had to go outside for fresh air. Great concept, but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> my hair is grayer than when I applied this product.  What a waste of time and money. Never turned color.... I kept waiting for the color to develop it never did.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time yesterday.  What a disaster!  The color was MUCH darker than depicted on the package.  The process was messy.  The gloves are flimsy.  The product left my hair so greasy that I had to shampoo after, and lather 3 times.  I have contacted LOreal by email, but they do not respond.  I tried calling them today, several times, but they were not answering lines, due to &amp;#34;higher call volume&amp;#34;.  I would rate their customer service as being as bad s their product.  I am so annoyed, that I will like boycott LOreal ANYTHING from now on.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> The dye was obviously old as it did not really dye my hair properly, I had to apply it twice. Just the feel of it was that this product has expired. I used other products like that before and had a better result</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK!!! I have been dying my hair for 20 years and using Garnier Mousse for many of those.  Bought this for the reuse option. Shook the heck out of it to insure &amp;#34;activation.&amp;#34;  Wasted my time because at the end of the process my hair was the same color as when I began, including my gray.  Call Loreal for your refund if you got stuck on this.  They mailed me a refund.  Bet the product does not last long as few people have anything positive to say about it.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase through Amazon. Does not cover grays as advertised. I didn&#x27;t have the issue of the foam staying white, because I did get some dye on my skin, but not as much as I normally would. I followed all the directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;, shaking it vigorously between every spray, massaging it in in large amounts on my roots, etc. Once rinsed out it did nothing to my grays. They were still shining and silvery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s featured as &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; but only if you aren&#x27;t doing an all over color with long hair. If you&#x27;re just doing roots, then yes it is, or if you have really short hair than that will apply to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, really, don&#x27;t use it. Ever. I liked the product look and how it was presented - comes with 2 sets of gloves, a thick leave on conditioner, etc, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give L&#x27;Oreal props. They are refunding my money, since the retailer wouldn&#x27;t. However, they do need the lot number, so don&#x27;t toss it if you want them to rectify the situation.</li>
            <li> Terrible Product! I decided to try this dye since I had a coupon and the colors looked enticing, but I am so sorry I did! It really damaged my hair and I have never felt my hair so stringy and nasty after dye like this. It didn&#x27;t even spread evenly throughout my head. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and I have to recolor but so afraid too after using that dye.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to leave bad reviews but I just want to give you the heads up. Sadly it&#x27;s not worth your time!</li>
            <li> I paid $15 - still a ripoff - so why is it $10 more on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless - DON&#x27;T BUY IT. IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK. i predict that L&#x27;Oreal will take this off the market soon because of dreadful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. Go buy two Nice N Easys and you&#x27;ll have much better results!</li>
            <li> So I bought this and then read all the reviews.  I didn&#x27;t feel like taking it back and it looked like the worst that would happen would be no color.  I followed the directions exactly and had perfect results.  There was no odor, it didn&#x27;t bother my very delicate scalp, and it covered my grays.  The gray at my temples is slightly lighter than the rest of my hair, but it is that way with every color I use.  The nice thing is that I have plenty to redo my temples in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I think the difference in my results could be these two things.&lt;br /&gt;1.  I shook it vigorously while I drank my morning coffee and then gave it a few shakes in between each appication.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It sounded important not to tip the applicator.  I made sure it stayed level by leaving it standing on the countertop and then dispensing it into my hand.  This golf ball sized amount I then spread across the part I made in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t understand, why is it twice the price on Amazon as at my local store?  I thought maybe there were two packages but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my hair is soft, silky and the grays are covered.</li>
            <li> For ease of use I could rate it higher because I dislike a drippy mess. Unfortunately, it did not cover my stubborn gray roots. I will be going back to my previous, albeit messy process.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this hair colour through Amazon, but used it a few weeks ago. What a disappointment! It didn&#x27;t cover grey, it didn&#x27;t even make my own hair a tone darker. Yes, it was easy to use, but the end result is very very disappointing. And  just the other thought, how do I know how much of a colour left? Is it going to be enough for the next time?&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but felt compelled to do so, so that I could warn others. This is the worst product I have ever used!  As a woman in my mid-40&#x27;s I have a few (OK maybe a moderate amount) of grays growing in.  I have had wonderful success covering my gray with other hair color products sold in the store.  This did nothing to cover my gray. I even used it twice and followed instructions to a T.  Just hoping my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out over night.  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Agree with all the reviews here.  I have been using other L&#x27;Oreal products and they work just fine, but one is a complete misfire.  The result is blotchy color with not great grey coverage at the root.  A re-do for me.  Steer clear!</li>
            <li> How did this product even make it to market?  It was hard to apply.  It stank.  It burned my scalp.  And worst of all, after going through all that, it didn&#x27;t even cover my gray!!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, I&#x27;ve colored my hair with different products over 15 years  and have never had any that smelt this strong . I had to wash it out quickly and I used all of the conditioner and it&#x27;s still strong. All of the other comments I read are also true I could tell right away it wasn&#x27;t working . Please don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Very hard to use. Very hard to get it on your hair evenly. Doesn&#x27;t color correctly. Rather have the regular liquid dye.</li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth between home dye and professional for about 10 years. I picked this up because I wanted to give the foam a shot. I was very impressed with how easy it was for me to put in my hair! I have super thick long hair and usally buy 4 boxes of dye, 3 isn&#x27;t quite enough. I bought 3 of this type and only used about 1 1/3(AWESOME)!! It turned out very even and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes of this (700) at Target during a sale.  I used the first box for a complete application and it was a mess!  When I was done, there was mousse all over the bathroom floor.  I found it hard to use because you can&#x27;t really tell where it is on your hair.  I felt like I was redoing the same area over and over because it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34;  In the end, my hair color turned out great but, because of the mess, I would never have repurchased this product and was sorry that I had bought two boxes (I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for years and find it pretty easy to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the second box for two touch-ups and now I love it!  A few things I did differently that made all the difference:  I wiped the tip of the dispenser between each squirt (and before shaking) which saved me from having the mousse flying all over the floor (I didn&#x27;t think of doing this the first time because my floor is white and I didn&#x27;t see the mess until later when it had turned into brown streaks all over the tile ).  I ignored the fact that I couldn&#x27;t see the color on my head and just trusted that the color was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch up color turned out perfectly and matched what I had already done.  It was quick and easy and it will save me money since I can do two touch-ups with one bottle.  My hair grows very fast and I have a lot of gray so, for me, this is HUGE!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, and I SO wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s bad. Really bad. I thought it would be easier to apply to touch up my gray. It is not. You have to massage it in after every row, so you may as well use a bottle or brush. It did not cover gray, which was the whole point. I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true products at Sally.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY or PRECIOUS TIME on this garbage product.  I hate to be so negative, and wouldn&#x27;t be as angry if the 800 hotline ever picked up to hear my complaints, but they didn&#x27;t bother.  I made the mistake of buying two of these due to a sale (2nd one 1/2 off).  This stuff is not worth even $2 let alone the 22.50 that I paid.  Here&#x27;s my experience:  The first time I tried this, I was going to an event and quickly needed to color my roots.  I used the product exactly as directed, and the results were FAR from acceptable.  I have lots of gray and it barely deposited a tiny bit of color and just made my grays a tad less noticeable.  Since my hair is fairly short, and I&#x27;m only touching up my roots, I had at least 1/2 bottle still left.  Within 1-2 shampoos my gray roots were showing as if I never dyed them in the first place.  Today, I decided to use the rest of the bottle since I have an appointment this afternoon and figured this would at least temporarily cover some of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, not only did it NOT COVER my gray AT ALL, it left my hair feeling SLIMY and strange even before using the enclosed conditioner.  I rinsed my hair as directed.  Looked in the mirror and it was as if I hadn&#x27;t done a thing but wash my hair.  NO color. Zip.  And as I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair, I&#x27;m feeling all this slimy residue on my hair and even on my hands.  Back to wash my hair; ten minutes later!  it&#x27;s less slimy but still gummy.  Did ANYONE at L&#x27;oreal bother to test this product?  I can&#x27;t believe they did.  I wish I had read the reviews first. I have an unopened box and will try to get my money back; there&#x27;s no way I would give this to anyone other than as a joke.  For the record, I followed the instructions and steps exactly for hair that has gray in it.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I really wish I read the reviews here first before I bought it. I saw the product on a list that said it was one of the best at home hair dye&#x27;s so I bought it. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AND BUY THIS PRODUCT. The toxic smell was so bad that it burned my nose and I had to stand by the window and spray it in my hand far away from my face. The product was easy to use but when I went to rinse it out I had a huge problem. My hair ran clear but I was left with a ton of it in my hair and it would not come out. I tried a small black tooth comb (I have thick long hair, it wasn&#x27;t fun) and it was taking a bunch out so I thought it was working but then I would run my nails through my hair and they would be filled with the product. After 1 hour of doing this, I still had a ton of it left in my hair and lots of my hair in the drain. I ended up washing my hair with Dawn dish detergent 3 times and was able to get it all out. I was left with dry hair with more gray than when I started. It has been 1 week since then and I have only washed it with shampoo once and used conditioner 3 times. I&#x27;m letting my natural oils help my hair before I redye it. I will go back to John Frieda&#x27;s mousse hair dye next time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I read all of the negative reviews and I had none of the problems others listed.  The color is beautiful, covers gray perfectly, application is a snap and my hair is shiny and feels very silky.  I love the economics of it.  So far I&#x27;ve gotten 3 applications to touch up roots and have one more left.  I bought it at CVS and I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dye I have ever used! I generally love L&#x27;oreal! A friend did my hair for me. My hair was meticulously done, following all the directions. I was shocked when it was done. Not only does it not, &amp;#34;beautifully cover all gray&amp;#34;, it looks like I have had it done for weeks with a lot of gray in there.&lt;br /&gt;The color is poor. It is an ugly darker brown, with no highlights, unless you consider the gray! My hair is very dry now, and I used a good amount of conditioner. My hair looks like a bad wig.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as I was rinsing the color, a very metallic taste came into my mouth, as a result of the odor.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for anyone using this product. It&#x27;s not just a waste of time, energy and money, it has been detrimental to my hair. I am sad that I am not the only one, but you can know, it&#x27;s not just me.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair at home for 30 years. This is the first and only product that has not even colored it. This stuff doesn&#x27;t even touch the gray. I used half an application on roots only. I had just gotten my hair cut and it&#x27;s medium-short. I only touch the top roots on the crown anyway. Nothing got colored. It goes on almost dry. It&#x27;s damp but not wet. I knew that was a bad sign because it can&#x27;t penetrate. It&#x27;s foam, not mousse. Big difference. And to add insult to injury, I paid $13 plus tax. This is truly a ripoff. I used the second half the next week. Same thing. Nothing. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Maybe thinking I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough the first time, I tried again to touch up my roots. This stuff DID NOT even begin to color my roots. Will stick with nice and easy, costs less and it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference colours for a long time but this is the first (and last) time I will use this product. The idea is great, but the execution is very poor. The only saving grace about it, for me, is the tube of conditioner. If you could just buy the conditioner that comes with these hair dyes on its own I&#x27;d buy it all the time. As for this item, the first problem with it is the very strong ammonia fumes which made my eyes water. Secondly, it didn&#x27;t really want to go on my hair at all, the mousse just sort of disappears and is difficult to control. But most importantly, it did not really do anything to my hair at all! I am naturally dark blonde and had used shade 1021 on my roots and a very few grey hairs (about 10 total), thinking that in a few weeks I could do the roots again and thus save money. Well that&#x27;s a laugh, it barely did anything to the shade of my hair and did not touch the grey hairs at all. I&#x27;m thinking now perhaps I could call L&#x27;Oreal and ask for a credit to buy one of their other products instead!</li>
            <li> It was hard to tell if I got every part of my hair and didn&#x27;t notice until the next day that I missed a few areas. It goes on quickly and is mouse, however, I wish it showed better that I got all the hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with all the other people who wrote horrific reviews, but my hair came out nicely. Application could not have been easier. Got mine at Walmart. What really attracted me to this product is the reusability. I had been using just 1/2 of other products, saving the other portion for next time. My hair is very fine and has thinned out quite a bit through the years, so I never need a full application of anything.  I&#x27;ve been using home products for years and despite being in my late 50s, have very little gray at the temples, mostly. This color covered it quite well. I usually use a medium golden brown - and despite the fact that this is really more of a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; brown, it still okay, though I&#x27;d like a little more golden highlight. If I can find a golden brown I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at Amazon but at a drugstore. I had the exact same experience as everyone else. This product simply does not color hair. I shook it multiple times, applied it and waited up to an hr. the white foam never changed color and my hair never changed color either. They need to recall this product as they are aware it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The color I used was light golden brown. Waste of time and money. Followed instructions carefully, ended up using the entire bottle on my roots because I could still see the grays. It did not smell very bad as other reviews say, however,  it BURNED like crazy. The result; my gray roots are still gray, the rest of the hair is quite a bit blonder, and quite dry. My scalp is still tender, two hours after.</li>
            <li> I agree, the worst product i ever bought. I followed the instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; . I bought this to color the hairline and sides as a fill in. I left the product on for 30 min and it covered nothing the grays are still there, I applied a second application, same results. Stay clear and don&#x27;t waste your money. Very disappointed in l&#x27;Oreal for putting out an expensive inferior product.</li>
            <li> Reusable hair color is a unique concept, but this product simply doesn&#x27;t work.  It did a poor job covering my gray roots during the first application.  I got my hair professionally colored a few weeks after that.  Today I used the remaining &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; product to cover my roots and you wouldn&#x27;t even know it.  In fact, I agree with another reviewer who thought it actually striped my existing color and made the gray even more pronounced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big consumer of L&#x27;Oreal products, but this is the worst and needs to be discontinued immediately.  Also, a review posted ONE year ago said L&#x27;Oreal knows the product is ineffective. So why is this still on the store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This product was purchased at Walmart, not Amazon.</li>
            <li> I saw this rated highly in an online article and liked that it was a reusable application.  I followed directions and applied to dirty hair.  It&#x27;s a bit weird at first because the mousse doesn&#x27;t change color for quite a few minutes so you can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  I was just touching up my roots but because it comes out as a thick  mousse it spreads wider than just using the bottle.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward because you have to shake every time and it&#x27;s messy to apply.  It smells like regular dye, if you color your hair you should be used to the smell.  I left it on for an hour because I have stubborn roots and I am afraid to ever not go that long.  The results were very blotchy coverage.  Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the product, but I am bummed that I wasted an hour and will be going back to the non-mousse version.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, but I must say it is the worst product ever. It didn&#x27;t color my gray hair. It is a waste of money. I never expected that a brand such as L&#x27;Oreal would cheat their customers this way.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t work, at all, didn&#x27;t activate. I tried to call the helpline to find out why but the machine said call back later. I tried calling 3 times. I wasted an hour and then my hair didn&#x27;t color, at all. I followed the instructions exactly. Also, the image in the instructions does not make it clear when the product has activated. It just looks white. Do not use this product. Call the company and complain and just hope they answer. I wish I could give no stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart, but came to Amazon to see about a Subcribe &amp; Save deal.  The number of negative reviews really surprised me because I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!  I don&#x27;t know if changes have been made to the product to improve it, or if some of the \\&quot;haters\\&quot; just didn&#x27;t use it correctly.  READ the instructions and WATCH the short instructional video available online.  This product is different from other products I&#x27;ve used, and the instructions MUST be followed to get good results!</li>
            <li> I never review products but this is so awful I feel I need to warn people. I did not buy this product through amazon.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair regularly for about 5 years, I&#x27;ve tried various products but have had the most luck with excellence by Loreal.  I tried this product because it promoted shine and mulit-tonal color.  Well, it is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Application was not that easy but I could live with that.  It is the result that is so sickening.  I have used med. Brown always----this is a flat slate/black.  The color is so dull. The texture of my hair (always silky soft even after coloring) is indescribable.  It&#x27;s like it is coated, and it is dry and brittle and breaking. Also, it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.  So, the color is awful AND I can&#x27;t style it the way I want.  I followed package directions to the letter except I rinsed in 25 minutes.  I am always cautious with new products, I can&#x27;t imagine if I had left it on the full time or longer.  Worst hair color ever.  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Used the Loreal 500, twice. Neither time did it do anything, no smell either. It did not cover the grays or change my hair color. It was horrible trying to wash it out. I got some in the sink and 20 minutes later it was still there pure white mousse, no color change. This system although sounding like a good idea does not work. Tried to call Loreal and they are away till after the holiday. Disappointed and for the price a total loss.</li>
            <li> I want My money back!!! First, I did not buy this product through Amazon. I purchased it at Fred Meyers.&lt;br /&gt;I did everything the directions told me to do.&lt;br /&gt;The foam goes on white like in the pictures, then just disappeared into my hair. Couldn&#x27;t tell where I was putting&lt;br /&gt;the color, because it left no dark stains anywhere. Looked at the pictures again, and the directions, but since I&lt;br /&gt;was doing everything right, I went ahead and finished the job. Waited the full 30 minutes, plus a couple extra.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsed, conditioned, towel dried.......NOTHING had happened!&lt;br /&gt;All the gray roots were still there. No difference in the color of my hair. NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;I feel very cheated by L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;Someone else mentioned that on the helpline, L&#x27;Oreal knows about a problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t pay good money, and waste my time, to be their test subject.&lt;br /&gt;I want a refund from the company! If this many people are complaining, think how much money L&#x27;Oreal&lt;br /&gt;is making off of selling boxes of NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews before I bought this.  I also do not review products very often but this one needs a warning.  Do not buy.  It left a coating on my hair that was awful.  I could not believe how awful my hair felt after using it.  I have used L&#x27;Oreal forever but may change now.  If they can put something out this awful and know they have a problem with it and not recall it, I wonder if I should not go to another company..  Did not even cover my growth of my roots either... Waste of time and money.....</li>
            <li> Since I have short hair, I was thrilled to find a product that I could use several times.I followed all directions carefully.  there was no problem with application at all.  However, this stuff would NOT rinse out of my hair--Instead it turned into sludge--what a mess!  After a prolonged effort to rinse it out, I hoped using the conditioner would do the trick, NOPE!  I was left with a gummy residue. The only way I could get rid of it was to shampoo it out. To top it off, instead of the dark blonde color it should have been, it is kind of ash brown.  A huge disappointment.  This isn&#x27;t an inexpensive product and I really hate that I threw my money away on it---especially since I&#x27;ll be throwing the rest of it away, too!  Horrible product!  I&#x27;dgive it less than 1 star if I could.</li>
            <li> What in the world did I put in my hair??? Was this product ever tested on humans?&lt;br /&gt;This stuff burnt my scalp, made my head itch like I hade a decades worth of lice. And the fumes! I was forced to sit outside at 4:30 in the morning! It stunk that bad. Well after my head burning of and the itching, I went and washed it out after 5 minutes or so. I&#x27;ve been using loreal hair coloring for years.  I&#x27;m very disappointed. I had to wash my hair 3 times to get the itchiness and fumes out.  Btw. I bought mine at walmart. I just needed to warn people of this product.</li>
            <li> yep- just awful!! I  have used Loreal  Excellence for years and like it very much.  This appealed because of reusability, and I trusted the brand. Here are the problems:  if you use it on &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair as all colors suggest, your hair will still be dirty no matter how you long you rinse the stuff out.  It left my hair feeling horrible , dull and greasy. The stench of ammonia and chemicals made me choke, and after rinsing I smelled like a chemical plant until I shampooed with real shampoo (after 24 hours  to try to hold the color). My husband asked me what the oder was...lovely!  It is hard to use, you have to keep shaking it, it tends to &amp;#34;fly&amp;#34; around, and because it is white , and takes forever to develop, it is hard to know where you have applied it, or where besides your hair it may have landed.  The colors are not  true.  Lighter brown looks almost black. Finally, it does not cover grey , especially around the hairline, and what was covered vanished in about 2 weeks as the color also faded from too dark to orangy light brown.  Bad . I&#x27;m going back to Excellence.  Good idea, nasty product.  I did keep the conditioner, which is nice after regular shampoo.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> First, I did not purchase from Amazon, but this stuff is so terrible, I felt a need to warn others.  I have been home dyeing/highlighting my hair for over 30 years, and almost always use L&#x27;oreal products with great results.  Decided to try the mousse and boy am I sorry I did.    The first indication that this product was off was after shaking the dispenser vigorously, I could clearly see patches of dye not mixed into foam.  Then when applying, the product does not grab the hair like other dyes.  Sometimes it would, but sometimes it took a lot of mousse to cover hair, kind of like oil &amp; water not mixing.  Also be warned that it does dye your skin.  When applying I usually can wipe away dye that drips on skin and it comes off quickly, even once the dye process is over.  Not so with this.  I had to really rub my skin and still found discolored specks that remained on my cheek and ear lobe days afterward.  I also must have had a strand of hair touch my forehead because I  ended up having a faint line of brown dye there.  Just what a 50-something yr old woman needs... another line on her face.    All would be forgiven if the color was nice.  But it isn&#x27;t.  I used the medium brown color and got a flat, very dark, gray/black mess.  No multi-tones, no shine &amp; bad gray coverage.  I feel like I&#x27;ve aged 10 years &amp; have been washing my hair with harsh shampoos to try to remove this mess from my head.  No way will I wait 6 weeks to re-dye it.  I just hope I don&#x27;t damage my hair by dyeing too soon.  But bald would be better than looking like a sea hag that allowed a child to magic marker her face.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read amazon reviews before I purchased. I loved the concept to have hair dye on hand when ever I needed a little touch up. What a disappointment! Used as directed and the color took, but the grey was back after one wash. Again, I followed the directions carefully. I used it two different times to give it a second chance. Fail. I can&#x27;t imaging how this passed product testing. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this product. You can&#x27;t reuse this as it becomes darker after sitting and the color is also spotty.Worst at home haircolor ever. Giving one star is too much. Ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried on my hair (medium brown) and was very happy with the result - it really brought up the shine and multi-tonal colour. I didn&#x27;t even know their commercial mentioned of these until I read the review. Well, tell you what, without hearing of their commercial in advance, I&#x27;ve noticed myself that my hair became so shiny and brought out the multi-tonal colour after my first use. So I recommended this product to my 2 other friends and they both loved it and continue to use this product so far.</li>
            <li> Totally LOVE it!!!  I shook the bottle vigorously for a full minute when I opened it.  Then I set up all my supplies and shook another 30 seconds before I used it.  I shook a lot during the application process.  I have almost all grey around my temples and lots of grey roots. I did the roots first, let them process for 20 minutes, and then did the ends and processed another 10 minutes,  My grey is covered completely and my hair has lots of highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor wasn&#x27;t bad but, my eyes did burn slightly (like old school color kits did)  It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really covering the greys when I first applied it so, I used extra on the really grey areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking shaking/mixing might be the secret.  If you don&#x27;t shake the bottle enough, maybe the mixture doesn&#x27;t come out correctly.  I could look at the foam and see both chemicals coming out evenly in my glove. They vary slightly in color.</li>
            <li> I regularly color my hair and I loved the mousse! It was so easy.  My hair was soft and shiny afterwards as per usual with L&#x27;Oreal products.  Normally I use Healthy Look but I will buy the Mousse if its on sale because it usually costs more than the Healthy Look.</li>
            <li> I tried this haircolor because I have very short hair, and I liked the idea of getting 2 applications from one box, instead of dumping the extra like I usually do.  The color was nice, but faded away after 2 weeks.  It barely colored the gray on my temples.  I will not buy this product again, I am going back to eSalon, which I highly reccommend.</li>
