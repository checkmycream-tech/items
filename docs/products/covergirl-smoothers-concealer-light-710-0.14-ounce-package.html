            <li>It goes on smooth (hence the name smoothers) and blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li>so amazing with this.</li>
            <li>Based on generally good reviews, I was tempted to pick this up, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-portable package, very easy to toss in a makeup bag and go</li>
            <li>The plastic top sometimes slides off in my purse</li>
            <li>This is overall a very good concealer!</li>
            <li>Love this concealer stick.</li>
            <li>It was cheap for a reason -</li>
            <li>Smooth to put on and not too oily.</li>
            <li>As a makeup addict I have tried nearly every concealer known to man and this is far and away the best concealer in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin with pink undertones and the light color works for me in the summer and the fair color in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I never wear a full face of makeup, i.e foundations, primers, etc.</li>
            <li>The color matches my skin great and its not as yellowish as the other concealers I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and unlike other makeup experiences, this time I&#x27;m pleased with the first one I bought!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a product that was more like Covergirl 710 #3211 which I had purchased a long time ago.</li>
            <li>that I had concealer on certain parts of my forehead and face and not on others</li>
            <li>This is a great little stick to figure out people that you&#x27;re a total emo.</li>
            <li>covers acne and even scabs very well.</li>
            <li>Start with just a touch and dab it with clean fingers and your \\&quot;oops\\&quot; will become almost invisible and last for hours!</li>
            <li>I love this product and have tried many others that have failed.</li>
            <li>The coverage is only fair and an application does not last very long.</li>
            <li>good at concealing small discolorations or acne scars that are flat with the skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a cosmetics junkie, I have to try just about every new thing that comes to my attention.</li>
            <li>Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-does not cover large acne blemishes very well, ex. pimples that rise up above the skin&lt;br /&gt;-depending on the size/color of the blemish, you may need to use a VERY generous layer to provide proper coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It blends with the skin texture very well (and I don&#x27;t mean the color-that&#x27;s unique for</li>
            <li>The #3211 had very good coverage and &amp;#34;lastability.&amp;#34; The one I received from you, 710 #4093 is exactly like #4072 and was a big disappointment and waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone who needs to cover flat blemishes and scars as opposed to acne, pimples, and zits because this only works right on flat imperfections.</li>
            <li>It barely conceals any blemishes and stays on for about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>so I took an old expensive Benefit concealer pot and broke off the CG top and smooshed it in with a tiny spatula.  </li>

            <li> It works for what it says it will do, color and coverage is good....but be careful not to mix it with certain powder foundation as it may clump a little. Good price for the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer.  It does ware off through the day, so additional applications are required.</li>
            <li> As a makeup addict I have tried nearly every concealer known to man and this is far and away the best concealer in my opinion.  It even beats the expensive Sephora brands!  I use it to conceal my red spider veins and the occasional blemish.  It goes on smooth (hence the name smoothers) and blends perfectly.  I have light skin with pink undertones and the light color works for me in the summer and the fair color in the winter.  The only thing that I would change would be to update the packaging.  The plastic top sometimes slides off in my purse so I took an old expensive Benefit concealer pot and broke off the CG top and smooshed it in with a tiny spatula.  I have noticed that the major pharmacy stores haven&#x27;t had this in stock the last few months and I am terrified that it will be discontinued.  Please Cover Girl, don&#x27;t get rid of this amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is something I will order again.</li>
            <li> This item works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and will not be stopping anytime soon. I love this product and have tried many others that have failed.</li>
            <li> This is overall a very good concealer! It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and unlike other makeup experiences, this time I&#x27;m pleased with the first one I bought! I bought this because I do not have much current acne, BUT I have tons of acne scars from the past that I like to cover up. I never wear a full face of makeup, i.e foundations, primers, etc. I always go natural, with eyeliner, maybe some shadow, and a little dot of concealer here and there. Because of this I was worried it would be obvious that I had concealer on certain parts of my forehead and face and not on others but I was wrong. It blends with the skin texture very well (and I don&#x27;t mean the color-that&#x27;s unique for everyone.)&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-very good at concealing small discolorations or acne scars that are flat with the skin&lt;br /&gt;-portable package, very easy to toss in a makeup bag and go&lt;br /&gt;-non-oily or greasy&lt;br /&gt;-stays on for long periods of time&lt;br /&gt;-long-lasting, and what I mean by this is even if you use this product every day, it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-does not cover large acne blemishes very well, ex. pimples that rise up above the skin&lt;br /&gt;-depending on the size/color of the blemish, you may need to use a VERY generous layer to provide proper coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who needs to cover flat blemishes and scars as opposed to acne, pimples, and zits because this only works right on flat imperfections. Definitely a necessity!</li>
            <li> I use this concealer to cover dark circles around my eyes.  Also to cover up age spots.  Works great.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetics junkie, I have to try just about every new thing that comes to my attention. Based on generally good reviews, I was tempted to pick this up, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. This will definitely be added into my regular rotation of items I&#x27;ll use. As a matter of fact, I carry an extra in my purse for \\&quot;emergencies.\\&quot; It blends and covers very well on those glowingly-reddish monsters that seem to come to life when you least want to see them. Also, they work on those little scars that need covering up. Start with just a touch and dab it with clean fingers and your \\&quot;oops\\&quot; will become almost invisible and last for hours! A definite recommendation.</li>
            <li> This product can cake very easily, so be careful! And I find it lasts longer when covered with a finishing powder. It has great coverage though!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan. It barely conceals any blemishes and stays on for about 10 seconds.  It was cheap for a reason - it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> Great value. Love this concealer stick. Been using this product for ten years.</li>
            <li> Can not buy this at that price elsewhere</li>
            <li> covers acne and even scabs very well. Smooth to put on and not too oily. Stays on for a long time (compared to other concealers)without wearing off.</li>
            <li> This product has been a long time staple in my make up routine.  I put it on after foundation for a perfect blemish or discoloration concealer.</li>
            <li> On time, correct color, no problems. I would purchase This again.</li>
            <li> works great, very good coverage &amp; convenient for travel</li>
            <li> The coverage is only fair and an application does not last very long. I had just purchased at retail a Covergirl 710 #4072 and was not happy with the results.

            <li> Perfect shade. Perfect everything</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a white boy like me and need to fix the dark circles under your eyes. This is a great little stick to figure out people that you&#x27;re a total emo. I use this little trick every day so people don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m such a big scary man ha ha my eyes my eyes there so amazing with this. Just buy this crap!</li>
