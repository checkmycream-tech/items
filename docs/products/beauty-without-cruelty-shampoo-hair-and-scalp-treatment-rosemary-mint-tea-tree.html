            <li>Works good but its always a good idea to alternate shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>I also wanted it to be affordable, natural, and great to my hair.</li>
            <li>They soften my hair, and the wonderful scent is unlike anything you&#x27;ll find in any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>Since I have dyed/stained hair, products with strong soap ingredients remove the stain faster in my case, which is undesirable.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels so much!!</li>
            <li>, so this is a HUGE improvement!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I discovered this brand when searching for cruelty free shampoo, and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite shampoo AND am am savinga ton compared to what I am used to spending!  </li>
            <li>I have really dry, itchy, flaky scalp, but really oily hair, so this shampoo is absolutely perfect for me!!</li>
            <li>It works great on my oily scalp, but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair</li>
            <li>It makes your hair and scalp feel so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I used to get super greasy hair</li>
            <li>highly highly highly recommend this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>this shampoo works really well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell it apart from other shampoo, nothing outstanding,  It smells more of Melon than Rosemary.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, cleans well and is a natural cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>This is the first BWC  brand shampoo that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell too!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m using vegan shampoo.</li>
            <li>After just ONE shampoo and round of conditioner, my hair is super silky, shiny and the most manageable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge huge huge lifesaver for my poor hair and scalp!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really feels aroma-therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise though, I think it cleans my hair very well</li>
            <li>in addition to being very invigorating with out being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers well, so don&#x27;t need to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>I might buy Aveda next time to see if it is worth the 400% markup!.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good and later-cleaning was thin.</li>
            <li>BWC honestly makes products that are equal, if not better than high end products.</li>
            <li>I have seen since I was young!</li>
            <li>With me being older, I have fly away hair and stubborn greys that stick up like crazy.</li>
            <li>I keeps your hair feeling soft as well.  </li>
            <li>I mix 100% natural Aloe in with the shampoo</li>
            <li>I have my 22 year old daughter using BWC now also</li>
            <li>I have dry scalp and it works very well for that</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the first BWC  brand shampoo that I have used.  I love the Rosemary Mint smell.  It makes your hair and scalp feel so clean and fresh.  The smell is awesome, without making you smell minty all day.  It really feels aroma-therapeutic.  I keeps your hair feeling soft as well.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great cruelty free product, shipped out quickly by vendor.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well!</li>
            <li> not much in the way of mint or rosemary scent ... a bit of tea tree, but overall a bit underwhelming</li>
            <li> Works good but its always a good idea to alternate shampoos. I mix 100% natural Aloe in with the shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo leaves my hair smelling good love it :)</li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite shampoo AND am am savinga ton compared to what I am used to spending!  I absolutley love the smell and I adore how my hair feels after cleaning with this shampoo!  I cannot wait to take a shower everyday!</li>
            <li> I used agenda rosemary mint and was looking for a less expensive version. This isn&#x27;t it. Doesn&#x27;t smell good and later-cleaning was thin.</li>
            <li> I was using gud shampoo and conditioner but it was leaving my hair dry... found bwc and I love it.  Love the smell, feel and my hair is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the conditioner for a year now and will not use anything else. It smells fresh, cleans well and is a natural cruelty free product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s really good for sensitive scalps. My hair is oily at the roots and dry at the end. When I wash my hair with this shampoo it&#x27;s feels really healthy and clean! I still have to use conditioner on the ends though. Best part is that it&#x27;s cruelty free! I really like the smell too!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using vegan shampoo. As seen in other comments, I&#x27;ve ordered this item with conditioner at the same time. It keeps my hair clean, it smells nice and I have no objections whatsoever. As soon as I run out of this shampoo, I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know what to say about the shampoo because I received the conditioner instead. And the item is not eligible for replacement.</li>
            <li> For those you who do not like using sulfate based shampoos, it should be noted that while the product is SLS-free, the second ingredient is sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate (which is also a version of soap/detergent). Since I have dyed/stained hair, products with strong soap ingredients remove the stain faster in my case, which is undesirable. On the product description it does not mention this ingredient. I think it may be showing the conditioner ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise though, I think it cleans my hair very well and I like the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy considering most shampoo products no longer come in 16 oz availability.  I like tea tree in my shampoo product so this is also a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  Does not fade my hennaed hair</li>
            <li> Cruelty free!!!!!  Yeah!</li>
            <li> this shampoo works really well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product. I have dry scalp and it works very well for that in addition to being very invigorating with out being overpowering.  I might buy Aveda next time to see if it is worth the 400% markup!. Keep you posted. Buy it you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo! It did a great job of cleansing my hair of the product I wear during the day. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell it apart from other shampoo, nothing outstanding,  It smells more of Melon than Rosemary.</li>
            <li> Very good cleaner not so much a moisturizer, but really good as body cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great &amp; smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, itchy, flaky scalp, but really oily hair, so this shampoo is absolutely perfect for me!! It&#x27;s a huge huge huge lifesaver for my poor hair and scalp!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the mint and citrus in the shampoo does wonders for my oily hair. I can actually go 3 days without washing the hair (I used a showercap because I didn&#x27;t think I needed to wash my hair in the shower) and the hair only starts beginning to look greasy at the roots on the 4th day. I used to get super greasy hair literally the day after I washed my hair, so this is a HUGE improvement!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the rosemary and tea tree is frigging amazing for my scalp. I love how it feels so much!! The tingly feeling (the mint probably also contributes) that I get when I put it on in the shower is so soothing for my itchy scalp!!! For the 1st couple of days I no longer have dandruff with this shampoo, but my scalp starts itching again after the 1st day unfortunately, but I&#x27;m willing to live with it. It&#x27;s much less itchy than it used to be. My scalp used to itch like crazy only an hour after washing my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, so don&#x27;t need to use too much of it. It smells great, WORKS WONDERS for me! I even asked my friends and family how they think my scalp looks, and they say they&#x27;re amazed by how healthy it looks! (It used to look flaky and have the occasional red scratch mark)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly highly highly recommend this shampoo!!! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found. I also love the rosemary mint conditioner and the leave-in conditioner. They soften my hair, and the wonderful scent is unlike anything you&#x27;ll find in any other shampoo. I discovered this brand when searching for cruelty free shampoo, and it exceeded my expectations. Try it!</li>
            <li> good product, but I received the conditioner not the shampoo I ordered</li>
            <li> BWC honestly makes products that are equal, if not better than high end products. I have used Aveda, Paul Mitchell and so on, and this BWC works better on my hair! With me being older, I have fly away hair and stubborn greys that stick up like crazy. After just ONE shampoo and round of conditioner, my hair is super silky, shiny and the most manageable I have seen since I was young! I have my 22 year old daughter using BWC now also and she loves it just as good as I do. You cannot go wrong with buying this line of products!</li>
            <li> I looked around for over a month for great vegan/vegetarian-friendly hair products. I also wanted it to be affordable, natural, and great to my hair. After using this product for months now, my hair is healthier and softer than it&#x27;s ever been. I recommend BWC to anyone looking for an affordable, vegan, great-smelling hair product. :-) Beauty Without Cruelty is also on PETA&#x27;s list of no-animal-testing/no-animal-ingredients skin and hair care products. Love that. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free and I love how it leaves my hair! 100% satisfied with product and customer service.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and had previously bought it from a Nutrition Center. It works great on my oily scalp, but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;It was also shipped and packages with care. Happy it is available through Amazon!</li>
