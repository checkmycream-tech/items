            <li>I was really excited about the good price.</li>
            <li>I got this cologne years ago and have not seen it since, by far the best CK cologne out there, need to market it more.</li>
            <li>I love how people appreciate and compliment my scent but most importantly I feel good about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>

            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This used to be one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>Still love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li>The girls love it, guys ask what you&#x27;re wearing, and you just smell ...</li>
            <li>Unless Calvin Klein has reformulated this cologne, the Contradiction that I received does not come close to the quality of the one I have used since a bit more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>we love it, me and my husband.</li>
            <li>Now the metal covering the glass spray bottle is square and it doesn&#x27;t seem as authentic meaning</li>
            <li>I wonder how customers have been able to give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been pleased ever since to wear it.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of this though.</li>
            <li>Ever since Hurricane Katrina, my boyfriend lost this favorite cologne of his and hasent been able to find it at any store.</li>
            <li>This is going in my \\&quot;always use\\&quot; section :-)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this ck and this one is his favorite .</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>all of us love it contradiction by calvin klein</li>
            <li>My husband gets a lot of compliments for this and has been faithfully wearing it for more than 13 years now.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this because not every one and their grandpa has this scent.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>It is just OK.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Calvin Klein fragrance&#x27;s but &amp;#34;Contradiction&amp;#34; just might be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I searched many sites trying to find this fragrance and was glad I found it and at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>It is a top quality product.</li>
            <li>and the ladies love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will like it...</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to still buy this product.  </li>
            <li>BUT I WILL SAY I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for years and still get many complimates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the woman&#x27;s version smells better than the men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it was ok and</li>
            <li>This is also I am pleased to say a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li>so I am glad to be able to purchase it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>A perfect subtle scent that smells great</li>
            <li>very clean sent, not over powering...</li>
            <li>This is a clean masculine scent and dosent arrive before I do, its not overpowering so its a good choice for work days.&lt;br /&gt;This has been discontinued from Calvin Klein but Amazon has a great price and hassel free shipping</li>
            <li>I do like it because it has a clean crisp smell that it is attractive.</li>
            <li>It is spicy and strong and that is what I love.</li>
            <li>I love this smell, its not too strong or musky</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easily in the top tier of all I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>To me, at least, it is not the equivalent of the wonderful original version even as it is quite pleasant...</li>
            <li>Although this fragrance is no longer available in stores, I love that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li>It is more of a sweet refreshing smell rather than a musky scent.</li>
            <li>The perfume was good and it was fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I loved the smell so much.</li>
            <li>its smells very nice.i think everyone should try it, a good mens cologne..</li>
            <li>I got this as a father&#x27;s day gift for my papa, it smells really fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>The original was so good the first time I smelled</li>
            <li>So feel all the better to have received an original item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly in execllent condition.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li>even though I wouldn&#x27;t normally dream of asking another guy what he was wearing this stuff smelled so good</li>
            <li>Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to make his man feel special, love it!</li>
            <li>Its not too strong but not too light either.</li>
            <li>I like contradiction for its smooth fragrance , strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>This bottle was a nice large bottle.</li>
            <li>Fantastic experience!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was left wondering if this one was a knock off because it just didn&#x27;t smell that great</li>
            <li>fantastic price also</li>
            <li>cologne smells great and last quite a while.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my everyday use of going to school and hanging out.</li>
            <li>It makes a great present</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>This cologne has a light scent to it that is not musky.</li>
            <li>I also was very happy about how fast I received this product after ordering and paying for it, I will definitely keep doing business with Amazon.</li>
            <li>this cologne smells good, its a natural blow dem away scent.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It was good service and it got to destination fast and safe, thanks a lot for that</li>
            <li>Thanks Again ...!!!</li>
            <li>Really!!!  AYFKM.</li>
            <li>The scent is too mild and fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>Gifted to my friend on his marriage ,he loves it very much.</li>
            <li>Test it in the store first to be sure you like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really better to buy it in a store so you can test it first.</li>
            <li>But I have used other colognes in the CK line escape, eternity, euphoria, CK one , etc,  but none is more successful than the Contradiction for Men, EDT Spray..</li>
            <li>Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li>the quality is ok, this product is exactly like the website said about it.</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>The scent is most exquisite, a little sweet thing that I really like.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes on my guy, it mixed with his natural chemical smell and turned out to be PERFECT for him.  </li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s not sold in department stores like Macy&#x27;s, it&#x27;s easily available online for much cheaper prices making it that much more enticing to purchase.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy something fresh or clean.</li>
            <li>it has a very pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Now it smells great but more alcoholic.</li>
            <li>The scent is just so damn good, its not overpowering, I always look for something lite but enough for females to notice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent for men.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell</li>
            <li>Not bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells great on him as do other Calvin Klein scents.</li>
            <li>Great job getting this here before we expected!  </li>
            <li>It is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, but for someone who loves a more lasting scent, I am not experiencing that with this product.</li>
            <li>It is ok, it did not really last for more than 2-3hrs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always super quick and the item is as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get it long time ago until I find it at Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; clean, sporty (but not like alcohol smelly), and such a turn on.</li>
            <li>If you like a light, yet crisp and fresh smell that lasts through out the day, C.K. Contradiction is for you.</li>
            <li>The price is also pretty cheap for such a nice scent and 3.4 oz/ 100ml.</li>
            <li>Good thing is that they still make that cologne, I am pretty sure that I would buy another bottle in the near future</li>
            <li>This is a simple,nice crisp clean scent...</li>
            <li>5 STARS FOR A TRUE  BLUE CLASSIC SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that smells fresh with a pinch of powder, go for it.</li>
            <li>Soft and elegant.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was not even worth the amount I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and the price to both its refreshing a mature smell.</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>CK has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have found Contradiction By Calvin Klein For Men on Amazon and for such a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>It smells different and pretty nice after a while you spread it.</li>
            <li>I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing.</li>
            <li>It has a classic, clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and crisp.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments while wearing this out socially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Armani Code and Black smell good</li>
            <li>Suddenly there are already new fragrances, but this is a great classic: very tasty</li>
            <li>but I like the aluminum cap very much.</li>
            <li>Without a shadow of a doubt this is the exact product at one of the cheapest cost with lightning speed shipping.  </li>
            <li>the scent of the Contradiction for Men - Calvin Klein was pretty beutiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne without smelling first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even going to go into the current smell of this stuff here because if you want to know this you can read almost anyone of more than a dozen reviews surrounding this one.  </li>
            <li>This scent drove my first girlfriend nuts...</li>
            <li>My husband wore this when we first started dating.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances I have ever bought, but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour or 2.  </li>
            <li>now i get all women i am with to squirt thanks to contradiction!  </li>
            <li>I hope I can get it later when I need more.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite and only cologne that I use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this cologne was about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>i will order more next time i need a cologne</li>
            <li>in2u, I was taken by surprise with the first spray.</li>
            <li>Recognizable from 10 feet away.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself as I was generally using axe before its a nice scent it does fade after I few hours which I expect but great overall</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, he has his sexy scent back.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CLASSY AND MASCULINE SCENTS</li>
            <li>I like Calvin Klein as a whole, and this was my first perfume from this brand.     </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and lasting without being overbearing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li>Very upset since it was a gift for my husband.</li>
            <li>Very unethical business.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve really fond memories attached to this fragrance</li>
            <li>The item was delivered very promptly.  </li>
            <li>and really it doesn&#x27;t remind me any of Calvin Klein product that I&#x27;m accustomed to.</li>
            <li>It has a very intoxicating effect on me when my boyfriend wears it.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt take much of it to get the jobs done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they use any unusual element in it, but the scent wakes me up from drowsiness.</li>
            <li>Will definitely suggest this to anyone that liked this specific men&#x27;s fragerence and can no longer find it in a store as I did.</li>
            <li>Clear, daily favorite since 1999.</li>
            <li>I will search for other favorites at your site once I have a better job.</li>
            <li>baiugh it based on other reviews and now totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>It first comes on really strong compared to other fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s initial scent lasts about 3 hours but there is a clean finish that lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>You know how eventually all colognes and perfumes all kind of smell the same after too long.</li>
            <li>Must confess that this perfume did certainly live up to its name - A Contradiction to the very concept of a perfume.</li>
            <li>It was, more or less, distinctive and promised a premium product.  </li>
            <li>So if you only need it for a meeting or a quick date then this is it.</li>
            <li>A small spray is all you need to have that great CK smell all day long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I got this fragrance as a gift when I was in high school</li>
            <li>The smell was a little bit better and it had a watery color.</li>
            <li>the aroma is pleasant enough for daily wear and it last pretty long.</li>
            <li>Goes great in the daytime or evening, casual or dress.</li>
            <li>I received a tester instead of new product.</li>
            <li>I was looking to buy some new perfumes and came across this....</li>
            <li>Very masculine, but not musky.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft for my taste.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those persons who don&#x27;t like it strong &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li>The American version must be a little more different or use different ingredients because the smell of this was no where near as nice and not the same smell as the one my friend had purchased us.</li>
            <li>Original product, it arrived early than i expected, they also keep you informed of your package along the transition.  </li>
            <li>I also bought a Jean Paul Gaultier cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue.</li>
            <li>I think this will be my first and last time buying cologne online.</li>
            <li>Oh well..... Something must&#x27;ve changed as I don&#x27;t think this is exactly the same product.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>it is a little sharp and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Other reviews I read indicated a long-lasting scent, which is true.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a watered down version of the original</li>
            <li>It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne.</li>
            <li>Has a soft sandalwood fragrance...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Better for a mature person may be a dad</li>
            <li>Maybe for a kid or a young adult.  </li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>AND USE IT FREQUENTLY.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 25 yr old son for Christmas...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that far but seems to lost its smell.</li>
            <li>It is a soft smell not too over powering.</li>
            <li>Its a lovely scent but not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>The original version of this I remember came in a round metal cylinder encased bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more for the small bottle.</li>
            <li>just no where near as distinctive and less powerful too.</li>
            <li>I ordered Encounter and Contradiction at the same time and guess what - they smell absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>this eau de toilette is really a fraude, the fragance does not exist, its evaporate instantly, just at the same moment you use It, this never happended to me before with this one or with any othet cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>No other way to describe it.  </li>
            <li>its fresh and subtle and very manly aroma.  </li>
            <li>Funnily enough, I bought this cologne when I was in High School to impress a girl...way back in 2001...</li>
            <li>but I generally like any fragrance by Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li>Saw the reviews about the scent not lasting long, and i agree for the most part maybe an hour or 2 then its hard to notice.</li>
            <li>I dont&#x27; like strong fragrances, but this is too weak.</li>
            <li>This cologne was difficult to find in brick &amp; mortar locations, easy to get on Amazon!</li>
            <li>In the store it was priced twice as much as I paid for it on this site, for half the amount.</li>
            <li>Not available in stores any more, or at least not sold in major stores.</li>
            <li>IT smells well, but not long lasting</li>
            <li>My man in a serious type that works out and doesn&#x27;t like all those sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle, sweet and I get the sandlewood smell they mention.</li>

            <li> It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This used to be one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> Still love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> The girls love it, guys ask what you&#x27;re wearing, and you just smell ...</li>
            <li> Unless Calvin Klein has reformulated this cologne, the Contradiction that I received does not come close to the quality of the one I have used since a bit more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> we love it, me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Now the metal covering the glass spray bottle is square and it doesn&#x27;t seem as authentic meaning</li>
            <li> I wonder how customers have been able to give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been pleased ever since to wear it.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of this though.</li>
            <li> Ever since Hurricane Katrina, my boyfriend lost this favorite cologne of his and hasent been able to find it at any store.</li>
            <li> This is going in my \\&quot;always use\\&quot; section :-)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this ck and this one is his favorite .</li>

            <li> This is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this because not every one and their grandpa has this scent.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> It is just OK.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Calvin Klein fragrance&#x27;s but &amp;#34;Contradiction&amp;#34; just might be my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I searched many sites trying to find this fragrance and was glad I found it and at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> It is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> and the ladies love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will like it...</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to still buy this product.  </li>
            <li> BUT I WILL SAY I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for years and still get many complimates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the woman&#x27;s version smells better than the men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but it was ok and</li>
            <li> This is also I am pleased to say a trustworthy seller.</li>
            <li> so I am glad to be able to purchase it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> A perfect subtle scent that smells great</li>
            <li> very clean sent, not over powering...</li>
            <li> This is a clean masculine scent and dosent arrive before I do, its not overpowering so its a good choice for work days.&lt;br /&gt;This has been discontinued from Calvin Klein but Amazon has a great price and hassel free shipping</li>
            <li> I do like it because it has a clean crisp smell that it is attractive.</li>
            <li> It is spicy and strong and that is what I love.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, its not too strong or musky</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easily in the top tier of all I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> To me, at least, it is not the equivalent of the wonderful original version even as it is quite pleasant...</li>
            <li> Although this fragrance is no longer available in stores, I love that Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> It is more of a sweet refreshing smell rather than a musky scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume was good and it was fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I loved the smell so much.</li>
            <li> its smells very nice.i think everyone should try it, a good mens cologne..</li>
            <li> I got this as a father&#x27;s day gift for my papa, it smells really fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> The original was so good the first time I smelled</li>
            <li> So feel all the better to have received an original item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly in execllent condition.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li> even though I wouldn&#x27;t normally dream of asking another guy what he was wearing this stuff smelled so good</li>
            <li> Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to make his man feel special, love it!</li>
            <li> Its not too strong but not too light either.</li>
            <li> I like contradiction for its smooth fragrance , strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> This bottle was a nice large bottle.</li>
            <li> Fantastic experience!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was left wondering if this one was a knock off because it just didn&#x27;t smell that great</li>
            <li> fantastic price also</li>
            <li> cologne smells great and last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my everyday use of going to school and hanging out.</li>
            <li> It makes a great present</li>
            <li> enjoy</li>
            <li> This cologne has a light scent to it that is not musky.</li>
            <li> I also was very happy about how fast I received this product after ordering and paying for it, I will definitely keep doing business with Amazon.</li>
            <li> this cologne smells good, its a natural blow dem away scent.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It was good service and it got to destination fast and safe, thanks a lot for that</li>
            <li> Thanks Again ...!!!</li>
            <li> Really!!!  AYFKM.</li>
            <li> The scent is too mild and fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> Gifted to my friend on his marriage ,he loves it very much.</li>
            <li> Test it in the store first to be sure you like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really better to buy it in a store so you can test it first.</li>
            <li> But I have used other colognes in the CK line escape, eternity, euphoria, CK one , etc,  but none is more successful than the Contradiction for Men, EDT Spray..</li>
            <li> Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li> the quality is ok, this product is exactly like the website said about it.</li>
            <li> I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li> The scent is most exquisite, a little sweet thing that I really like.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes on my guy, it mixed with his natural chemical smell and turned out to be PERFECT for him.  </li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not sold in department stores like Macy&#x27;s, it&#x27;s easily available online for much cheaper prices making it that much more enticing to purchase.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy something fresh or clean.</li>
            <li> it has a very pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Now it smells great but more alcoholic.</li>
            <li> The scent is just so damn good, its not overpowering, I always look for something lite but enough for females to notice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent for men.</li>
            <li> Sweet smell</li>
            <li> Not bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells great on him as do other Calvin Klein scents.</li>
            <li> Great job getting this here before we expected!  </li>
            <li> It is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, but for someone who loves a more lasting scent, I am not experiencing that with this product.</li>
            <li> It is ok, it did not really last for more than 2-3hrs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always super quick and the item is as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get it long time ago until I find it at Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; clean, sporty (but not like alcohol smelly), and such a turn on.</li>
            <li> If you like a light, yet crisp and fresh smell that lasts through out the day, C.K. Contradiction is for you.</li>
            <li> The price is also pretty cheap for such a nice scent and 3.4 oz/ 100ml.</li>
            <li> Good thing is that they still make that cologne, I am pretty sure that I would buy another bottle in the near future</li>
            <li> This is a simple,nice crisp clean scent...</li>
            <li> 5 STARS FOR A TRUE  BLUE CLASSIC SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that smells fresh with a pinch of powder, go for it.</li>
            <li> Soft and elegant.</li>
            <li> it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was not even worth the amount I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and the price to both its refreshing a mature smell.</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> CK has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have found Contradiction By Calvin Klein For Men on Amazon and for such a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> It smells different and pretty nice after a while you spread it.</li>
            <li> I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing.</li>
            <li> It has a classic, clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and crisp.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments while wearing this out socially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Armani Code and Black smell good</li>
            <li> Suddenly there are already new fragrances, but this is a great classic: very tasty</li>
            <li> but I like the aluminum cap very much.</li>
            <li> Without a shadow of a doubt this is the exact product at one of the cheapest cost with lightning speed shipping.  </li>
            <li> the scent of the Contradiction for Men - Calvin Klein was pretty beutiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne without smelling first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to go into the current smell of this stuff here because if you want to know this you can read almost anyone of more than a dozen reviews surrounding this one.  </li>
            <li> This scent drove my first girlfriend nuts...</li>
            <li> My husband wore this when we first started dating.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances I have ever bought, but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour or 2.  </li>
            <li> now i get all women i am with to squirt thanks to contradiction!  </li>
            <li> I hope I can get it later when I need more.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite and only cologne that I use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this cologne was about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> i will order more next time i need a cologne</li>
            <li> in2u, I was taken by surprise with the first spray.</li>
            <li> Recognizable from 10 feet away.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as I was generally using axe before its a nice scent it does fade after I few hours which I expect but great overall</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, he has his sexy scent back.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CLASSY AND MASCULINE SCENTS</li>
            <li> I like Calvin Klein as a whole, and this was my first perfume from this brand.     </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and lasting without being overbearing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li> Very upset since it was a gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> Very unethical business.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve really fond memories attached to this fragrance</li>
            <li> The item was delivered very promptly.  </li>
            <li> and really it doesn&#x27;t remind me any of Calvin Klein product that I&#x27;m accustomed to.</li>
            <li> It has a very intoxicating effect on me when my boyfriend wears it.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt take much of it to get the jobs done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they use any unusual element in it, but the scent wakes me up from drowsiness.</li>
            <li> Will definitely suggest this to anyone that liked this specific men&#x27;s fragerence and can no longer find it in a store as I did.</li>
            <li> Clear, daily favorite since 1999.</li>
            <li> I will search for other favorites at your site once I have a better job.</li>
            <li> baiugh it based on other reviews and now totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> It first comes on really strong compared to other fragrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s initial scent lasts about 3 hours but there is a clean finish that lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> You know how eventually all colognes and perfumes all kind of smell the same after too long.</li>
            <li> Must confess that this perfume did certainly live up to its name - A Contradiction to the very concept of a perfume.</li>
            <li> It was, more or less, distinctive and promised a premium product.  </li>
            <li> So if you only need it for a meeting or a quick date then this is it.</li>
            <li> A small spray is all you need to have that great CK smell all day long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance as a gift when I was in high school</li>
            <li> The smell was a little bit better and it had a watery color.</li>
            <li> the aroma is pleasant enough for daily wear and it last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Goes great in the daytime or evening, casual or dress.</li>
            <li> I received a tester instead of new product.</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy some new perfumes and came across this....</li>
            <li> Very masculine, but not musky.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft for my taste.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those persons who don&#x27;t like it strong &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> The American version must be a little more different or use different ingredients because the smell of this was no where near as nice and not the same smell as the one my friend had purchased us.</li>
            <li> Original product, it arrived early than i expected, they also keep you informed of your package along the transition.  </li>
            <li> I also bought a Jean Paul Gaultier cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue.</li>
            <li> I think this will be my first and last time buying cologne online.</li>
            <li> Oh well..... Something must&#x27;ve changed as I don&#x27;t think this is exactly the same product.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> it is a little sharp and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Other reviews I read indicated a long-lasting scent, which is true.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a watered down version of the original</li>
            <li> It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a soft sandalwood fragrance...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Better for a mature person may be a dad</li>
            <li> Maybe for a kid or a young adult.  </li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> AND USE IT FREQUENTLY.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 25 yr old son for Christmas...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that far but seems to lost its smell.</li>
            <li> It is a soft smell not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Its a lovely scent but not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> The original version of this I remember came in a round metal cylinder encased bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will spend more for the small bottle.</li>
            <li> just no where near as distinctive and less powerful too.</li>
            <li> I ordered Encounter and Contradiction at the same time and guess what - they smell absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> this eau de toilette is really a fraude, the fragance does not exist, its evaporate instantly, just at the same moment you use It, this never happended to me before with this one or with any othet cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> No other way to describe it.  </li>
            <li> its fresh and subtle and very manly aroma.  </li>
            <li> Funnily enough, I bought this cologne when I was in High School to impress a girl...way back in 2001...</li>
            <li> but I generally like any fragrance by Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li> Saw the reviews about the scent not lasting long, and i agree for the most part maybe an hour or 2 then its hard to notice.</li>
            <li> I dont&#x27; like strong fragrances, but this is too weak.</li>
            <li> This cologne was difficult to find in brick &amp; mortar locations, easy to get on Amazon!</li>
            <li> In the store it was priced twice as much as I paid for it on this site, for half the amount.</li>
            <li> Not available in stores any more, or at least not sold in major stores.</li>
            <li> IT smells well, but not long lasting</li>
            <li> My man in a serious type that works out and doesn&#x27;t like all those sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, sweet and I get the sandlewood smell they mention.</li>
            <li> With this bigger bottle it seems like I need 3 sprays, then it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep coming back as long as they carry it.</li>
            <li> I read other customers&#x27; reviews before purchasing and was disappointed at first because out of the bottle it was really strong</li>
            <li> I also like the bottle cap, which is the grey shell/top in the picture.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this scent for years, but it&#x27;s not available in the dept. stores near us anymore</li>
            <li> And it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Amazon did not indicate it was not a new retail product.  </li>
            <li> This supposedly the same cologne in a slightly updated presentation.  </li>
            <li> I thought this one will smell better but is not too bad...</li>
            <li> i was a lonely man until i squirted this on my body.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like it, it may even be made by the same company, but something went wrong with it at some point, either it stored in some place too hot or cold, because the SCENT DOES NOT LAST.</li>
            <li> I was actually considering buying a few bottles of this to keep in stock.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten which scent we&#x27;d purchased a few years back.</li>
            <li> THEY CAME FASTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> I wore it a few years ago, and went back to it.</li>
            <li> The military exchanges stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I have a wide variety of scents.</li>
            <li> Bought this product first time 10 years ago so feeling nostalgic</li>
            <li> This sits well with my other colognes (D&amp;G, Versace, Armani, Polo, Etc)</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled sick and to top it in a matter of a month, the fragrance seemed missing...</li>
            <li> at least 70-100 women tell me &amp;#34;I smell great&amp;#34; or at a public venue...</li>
            <li> I recieved the product in less than five days, and would recommend the Cologne, and this service to anyone.</li>
            <li> I get it for less here.</li>
            <li> Not a full grown man.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order a colonge without smelling it</li>
            <li> wore Issey Mikaki for a little bit and bought the woman&#x27;s version for my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing but a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The box was plain brown and the tester was without a cap and used.  </li>
            <li> I think it may be plastic made to look like metal (not sure)?  </li>
            <li> It lasts no more than an hour</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I shipped it outside of USA before I could test it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a decade, not sure when I will stop using this.</li>
            <li> Also not many store carries it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying what I wore in the past</li>
            <li> Hard to find til I looked on here.</li>
            <li> This item was hard to find .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to find.</li>
            <li> Have had some negative experiences with counterfeit products lately.</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> This meets my expectations in quality and duration (the scent wont disapear in just a little while; thats always disappointing).</li>
            <li> I got the fake one.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise buying this blindly online.  </li>
            <li> But sadly, the scent smelled like &#x27;rubbing alcohol&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Fake?  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very difficult or even impossible to find in dept stores.</li>
            <li> too bad the stores like Macy&#x27;s Van Maur, Sephora and the alike do not carry it.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I heard that CK was going to stop selling this fragrance</li>
            <li> Deeply disappointed....</li>
            <li> A loss of $28 :(</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by a CK product.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed that CK is discontinuing this fragrance!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excelente Product! I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Once again AMAZON has come through in the CLUTCH.....  I have been looking for this Calvin Klein (Contradiction) for months. Every store I go in tells me they are out of stock and the Fragrance is discontinued, I have allergies so I can&#x27;t wear just any cologne and this one Smells Great and doesnt bother me and is one of my Favorites....  Thanks Again ...!!!</li>
            <li> This piece of c**p has no smell or whatsoever. Didn&#x27;t expect something like this from cK. May be I got the fake one.</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful, sweet but manly scent. I love how people appreciate and compliment my scent but most importantly I feel good about it. My roommate borrows it every once in a while when he&#x27;s going on a date or to a party. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> When I found out that Contradiction was no longer going to be sold in the US I thought I would never find this again. It&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and I was determined to find it. Thanks to Amazon, he has his sexy scent back. lol</li>
            <li> Without a shadow of a doubt this is the exact product at one of the cheapest cost with lightning speed shipping.  Will definitely suggest this to anyone that liked this specific men&#x27;s fragerence and can no longer find it in a store as I did.</li>
            <li> Kind of vintage, not in the good sense but I like the aluminum cap very much. Makes me think if that was the most expensive part...</li>
            <li> Este perfume lo uso hace mas de 10 a&amp;ntilde;os y es muy bueno , dura mucho la fragancia y es muy varonil</li>
            <li> The perfume was good and it was fast. It was smelling good when I try it on. I would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY . I LIKE THE SMELL. I RECOMEND.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume por el precio. A los caballeros les recomiendo el Contradiction by Calvin Klein. Llego rapido a mi buzon. Gracias.</li>
            <li> the scent of the Contradiction for Men - Calvin Klein was pretty beutiful. I like Calvin Klein as a whole, and this was my first perfume from this brand.     It smells different and pretty nice after a while you spread it. RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE. The price is also pretty cheap for such a nice scent and 3.4 oz/ 100ml.</li>
            <li> I received a tester instead of new product. The box was plain brown and the tester was without a cap and used.  Very upset since it was a gift for my husband. There was no phone contact so I was stuck with it.  Amazon did not indicate it was not a new retail product.  Very unethical business.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have found Contradiction By Calvin Klein For Men on Amazon and for such a reasonable price too. I also was very happy about how fast I received this product after ordering and paying for it, I will definitely keep doing business with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Buyed for my husband...I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne without smelling first.  I did all my Christmas shopping on line this year and didn&#x27;t want this to be an exception.  I read other customers&#x27; reviews before purchasing and was disappointed at first because out of the bottle it was really strong and I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it.  After about 10 minutes on my guy, it mixed with his natural chemical smell and turned out to be PERFECT for him.  Other reviews I read indicated a long-lasting scent, which is true.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise buying this blindly online.  Test it in the store first to be sure you like it.  The price was right, and the packing and shipping were excellent.  I also like the bottle cap, which is the grey shell/top in the picture.  It&#x27;s easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li> The scent is just so damn good, its not overpowering, I always look for something lite but enough for females to notice and this cologne is it.  Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I buy this scent for my husband everytime he runs out.  It is my favorite.  Very masculine, but not musky.  It is not overpowering either.</li>
            <li> Original product, it arrived early than i expected, they also keep you informed of your package along the transition.  I just had to pay customs in which i didn&#x27;t know about.  but i am very happy and i am surely buying again in tuccini:)</li>
            <li> Great aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Excellent, I&#x27;ve always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Suddenly there are already new fragrances, but this is a great classic: very tasty</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne before and really liked it. In the store it was priced twice as much as I paid for it on this site, for half the amount. I recieved the product in less than five days, and would recommend the Cologne, and this service to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause I was really excited about the good price. It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne. It smells exactly like it, it may even be made by the same company, but something went wrong with it at some point, either it stored in some place too hot or cold, because the SCENT DOES NOT LAST. I&#x27;m telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so. This scent from this online bottle is gone within in an hour. This is also not a lone case. I also bought a Jean Paul Gaultier cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue. I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing. If you buy it here and notice the scent doesn&#x27;t last, you&#x27;ll know why</li>
            <li> This used to be one of my favorite fragrances. I received it a few weeks ago, and it smells stronger, not the masculine but soft touch it used to have. Now it smells great but more alcoholic. I called Coty NY (manufacturers), and they told me my bottle was manufactured on december 2010, so it&#x27;s not expired. Just different. Still love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance as a gift when I was in high school and I used it only when going on a date. So, I&#x27;ve really fond memories attached to this fragrance and my girlfriend loves it on me. I was really disappointed when I heard that CK was going to stop selling this fragrance but Amazon came to my rescue! I was actually considering buying a few bottles of this to keep in stock.    Its not too strong but not too light either. Its almost the perfect balance. And it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered very promptly.  But sadly, the scent smelled like &#x27;rubbing alcohol&#x27;.  No other way to describe it.  I think this will be my first and last time buying cologne online. It&#x27;s really better to buy it in a store so you can test it first.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance for years until it was discontiuned.  Happy to find that Amazon still has it.  Received very quickly in execllent condition.</li>
            <li> The girls love it, guys ask what you&#x27;re wearing, and you just smell ... Perfect</li>
            <li> Unless Calvin Klein has reformulated this cologne, the Contradiction that I received does not come close to the quality of the one I have used since a bit more than 10 years. Fake?  Deeply disappointed....and I bought 3 of the same! Sucks!</li>
            <li> choose this rating, because I think it&#x27;s great the processes to bring the product in good condition to my mailbox</li>
            <li> we love it, me and my husband. It has a perfect smell, reminds of teenage years when Calvin Klein was very popular. Good for men of all ages, for day or night use. so, simply perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product  This Product is the same as i hope. i am very happy with the product I will  recommend it.</li>
            <li> The original version of this I remember came in a round metal cylinder encased bottle.  It looked like a machined steel pipe you pulled off to reveal the pump bottle underneath.  It was, more or less, distinctive and promised a premium product.  This supposedly the same cologne in a slightly updated presentation.  Now the metal covering the glass spray bottle is square and it doesn&#x27;t seem as authentic meaning I think it may be plastic made to look like metal (not sure)?  Truly, I don&#x27;t care about this at all.  What I do care for is that I believe the fragrance has been changed.  The original was so good the first time I smelled it was on a customer in my store and even though I wouldn&#x27;t normally dream of asking another guy what he was wearing this stuff smelled so good I had to know.  I&#x27;m not even going to go into the current smell of this stuff here because if you want to know this you can read almost anyone of more than a dozen reviews surrounding this one.  What I do want folks to know who remember it from three or so years ago is that this seems like a completely different product.  To me, at least, it is not the equivalent of the wonderful original version even as it is quite pleasant...just no where near as distinctive and less powerful too.</li>
            <li> the aroma is pleasant enough for daily wear and it last pretty long. Over all the price and quality of product is good, almost perfect.</li>
            <li> This cologne was difficult to find in brick &amp; mortar locations, easy to get on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Must confess that this perfume did certainly live up to its name - A Contradiction to the very concept of a perfume. I wonder how customers have been able to give it a 5 star. I brought this brand, because of the Calvin Klien image, and seeing the reviews. The perfume smelled sick and to top it in a matter of a month, the fragrance seemed missing...it was like spraying water...    A loss of $28 :(</li>
            <li> This cologne is very difficult or even impossible to find in dept stores. I have used this cologne since its inception date in 1997. This scent drove my first girlfriend nuts...literally. But I have used other colognes in the CK line escape, eternity, euphoria, CK one , etc,  but none is more successful than the Contradiction for Men, EDT Spray..too bad the stores like Macy&#x27;s Van Maur, Sephora and the alike do not carry it.  I wonder if anyone knows why it went to the wayside?</li>
            <li> My husband wore this when we first started dating. I had heard it was dis-continued. I was so happy to find this again!!</li>
            <li> this cologne smells good, its a natural blow dem away scent. im impressed..  contradiction is definitely one of my fav now</li>
            <li> My husband was out of cologne. I&#x27;d forgotten which scent we&#x27;d purchased a few years back. This arrived and I realized it was not the same cologne he&#x27;d tried before. But it came in time for his stocking stuffer. He&#x27;s been pleased ever since to wear it. It smells great on him as do other Calvin Klein scents.</li>
            <li> Clear, daily favorite since 1999. I will search for other favorites at your site once I have a better job. I worked for Integrity at your largest facility where we set a 24 hour shipping record in 2012 (1,000,000+). Fantastic experience!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return. They really liked me there.</li>
            <li> Bought this product first time 10 years ago so feeling nostalgic I was wanted to refresh my memory lane. Oh well..... Something must&#x27;ve changed as I don&#x27;t think this is exactly the same product.  It lasts no more than an hour and really it doesn&#x27;t remind me any of Calvin Klein product that I&#x27;m accustomed to. At its best it is on par with products available at a convenience store</li>
            <li> A friend from the UK had purchased this for my husband. I purchased this because I loved the smell so much. The American version must be a little more different or use different ingredients because the smell of this was no where near as nice and not the same smell as the one my friend had purchased us. I was left wondering if this one was a knock off because it just didn&#x27;t smell that great and I loved the one from the UK.</li>
            <li> I had a 1 oz. bottle before this and the strength of the scent was stronger only needed one spray. With this bigger bottle it seems like I need 3 sprays, then it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. I wondered why their was such a price difference between the different sizes. Next time I will spend more for the small bottle. I do love the smell of this though. To me it is a woodsy kind of scent.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, but for someone who loves a more lasting scent, I am not experiencing that with this product. Its a lovely scent but not strong enough for me. The scent don&#x27;t last all day as I like my scents to do. I would recommend it to those persons who don&#x27;t like it strong &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only similarity to Calvin Klein is the packaging. Unfortunately I shipped it outside of USA before I could test it. I ordered Encounter and Contradiction at the same time and guess what - they smell absolutely the same. It&#x27;s nothing but a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hard to find til I looked on here. Just started using it again. Smells like I remember from years ago. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Ever since Hurricane Katrina, my boyfriend lost this favorite cologne of his and hasent been able to find it at any store. So I bought it for him (from you) and he hasent stopped thanking me or asking where I got it. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years, but we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. Amazon actually had it and for the cheapest price around. Its smells extremely good, he is always getting complimented on it.</li>
            <li> Has a soft sandalwood fragrance...Nice....FRA</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy some new perfumes and came across this.... baiugh it based on other reviews and now totally in love with it. This is going in my \\&quot;always use\\&quot; section :-)</li>
            <li> My man in a serious type that works out and doesn&#x27;t like all those sweet smelling colognes. This is a perfect scent for him. Nice &amp; clean, sporty (but not like alcohol smelly), and such a turn on. This bottle was a nice large bottle. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I thought this one will smell better but is not too bad...</li>
            <li> This item was hard to find . But I found it on amazon . My boyfriend loves this ck and this one is his favorite . It s perfect</li>
            <li> This is CK&#x27;s best cologne by far.Everyone who smells it comments on how good it smells.I hope Amazon keeps it in stock for future purchases.Enjoy!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances I have ever bought, but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour or 2.  So if you only need it for a meeting or a quick date then this is it.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent for men. It has a very intoxicating effect on me when my boyfriend wears it.</li>
            <li> Calvin klein brand has an excellent line of fragrances for being pleasant fragrances. The prefume was well received without details ambalado.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this line of perfumes, as well as the provider for its service quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Eder</li>
            <li> excellent, excellent smell all of us love it contradiction by calvin klein best best valentine,s gift for men by women.</li>
            <li> IT smells well, but not long lasting</li>
            <li> THEY CAME FASTER THAN EXPECTED. GREAT!</li>
            <li> i was a lonely man until i squirted this on my body.  now i get all women i am with to squirt thanks to contradiction!  fantastic price also</li>
            <li> this cologne is a great buy and I wanted to get it long time ago until I find it at Amazon for a good price.I hope I can get it later when I need more.</li>
            <li> This is more of a subtle fragrance.  It&#x27;s initial scent lasts about 3 hours but there is a clean finish that lasts longer.  Yet another CK fragrance that I find quite nice.  There are no spicy or musky notes here at all--which I am not a fan of.</li>
            <li> Gifted to my friend on his marriage ,he loves it very much.I have received compliments from him for this EDT gift.I like contradiction for its smooth fragrance , strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li> Although this fragrance is no longer available in stores, I love that Amazon still carries it. I have been looking for this cologne at Macy&#x27;s but the salesgirl said they no longer make it. Thanks Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband gets a lot of compliments for this and has been faithfully wearing it for more than 13 years now. Great price too!</li>
            <li> The scent is most exquisite, a little sweet thing that I really like. Calvin klein one that meets my expectations! // El aroma es de lo más exquisito, un poco dulce cosa que a mi me gusta mucho. Un calvin klein que llena mis expectativas!!</li>
            <li> Excelente producto..!!</li>
            <li> Its my favorite and only cologne that I use. If you can find it in a retail setting it&#x27;s three times the price. They only ship by ground but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll keep coming back as long as they carry it.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever made. I keep receiving a lot of compliments all the time. It has a classic, clean and fresh scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> It is very soft for my taste. I dont&#x27; like strong fragrances, but this is too weak. You apply it and within 15 minutes it has evaporated.</li>
            <li> Item arrived within a couple days, great packaging and new/sealed box. Great price and fast service, cant ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> This is a clean masculine scent and dosent arrive before I do, its not overpowering so its a good choice for work days.&lt;br /&gt;This has been discontinued from Calvin Klein but Amazon has a great price and hassel free shipping so they beat local&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;perfume outlets\\&quot; and no having to deal with pushy sales people. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wow! Ordered yesterday and came today.  Got this for christmas present so I don&#x27;t know if they will like it.</li>
            <li> Great Musky smell&lt;br /&gt;Better for a mature person may be a dad</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order a colonge without smelling it but I generally like any fragrance by Calvin Klein.  I was very happy with Contradiction it has a very pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Excelente Producto, recibido sin problemas en mis manos. Buenos colores y buen precio Gracias por el servicio y por buen producto.</li>
            <li> this I really like it, smell very good, my girlfriend like it</li>
            <li> exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> CONTRADICTION BY CK IS TRULY ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.   I LOVE CLASSY AND MASCULINE SCENTS AND THIS ONE HAS IT  ALL.TRUST ME, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!! 5 STARS FOR A TRUE  BLUE CLASSIC SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this cologne was about 10 years ago. The smell was a little bit better and it had a watery color. Now it has a blueish color and the smell now is a bit stronger. Overall I would rate this product with a 85% compare to what it used to be. Good thing is that they still make that cologne, I am pretty sure that I would buy another bottle in the near future</li>
            <li> muy buen producto , llego en buena condiciones estamos muy satisfechos con el producto , todo sin novedad y un buen servicio</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite. I have been using this for over a decade, not sure when I will stop using this. Not available in stores any more, or at least not sold in major stores. It is spicy and strong and that is what I love.</li>
            <li> It is ok, it did not really last for more than 2-3hrs. i am assuming it stays atleast for 4-6hrs</li>
            <li> ES LA PRIMERA VEZ QUE COMPRO UN PERFUME DE KALVIN KLEIN Y ME PARECE QUE TIENE UN AROMA QUE ME GUSTA MUCHO</li>
            <li> its smells very nice.i think everyone should try it, a good mens cologne..i will order more next time i need a cologne</li>
            <li> Seems like a watered down version of the original</li>
            <li> Very nice smell LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This EDT has a pleasant aroma and you can use by day, as well as at night. I recommend it totally and without reservations. I like it.</li>
            <li> very clean sent, not over powering... and it doesnt take much of it to get the jobs done. I wore it a few years ago, and went back to it. kind of a citrus smoke smell to it...</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, great sandalwood based cologne</li>
            <li> I love this because not every one and their grandpa has this scent. It&#x27;s fresh and crisp. It&#x27;s also hard to find.</li>
            <li> I got this as a father&#x27;s day gift for my papa, it smells really fresh and nice. It is more of a sweet refreshing smell rather than a musky scent. My Dad loves it and wears it anytime he goes out with my momma. Momma lives it as well</li>
            <li> This was a great price for a great product.  You are truly the value leader for all products.  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> good fragrance, came in time stated</li>
            <li> Definitely not my style.  The scent is too mild and fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell so good. I love it...no complaints here</li>
            <li> the quality is ok, this product is exactly like the website said about it. was a good purchase, all right</li>
            <li> Being a lover of CK in2u, I was taken by surprise with the first spray. Not that I am comparing it to in2u and belittling all the research that might have gone into th creation of this perfume, but, I personally can&#x27;t find enough occasions where I would like to wear this perfume to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not one of those perfumes that you would definitely want to have in your collection. It is just OK. I would say, if you like something that has spicy undertones, try something else. If you are looking for something that smells fresh with a pinch of powder, go for it.</li>
            <li> A fresh scent but of great durability. Soft and elegant. Recognizable from 10 feet away. Great value for money. Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> CK has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Calvin Klein fragrance&#x27;s but &amp;#34;Contradiction&amp;#34; just might be my favorite.  A small spray is all you need to have that great CK smell all day long.</li>
            <li> this eau de toilette is really a fraude, the fragance does not exist, its evaporate instantly, just at the same moment you use It, this never happended to me before with this one or with any othet cologne I have ever bought. I demand a total refund of my money.</li>
            <li> great great smell women love this guys really</li>
            <li> Funnily enough, I bought this cologne when I was in High School to impress a girl...way back in 2001...I had no clue about it&#x27;s smell or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we are in 2014, no department stores carry it, and i&#x27;m stuck with Perfumania or online to buy...but no need to worry...as I have truly at least 70-100 women tell me &amp;#34;I smell great&amp;#34; or at a public venue...&amp;#34;who is that that smells so good&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will wear this cologne until it&#x27;s not produced anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this smell, its not too strong or musky, I got this for my dad for a fathers day present and he loved it.</li>
            <li> I searched many sites trying to find this fragrance and was glad I found it and at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> I remember getting this cologne from Macy&#x27;s when I was about 16 or 17 and remembering how great it smelled. I&#x27;m now 30 and I still feel the same way. Though it&#x27;s not sold in department stores like Macy&#x27;s, it&#x27;s easily available online for much cheaper prices making it that much more enticing to purchase. If you like a light, yet crisp and fresh smell that lasts through out the day, C.K. Contradiction is for you. This sits well with my other colognes (D&amp;G, Versace, Armani, Polo, Etc) C.K. got this one right and I hope they never stop making this! I have received many compliments while wearing this out socially. Girls, do yourselves a favor and buy your guy this cologne, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Great price!  Gave it as a gift and it was a big hit.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy and for the price your getting a great deal. It is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> Very good in every aspect.Price is  cheaper than store price. Also not many store carries it.Buy it. it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never dissapointed when ordering from amazon. It&#x27;s always super quick and the item is as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells great and last quite a while. Perfect for my everyday use of going to school and hanging out. I get complements on how I smell good, which is great for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this cologne to all guys who love to smell good for hours.</li>
            <li> For the price point this cologne is amazing. I can&#x27;t describe it because well how do I do that but I can say I have gotten only compliments and wear it daily. I can see this costing $60+ at the dept store</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very good service, I recommend</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.  I chose this because my funds were low, but the next time, I&#x27;ll just wait.  It was not even worth the amount I paid for it.  Maybe for a kid or a young adult.  Not a full grown man.  I will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was good service and it got to destination fast and safe, thanks a lot for that, I will count on you in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Calvin Klein clothes and fragrances.  Contradiction is one of my favorites.  A perfect subtle scent that smells great and the ladies love it.  This is not your father&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my brothers and brother in laws...I&#x27;m sure they will like it...</li>
            <li> Great job getting this here before we expected!  So glad to be able to still buy this product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like it very much and the price to both its refreshing a mature smell. You should buy indeed C K all the way</li>
            <li> good product,very good supplier</li>
            <li> Muy buen perfume, una fragancia unica que puede cautivar a cualquier mujer que le guste un hombre bien oloroso! la recomiendo!</li>
            <li> Superb scent! Fresh, clean and lasting without being overbearing. Perfect for the day at the office.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself as I was generally using axe before its a nice scent it does fade after I few hours which I expect but great overall</li>
            <li> Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to make his man feel special, love it! It makes a great present</li>
            <li> I DECIEDED TO TRY THIS FRAGRANCE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO TEST BUT I WILL SAY I LOVE IT. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT 3 BOTTLES SO FAR AND USE IT FREQUENTLY. GOOD SCENT AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 25 yr old son for Christmas...its fresh and subtle and very manly aroma.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. It is fresh and clean. It works well with his body chemistry. It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> So disappointed that CK is discontinuing this fragrance! This was quite a bargain and the fragrance is not diminished by price or age. Great deal!</li>
            <li> This is a simple,nice crisp clean scent...not overpowering, can be worn anytime. Just makes him smell good. You will like it.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled about the EDT spray. It smells authentic and wonderful. Have had some negative experiences with counterfeit products lately. So feel all the better to have received an original item. This is just great :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell-- it is a little sharp and very refreshing. It almost has a unisex thing about it. I don&#x27;t know if they use any unusual element in it, but the scent wakes me up from drowsiness. If I were a man, I would definitely wear it.</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews about the scent not lasting long, and i agree for the most part maybe an hour or 2 then its hard to notice. But you get what you pay for, still a good scent!</li>
            <li> Excellente product and nice price</li>
            <li> I have used Contradiction for several years. The military exchanges stopped carrying it. That&#x27;s okay. I get it for less here. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A very nice clean scent, any woman will love. Goes great in the daytime or evening, casual or dress. I have been wearing it for years and still get many complimates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying what I wore in the past so you can understand my preferences...&lt;br /&gt;Last cologne was Acqua di Gio. Wore that for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Always love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;I wore Issey Mikaki for a little bit and bought the woman&#x27;s version for my wife. I think the woman&#x27;s version smells better than the men&#x27;s. The men&#x27;s was a bit musky and I would have to sneeze every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Before that JPG man. Girlfriend at the time bought me that. Sweet smell but it was ok and that was a younger time for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armani Code and Black smell good and I have tried from a friend before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So regarding this cologne. It smells like it has lost its fragrance. You know how eventually all colognes and perfumes all kind of smell the same after too long. It isn&#x27;t that far but seems to lost its smell. The smell is subtle, sweet and I get the sandlewood smell they mention. It is a soft smell not too over powering. For the price it is on here...you can&#x27;t beat it unless you go buy a knock off. Then again you could just go buy some AXE. Not bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on me last night to see if I could smell it in the morning and it seems to last.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne years ago and have not seen it since, by far the best CK cologne out there, need to market it more.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by a CK product.  I&#x27;ve never owned this cologne until now, and now that I do it&#x27;s easily in the top tier of all I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have a wide variety of scents. I particularly enjoy something fresh or clean. This meets my expectations in quality and duration (the scent wont disapear in just a little while; thats always disappointing). This is also I am pleased to say a trustworthy seller. hopefully this shed some lite into your buying options. enjoy</li>
            <li> This cologne has a light scent to it that is not musky. It will last for a while. It first comes on really strong compared to other fragrances. I do like it because it has a clean crisp smell that it is attractive.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. This is just my opinion and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!!  AYFKM. Jusy Saying.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this scent for years, but it&#x27;s not available in the dept. stores near us anymore so I am glad to be able to purchase it at Amazon. We both love the scent and this size bottle is a great value.</li>
