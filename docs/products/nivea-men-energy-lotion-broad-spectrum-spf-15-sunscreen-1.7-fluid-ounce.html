            <li>Great price and fast delivery to boot</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more from this.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer for the face and very soothing after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to do what it is supposed to do and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>for many applications.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the lotion.</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously top notch.</li>
            <li>SPF on top of that seals the deal.</li>
            <li>Nice light lotion.</li>
            <li>it is suitable for my daily lift good !</li>
            <li>Great product - makes aging male skin much more supple and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is a good face lotion for men, will hydrate your face very well without leaving any sticky, greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Great product, put it on every morning and skin feels much better during the entire day.</li>
            <li>Spf 15 is great for the face daily , even in cloudy weather, everyone should use something like this.</li>
            <li>Looking for a gel or light lotion, this is neither.</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily.</li>
            <li>Great face lotion with a nice fresh smell plus SPF protection which usually doesn&#x27;t come with after shave lotions.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs well, not greasy, and has a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>no way that is true.</li>
            <li>Use this after the shave  to keep the face fresh and smooth feeling, has sunblock and Q10 too.</li>
            <li>Speaking of smooth, I love how this keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>the goods is very good,and i love it very much.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and more elastic - worth every penny.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Other are good except too much perfume.</li>
            <li>I like this a LOT better than the Nivea gel moisturizer that comes in the same bottle.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS FACIAL LOTION - lasts all day and not greasy, light and once on it feels natural.</li>
            <li>I use the Nivea regular non SPF moisturizer and love that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the sun screen smell at first but now that it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and use it everyday after a shower to keep the face fresh and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>not expensive.</li>
            <li>Look 10 years younger :)</li>
            <li>Good protection, but the cream is too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I get a lot of &#x27;energy&#x27; from putting on this lotion, but I have read that caffeine content in lotion can have a positive effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product; as my son recently finished his one and only container/canister.&lt;br /&gt;Placing my order today on Amazon; I&#x27;m looking forward to see his surprised and HAPPY expression on his face when it is delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the Q10 does any good, but that&#x27;s not why I buy it.</li>
            <li>my face felt more dry then before I applied it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting too much from it.</li>
            <li>Who wants to put Gel on their face?</li>
            <li>Can is pretty small, but the product is effective.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t apply it near your eyes !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; products and most are either watered down, or</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re moving quickly in the morning, it&#x27;s these small things that make it go smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Decent scent, seems to make an immediate minor difference on small wrinkles &amp; skin color, which i was not expecting, but is good.</li>
            <li>The pump draw seems to pump a little too much lotion if you give it a full press...</li>
            <li>Not oily and in a nice small package that doesn&#x27;t get gross.</li>
            <li>Pretty good lotion for fail daily use.</li>
            <li>I like that a single pump gives the right amount for your face.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like, but the moisturizer is fantastic, and my face looks well-put-together.</li>
            <li>The texture is like a heavy lotion and moisturizes your face as if you&#x27;ve put 5 layers of lotion on, BUT it feels light as if it was your skin&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>Would buy again, as Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion leaves too much grease feeling for 15 min.</li>
            <li>Here in dry AZ, very pleasant to skin, right amount of moisturizing and perfume, BUT, have found now repeatedly, if you come close to eyes, it will irritate your eyes (tearing) later during the day, like when you party the night :-(</li>
            <li>I will buy this again as long as the price does not go up too much.</li>
            <li>However, it does absorb fairly quickly and I forget about it after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff, a little bit goes a long way and it doesnt leave any oily residue feeling, in fact it just feels soft and dry yet moisturized after about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li> I do feel like it goes on a bit greasy/shiny, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> only use a little.</li>
            <li> I just recently tried the Neutrogena For Men variety, and my face kept getting chapped and raw with it.</li>
            <li> A little amount does a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has SPF which is important and the smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> My husband like it very much,because it&#x27;s emitting a faint scent.</li>
            <li> It makes your face shiny, feels heavy and within 1 hr, your eyes start watering due to some irritation from its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every statement in the selling remarks is not true.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells a lot like sun screen but with a little added scent.</li>
            <li> your skin will feel heavy and oily and shiny, not moisturized.</li>
            <li> I felt this face lotion dried out my face.  </li>
            <li> Oh man this stuff is not good.</li>
            <li> worse Gel.</li>
            <li> Sorry Nivea 5 stars to your face wash</li>
            <li> its sunscreen lotion, Description is wrong.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make his face break out anymore then before. He likes the feel of it. Uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I feel good for my face ! Ilike it!</li>
            <li> I like this a LOT better than the Nivea gel moisturizer that comes in the same bottle. This lotion absorbs well, not greasy, and has a light, fresh scent. The pump draw seems to pump a little too much lotion if you give it a full press... so just watch out for that.</li>
            <li> Sorry Nivea 5 stars to your face wash but whenever I use this cream my eyes burn even without sweating .I would just use it as a after shave cream and would&#x27;nt put it on anywhere close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, a little bit goes a long way and it doesnt leave any oily residue feeling, in fact it just feels soft and dry yet moisturized after about 5 minutes. Spf 15 is great for the face daily , even in cloudy weather, everyone should use something like this.</li>

            <li> I hope this product never goes off the market, been a user for 5+ years! It&#x27;s the ONLY lotion/balm I use on my face that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion on my face for years.  It always sells out at the local Target, so I started buying it on Amazon.  I like that a single pump gives the right amount for your face.  When you&#x27;re moving quickly in the morning, it&#x27;s these small things that make it go smoothly.  Speaking of smooth, I love how this keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, especially in the winter.  No wrinkles yet.  Is it the lotion?  Who knows, but I won&#x27;t stop using this lotion and find out!</li>
            <li> Will not reorder.  Looking for a gel or light lotion, this is neither.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a pleasant texture and goes on smooth.  I can&#x27;t say that I get a lot of &#x27;energy&#x27; from putting on this lotion, but I have read that caffeine content in lotion can have a positive effect on your skin.  I also appreciate that this is rated at SPF 15.  I do feel like it goes on a bit greasy/shiny, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Great product - makes aging male skin much more supple and smooth!</li>
            <li> Oh man this stuff is not good. Makes your skin so freaking oily. non-greasy gel formula no way that is true. I was expecting a lot more from this. Every statement in the selling remarks is not true. your skin will feel heavy and oily and shiny, not moisturized. not energized.</li>
            <li> Be carefull. This is sunscreen lotion. Desciprtion of item says Energy Face lotion.</li>
            <li> A little amount does a long way.  Decent scent, seems to make an immediate minor difference on small wrinkles &amp; skin color, which i was not expecting, but is good.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FACIAL LOTION - lasts all day and not greasy, light and once on it feels natural.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer twice a day. It&#x27;s great. It gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for several years. It is light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily. It has SPF which is important and the smell isn&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;m not sure if the Q10 does any good, but that&#x27;s not why I buy it.</li>
            <li> When sweating in the sun it burns the eyes</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> very good lotion i use for after shave.great price.</li>
            <li> I was expecting too much from it. I use the Nivea regular non SPF moisturizer and love that. I thought this would be like that. But its not. It makes your face shiny, feels heavy and within 1 hr, your eyes start watering due to some irritation from its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again and will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer for the face and very soothing after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to do what it is supposed to do and lasts all day.  Also&lt;br /&gt;lasts for many applications.</li>
            <li> its sunscreen lotion, Description is wrong. its not a moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Helps moisten skin and prevent razor burn.  No need for aftershave if using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, put it on every morning and skin feels much better during the entire day. Stays on even after washing face with water. Keeps skin soft and more elastic - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Only Amazon has.</li>
            <li> great aftershave. only use a little.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far is the best. Awesome face moisturizer! I have been using this for quite some time and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells a lot like sun screen but with a little added scent. I didn&#x27;t like the sun screen smell at first but now that it&#x27;s summer it makes me feel like I was at the beach all day. My skin does feel nice and healthy when I use it and that was the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Played 18 holes in 80* and didn&#x27;t get burned at all using only this to protect me.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Can is pretty small, but the product is effective.</li>
            <li> Use this after the shave  to keep the face fresh and smooth feeling, has sunblock and Q10 too. Great stuff will buy again.</li>
            <li> It energize the face and it&#x27;s constant usage brings facial uplift. To me, it&#x27;s a bang for your buck, and to others it may depend.</li>
            <li> My husband like it very much,because it&#x27;s emitting a faint scent.</li>
            <li> love the lotion. very good after shave</li>
            <li> Great face lotion with a nice fresh smell plus SPF protection which usually doesn&#x27;t come with after shave lotions.</li>
            <li> Very good product, skin really loves this.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and use it everyday after a shower to keep the face fresh and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> not expensive. good for summer  day use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion daily for years.  Best I&#x27;ve ever found and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously top notch. The texture is like a heavy lotion and moisturizes your face as if you&#x27;ve put 5 layers of lotion on, BUT it feels light as if it was your skin&#x27;s natural oils. On top of that, it smells great, and not perfumy. SPF on top of that seals the deal.</li>
            <li> this lotion is great for a man.  It moisturizes and lubricates your face.  I use it on my face and hair after a shower in the morning it works great.</li>
            <li> I felt this face lotion dried out my face.  Minutes after applying it my face felt more dry then before I applied it.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion I have ever used.  Not greasy like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Other are good except too much perfume.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and think it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Used this for years and have the skin best moisturizer out there and good value to.  Look 10 years younger :)</li>
            <li> the goods is very good,and i love it very much. thank you very much and i will go back!&lt;br /&gt;from Dr. Zhou</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Nice, inexpensive face moisturizer for after the gym.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product; as my son recently finished his one and only container/canister.&lt;br /&gt;Placing my order today on Amazon; I&#x27;m looking forward to see his surprised and HAPPY expression on his face when it is delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon; this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Nivea products and this in one of my favorites and I am glad it is easily available on Amazon. This is a good face lotion for men, will hydrate your face very well without leaving any sticky, greasy feeling. Its a good moisturizer for face.</li>
            <li> I have been cycling through face lotions for a while. I just recently tried the Neutrogena For Men variety, and my face kept getting chapped and raw with it. This new NIVEA for Men has been excellent. The scent is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like, but the moisturizer is fantastic, and my face looks well-put-together.</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave and my skin looks and feels great. It also has a sunblock. Try it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t apply it near your eyes !!! cheeck yes, eyebrows no, forehead no if you may sweat. the sunscreen makes my eyes irrated and i have to go to the drug store to get the eye wash.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I like this since it has SPF in there to protect from  the sun even though its still winter. I will buy this again as long as the price does not go up too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (or similar) Nivea for men lotion for 10+ years. Even after sampling the best that Birchbox had to offer, nothing has ever compared. Use this, your face will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> The description is for  the Q10 energy gel moisturizer and not the sunscreen moisturizer lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Please check that before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Nice light lotion. I use this when I go out in the morning after I wash my face. Has a nice smell and the spf is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Good protection, but the cream is too heavy.  Should be a bit lighter.  It feels like I&#x27;m pasting it on my face.  However, it does absorb fairly quickly and I forget about it after a few minutes.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I use this daily after shaving.  It leaves my face moisturized but not looking oily.</li>
            <li> One of the best men&#x27;s face moisturizers I have used.  This works as well as some woman&#x27;s moisturizers that cost 7 times the price but is a great value.  Has a cool pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering.  Use it daily in the winter months to keep face from drying out. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; products and most are either watered down, or worse Gel. Who wants to put Gel on their face? It feels like I need to wash it off after I put that on.  This product is works great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very light and not oily</li>
