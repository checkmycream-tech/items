            <li>I liked the feel in my mouth after using this product Very clean and fresh feeling&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>i like the refreshing taste crest advanced leaves in my mouth</li>
            <li>I enjoyed trying the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I thought that the mouthwash had a nice minty flavor and made my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Nice minty fresh taste.</li>
            <li>I already have like 5 steps to my skincare routine, I didn&#x27;t want to add more steps to my brushing routine (even though I know that my teeth are super important!).</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshing for hours.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Want to have a clean and healthy mouth?  </li>
            <li>It was easy to rinse in the mouth.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not as clean, refreshing, and sparkling as my Listerine.</li>
            <li>I found it to be too strong to swish for a minute, I had to spit if out.</li>
            <li>For people who do not want a strong medicine taste this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>If you do not like the strong mint taste on some mouthwash, this one will be to your liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor is just right..not too strong or too minty.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>The flavor was fine</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use mouthwash on a regular basis but when I do, I&#x27;m mostly using it to get rid of germs while having a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>But this product is actually pleasant and enjoyable, so for that reason I&#x27;m giving this mouthwash a definite thumbs</li>
            <li>Probably because it&#x27;s alcohol free, there was no puckering, no stinging, no pain.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product after brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I have been using the Crest Pro-Health Advanced mouthwash after I brush and floss in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job cleaning the teeth and keeping surface stains off.</li>
            <li>tried the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash on 2 separate occasions.</li>
            <li>Smooth taste.  </li>
            <li>The strengthening of the tooth enamel, especially if you eat and drink acidic foods is great.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of the 3d whitening tooth paste and it is like a fresh cleaning from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>The taste is good, (as far as mouthwashes go..)</li>
            <li>but it also provides healthy mouth benefits at the same time at a fair price.</li>
            <li>The product makes my mouth feel very fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash claims to do exactly the same as others on the market, it is however more pleasant tasting since the othres taste like medicine.</li>
            <li>I use mouthwash twice daily for years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste and left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and I like the flavor of the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The product left my mouth feeling clean with a pleasant after taste.</li>
            <li>It created a clean mouth feeling without a medicinal taste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a smooth, mild mint flavor which will let you keep swishing.</li>
            <li>My breath felt clean after I used it</li>
            <li>You can feel it freshen and clean your mouth.</li>
            <li>but there is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>Get a zippy, clean mouth that will leave you ready to confidently face the day.</li>
            <li>Great fresh clean rinse without the strong burn like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>The minty-ness fades within minutes, which is for some perhaps a fair trade to avoid the potential zap of alcohol products in the mouth.</li>
            <li>, leVing my mouth with a super clean feeling...</li>
            <li>I like the fresh breath feel after using Crest Pro Health Advanced mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>My initial reaction to the taste was, &amp;#34;Not bad.&amp;#34; - aftertaste - not so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was good just not quite minty enough for me.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, minty, just a clean fresh feeling all over your mouth.  </li>
            <li>No staining, my mouth feels clean and fresh each time I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>It was a clean, fresh feel without the burn.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel clean and fresh for hours after use.</li>
            <li>This product tasted fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this Crest Pro-Health mouthwash.</li>
            <li>There is no harsh taste, it actually tastes good but most of all, it gets my teeth squeaky</li>
            <li>Because there&#x27;s no pain to tolerate with this mouthwash, I would logically and likely look forward to this part of my dental hygiene regime, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I really loved this mouthwash because not only did it keep my mouth minty fresh, but it also really kept my teeth clean and germ free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sorry I can&#x27;t be more positive about it, but happy I was able to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this product to be pleasant tasting, and it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Advanced AntiCavity Fluoride Mouthwash really delivers.</li>
            <li>I just love the fresh feeling this leaves my mouth with after I have use Crest Pro Health Advanced Mouthwash with Extra Crest.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the color with my electric toothbrush, but it was definitely an unexpected event.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash made me feel that I was taking a worthwhile extra step toward tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of making my teeth stronger and healthier, however I did not like the feeling/taste that was left in my mouth after I used the rinse.</li>
            <li>Kept my mouth fresh for quite sometime.</li>
            <li>Today i wised up and mixed it with warm water and success.</li>
            <li>Mouth feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn when using.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt fresh after using it and my breathe was fresh.</li>
            <li>I found this mouthwash to be refreshing and left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong that it makes your eyes burn, but strong enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t taste good after each other.</li>
            <li>Just give me the slightest reason and I&#x27;ll justify not having to floss every day, right?</li>
            <li>I was told to stop using this mouthwash right away.</li>
            <li>I use it with the dual action toothpaste and it leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean and my mouth feeling bubbly and refreshed!</li>
            <li>after brushing, the mouthwash , after swooshing, always managed to have more debris that I apparently had missed.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find a good alcohol free mouthwash</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I was interested to try this product.</li>
            <li>Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>It was like the feeling you get when you burn your tongue on hot food or coffee.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I love the shade of blue that was chosen.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised upon reading the label that it was alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I was at first intrigued by the product-</li>
            <li>So overall, I didn&#x27;t love the product.</li>
            <li>Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>I did not have such an enjoyable experience with this one.</li>
            <li>The mouth wash flavor sure does keep your mouth fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product if the price was right..it would be nice if the cap was marked with a 2 tsp.</li>
            <li>Not a strong burn like other mouthwashes, which is great!  </li>
            <li>and you have easily given your mouth and teeth extra protection.</li>
            <li>THis product was smooth, no harsh after taste, no tingling sensation, just left your mouth feeling clean and refreshed&lt;br</li>
            <li>This did neither of those, with only a mild tingling and no burn!</li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But is was my WHOLE mouth.</li>
            <li>After day 3 when I really couldn&#x27;t taste anything anymore</li>
            <li>It does not burn so that is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash has that extra &amp;#34;pizzazz&amp;#34; that tells you it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really has helped strengthen my teeth</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Advanced is a blue, lightly-flavored mouthwash which claims to have &amp;#34;extra-deep&amp;#34; cleaning power and can help your teeth become stronger.</li>
            <li>I also absolutely wanted to rinse my mouth out because of that and the instructions said not</li>
            <li>I was using the this mouthwash, I didn&#x27;t have any real issues.</li>
            <li>and it is not too intense.</li>
            <li>It really alters the flavor of the food I eat even an hour after using it.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling fresh like the feeling I get from a freshly chewed piece of gum.</li>
            <li>I really liked it and would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li>The flavor was a little too strong for me - but I didn&#x27;t mind that too much since it seemed to make my mouth feel fresh</li>
            <li>It left my teeth and gums squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>When I spit it out, there are blue globs in the sink which was kind of strange and made me wonder how it formed.</li>
            <li>What I really like about it, besides all the normal mouthwash perks, is that it strengthens my teeth enamel for a healthier mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use mouthwash that much but was intrigued by this one in that it could help to strengthen the enamel of my teeth.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m left with is a mild minty breath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Complete with Fluoride, and can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the two.</li>
            <li>I found that it really gave me fresh breath, especially early in the morning and before bed after a long day and dinner.</li>
            <li>I used it right after the Crest 3D white test kit I received, and they work together really well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for any home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product from a trusted brand name.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li>The smell is a little better for me then others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does all the things it claims it does because I didn&#x27;t do it for more than a few days and saw no change during that</li>
            <li>It was a good concept, just not great execution for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>Not hard on the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how they measure this, but I like strong teeth!</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh &amp; clean, while at the same time no burning sensation as with some other</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried many mouthwashes in my past, and Crest Pro-Health is my #1favorite.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have the burn that some other products can have and my mouth felt clean and</li>
            <li>This happened consistently the entire time I used the product (nearly 2 weeks now).</li>
            <li>Besides freshening breath, if it really does do all of the other things that are listed on the bottle, then I&#x27;m all for it and it will always be my first choice when it comes to mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health left my mouth feeling clean, but I didn&#x27;t feel that it lasted as long as Listerine.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like it so much that I will be replacing my current brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is helpful product to have for your complete oral health care for you and your family.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it made my mouth feel as though I had just brushed my teeth!</li>
            <li>While my teeth remained shiny white while using this, the warnings about staining on the product made me nervous, even if the staining would essentially be caused by the product doing its job even better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is not a sweet aftertaste, but definitely a clean thorough feeling..</li>
            <li>My mouth is left dry and puckering from the strong astringent quality, which can itself create potential sores or lesions in the gum.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it really worked, and kept working all day long.</li>
            <li>After about a week my mouth went back to normal so no permanent damage.</li>
            <li>taste is very light, not strong like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li>The taste wasn&#x27;t great but wasn&#x27;t horrible like typical mouthwashes, and I love the added fluoride to strengthen teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li>It bothered my sensitive teeth only a tiny bit, but the taste wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>At first it tasted a little like bubble gum</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the Crest Pro-Health Advance Mouthwash</li>
            <li>At first I thought the odd numbing sensation was due to being new at rinsing with mouthwash twice a day.</li>
            <li>I really liked this mouthwash, it made my mouth feel fresh and did not have an unpleasant aftertaste or make my mouth feel dry as other products</li>
            <li>mouthwash kills bad breath germs, helps prevents cavities, strengthens enamel, cleans teeth and gums and freshens your breath with a cool minty clean.</li>

            <li> and I love the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> i like the refreshing taste crest advanced leaves in my mouth</li>
            <li> I enjoyed trying the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I thought that the mouthwash had a nice minty flavor and made my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice minty fresh taste.</li>
            <li> I already have like 5 steps to my skincare routine, I didn&#x27;t want to add more steps to my brushing routine (even though I know that my teeth are super important!).</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshing for hours.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Want to have a clean and healthy mouth?  </li>
            <li> It was easy to rinse in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not as clean, refreshing, and sparkling as my Listerine.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too strong to swish for a minute, I had to spit if out.</li>
            <li> For people who do not want a strong medicine taste this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> If you do not like the strong mint taste on some mouthwash, this one will be to your liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavor is just right..not too strong or too minty.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> The flavor was fine</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use mouthwash on a regular basis but when I do, I&#x27;m mostly using it to get rid of germs while having a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> But this product is actually pleasant and enjoyable, so for that reason I&#x27;m giving this mouthwash a definite thumbs</li>
            <li> Probably because it&#x27;s alcohol free, there was no puckering, no stinging, no pain.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product after brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health Advanced mouthwash after I brush and floss in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job cleaning the teeth and keeping surface stains off.</li>
            <li> tried the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash on 2 separate occasions.</li>
            <li> Smooth taste.  </li>
            <li> The strengthening of the tooth enamel, especially if you eat and drink acidic foods is great.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of the 3d whitening tooth paste and it is like a fresh cleaning from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> The taste is good, (as far as mouthwashes go..)</li>
            <li> but it also provides healthy mouth benefits at the same time at a fair price.</li>
            <li> The product makes my mouth feel very fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash claims to do exactly the same as others on the market, it is however more pleasant tasting since the othres taste like medicine.</li>
            <li> I use mouthwash twice daily for years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste and left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and I like the flavor of the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The product left my mouth feeling clean with a pleasant after taste.</li>
            <li> It created a clean mouth feeling without a medicinal taste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a smooth, mild mint flavor which will let you keep swishing.</li>
            <li> My breath felt clean after I used it</li>
            <li> You can feel it freshen and clean your mouth.</li>
            <li> but there is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> Get a zippy, clean mouth that will leave you ready to confidently face the day.</li>
            <li> Great fresh clean rinse without the strong burn like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> The minty-ness fades within minutes, which is for some perhaps a fair trade to avoid the potential zap of alcohol products in the mouth.</li>
            <li> , leVing my mouth with a super clean feeling...</li>
            <li> I like the fresh breath feel after using Crest Pro Health Advanced mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>

            <li> /&gt;it was good just not quite minty enough for me.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, minty, just a clean fresh feeling all over your mouth.  </li>
            <li> No staining, my mouth feels clean and fresh each time I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>

            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this Crest Pro-Health mouthwash.</li>
            <li> There is no harsh taste, it actually tastes good but most of all, it gets my teeth squeaky</li>
            <li> Because there&#x27;s no pain to tolerate with this mouthwash, I would logically and likely look forward to this part of my dental hygiene regime, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I really loved this mouthwash because not only did it keep my mouth minty fresh, but it also really kept my teeth clean and germ free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t be more positive about it, but happy I was able to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this product to be pleasant tasting, and it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other mouthwashes.</li>

            <li> I just love the fresh feeling this leaves my mouth with after I have use Crest Pro Health Advanced Mouthwash with Extra Crest.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh breath.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove the color with my electric toothbrush, but it was definitely an unexpected event.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash made me feel that I was taking a worthwhile extra step toward tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of making my teeth stronger and healthier, however I did not like the feeling/taste that was left in my mouth after I used the rinse.</li>
            <li> Kept my mouth fresh for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> Today i wised up and mixed it with warm water and success.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn when using.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt fresh after using it and my breathe was fresh.</li>
            <li> I found this mouthwash to be refreshing and left my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong that it makes your eyes burn, but strong enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t taste good after each other.</li>
            <li> Just give me the slightest reason and I&#x27;ll justify not having to floss every day, right?</li>
            <li> I was told to stop using this mouthwash right away.</li>
            <li> I use it with the dual action toothpaste and it leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean and my mouth feeling bubbly and refreshed!</li>
            <li> after brushing, the mouthwash , after swooshing, always managed to have more debris that I apparently had missed.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a good alcohol free mouthwash</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this product.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> It was like the feeling you get when you burn your tongue on hot food or coffee.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I love the shade of blue that was chosen.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised upon reading the label that it was alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I was at first intrigued by the product-</li>
            <li> So overall, I didn&#x27;t love the product.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I did not have such an enjoyable experience with this one.</li>
            <li> The mouth wash flavor sure does keep your mouth fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product if the price was right..it would be nice if the cap was marked with a 2 tsp.</li>
            <li> Not a strong burn like other mouthwashes, which is great!  </li>
            <li> and you have easily given your mouth and teeth extra protection.</li>
            <li> THis product was smooth, no harsh after taste, no tingling sensation, just left your mouth feeling clean and refreshed&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did neither of those, with only a mild tingling and no burn!</li>
            <li> It made my mouth feel very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But is was my WHOLE mouth.</li>
            <li> After day 3 when I really couldn&#x27;t taste anything anymore</li>
            <li> It does not burn so that is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash has that extra &amp;#34;pizzazz&amp;#34; that tells you it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really has helped strengthen my teeth</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced is a blue, lightly-flavored mouthwash which claims to have &amp;#34;extra-deep&amp;#34; cleaning power and can help your teeth become stronger.</li>
            <li> I also absolutely wanted to rinse my mouth out because of that and the instructions said not</li>
            <li> I was using the this mouthwash, I didn&#x27;t have any real issues.</li>
            <li> and it is not too intense.</li>
            <li> It really alters the flavor of the food I eat even an hour after using it.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling fresh like the feeling I get from a freshly chewed piece of gum.</li>
            <li> I really liked it and would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> The flavor was a little too strong for me - but I didn&#x27;t mind that too much since it seemed to make my mouth feel fresh</li>
            <li> It left my teeth and gums squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> When I spit it out, there are blue globs in the sink which was kind of strange and made me wonder how it formed.</li>
            <li> What I really like about it, besides all the normal mouthwash perks, is that it strengthens my teeth enamel for a healthier mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use mouthwash that much but was intrigued by this one in that it could help to strengthen the enamel of my teeth.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m left with is a mild minty breath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Complete with Fluoride, and can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I found that it really gave me fresh breath, especially early in the morning and before bed after a long day and dinner.</li>
            <li> I used it right after the Crest 3D white test kit I received, and they work together really well.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for any home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product from a trusted brand name.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li> The smell is a little better for me then others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does all the things it claims it does because I didn&#x27;t do it for more than a few days and saw no change during that</li>
            <li> It was a good concept, just not great execution for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Not hard on the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they measure this, but I like strong teeth!</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel fresh &amp; clean, while at the same time no burning sensation as with some other</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mouthwashes in my past, and Crest Pro-Health is my #1favorite.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the burn that some other products can have and my mouth felt clean and</li>
            <li> This happened consistently the entire time I used the product (nearly 2 weeks now).</li>
            <li> Besides freshening breath, if it really does do all of the other things that are listed on the bottle, then I&#x27;m all for it and it will always be my first choice when it comes to mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health left my mouth feeling clean, but I didn&#x27;t feel that it lasted as long as Listerine.</li>
            <li> In fact, I like it so much that I will be replacing my current brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is helpful product to have for your complete oral health care for you and your family.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it made my mouth feel as though I had just brushed my teeth!</li>
            <li> While my teeth remained shiny white while using this, the warnings about staining on the product made me nervous, even if the staining would essentially be caused by the product doing its job even better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is not a sweet aftertaste, but definitely a clean thorough feeling..</li>
            <li> My mouth is left dry and puckering from the strong astringent quality, which can itself create potential sores or lesions in the gum.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it really worked, and kept working all day long.</li>
            <li> After about a week my mouth went back to normal so no permanent damage.</li>
            <li> taste is very light, not strong like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t great but wasn&#x27;t horrible like typical mouthwashes, and I love the added fluoride to strengthen teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> It bothered my sensitive teeth only a tiny bit, but the taste wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> At first it tasted a little like bubble gum</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the Crest Pro-Health Advance Mouthwash</li>
            <li> At first I thought the odd numbing sensation was due to being new at rinsing with mouthwash twice a day.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mouthwash, it made my mouth feel fresh and did not have an unpleasant aftertaste or make my mouth feel dry as other products</li>
            <li> mouthwash kills bad breath germs, helps prevents cavities, strengthens enamel, cleans teeth and gums and freshens your breath with a cool minty clean.</li>
            <li> a typical mouth wash just little less as strong tasting as most&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li> This mouthwash makes my mouth feel much cleaner than others I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> so it left me feeling dentist-fresh, and the freshness was long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback I found was that 1 minute seems a very long time to swish mouthwash around in my mouth!!&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> Since most of them have alcohol, there is usually an exceedingly strong astringent quality that can be very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> To me this did not stand out enough from other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would purchase this particular mouthwash in the future.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> It can take a little getting used to at first as it is definitely a stronger mouthwash than the typical stuff out there, but it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It was an extremely benign experience of swish and spit, no dry mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the burning feeling and doing that for a minute was too long.</li>
            <li> Almost toooo long.</li>
            <li> I am not wild about the consistency - it has a bit of a &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this mouthwash along with my other oral care products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt that it wasn&#x27;t significantly different than other mouthwashes I had tried.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Crest products and have used their other mouthwashes regularly.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-Health Advanced was nowhere near this painful end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> feeling as I swish it around my mouth, almost like that of a dry wine.</li>
            <li> Then one night I used it and it turned my tongue dark blue.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of mouthwash to rinse and strengthen teeth, but the alcohol burn makes it impossible for me to keep it in my mouth and most washes without alcohol have irritated the lining of my mouth until it peels.</li>
            <li> like the idea of a mouthwash that offer more than just killing germs that cause bad breath.</li>
            <li> I starting use this after a dental appointment in which I was informed that I needed to floss and use mouthwash everyday.</li>
            <li> It was not what I had expected from the color.</li>
            <li> When I got up the next morning, my tongue felt very dry and the roof of my mouth felt burned and raw.</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is the taste was a little off-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any of the issues that some other people had with the flavor.</li>
            <li> I will it will taste a little bit stronger and make the after taste last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It does not burn your mouth like the other ones do.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they used two different minty flavors</li>
            <li> When waking up in the morning, my teeth didn&#x27;t have that fuzzy feeling like with other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> the sting you get with other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I usually have to take a deep breath and prepare myself for 60 seconds of discomfort and even pain when I take a swish of a typical mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash was an average mouthwash for me.</li>
            <li> Can be improved by diluting by half.</li>
            <li> I do think it did extricate hidden tooth</li>
            <li> I typically use Listerine; have for years.</li>
            <li> There is a slight after taste</li>
            <li> However, it does cause a slight burning sensation which lasts a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have previously seen it in store</li>
            <li> When I first used the product, I wasn&#x27;t that crazy about the taste...</li>
            <li> but it was always a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> but it grew on me after a few uses.</li>
            <li> BUT using it after the 2-part Crest whitening left my mouth conflicted and confused.</li>
            <li> I would definitely have to warn them of the aftertaste that the mouthwash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a little difficult to open, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides the lingering bad taste, it left my mouth and tongue coated with yucky blue gunk.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li> Though the size of typeface is a tad to small to read.</li>
            <li> Products I&#x27;ve used in the past have felt as though my mouth was on fire.  </li>
            <li> It was not overwhelming in flavor.</li>
            <li> I like the claims on the label, but it is hard to tell if it made my teeth any stronger.&lt;br /&gt;[you</li>
            <li> And that this was a common problem with that mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about any Crest product is that I have never cared for the taste of their products.</li>
            <li> and I mean kissable clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t happened again, but it has made me a little wary of the product.</li>
            <li> Some of them can hurt any sores, cuts, openings or weak points in the mouth with a wince-inducing sting.</li>
            <li> When I initially put the mouthwash in my mouth, it feels very cold on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Using mouthwash is always unpleasant for me due to the burning sensation that it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> But after 2 days it got worse.</li>
            <li> The flavor was unappealing and my mouth felt irritated after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it daily though because I was fearful of having a reaction.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to continue to hold the wash in my mouth for the minute because it was too &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> However, about 10 minutes after I spit and rinsed, a really disgusting metallic taste crept up on my tongue and stayed put until I woke up the next morning.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as orange juice after toothpaste, but not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then you can&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes but the burning feeling lasted for some time and it leaves an unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> But it does have an unpleasant aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> They both claim to strengthen your teeth, prevent cavities, and kill bad breath germs.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed in this Crest product.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I was VERY unhappy with the taste.</li>
            <li> I hate when mouthwash</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.</li>
            <li> so there is no burning or nasty aftertaste.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and dread the burn and horrible taste of mouthwash, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible, by any means, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose to purchase it.</li>

            <li> I liked the feel in my mouth after using this product Very clean and fresh feeling&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> My mouth was revived after using Crest Pro-health.. Felt Clean, teeth felt great, and fresh breath lasted.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This was a great follow up to the toothpastes. For me it calmed my mouth&#x27;s reaction to the pastes. It had a pleasant taste and hopefully worked as the bottle described.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This product left your mouth tingling. It is strong but very effective</li>
            <li> Tastes awful. Can be improved by diluting by half.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes my mouth feel fresh &amp; clean, while at the same time no burning sensation as with some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Wow! Crest Pro-Health Advanced AntiCavity Fluoride Mouthwash really delivers. After rinsing, your mouth will feel a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash kills bad breath germs, helps prevents cavities, strengthens enamel, cleans teeth and gums and freshens your breath with a cool minty clean. You may notice blue specks or gobs in your sink after spitting out Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. This means the mouthwash is binding to the germs and when you spit you are getting rid of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for any home. I love it! My mouth feels healthier since using it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this product. I found it to be too strong to swish for a minute, I had to spit if out. I do think it did extricate hidden tooth debris.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> You are suppose to keep this product in your mouth between your teeth swishing for a minute. I didn&#x27;t like the burning feeling and doing that for a minute was too long. Then you can&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes but the burning feeling lasted for some time and it leaves an unpleasant taste. I don&#x27;t know if it does all the things it claims it does because I didn&#x27;t do it for more than a few days and saw no change during that time.&lt;br /&gt;This is my personal review  as part of the Shopper Army!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash claims to do exactly the same as others on the market, it is however more pleasant tasting since the othres taste like medicine.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh breath. Powerfully strong!</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use mouthwash on a regular basis but when I do, I&#x27;m mostly using it to get rid of germs while having a pleasant taste. This product works on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Like the idea of a product that can whiten teeth and also strengthen them. I did not like the metallic after taste a lot.</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste of the mouthwash and like how it makes my mouth and teeth feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash! I use mouthwash twice daily for years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried. I use it with the dual action toothpaste and it leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean and my mouth feeling bubbly and refreshed! Love it - will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Great new product,,It makes my mouth feel very clean, and healthy. I heard about the product from SHOPPER ARMY.&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;ll use it every day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the taste of the mouthwash. It made my mouth feel very clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Most mouthwashes I buy with trepidation. I know that they are beneficial, but there is always a physical cost for the benefits. Since most of them have alcohol, there is usually an exceedingly strong astringent quality that can be very unpleasant. Some of them can hurt any sores, cuts, openings or weak points in the mouth with a wince-inducing sting. I usually have to take a deep breath and prepare myself for 60 seconds of discomfort and even pain when I take a swish of a typical mouthwash. My mouth is left dry and puckering from the strong astringent quality, which can itself create potential sores or lesions in the gum. This Crest Pro-Health Advanced was nowhere near this painful end of the spectrum. Probably because it&#x27;s alcohol free, there was no puckering, no stinging, no pain. It was an extremely benign experience of swish and spit, no dry mouth afterwards. What I&#x27;m left with is a mild minty breath. It&#x27;s possible the mouthwash is a bit TOO benign. The minty-ness fades within minutes, which is for some perhaps a fair trade to avoid the potential zap of alcohol products in the mouth. Because there&#x27;s no pain to tolerate with this mouthwash, I would logically and likely look forward to this part of my dental hygiene regime, which is a good thing. We all tend to rationalize slacking off on beneficial habits. Just give me the slightest reason and I&#x27;ll justify not having to floss every day, right? But this product is actually pleasant and enjoyable, so for that reason I&#x27;m giving this mouthwash a definite thumbs UP.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I thought that the mouthwash had a nice minty flavor and made my mouth feel fresh. I didn&#x27;t notice any of the issues that some other people had with the flavor. I like the claims on the label, but it is hard to tell if it made my teeth any stronger.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Great fresh clean rinse without the strong burn like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Satisfied Customer. It is a quality product that I would use again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product after brushing my teeth it is so refreshing, I like the taste of it there is no alcohol in it so there is no burning or nasty aftertaste. I will definitely be using this mouthwash along with my other oral care products.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I starting use this after a dental appointment in which I was informed that I needed to floss and use mouthwash everyday. So the timing of this was perfect. At first I thought the odd numbing sensation was due to being new at rinsing with mouthwash twice a day. But after 2 days it got worse. It was like the feeling you get when you burn your tongue on hot food or coffee. But is was my WHOLE mouth. After day 3 when I really couldn&#x27;t taste anything anymore I called my dentist. I was told to stop using this mouthwash right away. And that this was a common problem with that mouthwash. After about a week my mouth went back to normal so no permanent damage. But I obviously do not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> When I first used the product, I wasn&#x27;t that crazy about the taste...but it grew on me after a few uses. I typically use Listerine; have for years. Crest Pro-Health left my mouth feeling clean, but I didn&#x27;t feel that it lasted as long as Listerine. I wouldn&#x27;t change to it, but I will finish using the product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the Crest Pro-Health Advance Mouthwash I felt that it wasn&#x27;t significantly different than other mouthwashes I had tried. Then one night I used it and it turned my tongue dark blue. I was able to remove the color with my electric toothbrush, but it was definitely an unexpected event. It hasn&#x27;t happened again, but it has made me a little wary of the product. I am not sure I would purchase this particular mouthwash in the future.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> liked the taste of this because it is not medicinal. It left my mouth feeling fresh like the feeling I get from a freshly chewed piece of gum. I would use this regularly if I did not have to use a prescription mouthwash</li>
            <li> I just love the fresh feeling this leaves my mouth with after I have use Crest Pro Health Advanced Mouthwash with Extra Crest.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash lives up the good name that Crest has earned. The taste is good, it is effective, and the fresh feeling it leaves in your mouth is great!</li>
            <li> I like the mouthwash. It has a great taste and seems to work. I do feel like my mouth is cleaner and the taste is pretty good. There is a slight after taste but I am not sure how to describe it. At first it tasted a little like bubble gum but then it changes back to mint. It does not burn so that is a real plus. I hate when mouthwash burns.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This product taste good while in the mouth. It makes me feel fresh and clean after use. It&#x27;s a high quality product from a trusted brand name. I will it will taste a little bit stronger and make the after taste last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mouthwashes in my past, and Crest Pro-Health is my #1favorite. It leaves my mouth feeling really clean, has a great taste and I love the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free. Besides freshening breath, if it really does do all of the other things that are listed on the bottle, then I&#x27;m all for it and it will always be my first choice when it comes to mouthwash. You can&#x27;t beat a product when besides being a mouthwash, it protects you from cavities, strengthens enamel and cleans teeth and gums all at once.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash has that extra &amp;#34;pizzazz&amp;#34; that tells you it&#x27;s working. The taste is good, (as far as mouthwashes go..) and it&#x27;s pleasant to use each morning. What I really like about it, besides all the normal mouthwash perks, is that it strengthens my teeth enamel for a healthier mouth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest mouthwash has what I would call a stringent, working taste..after brushing, the mouthwash , after swooshing, always managed to have more debris that I apparently had missed., leVing my mouth with a super clean feeling...It is not a sweet aftertaste, but definitely a clean thorough feeling..I would definitely buy this product if the price was right..it would be nice if the cap was marked with a 2 tsp. line.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but doesn&#x27;t give that tingling or sensational feeling after use.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it seems to the same as others like it. The smell is a little better for me then others. It works fine. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Tastes goo and has health benefits at the same time</li>
            <li> Crest, the best.  Clean, fresh, minty, just a clean fresh feeling all over your mouth.  The best mouthwash I have ever used</li>
            <li> This mouthwash makes my mouth feel much cleaner than others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. However, it does cause a slight burning sensation which lasts a couple of minutes. The freshness is long-lasting. In fact, I like it so much that I will be replacing my current brand.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This is helpful product to have for your complete oral health care for you and your family. My just love it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and dread the burn and horrible taste of mouthwash, then this product is for you. I like the concept of mouthwash to rinse and strengthen teeth, but the alcohol burn makes it impossible for me to keep it in my mouth and most washes without alcohol have irritated the lining of my mouth until it peels. This did neither of those, with only a mild tingling and no burn! The taste wasn&#x27;t great but wasn&#x27;t horrible like typical mouthwashes, and I love the added fluoride to strengthen teeth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> didnt burn my gums, tasted great and kept my mouth feeling clean all day!</li>
            <li> I liked the taste, it swoosh&#x27;s great! I used it right after the Crest 3D white test kit I received, and they work together really well. No staining, my mouth feels clean and fresh each time I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use mouthwash that much but was intrigued by this one in that it could help to strengthen the enamel of my teeth. It has a pleasant taste and left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean. I don&#x27;t know if it really has helped strengthen my teeth but I do plan to continue to use it and see! The only drawback I found was that 1 minute seems a very long time to swish mouthwash around in my mouth!!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This product is a great mouthwash! It does not burn your mouth like the other ones do. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshing for hours.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I always was a listerine user. Now I am switching to this. Nice minty fresh taste. Not hard on the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very light, not strong like a lot of other products. The taste lasted about 1 an hour. For people who do not want a strong medicine taste this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lightly refreshing</li>
            <li> i like the refreshing taste crest advanced leaves in my mouth</li>
            <li> I found this mouthwash to be refreshing and left my mouth feeling clean. BUT using it after the 2-part Crest whitening left my mouth conflicted and confused. Not sure why they used two different minty flavors but they didn&#x27;t taste good after each other. Not as bad as orange juice after toothpaste, but not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash made me feel that I was taking a worthwhile extra step toward tooth and gum health. It had a great flavor without the sting and burn that some products have.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> a typical mouth wash just little less as strong tasting as most&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> makes my mouth feel refreshed</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked this mouthwash. It seemed like it really worked, and kept working all day long. The flavor was a little too strong for me - but I didn&#x27;t mind that too much since it seemed to make my mouth feel fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Advanced is a blue, lightly-flavored mouthwash which claims to have &amp;#34;extra-deep&amp;#34; cleaning power and can help your teeth become stronger. I&#x27;m not sure how they measure this, but I like strong teeth! I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Complete with Fluoride, and can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the two. They both claim to strengthen your teeth, prevent cavities, and kill bad breath germs. They even look and taste the same. I appreciate the milder taste, and do feel that it helps my mouth feel fresher during the day.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the mouthwash and liked the minty aftertaste which lasted for about 10 minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed in this Crest product. The mouthwash did not have as pleasant nor as refreshing as taste as I prefer. I also felt that the blue color of the mouthwash tended to leave a blue tint to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health Advanced mouthwash after I brush and floss in the morning and evening. I really like it! My mouth feels clean and I like the flavor of the mouthwash. There is no alcohol burn and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I was happy that got to try this mouthwash from Crest. I have previously seen it in store but it was always a little too pricey. The shape of the bottle as well as the overall look is very attractive to the eye. Though the size of typeface is a tad to small to read. The instructions, however, are very easy to understand. I love the shade of blue that was chosen. I was pleasantly surprised upon reading the label that it was alcohol free. Using mouthwash is always unpleasant for me due to the burning sensation that it leaves behind. When I went to use this, there was no harshness present. HOWEVER, I was VERY unhappy with the taste. It left a taste in my mouth that reminded me of plastic. Horrible. I would love to recommend this to others. I would definitely have to warn them of the aftertaste that the mouthwash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I really loved this mouthwash because not only did it keep my mouth minty fresh, but it also really kept my teeth clean and germ free.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash! Promotes a healthier mouth and I feel great about the whole family using this.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I was at first intrigued by the product- was I supposed To use it just as mouthwash to freshen my breath or was I supposed to add it to my brushing routine. Once I found out I was supposed to add it to my brushing, I was not so happy. I already have like 5 steps to my skincare routine, I didn&#x27;t want to add more steps to my brushing routine (even though I know that my teeth are super important!). I liked the idea of making my teeth stronger and healthier, however I did not like the feeling/taste that was left in my mouth after I used the rinse. And on top of that- I wasn&#x27;t allowed to drink anything for 30 minutes after which made the product a deal breaker- I didn&#x27;t want to use it because I didn&#x27;t like the taste it left and then I couldn&#x27;t even drink some water to get rid of the taste. So overall, I didn&#x27;t love the product. It was a good concept, just not great execution for me.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> For a clean, refreshed mouth with fresh breath, Crest Mouthwash does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  I purchased the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash and am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a convert to Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. It does a fantastic job cleaning the teeth and keeping surface stains off. It can take a little getting used to at first as it is definitely a stronger mouthwash than the typical stuff out there, but it works extremely well. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> It was too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for my mouth. I found it difficult to continue to hold the wash in my mouth for the minute because it was too &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; for me. The flavor was fine but I didn&#x27;t want to keep it in for the time because it burned. I also absolutely wanted to rinse my mouth out because of that and the instructions said not too so I had to keep spitting. Could be I am just a wimp for spicy - overall it made my mouth feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I loved this Crest Mouthwash because I was in search of a good mouthwash that contained fluoride and didn&#x27;t make my mouth burn. I was so excited when I received this and it was perfect. It has a great taste, doesn&#x27;t burn and is from a company I trust and am loyal to - Crest. You can trust this review because I am part of Shopper Army!</li>
            <li> Works great! Tasty too!!!</li>
            <li> The product had a great crisp mint flavor. Kept my mouth fresh for quite sometime. I actually took it to work and used it in the middle of the day. I really like the way it made my mouth feel as though I had just brushed my teeth!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mouthwash, it made my mouth feel fresh and did not have an unpleasant aftertaste or make my mouth feel dry as other products do.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Not a strong burn like other mouthwashes, which is great!  But it does have an unpleasant aftertaste.  Overall, a great mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Products I&#x27;ve used in the past have felt as though my mouth was on fire.  This did not do that.  It was a clean, fresh feel without the burn.</li>
            <li> I thought the product had a great taste. I liked that it was taking care of more than one dental health issue. When I use my regular mouthwash I add a splash of peroxide for whitening and germ fighting. I did not feel like I needed to do that with this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this mouthwash. After brushing my teeth and rinsing with this I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering like some mouthwashes. The taste was very pleasant. My mouth felt very clean and I found my teeth stayed cleaner longer.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I received this to test as part of the Shopper Army review panel. I really liked it and would definitely consider purchasing it in the future. The flavor was identical to what my dentist uses (I wonder if this IS what he uses) so it left me feeling dentist-fresh, and the freshness was long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I found this product to be pleasant tasting, and it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other mouthwashes. My mouth felt fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;As I was using the this mouthwash, I didn&#x27;t have any real issues. It bothered my sensitive teeth only a tiny bit, but the taste wasn&#x27;t overpowering. However, about 10 minutes after I spit and rinsed, a really disgusting metallic taste crept up on my tongue and stayed put until I woke up the next morning. This happened consistently the entire time I used the product (nearly 2 weeks now). Blech.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> The product left my mouth feeling clean with a pleasant after taste.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this and it is not too intense.</li>
            <li> For a short time you swish the Pro Health Mouthwash around and you have easily given your mouth and teeth extra protection. My one complaint about any Crest product is that I have never cared for the taste of their products.</li>
            <li> I found that it really gave me fresh breath, especially early in the morning and before bed after a long day and dinner.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh breath feel after using Crest Pro Health Advanced mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I liked the spicy smell and taste of this product. It was not what I had expected from the color. The taste stayed with me perhaps longer than I would have liked after using, and even though I liked the flavor I often felt like I wanted to rinse with water afterward. While my teeth remained shiny white while using this, the warnings about staining on the product made me nervous, even if the staining would essentially be caused by the product doing its job even better than expected. To me this did not stand out enough from other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> My initial reaction to the taste was, &amp;#34;Not bad.&amp;#34; - aftertaste - not so good. Besides the lingering bad taste, it left my mouth and tongue coated with yucky blue gunk. I was pleased it had no alcohol, but beyond that, I could not find anything to recommend it. Sorry I can&#x27;t be more positive about it, but happy I was able to try it.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This mouthwash was good. It made my mouth feel clean and fresh for hours after use. When waking up in the morning, my teeth didn&#x27;t have that fuzzy feeling like with other mouthwashes. This mouthwash has a good taste. It&#x27;s not too strong that it makes your eyes burn, but strong enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It didn&#x27;t have the burn that some other products can have and my mouth felt clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Want to have a clean and healthy mouth?  Use Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash and you will have it!  Pleasantly tingly with no harse after taste.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash gave my mouth a great clean and refreshing feel. It left my teeth and gums squeaky clean. It had a good taste to it without any burn. It was easy to rinse in the mouth. It covered all parts of my teeth and gums. It was not overwhelming in flavor. No whitening power however.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest is a good mouthwash but there is nothing special about it.  It is one of many good mouthwashes on the market</li>
            <li> Get a zippy, clean mouth that will leave you ready to confidently face the day.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Crest products and have used their other mouthwashes regularly. I did not have such an enjoyable experience with this one. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, by any means, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose to purchase it. When I initially put the mouthwash in my mouth, it feels very cold on my teeth. I don&#x27;t have oversensitive teeth, so it was a surprising feeling. It has kind of a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling as I swish it around my mouth, almost like that of a dry wine. When I spit it out, there are blue globs in the sink which was kind of strange and made me wonder how it formed. The mouth wash flavor sure does keep your mouth fresh for a long time. Almost toooo long. It really alters the flavor of the food I eat even an hour after using it. If I were to keep using it I would stick to using it only at night for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, But no Cigar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash has been a nice experience. The taste and the after taste are refreshing. Using this after brushing my teeth and rinsing seems to add an extra cleaning component and helps remove the toothpaste residue that always remains, even after rinsing. I am not wild about the consistency - it has a bit of a &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; feel. The flavor is not as clean, refreshing, and sparkling as my Listerine. I prefer Listerine, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week and it still hurts the inside of my cheeks. Today i wised up and mixed it with warm water and success. Works better for me this way.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Mouth feels fresh and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn when using.</li>
            <li> Your Review [copy the whole text!  Make sure they know you are part of the Army :) ]:&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash on 2 separate occasions. I did not like it either time. The flavor was unappealing and my mouth felt irritated after use.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. I use the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste already, and using them both makes my mouth feel marvelous. There is no harsh taste, it actually tastes good but most of all, it gets my teeth squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Not only does it freshen my breath but it also provides healthy mouth benefits at the same time at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash was very easy to use with great results.  It created a clean mouth feeling without a medicinal taste.  In just one minute, I had great breath, cleaner feeling teeth and made my teeth feel protected.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> product works great, does not leave your mouth with that after burn feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I found the taste of the mouthwash rather pleasant, after about 15 seconds my tongue started burning and I had to spit the mouthwash out. My tongue had already turned blue, and I had to scrub the particles off with a facecloth. When I got up the next morning, my tongue felt very dry and the roof of my mouth felt burned and raw. I must be allergic to something in the mouthwash. I will not be trying to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;[You can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Smooth taste.  If you do not like the strong mint taste on some mouthwash, this one will be to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smooth, mild mint flavor which will let you keep swishing.</li>
            <li> Crest Prohealth Advanced provides a great way to freshen your breath and strengthen your teeth. Best of all it is alcohol free and contains fluoride for overall dental health. My breath felt clean after I used it and I mean kissable clean.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Cleans gums and teeth without leaving an aftertaste and the sting you get with other mouthwashes. Leaves your mouth feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> I loved this mouthwash and that it is alcohol free. It is so hard to find a good alcohol free mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Overall Rating [out of 5]:&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was good just not quite minty enough for me. I like my breath to feel fresher&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> I enjoyed trying the Crest Pro-Health Advanced Mouthwash. The flavor is just right..not too strong or too minty. I sometimes have sensitivity to mouthwash, but I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with this one. I didn&#x27;t use it daily though because I was fearful of having a reaction. My mouth felt fresh after using it and my breathe was fresh. I would recommend this product to others&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> The product makes my mouth feel very fresh and clean It has a very pleasant taste and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> like the idea of a mouthwash that offer more than just killing germs that cause bad breath. The strengthening of the tooth enamel, especially if you eat and drink acidic foods is great. The only slight downside is the taste was a little off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> Crest has always been a staple in my house. Only brand we use. The mouthwash is fantastic. You can feel it freshen and clean your mouth. I use it on top of the 3d whitening tooth paste and it is like a fresh cleaning from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> THis product was smooth, no harsh after taste, no tingling sensation, just left your mouth feeling clean and refreshed&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This product tasted fresh and clean. The bottle was a little difficult to open, however.&lt;br /&gt;[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]</li>
            <li> This mouthwash was an average mouthwash for me. Freshened breath without using alcohol as an ingredient.</li>
