            <li>My hair has NEVER looked more beautiful.</li>

            <li>This is a great ceramic straightener, and I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve discontinued them in the stores, so I was glad to find one online!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS IRON!</li>
            <li>They were an awesome price and does exactly what I wanted them to do.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the gold n hot brand is about the best there is.</li>
            <li>, it is absolutely magnificent; it heats up very quickly, and I love the fact that it is ceramic (it protects your hair better).  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to decided between this and another iron in the 20-45 dollar range, this is certainly the best deal around.  </li>
            <li>I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>Works perfect on 4c or very kinky hair</li>
            <li>If I  were looking for another straightener, honestly with my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li>I was considering getting a chi, but this was 1/8th the price and probably just as good :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, great price, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>found the exact product at a very good price</li>
            <li>They are very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The plates come all the way together, which is good beacuse my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t forget to use some kind of &#x27;protectant&#x27; product that minimizes the damage :)</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I chose Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>I suppose if it made a 19 year old happy, then everything is ok!</li>
            <li>Love it, gets very hot!!</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY straightner out of dozens I have tried that straightens my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad that I purchased it...</li>
            <li>but my babyliss titanium 1inch does a better job</li>
            <li>in my opinion you can&#x27;t ask for a better product</li>
            <li>i love the iron, it does wonders to my hair</li>
            <li>For the cost, you wont get a better straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>It also felt kind of cheap just holding it.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I love the intensity of the heat although I&#x27;m sure that for others not having the option of changing the settings</li>
            <li>Im pleased with my hair and this product.</li>
            <li>yes nice very worth every penny....</li>
            <li>and I love this more than I did my old one that I thought I loved!</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that Amazon do carry this product and it really is the best flat iron out there!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I chose this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Best freaking flat iron</li>
            <li>The are the best flat irons I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Gold n hot as a whole is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to handle</li>
            <li>Thanks for the tools for making my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li>perfect for long hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, but very curly hair and this iron works great for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy, thus, good product</li>
            <li>My hair is determined to do as it pleases, not as I wish, and this straightening iron has saved me from becoming one of those ladies who go to the hairdresser every week.</li>
            <li>also, I love how cheap it was.</li>
            <li>These are very good flat irons.</li>
            <li>Wow this product is magic!! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>She said it is easy to use</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s compactness but yet full plates.</li>
            <li>Gold n Hot continues to improve upon a great product that really works.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine like it used to.</li>
            <li>I love how this straightening iron heats up really quick.</li>
            <li>no temperature control -- burned my hair... returned QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great for my coarse hair!</li>
            <li>is works good on natural and chemicalled hair.</li>
            <li>This is a really great flat iron.</li>
            <li>These are great, I can flat iron my hair once a week instead of every day like I was doing before with my others.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up very quickly and straightens quickly as well without damaging hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and easily operated.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li>but I love it straightes your hair on the first try and looks shinny</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my hair - very curly, but only an ok job on hers.  </li>
            <li>what I liked is that this  straightener is getting very hot and straightens very well.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect flat iron. :)</li>
            <li>this flat iron works great and gets very hot</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>Arrived when expected and works great</li>
            <li>I use this flat iron daily on myself and it works great, I am glad I got one!</li>
            <li>cool touch</li>
            <li>but this iron is a good second.</li>
            <li>And you find yourself switching it on an off to cool and heat.</li>
            <li>I thought even a cheap one would do right about now</li>
            <li>Best straightener for such a low cost!</li>
            <li>It also heats up quickly, and I think it does a quicker job because of the wider 2\\&quot; plates.</li>
            <li>The 2-inch width helps me finish my hair quickly, and I divide my hair into four layers.</li>
            <li>I returned it quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>There is no way to cool it when it gets too hot, and remember, you are using it on your head!</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight !</li>
            <li>Would recommended the Gold n Hot brand to anyone!</li>
            <li>it got so hot it almost burned through my hair!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;plates get ultra hot!</li>
            <li>This will be the 2nd one I own.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and will give CHI a run for it&#x27;s money</li>
            <li>It did warm up quick but it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair like other ones, it looks good for a hour or 2</li>
            <li>I wanted to review it right away.</li>
            <li>Product came right on time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right size for me.</li>
            <li>It has a wide surface area so it covers more hair than the thinner ones and it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is hands down the BEST I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>No temperature control button...straighten hair very well but had to run through quickly to avoid excess heat.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>They heat up very fast.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all the sisters out there, the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a more expensive one (CROC - its amazing!)</li>
            <li>The wider ceramic size works 10 times better for me, as compare the the smaller sizes they have all over out there, in the stores.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be paying for the brand if you do ;)</li>
            <li>ok first off there is only an on and off</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it does get hot and does the job.</li>
            <li>B00092M32C Gold N Hot GH2144</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not too big and does the trick.</li>
            <li>but you may burn your hair since it get so hot</li>
            <li>and she fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m going to have to buy a Revlon one for a higher price.</li>
            <li>no settings it gets really really hot</li>
            <li>I love that it has only one setting...&amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and those ceramic&lt;</li>
            <li>I use the Vidal Sassoon clips to section and hold my hair while I use the Gold N Hot Ceramics Straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>The smaller one is easier to manage and therefore more affective.</li>
            <li>the Gold N Hot didn&#x27;t straighten my hair enough and gave my hair a lot of static.</li>
            <li>This works well, but it damages hair really quickly because the temperature is SO high &amp; there&#x27;s no way to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>It is far and away better than my old one!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 90% satisfied with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, it nicely straightens my hair making my hair feeling soft and silky, and looking shiney.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a steal, really smooths frizzy hair with proper heat protectant :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much and will never use another flat iron.</li>
            <li>having a large iron make things go faster.</li>
            <li>Works great for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li>I have found that it won&#x27;t work that great if my hair is wet or damp, so I just blow dry it before straightening.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is 2 inches wide means it takes way less time and is more effective than narrower models.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know much about the industry, but it seems to work just as well as my friends&#x27; $120 straighteners.</li>
            <li>My hair looks straight and shiny without causing a lot of damage.</li>
            <li>It now takes about 10 minutes to satisfactorily straighten my hair, 15 if I&#x27;m really picky.</li>
            <li>shipped fast...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well at all.</li>
            <li>Yeah, not so much.</li>
            <li>cuz that doesnt fry your hair as much</li>
            <li>and it still wasnt straight.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>heats up so fast, and makes my hair stick straight for 2 days with one use.</li>
            <li>I havent used it much...</li>
            <li>I cant really get close to my roots</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my wet hair, but its so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>hair has never been this straight ever.</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up quickly and to the right temperature setting.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than other straightening irons in the same price range, but next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra 20 or 30 bucks to save myself from having to pay for so many more haircuts from damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Plant to buy more for my other family members.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and straightens my long wavy hair in a snap!  </li>
            <li>and I usually need to run the flat iron about 3 times through the same spot to be perfect but</li>
            <li>Fabulous Flat Iron!!  </li>
            <li>-bye frizz, hello soft, straight and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Brand New!</li>
            <li>Bought this over a year ago and it still looks and works like new!</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis, it gets as hot as the  first time.</li>
            <li>I can now straighten my puffy hair in the morning before work and not have to spend hours to make my hair look decent.</li>
            <li>this really makes your hair soft, silk and really really straight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand reviews about this iron&#x27;s not getting hot enough because I think it gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s going to burn and it gets very hot at the same time.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t tolerate high heat this iron isn&#x27;t for you because there is no temp gauge.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally know where to go to get this flat iron.</li>
            <li>In 5 minutes, I was left with super shiny, soft and perfectly straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time that I used the Gold N Hot flat iron, I was stunned!  </li>
            <li>I have a smaller hair straighter, the wet to straight one, and this one seriously works best than that one!</li>
            <li>and for my hair it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to  keep it straight</li>
            <li>They are great for long and thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron for African American hair hands down!!</li>
            <li>But this flat iron gives me the look of Remey straight Indian hair!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>There is no need to tightly clamp the iron on your hair because it closes without much effort at all and glides smoothly over your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair that usually straightens well with a real hot iron.  </li>
            <li>They get hot enough to get the job done, and one should use a heat protectant since you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>This has no heat settings so it doesn&#x27;t even get HOT enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in August 2011 and it still works the same as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>They charge you so much for the other ceramic irons and this one is cheap and works the same.</li>
            <li>This was my fourth pair of flat irons, but my first pair of Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li>If you want a professional finish that will last all day and even once you&#x27;ve slept on it, you are going to have to fork over the bucks and get something at a higher price point.</li>
            <li>This is the first ceramic  flat iron I have had</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Gold N Hot 1&amp;#34; flat iron to replace a CHI that had ran its course</li>
            <li>It might be too powerful for fine or thin hair, though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any settings but that doesn&#x27;t matter - when I changed them on my old one</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft after using this iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and it lasts straightened for about 2 days.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for hair that shorter than four inches long because you will end up burning your scalp and leaving crimp bumps trying to avoid the hot plates.</li>
            <li>It makes bed-head disappear completely.</li>
            <li>, cheaper flat irons will pull your loose strands on the ceramic part because they are cheap.</li>
            <li>I have used Gold N Hot for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I apply a Moroccan dry oil (Suave brand) and a heat protectant then use my Gold n Hot.  </li>
            <li>They only have one temperature setting but that setting is hot enough to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wide enough to get through it quick.</li>
            <li>My last flat irons from Gold N Hot are still in use after 10 years.</li>
            <li>There are no temperature settings and it gets pretty darn hot, which may be a problem for those with finer or color-treated hair, but if you have thick hair and don&#x27;t use heat on it every day</li>
            <li>The price was affordable and Gold N Hot products tend to last very long.</li>
            <li>I will say if you are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this flat iron alone will not be enough to get your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>I really like how this flat iron heats up quickly and the size, my hair is thick so</li>
            <li>As for durability, let me just say that the TSA searched my suitcase during one business trip and crammed the iron back inside, nearly breaking the joint.</li>
            <li>It barely straightens my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with just slight wavy thin hair it would work good on.</li>
            <li>Love this Flat iron, my only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets caught between the gold plate and the plastic handle and it pulls</li>
            <li>This one got hot but not hot enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li>1\\&quot; Professional Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li>I bought this because my old flat iron broke and it was my second one</li>
            <li>so its not hot enough for my curly hair to get straight and bc its so bulky</li>
            <li>when i still using my old iron, it took me for an hour) but know, for only 15 minutes, my long hair is already done and it gives shine as well...</li>
            <li>I kept looking into 100.00+ straighteners but couldn&#x27;t get myself to spend the money on one but as my hair got longer and harder to blow dry straight</li>
            <li>so I read the reviews and tried this one, because it was less expensive than the others with good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, fairly unmanageable hair (each individual hair is practically a wire), and with my old Conair I was resigned to it taking at least a half hour on the highest setting to straighten properly.</li>

            <li> She loved it and said it did a great job with her hair.  </li>
            <li> , it straightens good</li>
            <li> , i just hoped this would be a good try.</li>
            <li> Gets good heat though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job either.</li>
            <li> Great give u a nice bump</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER looked more beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I got so many compliments on how beautiful my hair looked.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; straightens perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great price is an added bonus-I can&#x27;t understand how the $100-$200 range could be any better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Im very satisfied with my purchase and no need to spend alot of money</li>
            <li> This is a great ceramic straightener, and I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve discontinued them in the stores, so I was glad to find one online!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS IRON!</li>
            <li> They were an awesome price and does exactly what I wanted them to do.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> the gold n hot brand is about the best there is.</li>
            <li> , it is absolutely magnificent; it heats up very quickly, and I love the fact that it is ceramic (it protects your hair better).  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to decided between this and another iron in the 20-45 dollar range, this is certainly the best deal around.  </li>
            <li> I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on 4c or very kinky hair</li>
            <li> If I  were looking for another straightener, honestly with my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a chi, but this was 1/8th the price and probably just as good :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, great price, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> found the exact product at a very good price</li>
            <li> They are very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The plates come all the way together, which is good beacuse my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t forget to use some kind of &#x27;protectant&#x27; product that minimizes the damage :)</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I chose Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> I suppose if it made a 19 year old happy, then everything is ok!</li>
            <li> Love it, gets very hot!!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY straightner out of dozens I have tried that straightens my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad that I purchased it...</li>
            <li> but my babyliss titanium 1inch does a better job</li>
            <li> in my opinion you can&#x27;t ask for a better product</li>
            <li> i love the iron, it does wonders to my hair</li>
            <li> For the cost, you wont get a better straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> It also felt kind of cheap just holding it.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I love the intensity of the heat although I&#x27;m sure that for others not having the option of changing the settings</li>
            <li> Im pleased with my hair and this product.</li>
            <li> yes nice very worth every penny....</li>
            <li> and I love this more than I did my old one that I thought I loved!</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that Amazon do carry this product and it really is the best flat iron out there!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I chose this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Best freaking flat iron</li>
            <li> The are the best flat irons I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Gold n hot as a whole is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Thanks for the tools for making my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> perfect for long hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, but very curly hair and this iron works great for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy, thus, good product</li>
            <li> My hair is determined to do as it pleases, not as I wish, and this straightening iron has saved me from becoming one of those ladies who go to the hairdresser every week.</li>
            <li> also, I love how cheap it was.</li>
            <li> These are very good flat irons.</li>
            <li> Wow this product is magic!! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> She said it is easy to use</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s compactness but yet full plates.</li>
            <li> Gold n Hot continues to improve upon a great product that really works.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine like it used to.</li>
            <li> I love how this straightening iron heats up really quick.</li>
            <li> no temperature control -- burned my hair... returned QUICKLY!</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great for my coarse hair!</li>
            <li> is works good on natural and chemicalled hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really great flat iron.</li>
            <li> These are great, I can flat iron my hair once a week instead of every day like I was doing before with my others.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up very quickly and straightens quickly as well without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and easily operated.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li> but I love it straightes your hair on the first try and looks shinny</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my hair - very curly, but only an ok job on hers.  </li>
            <li> what I liked is that this  straightener is getting very hot and straightens very well.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect flat iron. :)</li>
            <li> this flat iron works great and gets very hot</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected and works great</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron daily on myself and it works great, I am glad I got one!</li>
            <li> cool touch</li>
            <li> but this iron is a good second.</li>
            <li> And you find yourself switching it on an off to cool and heat.</li>
            <li> I thought even a cheap one would do right about now</li>
            <li> Best straightener for such a low cost!</li>
            <li> It also heats up quickly, and I think it does a quicker job because of the wider 2\\&quot; plates.</li>
            <li> The 2-inch width helps me finish my hair quickly, and I divide my hair into four layers.</li>
            <li> I returned it quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> There is no way to cool it when it gets too hot, and remember, you are using it on your head!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight !</li>
            <li> Would recommended the Gold n Hot brand to anyone!</li>
            <li> it got so hot it almost burned through my hair!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;plates get ultra hot!</li>
            <li> This will be the 2nd one I own.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and will give CHI a run for it&#x27;s money</li>
            <li> It did warm up quick but it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair like other ones, it looks good for a hour or 2</li>
            <li> I wanted to review it right away.</li>
            <li> Product came right on time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the right size for me.</li>
            <li> It has a wide surface area so it covers more hair than the thinner ones and it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is hands down the BEST I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> No temperature control button...straighten hair very well but had to run through quickly to avoid excess heat.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They heat up very fast.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all the sisters out there, the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a more expensive one (CROC - its amazing!)</li>
            <li> The wider ceramic size works 10 times better for me, as compare the the smaller sizes they have all over out there, in the stores.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be paying for the brand if you do ;)</li>
            <li> ok first off there is only an on and off</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it does get hot and does the job.</li>
            <li> B00092M32C Gold N Hot GH2144</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not too big and does the trick.</li>
            <li> but you may burn your hair since it get so hot</li>
            <li> and she fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m going to have to buy a Revlon one for a higher price.</li>
            <li> no settings it gets really really hot</li>
            <li> I love that it has only one setting...&amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and those ceramic&lt;</li>
            <li> I use the Vidal Sassoon clips to section and hold my hair while I use the Gold N Hot Ceramics Straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> The smaller one is easier to manage and therefore more affective.</li>
            <li> the Gold N Hot didn&#x27;t straighten my hair enough and gave my hair a lot of static.</li>
            <li> This works well, but it damages hair really quickly because the temperature is SO high &amp; there&#x27;s no way to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> It is far and away better than my old one!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 90% satisfied with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, it nicely straightens my hair making my hair feeling soft and silky, and looking shiney.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a steal, really smooths frizzy hair with proper heat protectant :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much and will never use another flat iron.</li>
            <li> having a large iron make things go faster.</li>
            <li> Works great for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have found that it won&#x27;t work that great if my hair is wet or damp, so I just blow dry it before straightening.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is 2 inches wide means it takes way less time and is more effective than narrower models.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know much about the industry, but it seems to work just as well as my friends&#x27; $120 straighteners.</li>
            <li> My hair looks straight and shiny without causing a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> It now takes about 10 minutes to satisfactorily straighten my hair, 15 if I&#x27;m really picky.</li>
            <li> shipped fast...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well at all.</li>
            <li> Yeah, not so much.</li>
            <li> cuz that doesnt fry your hair as much</li>
            <li> and it still wasnt straight.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> heats up so fast, and makes my hair stick straight for 2 days with one use.</li>
            <li> I havent used it much...</li>
            <li> I cant really get close to my roots</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my wet hair, but its so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> hair has never been this straight ever.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and to the right temperature setting.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than other straightening irons in the same price range, but next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra 20 or 30 bucks to save myself from having to pay for so many more haircuts from damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Plant to buy more for my other family members.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and straightens my long wavy hair in a snap!  </li>
            <li> and I usually need to run the flat iron about 3 times through the same spot to be perfect but</li>
            <li> Fabulous Flat Iron!!  </li>
            <li> -bye frizz, hello soft, straight and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Brand New!</li>
            <li> Bought this over a year ago and it still looks and works like new!</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis, it gets as hot as the  first time.</li>
            <li> I can now straighten my puffy hair in the morning before work and not have to spend hours to make my hair look decent.</li>
            <li> this really makes your hair soft, silk and really really straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand reviews about this iron&#x27;s not getting hot enough because I think it gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s going to burn and it gets very hot at the same time.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tolerate high heat this iron isn&#x27;t for you because there is no temp gauge.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally know where to go to get this flat iron.</li>
            <li> In 5 minutes, I was left with super shiny, soft and perfectly straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time that I used the Gold N Hot flat iron, I was stunned!  </li>
            <li> I have a smaller hair straighter, the wet to straight one, and this one seriously works best than that one!</li>
            <li> and for my hair it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to  keep it straight</li>
            <li> They are great for long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron for African American hair hands down!!</li>
            <li> But this flat iron gives me the look of Remey straight Indian hair!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> There is no need to tightly clamp the iron on your hair because it closes without much effort at all and glides smoothly over your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair that usually straightens well with a real hot iron.  </li>
            <li> They get hot enough to get the job done, and one should use a heat protectant since you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> This has no heat settings so it doesn&#x27;t even get HOT enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in August 2011 and it still works the same as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> They charge you so much for the other ceramic irons and this one is cheap and works the same.</li>
            <li> This was my fourth pair of flat irons, but my first pair of Gold N Hot.</li>
            <li> If you want a professional finish that will last all day and even once you&#x27;ve slept on it, you are going to have to fork over the bucks and get something at a higher price point.</li>
            <li> This is the first ceramic  flat iron I have had</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Gold N Hot 1&amp;#34; flat iron to replace a CHI that had ran its course</li>
            <li> It might be too powerful for fine or thin hair, though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any settings but that doesn&#x27;t matter - when I changed them on my old one</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft after using this iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and it lasts straightened for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for hair that shorter than four inches long because you will end up burning your scalp and leaving crimp bumps trying to avoid the hot plates.</li>
            <li> It makes bed-head disappear completely.</li>
            <li> , cheaper flat irons will pull your loose strands on the ceramic part because they are cheap.</li>
            <li> I have used Gold N Hot for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I apply a Moroccan dry oil (Suave brand) and a heat protectant then use my Gold n Hot.  </li>
            <li> They only have one temperature setting but that setting is hot enough to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wide enough to get through it quick.</li>
            <li> My last flat irons from Gold N Hot are still in use after 10 years.</li>
            <li> There are no temperature settings and it gets pretty darn hot, which may be a problem for those with finer or color-treated hair, but if you have thick hair and don&#x27;t use heat on it every day</li>
            <li> The price was affordable and Gold N Hot products tend to last very long.</li>
            <li> I will say if you are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this flat iron alone will not be enough to get your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> I really like how this flat iron heats up quickly and the size, my hair is thick so</li>
            <li> As for durability, let me just say that the TSA searched my suitcase during one business trip and crammed the iron back inside, nearly breaking the joint.</li>
            <li> It barely straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with just slight wavy thin hair it would work good on.</li>
            <li> Love this Flat iron, my only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets caught between the gold plate and the plastic handle and it pulls</li>
            <li> This one got hot but not hot enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li> 1\\&quot; Professional Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old flat iron broke and it was my second one</li>
            <li> so its not hot enough for my curly hair to get straight and bc its so bulky</li>
            <li> when i still using my old iron, it took me for an hour) but know, for only 15 minutes, my long hair is already done and it gives shine as well...</li>
            <li> I kept looking into 100.00+ straighteners but couldn&#x27;t get myself to spend the money on one but as my hair got longer and harder to blow dry straight</li>
            <li> so I read the reviews and tried this one, because it was less expensive than the others with good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, fairly unmanageable hair (each individual hair is practically a wire), and with my old Conair I was resigned to it taking at least a half hour on the highest setting to straighten properly.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely curly hair that is difficult to flatten then you may need one that gets hotter i.e. 450 degrees, but this is great for the average person who needs to run a flat iron through their hair to add shine and remove blow dryer frizz!</li>
            <li> Used it a long time ago when i used to straighten my hair (curly african american hair)</li>
            <li> I thought it would get really hot and actually straighten my hair, since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> My black people; You know what I&#x27;m talking about (permed hair vs. au natural)!</li>
            <li> I had been using a 1\\&quot; Andis flat iron and was getting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this flat iron</li>
            <li> This straightening flat iron is no exception</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this flat iron and I had to go search for it.</li>
            <li> My fav is still the amika flat iron</li>
            <li> Doesnt get really hot for thick hair</li>
            <li> Before, I&#x27;ve had horrible experiences with flat irons that really cause damage to my hair (and with long locks, having a lot of split ends ain&#x27;t very sexy).</li>
            <li> Made weird buzzing sound</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I have long, layered, wavy, chemically lightened hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like is that is makes  strange noise as if</li>
            <li> This got my thick, waist length hair straight and shiny and silky like ribbon.</li>
            <li> I def recommend this to other women how are looking for something in this price range that ACTUALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I also like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking at the closing point like other flat irons I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used a 2 inch wide straightening iron on my hair</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> as expected...</li>
            <li> well its alot of work to prep and the plates are too wide to not burn your hair</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical buying this</li>
            <li> Only brand i have used for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I pulled my other ones out and had to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> But hubby performed surgery and this tough little iron is still hanging on several months later!  </li>
            <li> It is NOT worth your money to get.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and stubborn, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Also mine made this obnoxious buzzing noise whenever it was turned on abd that made ne a little nervous.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy real expensive flat irons but after reading how hot people said this iron got i thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> was so tired of spending 30+ minutes, torturing my hair to still be left with waves.  </li>
            <li> and it frizzled the ends of my hair using everyday.</li>
            <li> I just got this for my daughter which has long thick hair, she Loves it!</li>
            <li> Again, my hair is long, thick and stubborn curly!  </li>
            <li> Too heavy for small size</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky which makes it hard to get in close to the roots.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was disappointed to find out that if I tried to return it, with shipping, restocking fee, and all that, I would only get like $10 back!</li>
            <li> Ill stick to my salon grade flat irons</li>
            <li> This glides through my thick thick wavy lonnnngg hair!</li>
            <li> hair does not last at all :(</li>
            <li> The secret is in the spray for the hair, not the iron.</li>
            <li> I just hate that burnt hair smell other than that</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The worst excuse for a straightener.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it would blow up.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This iron is terrible,  it rips your hair out as you use it and it doesn&#x27;t have temperature settings!  </li>

            <li> This item work perfectly I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> Too heavy for small size</li>
            <li> This flat iron is hands down the BEST I have ever owned.  Works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight !</li>
            <li> My hair is determined to do as it pleases, not as I wish, and this straightening iron has saved me from becoming one of those ladies who go to the hairdresser every week. The fact that it is 2 inches wide means it takes way less time and is more effective than narrower models. My hairdresser used a 2 inch wide straightening iron on my hair so I read the reviews and tried this one, because it was less expensive than the others with good reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t have any settings but that doesn&#x27;t matter - when I changed them on my old one it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. It might be too powerful for fine or thin hair, though. I can&#x27;t judge its durability since I just bought it, but it&#x27;s so great I wanted to review it right away.</li>
            <li> Brand New! Just like the website said.  I am so glad I finally know where to go to get this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! Heats up quickly &amp; straightens perfectly! I have used Gold N Hot for a very long time. This is the first ceramic  flat iron I have had and I wish I had gotten it sooner! Great price is an added bonus-I can&#x27;t understand how the $100-$200 range could be any better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair straightner for 6 years.  I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair.  This is the ONLY straightner out of dozens I have tried that straightens my hair perfectly.  I have medium length hair and it takes me about 20 minutes to straighten it.  It leaves my hair very smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical buying this but I am glad that I purchased it... It saved my time( before when i still using my old iron, it took me for an hour) but know, for only 15 minutes, my long hair is already done and it gives shine as well...(-:</li>
            <li> I just got this for my daughter which has long thick hair, she Loves it! She said it is easy to use and it&#x27;s wide enough to get through it quick.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up very quickly and straightens quickly as well without damaging hair. I have very fine hair. Of course, my review might be pointless because this is my first straightener and I don&#x27;t know much about the industry, but it seems to work just as well as my friends&#x27; $120 straighteners.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t control the temperature  Disappointed.  Had to buy a 2 1/4&amp;#34; which had temp control</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fabulous! It heats up very quickly and straightens my long wavy hair in a snap!  I get tons of compliments whenever I use this. Before, I&#x27;ve had horrible experiences with flat irons that really cause damage to my hair (and with long locks, having a lot of split ends ain&#x27;t very sexy). But this one doesn&#x27;t! My hair looks straight and shiny without causing a lot of damage. My friends think I just got out of the salon!    I finally found the perfect flat iron. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 90% satisfied with this flat iron. They&#x27;ve discontinued them in the stores, so I was glad to find one online! The wider ceramic size works 10 times better for me, as compare the the smaller sizes they have all over out there, in the stores. The only downside of this iron is that you can not control the temperature - You have to go with the default setting, which can be an inconvenience at times, depending on your style need .. My black people; You know what I&#x27;m talking about (permed hair vs. au natural)! Overall, good buy, thus, good product</li>
            <li> I kept looking into 100.00+ straighteners but couldn&#x27;t get myself to spend the money on one but as my hair got longer and harder to blow dry straight I thought even a cheap one would do right about now and it did!! I thought maybe because of the price it wouldn&#x27;t do the job but it does!! Im very satisfied with my purchase and no need to spend alot of money you&#x27;ll be paying for the brand if you do ;)</li>
            <li> I have thick, fairly unmanageable hair (each individual hair is practically a wire), and with my old Conair I was resigned to it taking at least a half hour on the highest setting to straighten properly. When I lost the Conair, I went by the reviews on this one and figured it would be the same. It is far and away better than my old one! It now takes about 10 minutes to satisfactorily straighten my hair, 15 if I&#x27;m really picky. There are no temperature settings and it gets pretty darn hot, which may be a problem for those with finer or color-treated hair, but if you have thick hair and don&#x27;t use heat on it every day this is the straightener for you. Excellent investment, why spend more than $22??</li>
            <li> Best straightener for such a low cost! Only brand i have used for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> ok first off there is only an on and off switch you can&#x27;t control the heat.. and for my hair it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to  keep it straight</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. It makes my hair very smooth and straight. Now I can style my hair in no time. Will recommend it to anyone. And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Have had the iron for over 30 days now and it is working great. I use it on a daily basis, it gets as hot as the  first time. My last one burned my hair and it lasted about two days and it was out of here. I&#x27;m very happy with this choice.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic!!!  I have long, thick, and stubborn, curly hair.  I had been using a 1\\&quot; Andis flat iron and was getting was so tired of spending 30+ minutes, torturing my hair to still be left with waves.  The first time that I used the Gold N Hot flat iron, I was stunned!  After blow drying my hair, I turned the iron on and it heated up almost instantly.  That alone is a great feature!  There is no need to tightly clamp the iron on your hair because it closes without much effort at all and glides smoothly over your hair.  Instead of 5+ passes over sections of my hair, 1 pass did the trick!  1 PASS!  Again, my hair is long, thick and stubborn curly!  In 5 minutes, I was left with super shiny, soft and perfectly straight hair.  And it&#x27;s only $20!!!  What a deal!  I love this thing so much and will never use another flat iron.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I chose this flat iron. I have fine, but very curly hair and this iron works great for me. The plates come all the way together, which is good beacuse my hair is so fine. I have found that it won&#x27;t work that great if my hair is wet or damp, so I just blow dry it before straightening. It also heats up quickly, and I think it does a quicker job because of the wider 2\\&quot; plates.</li>
            <li> No temperature control button...straighten hair very well but had to run through quickly to avoid excess heat. Very light weight and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I love how this straightening iron heats up really quick. Not only that, it nicely straightens my hair making my hair feeling soft and silky, and looking shiney. Great product! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS IRON! You can&#x27;t beat the price. My hair is so shiny and soft after using this iron. Would recommended the Gold n Hot brand to anyone!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it does get hot and does the job. also does not PULL my hair, cheaper flat irons will pull your loose strands on the ceramic part because they are cheap. This glides through my thick thick wavy lonnnngg hair! I needed a 2inch because 1inch will take me forever to get my hair done. I recommend this product for overall quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this flat iron but they don&#x27;t sell it in my local beauty supply stores. I was happy to see that Amazon do carry this product and it really is the best flat iron out there!</li>
            <li> Fabulous Flat Iron!!  I have been using \\&quot;Gold-N-Hot\\&quot; products for quite some time now, and have no doubt that I will continue because their products simply do what they say they are going to do.  This straightening flat iron is no exception, it is absolutely magnificent; it heats up very quickly, and I love the fact that it is ceramic (it protects your hair better).  It&#x27;s a great product, great price, highly recommend. [[ASIN:B00092M32C Gold N Hot GH2144 1\\&quot; Professional Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> They were an awesome price and does exactly what I wanted them to do.  They heat up very fast.  I can now straighten my puffy hair in the morning before work and not have to spend hours to make my hair look decent. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking at the closing point like other flat irons I&#x27;ve had before.  They are very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Product came right on time. This is a really great flat iron. Love that it&#x27;s not too big and does the trick. My hair comes out great and it lasts for days. Must buy!!</li>
            <li> Love this Flat iron, my only complaint is that sometimes my hair gets caught between the gold plate and the plastic handle and it pulls but it does the job well!</li>
            <li> this flat iron works great and gets very hot, it straightens good but you may burn your hair since it get so hot just lubricate your hair I just hate that burnt hair smell other than that is works good on natural and chemicalled hair.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. It came. It heated. It straightened. It works like it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t take forever to hear up. Delivery was even faster then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> honestly I saw excellent reviews so I decided to purchase but my babyliss titanium 1inch does a better job... hair does not last at all :(</li>
            <li> Thsi product is awesome. I use it every other day. This will be the 2nd one I own. My hair is soft and it lasts straightened for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> Best freaking flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> So my ex at the time got this and she fell in love with it instantly. It has a wide surface area so it covers more hair than the thinner ones and it heats up very quickly. I def recommend this to other women how are looking for something in this price range that ACTUALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I think I have a hair texture that has no name! No 4a, 4b, 4c &amp; 4d?  But this flat iron gives me the look of Remey straight Indian hair!! No lie! This is the best flat iron for African American hair hands down!! Love it! Plant to buy more for my other family members.</li>
            <li> No iron works the way this one does...great item would buy again...shipped fast...as expected...my daughter loves it too. Thank you</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely and straightens hair without damaging it! I will say if you are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this flat iron alone will not be enough to get your hair bone straight. I would use along with a pressing comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old flat iron broke and it was my second one and I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I read the reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I love this more than I did my old one that I thought I loved! Great price and GREAT product</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this flat iron and I had to go search for it. I looked at beauty supply stores and only found the 1\\&quot;. this really makes your hair soft, silk and really really straight.</li>
            <li> the gold n hot brand is about the best there is. in my opinion you can&#x27;t ask for a better product</li>
            <li> This works well, but it damages hair really quickly because the temperature is SO high &amp; there&#x27;s no way to adjust the temperature. It works much better than other straightening irons in the same price range, but next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra 20 or 30 bucks to save myself from having to pay for so many more haircuts from damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron daily on myself and it works great, I am glad I got one! If you have extremely curly hair that is difficult to flatten then you may need one that gets hotter i.e. 450 degrees, but this is great for the average person who needs to run a flat iron through their hair to add shine and remove blow dryer frizz!</li>
            <li> Gold n Hot continues to improve upon a great product that really works. Thanks for the tools for making my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> This product does not have a temperature control setting.  It was advertised as \\&quot;Can reach up to 400 degrees\\&quot; but there is no way to control the heat.  There is no way to cool it when it gets too hot, and remember, you are using it on your head! Also, I was disappointed to find out that if I tried to return it, with shipping, restocking fee, and all that, I would only get like $10 back! What a rip. I would not recommend this product because of the lack of heat control.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on 4c or very kinky hair</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I have long, layered, wavy, chemically lightened hair.  I apply a Moroccan dry oil (Suave brand) and a heat protectant then use my Gold n Hot.  Buh-bye frizz, hello soft, straight and shiny!  I don&#x27;t understand reviews about this iron&#x27;s not getting hot enough because I think it gets REALLY hot.  The 2-inch width helps me finish my hair quickly, and I divide my hair into four layers. I would not recommend this for hair that shorter than four inches long because you will end up burning your scalp and leaving crimp bumps trying to avoid the hot plates. As for durability, let me just say that the TSA searched my suitcase during one business trip and crammed the iron back inside, nearly breaking the joint. But hubby performed surgery and this tough little iron is still hanging on several months later!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a proper straightner but I wanted a 2&amp;#34; barrel and this thing is horrid. It barely straightens my hair. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to buy a Revlon one for a higher price. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. Doesn&#x27;t really work well at all.</li>
            <li> found the exact product at a very good price</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> loves this product just can&#x27;t use it every day. no settings it gets really really hot and it frizzled the ends of my hair using everyday. but I love it straightes your hair on the first try and looks shinny</li>
            <li> Bought this over a year ago and it still looks and works like new! This is a great ceramic straightener, and I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The are the best flat irons I have ever owned. This was my fourth pair of flat irons, but my first pair of Gold N Hot. These are great, I can flat iron my hair once a week instead of every day like I was doing before with my others. They only have one temperature setting but that setting is hot enough to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected and works great</li>
            <li> This iron is terrible,  it rips your hair out as you use it and it doesn&#x27;t have temperature settings!  Doesn&#x27;t not even deserve 1 star!</li>
            <li> Made weird buzzing sound and I was afraid it would blow up. I returned it quickly. Also it was larger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> i used it and it burned a hole in my couch it got so hot it almost burned through my hair!</li>
            <li> I really like how this flat iron heats up quickly and the size, my hair is thick so having a large iron make things go faster. I would recommend this product to all the sisters out there, the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great!  This flat iron heats up quickly and to the right temperature setting.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great straightner.</li>
            <li> i love the iron, it does wonders to my hair and it&#x27;s just the right size for me. cool touch</li>
            <li> well its alot of work to prep and the plates are too wide to not burn your hair thats all</li>
            <li> For the cost, you wont get a better straightening iron.  A friend recommended this for my daughter who has textured hair.  It does a great job on my hair - very curly, but only an ok job on hers.  It is a little bulky which makes it hard to get in close to the roots.  I ended up getting a more expensive one (CROC - its amazing!) for daily use.  But plan on using this one for travel.  If you are trying to decided between this and another iron in the 20-45 dollar range, this is certainly the best deal around.  If you want a professional finish that will last all day and even once you&#x27;ve slept on it, you are going to have to fork over the bucks and get something at a higher price point.</li>
            <li> I was reading all the reviews and thought it would be a great straightener but it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off and it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair like other ones, it looks good for a hour or 2 then starts to get frizzy. I would buy a different product, I don&#x27;t know why they even make these products without the auto shut off.</li>
            <li> I thought it would get really hot and actually straighten my hair, since I have thick hair. Yeah, not so much. It will straighten it if I hold it on the hair for a while but I guess it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to Chi&#x27;s. If I  were looking for another straightener, honestly with my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t get this one. Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the item they promised. Used it a long time ago when i used to straighten my hair (curly african american hair) and it worked fine like it used to. They charge you so much for the other ceramic irons and this one is cheap and works the same. My fav is still the amika flat iron cuz that doesnt fry your hair as much but this iron is a good second.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this.  I usually buy real expensive flat irons but after reading how hot people said this iron got i thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have pretty curly hair that usually straightens well with a real hot iron.  This one got hot but not hot enough for my hair.  I had to flatten the same section several.times and it still wasnt straight.  I pulled my other ones out and had to finish the job.  Also mine made this obnoxious buzzing noise whenever it was turned on abd that made ne a little nervous.  Maybe someone with just slight wavy thin hair it would work good on. I retuned it because of the buzzing noise.  It also felt kind of cheap just holding it.  Ill stick to my salon grade flat irons, i just hoped this would be a good try.</li>
            <li> Works great for thick curly hair! For the price it is a steal, really smooths frizzy hair with proper heat protectant :)</li>
            <li> Gold n hot as a whole is wonderful.  However the only problem i find with this purchase is temp control.  There is no was for you to control the heat. And you find yourself switching it on an off to cool and heat.</li>
            <li> These are very good flat irons. They are great for long and thick hair. They heat up quickly. They get hot enough to get the job done, and one should use a heat protectant since you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature. Overall, this was a great buy. The price was affordable and Gold N Hot products tend to last very long. My last flat irons from Gold N Hot are still in use after 10 years.</li>
            <li> This product was the biggest piece of s*** I have ever seen. The worst excuse for a straightener. This has no heat settings so it doesn&#x27;t even get HOT enough to straighten my hair. If I could return it I would. It is NOT worth your money to get. Its a s***ty product!</li>
            <li> I had one and gave it to my neighbors daughter who was just learning how to do her hair. At the time I was wearing corn rows&lt;br /&gt;and didn&#x27;t think I would use it again. Well, I was wrong. I could not find one in stores (here in Alabama) and I turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the straightening iron because of having owned one before. I love that it has only one setting...&amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and those ceramic&lt;br /&gt;plates get ultra hot! I don&#x27;t have to use it but once every two weeks so that I won&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this straightener according to the customer reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it now. what I liked is that this  straightener is getting very hot and straightens very well. love it.&lt;br /&gt;what I didn&#x27;t like is that is makes  strange noise as if, it&#x27;s going to burn and it gets very hot at the same time. I hope it won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This iron works wonders. A must buy for African American Women. Heats up quickly and easily operated. I bought this along with the Gold N Hot 1&amp;#34; flat iron to replace a CHI that had ran its course and I&#x27;m so happy I chose Gold N Hot. Definitely worth the money and will give CHI a run for it&#x27;s money</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Doesnt get really hot for thick hair</li>
            <li> This model works great.  Heats fast and get the job done.  I use the Vidal Sassoon clips to section and hold my hair while I use the Gold N Hot Ceramics Straightening iron.  My daughter tells me that it works as well as her Chi with the same features.</li>
            <li> heats up so fast, and makes my hair stick straight for 2 days with one use. AMAZING! also, I love how cheap it was. I was considering getting a chi, but this was 1/8th the price and probably just as good :)</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s compactness but yet full plates. It works great. If you can&#x27;t tolerate high heat this iron isn&#x27;t for you because there is no temp gauge.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in August 2011 and it still works the same as the first time I used it. I love the intensity of the heat although I&#x27;m sure that for others not having the option of changing the settings is a downside. I would buy this product again if necessary.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this straightening iron. It makes bed-head disappear completely. Just don&#x27;t forget to use some kind of &#x27;protectant&#x27; product that minimizes the damage :)</li>
            <li> The smaller one is easier to manage and therefore more affective. Gets good heat though. The secret is in the spray for the hair, not the iron.</li>
            <li> I havent used it much...doesnt have adjustable heat so its not hot enough for my curly hair to get straight and bc its so bulky I cant really get close to my roots</li>
            <li> When you use this , your hair smells burnt! It doesn&#x27;t do a good job either. I regret buying this</li>
            <li> perfect for long hair</li>
            <li> no temperature control -- burned my hair... returned QUICKLY!</li>
            <li> Great give u a nice bump yes nice very worth every penny....</li>
            <li> i order this product and did not work.....tried to send it back and had nothing but problems!!! i just went and bought a chi..</li>
            <li> Love it, gets very hot!! Great for my coarse hair!</li>
            <li> This got my thick, waist length hair straight and shiny and silky like ribbon. My hair has NEVER looked more beautiful. I used this to straighten my hair for my brother&#x27;s graduation and I got so many compliments on how beautiful my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller hair straighter, the wet to straight one, and this one seriously works best than that one! yeah I don&#x27;t use it on my wet hair, but its so silky and smooth! And the best part I ordered on wednesday, i had it friday!(:</li>
            <li> Wow this product is magic!! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been this straight ever. Im pleased with my hair and this product. Except there was no button to control the temperature which is why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my niece and she loved it.  She had been looking at much more expensive straightening irons and I decided to save some money and got her this one.  She loved it and said it did a great job with her hair.  I suppose if it made a 19 year old happy, then everything is ok!</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it was on sale for $19.95. It did warm up quick but it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. I have wavy hair and I usually need to run the flat iron about 3 times through the same spot to be perfect but the Gold N Hot didn&#x27;t straighten my hair enough and gave my hair a lot of static. It left my hair puffy and still a bit wavy. I had to return it.</li>
