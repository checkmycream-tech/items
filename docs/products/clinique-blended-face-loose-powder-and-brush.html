            <li>Well, I found that Clinique Loose Powder is the best powder for my makeup transformation.</li>
            <li>My blush goes on smoothly after I&#x27;ve powdered.  </li>
            <li>Have used lighter and they are to light giving a ghost look.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and prevents shiny areas from coming through.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what she want and is hhapy with it!</li>

            <li>Looks much more natural, but I like to hide my freckles.</li>
            <li>Came right on Time.</li>
            <li>I am blonde hair blue eyes, and looks like you are wearing nothing  Other popular brands offer loose powder, This is a good price for a nice product.</li>
            <li>It sheds and it doesn&#x27;t apply the powder very well.  </li>
            <li>Not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Just what I had expected. :)</li>
            <li>I use Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, but I found a light brushing of Clinique&#x27;s Loose Powder kept my transformation looking morning fresh!  </li>
            <li>An old clinique pot filled with other powder.</li>
            <li>Not new, no box and a different cheap brush, made in china</li>
            <li>Simply, brush a light coating of Clinique&#x27;s Loose Powder and your transformation will last 4-6 hrs longer</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spill when you drop it, and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> kabuki face brush for my loose powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s loose powder for over 25 years and they sill have not improved their brush.</li>
            <li> I have Clinique&#x27;s Compact Powder too, but prefer the loose powder.</li>
            <li> The product was as I expected</li>
            <li> The brush that Clinque includes in the box is not worth using.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong color I guess</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate it when your blush fades and your foundation seems to evaporate into thin air?  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m only going to buy this from now on. I use the lightest shade for my extremely fair skin. Pairs with foudation well, also. Doesn&#x27;t spill when you drop it, and it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The powder is nice for setting your makeup.  I always apply the powder BEFORE I apply my blush.  My blush goes on smoothly after I&#x27;ve powdered.  The brush that Clinque includes in the box is not worth using.  It sheds and it doesn&#x27;t apply the powder very well.  I use the e.l.f. kabuki face brush for my loose powder. I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s loose powder for over 25 years and they sill have not improved their brush. A great tip for smooth foundation and powder is to make sure that you include manual exfoliation in your cleaning routine.  I love Clinique&#x27;s 7 Day Scrub Cream.</li>
            <li> All Good. Came right on Time. Nothing to complain. My mom loved it. It was exactly what she want and is hhapy with it!</li>
            <li> Clinique products are great--and this powder is no exception.  Works well with the foundation for a long-lasting finish that doesn&#x27;t discolor during the day.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing.  An old clinique pot filled with other powder. Not new, no box and a different cheap brush, made in china</li>
            <li> This is a. Great product. Last one lasted me over 5 yrs!! I love how the powder glides over my skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this powder. By far my favorite. Be sure and press it into your complexion instead of rubbing it on. No shine, great setting/blending powder.</li>
            <li> Definitely my fav. gives great coverage, goes on light and smooth, does not sink in lines on the face I think the 03 gives a hint of color and coverage.  Have used lighter and they are to light giving a ghost look.  I am blonde hair blue eyes, and looks like you are wearing nothing  Other popular brands offer loose powder, This is a good price for a nice product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate it when your blush fades and your foundation seems to evaporate into thin air?  Well, I found that Clinique Loose Powder is the best powder for my makeup transformation. I use Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, but I found a light brushing of Clinique&#x27;s Loose Powder kept my transformation looking morning fresh!  Simply, brush a light coating of Clinique&#x27;s Loose Powder and your transformation will last 4-6 hrs longer (I don&#x27;t use the tiny brush that is included). I have Clinique&#x27;s Compact Powder too, but prefer the loose powder. Occasionally, I use just the powder alone and brush on a smidge of powder blush. Looks much more natural, but I like to hide my freckles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It goes on smooth and prevents shiny areas from coming through.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product was as I expected</li>
            <li> Just what I had expected. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong color I guess</li>
            <li> all thoroughly recommend</li>
            <li> I have always loved this powder...sheer yet flawless. This item arrived 2 days after I ordered it &amp; was nicely packaged. Will order again !</li>
