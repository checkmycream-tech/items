            <li>Love this product..  Would not be without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent; I suffer from symptoms related to crohn’s.</li>
            <li>It mininizing the itching cased by healing skin, it lubricates so that its not painful when the area stretches, and it is amazing what it does to minimize the scarring.  </li>
            <li>I know this to be a very good product, however, at the time I placed my order it was on back order from the supplier</li>
            <li>I got a tube in the hospital &amp; loved it so much I have ordered mutiples.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from Eucerin to Vaseline and this product aids in keeping my skin moisturized and free of &amp;#34;breakouts.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Sealed his clean little bum the best and the rash was gone in 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This product is unique in skin barriers.  </li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin and diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>I have no personal experience of this, but wife is very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>No grease, no mess, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I fell &amp; broke my femur bone in my right leg, so I am spending a lot of time laying.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky to work with but worth it.</li>
            <li>Truly soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things and this is the only thing that heals and protects.</li>
            <li>I am positive that there will always be some of this product in the house.  </li>
            <li>I was given this originally in the hospital and bought another tube because it was the best and least messy skin protectant I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The Proshield has kept her skin free from a diaper rash and does not dry her skin out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can only give stars based on previous experience - it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I continued its use through the whole healting process and my scar was so faint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>and it really proctec her.</li>
            <li>This was first given to me my one of my wound care nurses years ago to use because my skin was so sensitive to the adhesives used in my bandaging.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this is the only one that easily washes off yet thoroughly protects the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is also clear which does not stain clothing.</li>
            <li>Completely shield.</li>
            <li>the Proshield Plus Skin Protectant cleared them, but my problem is the skin has been damaged &amp; we are totally out of the skin protectant &amp; I am very scared it is going to open up again.</li>
            <li>I like it MUCH better than zinc oxide, and while very thick, it didn&#x27;t stain clothes and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me.</li>
            <li>This is literally the only thing that would keep him clear and keep us from needing steroids all the time.</li>
            <li>After finally getting the sore to close completely we are using this as a daily protectant to prevent it from reopening.  </li>
            <li>So far it is a miracle and seems to be creating that extra barrier necessary to protect the fragile skin.</li>

            <li> I got the idea when they sent a tube home after my husband had several surgeries to apply and keep the wounds dry when cleaning.</li>
            <li> My daughter (4yrs) has dry hands in the winter.</li>

            <li> AND, if the skin has already gotten sore with open areas, it sticks to broken skin where other products don&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse, and we constantly have to wash our hands. I have tried everything from Eucerin to Vaseline and this product aids in keeping my skin moisturized and free of &amp;#34;breakouts.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one that easily washes off yet thoroughly protects the skin.  It is expensive but I can&#x27;t imagine letting a sick person suffer one more problem that this product resolves.</li>
            <li> The product works very good. Helps stop the burning  that comes from skin irratation. It is also clear which does not stain clothing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product really works well!!</li>
            <li> My disabled daughter got this during a hospital stay for her diaper area.  When we brought her home I decided to give it a try and am very happy to say I love it. The Proshield has kept her skin free from a diaper rash and does not dry her skin out.  I am going to buy more when we run out. I do think its expensive though, but if it works I will pay more.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for every part of the body. I got a tube in the hospital &amp; loved it so much I have ordered mutiples.</li>
            <li> works for my butt - real serious wound protected</li>
            <li> We had prior experience with the Pro Shield product from a stay in the hospital. It protects any cuts, burns or chaffing.</li>
            <li> I was given this originally in the hospital and bought another tube because it was the best and least messy skin protectant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I like it MUCH better than zinc oxide, and while very thick, it didn&#x27;t stain clothes and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me.</li>
            <li> My infant had terrible redness under his chin and on his chest from excessive drooling. This is literally the only thing that would keep him clear and keep us from needing steroids all the time. Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I know this to be a very good product, however, at the time I placed my order it was on back order from the supplier and I had to change my order to a different product.  I can only give stars based on previous experience - it is a great product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This was first given to me my one of my wound care nurses years ago to use because my skin was so sensitive to the adhesives used in my bandaging.  I continued its use through the whole healting process and my scar was so faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had another surgery, and as soon as my wounds closed I started using this product immediately. It mininizing the itching cased by healing skin, it lubricates so that its not painful when the area stretches, and it is amazing what it does to minimize the scarring.  I keep this product in my medicine cabinet at all times.</li>
            <li> My daughter (4yrs) has dry hands in the winter. Her hands get to the point of bleeding due to the dryness. This is the only product I have found that protects her hands and promotes healing.</li>
            <li> This product is unique in skin barriers.  Anytime someone is incontinent, they should be using a skin protective barrier to protect the skin from urine or stool.  This product will do that AND, if the skin has already gotten sore with open areas, it sticks to broken skin where other products don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a one of a kind product.  I hve worked in skincare and wound care for 28 years and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other creams! This stuff cures every diaper rash my kids have had. It also is safe for cloth diapers. I hope I can always find it because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is developing pressure sores or sores from moist areas on areas where their skin folds.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended.  It works really well.  A little goes a long way.  Will continue to use.  Wish it were not so pricey though.</li>
            <li> Love this product..  Would not be without it. Great for sores where it is moist.</li>
            <li> I use this in making homemade butt paste for my great grandson who suffered horribly with diaper rash. Everything organic and healing with a couple squirts of this in it. Sealed his clean little bum the best and the rash was gone in 24 hours. Very sticky to work with but worth it. I got the idea when they sent a tube home after my husband had several surgeries to apply and keep the wounds dry when cleaning. It worked great for that so thought...hey, why not?</li>
            <li> I have no personal experience of this, but wife is very satisfied with it.  I am positive that there will always be some of this product in the house.  It is my purpose in lie to please my ill wife and this product pleases her and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> It is like a thin vaseline in consistency.  Vaseline works just as well and would probably not pay the extra cost for this product.</li>
            <li> Truly soft, smooth skin.  I&#x27;d certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, so glad it is available on Amazon.  We use it for wound care on my husband and my daughter uses for her baby&#x27;s occasional diaper rash.  This product was recommended by a wound care specialist we had been seeing for my husband&#x27;s pressure sore that would not heal, for over two years.  After finally getting the sore to close completely we are using this as a daily protectant to prevent it from reopening.  So far it is a miracle and seems to be creating that extra barrier necessary to protect the fragile skin.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommend this for my mother so I buy it, they put it on my mother skin and it really proctec her. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent; I suffer from symptoms related to crohn’s. I&#x27;ve tried many things and this is the only thing that heals and protects.</li>
            <li> did not work,because it was some thing else.thank you</li>
            <li> We have not received the order.  We know the Proshield Plus Skin Protectant works for skin that has broken down.  I fell &amp; broke my femur bone in my right leg, so I am spending a lot of time laying.  I have had 2 bed sores &amp; because we didn&#x27;t let it get out of control the Proshield Plus Skin Protectant cleared them, but my problem is the skin has been damaged &amp; we are totally out of the skin protectant &amp; I am very scared it is going to open up again.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin and diaper rashes. Nothing compares to it. Wish that they have a larger size though.</li>
            <li> Amazing gel for soothing my daughter&#x27;s nappy rash. Results within twelve hours. Would massively recommend it to parents who&#x27;s children suffer and nothing else will work.</li>
            <li> Excellent best there is for baby diaper rash</li>
            <li> Great product. Completely shield. No grease, no mess, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great price, free shipping.</li>
