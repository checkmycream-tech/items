            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in cooking like most would do</li>
            <li>I could get a refund if I tried I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Which may be okay for some, but that&#x27;s why I like bath salts.</li>
            <li>bath salt hope its OK to eat this stuff</li>
            <li>They look lovely displayed in a glass container on the countertop and remind me that I can pamper myself today.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love these crystals they work wonders in wraps for scrubs or in the bath</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality Himalayan salt only.  </li>
            <li>It is relaxing and gives the water a nice, comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FOR MY SALT BAR</li>
            <li>fantastic, completely edible, and a great price!</li>
            <li>I love taking a bath in these salts</li>
            <li>my skin is so much better now clearer and softer</li>
            <li>I like the fine grain better, but it works well.</li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s a beautiful addition to my bath salt mixture and will definitely keep using and buying it</li>
            <li>I loved these so much</li>
            <li>The price was good and it shipped really fast.  </li>
            <li>very good quality, easy to open and close (it seals).</li>
            <li>This salt is nice, dissolves well and is a good carrier for the essential oils I put in with it to add to the bath!</li>
            <li>I drink an Adrenal Cocktail (search term)made from 1/4 t. of this salt in a glass of filtered water with the juice of half a lemon and a bit of stevia each day to support my adrenal glands and the results have been excellent...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to order more!</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It worked great in my bath along with my essential oils and herbs.</li>
            <li>The salt is always dissolved fairly quickly and the tub is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in an ancient ocean, rich in healing minerals.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited for these to arrive.</li>
            <li>The crystals are a perfect size to use in a small salt grinder.  </li>
            <li>They absorbed the essential oils well and made a great bath soak.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>If your in-house water softener is already turned to high, why bother adding more, esp.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly and their customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The Coarse crystals work best for warm baths and dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, displayed in a glass jar.</li>
            <li>and they have such a lovely color to them!</li>
            <li>really relieves the pains in the joints!!</li>
            <li>well calm and look after skin.</li>
            <li>Himalayan Salt holds Negative Ions,which is amazing for your body, and removes toxins when put in a bath with warm water.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li>Powerful healing in a salt bath/spray.</li>
            <li>While very pretty and nicely packaged, these salts are large and take a long time to dissolve in even very hot water.</li>
            <li>Our skin is soft from bathing in this salt but more than that our hair is so much stronger.  </li>
            <li>so over all I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it and sadly won&#x27;t be able to buy more.</li>
            <li>This never happens when I stick to foods cooked at home and seasoned with this salt.</li>
            <li>Those minerals are life supporting and synergistic.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>These arrived exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dissolve well at all even in quite hot water.</li>
            <li>Its a gently pink coloring, and dissolves nicely in bath water.</li>
            <li>They seem ok (I like the larger ones as for some reason I like feeling the texture of them in the bath)</li>
            <li>so it needs to be in a hot bath for a while to dissolve first.</li>
            <li>Since she started taking long salt baths with these crystals her hair is much stronger and doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily anymore.  </li>
            <li>I immediately loved the color and raw texture of the bath salt.  </li>
            <li>In fact the salt helps keep the tub clean because salt is a natural disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this,  then as directed I put it in the tub and ran alot of hot water on it, it just laid there never dissolving.</li>
            <li>The natural pink color is awesome since I only use 100% natural ingredients and have problems coloring items.</li>
            <li>But this salt too large.</li>
            <li>i love the pink color of this salt.</li>
            <li>Lovely pink crystals.</li>
            <li>So, a kilo is not quite as much volume as you may expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An open jar of scented bath salts can be left in a room to leave an nice smell.  </li>
            <li>a whole lot of dry hair that tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>I read all the good reviews and now firmly disagree with any potential of this item.</li>
            <li>This product was bought on special and was much cheaper than I would normally had to pay for it, only have used it in a gift foot soak so far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this salt and this seller.</li>
            <li>Is just too coarse to for my bathwater to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Next time it will get to the right address</li>
            <li>Using Himalayan pink salt provides far more minerals, including essential iodine, to your diet.</li>
            <li>I buy the granulated salt to cook with, I buy the large salt rocks to make sole water with and to use as a salt rock deodorant and I buy these bath crystals for my baths and my daughter&#x27;s baths.  </li>
            <li>OK - when I opened this product I was a little surprised it was not larger -</li>
            <li>I make natural beauty products and then write about it on my blog.  </li>
            <li>The HIMALAYAN salt is alright, but it does not completely dissolve in bath water no matter how hot it is.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dissolve completely in the tub</li>
            <li>Some reviewers noted that this salt does not contain Iodine, but the are referring to ADDED Iodine, which is added to processed, bleached salt because the processing takes out ALL the minerals that naturally occur in salt.</li>
            <li>A big thanks to Spice Lab.</li>
            <li>If you already have soft water, this will make it softer because, after all, it is salt and therefore increases the saline content.</li>
            <li>, I only buy from The Spice Lab because Amazon charges too much for shipping for this product.</li>
            <li>I really like pink Himalayan sea salt baths!</li>
            <li>but the shipping was way too high (due to the weight)</li>

            <li> The HIMALAYAN salt is alright, but it does not completely dissolve in bath water no matter how hot it is.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dissolve completely in the tub</li>
            <li> Some reviewers noted that this salt does not contain Iodine, but the are referring to ADDED Iodine, which is added to processed, bleached salt because the processing takes out ALL the minerals that naturally occur in salt.</li>
            <li> A big thanks to Spice Lab.</li>
            <li> If you already have soft water, this will make it softer because, after all, it is salt and therefore increases the saline content.</li>
            <li> , I only buy from The Spice Lab because Amazon charges too much for shipping for this product.</li>
            <li> I really like pink Himalayan sea salt baths!</li>
            <li> but the shipping was way too high (due to the weight)</li>
            <li> The pink caused some rings to be left in the tub the next day and they accumulated around the drain.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Himalayan pink salt for several bath salts.</li>
            <li> took a long time to dissolve and when it did, left a pink bath tub ring.</li>
            <li> The water from my tub is piping hot, yet I have a hard time melting the salt!</li>
            <li> but, salt is heavy apparently.</li>
            <li> It very long is dissolved and remains at the bottom of a bath pink stones.</li>
            <li> A little essential oil</li>
            <li> I bought these for bath salts - added a little lavender essential oil and they smell heavenly, but they are also food grade so you can use them to salt your food.</li>
            <li> I also crushed some up a little smaller and added some aloe, Vitamin E and lavender oils for a cleansing face scrub.</li>
            <li> I found that they did not disolve very quickly which made it rather uncomfortable when I got in (meaning a pain in the rear literally!).  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> But you take a bath to get clean, so dirty water isn&#x27;t reassuring.  </li>
            <li> This pink Himalayan salt is a luxurious bath waiting to happen!</li>
            <li> I also like the other samples I received from this company.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been using my other bath salts instead.</li>
            <li> so I usually mix with finer ground pink or other sea salt</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the tastiest salt (use less) I have ever used.</li>
            <li> the store I frequent only had some weird green ones that usually disappear as soon as you drop them in</li>
            <li> little concerned the package claims it to be</li>
            <li> I thought it was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Added another bag of lavender and rosebuds and put it all in a small burlap bag.  </li>
            <li> no more waking up between 2-4 a.m.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how therapeutic they are?</li>
            <li> The remainder leaves my tub dirty.</li>
            <li> I want to like this product, but it makes the water muddy and my tub dirty.  </li>
            <li> I feel very uncomfortably bloated afterward, and my blood pressure is elevated for a day or so.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved these so much I had to buy bulk amount! This pink Himalayan salt is a luxurious bath waiting to happen!</li>
            <li> Bought this to mix with essential oils and give out as Xmas presents for bath salts. The natural pink color is awesome since I only use 100% natural ingredients and have problems coloring items. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all, you can be finished with your bath and the crystals are still not dissolved. I thought it was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> i love the pink color of this salt. I don&#x27;t use it in cooking like most would do so I cannot comment on the taste. I use this product for making bath salts. A little essential oil and I have a great gift for the holidays. I packed it in clear glass jars and it made wonderful gifts. The price was good and it shipped really fast.  An open jar of scented bath salts can be left in a room to leave an nice smell.  I make natural beauty products and then write about it on my blog.  I have an author page here on Amazon with the details of the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> The HIMALAYAN salt is alright, but it does not completely dissolve in bath water no matter how hot it is.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the fine grain better, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Will never buy again. I regret being foolish enough to buy 3 bags. This product is more useless than Epsom salt. I read all the good reviews and now firmly disagree with any potential of this item. I could get a refund if I tried I&#x27;m sure but it isn&#x27;t worth my time. I can probably put this salt to use in some non-bath context.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, i really thought i would get the relaxed feeling a lil bit, but.NO....u can have it back</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the tastiest salt (use less) I have ever used. Using Himalayan pink salt provides far more minerals, including essential iodine, to your diet. It is not salt we should avoid. It is SUGAR! I highly recommend this salt and this seller.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful but doesn&#x27;t have any smell to it. Which may be okay for some, but that&#x27;s why I like bath salts.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these salts!  Made my aches and pains melt away, very good quality, easy to open and close (it seals).</li>
            <li> everyone loved them and enjoyed their baths. Smelled wonderful! Will definitly buy again the next time i need to do this.</li>
            <li> Salt grain is good quality but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything. It comes in 2 pound package and is good value</li>
            <li> The best, buy it in bulk &amp; make yourself some bath salts!</li>
            <li> I bought it to take a bath. Sea salt well calm and look after skin. But this salt too large. It very long is dissolved and remains at the bottom of a bath pink stones.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product!!</li>
            <li> Great salt with that beautiful pink color. Doesn&#x27;t dissolve completely in the tub so I usually mix with finer ground pink or other sea salt</li>
            <li> I bagged a spoonful of these for my clients for Christmas gifts.  Added another bag of lavender and rosebuds and put it all in a small burlap bag.  They loved them.  Added my own touch by stamping the burlap.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order from the Spice Lab and I plan to continue buying from them. This salt is very good tasting and as others have noted, it does not cause one to have edema (swelling). I have been using Himalayan salt for several years and I&#x27;ve noticed that when I occasionally get food away from home that has processed salt on it I feel very uncomfortably bloated afterward, and my blood pressure is elevated for a day or so. This never happens when I stick to foods cooked at home and seasoned with this salt. I drink an Adrenal Cocktail (search term)made from 1/4 t. of this salt in a glass of filtered water with the juice of half a lemon and a bit of stevia each day to support my adrenal glands and the results have been excellent...no more waking up between 2-4 a.m. and my fatigue is noticeably lessened. Some reviewers noted that this salt does not contain Iodine, but the are referring to ADDED Iodine, which is added to processed, bleached salt because the processing takes out ALL the minerals that naturally occur in salt. Himalayan salt actually contains the minerals that are in the earth from which it is mined. Those minerals are life supporting and synergistic. A big thanks to Spice Lab.</li>
            <li> great product. works great for my bath salts.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved the color and raw texture of the bath salt.  A very light smell that can be used in the spa</li>
            <li> Works nice for foot scrubs.</li>
            <li> perfect for my salt mill&lt;br /&gt;a little concerned the package claims it to be bath salt hope its OK to eat this stuff</li>
            <li> took a long time to dissolve and when it did, left a pink bath tub ring. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> Beautiful Himalayan Pink Crystals that worked perfectly for my bath. The Coarse crystals work best for warm baths and dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li> Himalayan Salt holds Negative Ions,which is amazing for your body, and removes toxins when put in a bath with warm water.</li>
            <li> This salt is nice, dissolves well and is a good carrier for the essential oils I put in with it to add to the bath!</li>
            <li> Great quality and quick delivery. Well continue to order!</li>
            <li> Lovely pink crystals. Beautiful addition to the bathroom d&amp;eacute;cor. They look lovely displayed in a glass container on the countertop and remind me that I can pamper myself today. I also crushed some up a little smaller and added some aloe, Vitamin E and lavender oils for a cleansing face scrub.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly. They dissolve nicely in the tub. They are very pretty, displayed in a glass jar. I&#x27;m ready to order more! Thanks! :D</li>
            <li> Since I ordered this, I gave out samples to my friends and family.  They have all asked me to order some for them too.  They say it takes all the toxins in their body.  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. It is a great quality product at a great price. I also like the other samples I received from this company. I will definitely order this product again as needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these crystals they work wonders in wraps for scrubs or in the bath and they have such a lovely color to them!</li>
            <li> While very pretty and nicely packaged, these salts are large and take a long time to dissolve in even very hot water. If you have the patience to stir and stir and monitor your bath water, then you will be rewarded with super-soft water in which to soak. If you already have soft water, this will make it softer because, after all, it is salt and therefore increases the saline content. If your in-house water softener is already turned to high, why bother adding more, esp. if you do a cost/benefit analysis?</li>
            <li> This product was bought on special and was much cheaper than I would normally had to pay for it, only have used it in a gift foot soak so far.</li>
            <li> Ordered these bath salts to add to my own bath salt mix with epsom salts and scented oils as a bridal shower favor. Shipped quick and were perfect for what I needed! Recommend and will order again-great price for the amount of salts you receive.</li>
            <li> Good results when soaking for my psoriasis.  Skin feels and looks better!  Will continue to use for my skin on a daily basis</li>
            <li> My daughter used these to make party favors at her spa party. They absorbed the essential oils well and made a great bath soak.</li>
            <li> It makes my bath feel so nice and before they dissolve you can use them for callous removal, which is great.</li>
            <li> Is just too coarse to for my bathwater to be absorbed.  It let lots of residue in the tube.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am used to Epsom salts that dissolve well. Perhaps Himalayan salts aren&#x27;t meant to dissolve. These arrived exactly as ordered. They don&#x27;t dissolve well at all even in quite hot water. I am not sure how therapeutic they are?</li>
            <li> OK - when I opened this product I was a little surprised it was not larger - but, salt is heavy apparently. So, a kilo is not quite as much volume as you may expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the price is great. And, the salt looks and feels nice. Its a gently pink coloring, and dissolves nicely in bath water. Additionally, it looks nice if you display it in a bowl beside the tub. Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This salt is great for the bath. She is salty as the ocean. I soak my aching in the legs after nwypadku and the salt reduces my pain. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the salts!! really relieves the pains in the joints!! Would order again!!  Next time it will get to the right address</li>
            <li> Great product. Himalayan salt is great for my bath.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in an ancient ocean, rich in healing minerals.</li>
            <li> You can not beat this price, even after the shipping cost...per pound it was cheaper. I like the bigger grains. It worked great in my bath along with my essential oils and herbs. Love the product!</li>
            <li> I really like pink Himalayan sea salt baths! They make for the best salt bath I have experienced. I would like to add lavender next time though to add an aromatherapy feel to it too</li>
            <li> I have been converted to this salt.  I buy the granulated salt to cook with, I buy the large salt rocks to make sole water with and to use as a salt rock deodorant and I buy these bath crystals for my baths and my daughter&#x27;s baths.  The salt is always dissolved fairly quickly and the tub is easy to clean. In fact the salt helps keep the tub clean because salt is a natural disinfectant.  Our skin is soft from bathing in this salt but more than that our hair is so much stronger.  My bi-racial daughter had (before her salt baths) a whole lot of dry hair that tangled easily.  Since she started taking long salt baths with these crystals her hair is much stronger and doesn&#x27;t tangle very easily anymore.  We are very pleased with these crystals and all of The Spice Labs Himalayan Salts.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I only buy from The Spice Lab because Amazon charges too much for shipping for this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this,  then as directed I put it in the tub and ran alot of hot water on it, it just laid there never dissolving.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited for these to arrive. The water from my tub is piping hot, yet I have a hard time melting the salt! The remainder leaves my tub dirty. Since then, I&#x27;ve been using my other bath salts instead.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality Himalayan salt only.  No additives, so it is food grade and edible.  The crystals are a perfect size to use in a small salt grinder.  So use it for the bath, on your food or even mix some with a lotion for an exfoliating scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE The Spice Lab products! I recommend them highly and their customer service is fantastic! Will be purchasing again from them.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the fast shipping and excellent product. I have used this Himalayan pink salt for several bath salts.</li>
            <li> Husband gets a lot of relief from his Psoriasis by mixing this with ionized water and spraying it all over his skin after a shower. Powerful healing in a salt bath/spray.</li>
            <li> Kept this in my tea warmer for it&#x27;s looks and benefits. I love it.!</li>
            <li> So I got some for my bath and tried it out last weekend.  I found that they did not disolve very quickly which made it rather uncomfortable when I got in (meaning a pain in the rear literally!).  After the bath, there was still salt crystals in the tub. The pink caused some rings to be left in the tub the next day and they accumulated around the drain.  I thought my drain was rusting!  All in all I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find bath salts and the store I frequent only had some weird green ones that usually disappear as soon as you drop them in so I figured I&#x27;d give these a try.  They seem ok (I like the larger ones as for some reason I like feeling the texture of them in the bath) but the shipping was way too high (due to the weight) so over all I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it and sadly won&#x27;t be able to buy more.</li>
            <li> It is relaxing and gives the water a nice, comfortable feeling. The salt is very coarse so it needs to be in a hot bath for a while to dissolve first. Will definitely order it again. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOR MY SALT BAR</li>
            <li> bought these to make my own foot soak .. haven&#x27;t done it yet .. need to add to the todo list...</li>
            <li> Great for relaxing baths.</li>
            <li> I bought these for bath salts - added a little lavender essential oil and they smell heavenly, but they are also food grade so you can use them to salt your food.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s a beautiful addition to my bath salt mixture and will definitely keep using and buying it</li>
            <li> fantastic, completely edible, and a great price!</li>
            <li> use it both for cooking and for baths - it&#x27;s great for both uses</li>
            <li> Very nice salt for bath . Relaxing and nice smel to it .</li>
            <li> I want to like this product, but it makes the water muddy and my tub dirty.  That just feels off and undesirable when bathing.  In fairness, that just may be how these salts work.  But you take a bath to get clean, so dirty water isn&#x27;t reassuring.  Also, they do not dissolve well at all.  So while I won&#x27;t return them, I won&#x27;t buy them again either.</li>
            <li> I love taking a bath in these salts my skin is so much better now clearer and softer it seems to have purifying properties.</li>
