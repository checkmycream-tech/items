            <li>I am happy to have found this product at a great price and offer my honest opinion about regarding this product.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, there was no oily effect or shine.  </li>
            <li>This one has a not so pleasant smell, like a medicinal smell</li>
            <li>they work fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>but it was a fairly good size rash.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy I got this product for discounted price in return for honest review.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll never find anything as good as this at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fairly gooey.</li>
            <li>I never took off my make-up at night, but always washed my face every morning with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>We have found that the light therapy and a drying agent is the best bet.</li>
            <li>Seems to work - smells good and isn&#x27;t greasy  </li>
            <li>My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone.</li>
            <li>Saw this here at Amazon and with its good reviews, ordered one.</li>
            <li>I was more then happy to try this product when it was offered to e during a promotion for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>I love the process Create has for improving it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased!</li>
            <li>in my opinion, the best for acne prone skin as it is antibacterial and no weird additives)</li>
            <li>He also works in an industrial setting with a lot of heat, smoke, and dirt...which seemed to irritate his skin even more!  </li>
            <li>I love this oil!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>this is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I use it under my moisturizer and makeup in the mornings and on its own at night.</li>
            <li>Besides this product I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Pure-Castille Soap and Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li>I was about to make a dermatology appointment but held off after one day of using this because it is so effective.</li>
            <li>So, my focus has been on finding affordable, effective, non-irritating products without the pore-clogging ingredients....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negative: It took me 2 weeks to see good results, and it was initially more drying than moisturizing, but it seems my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li>received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice to me, and goes on no problem.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that this product will work for everyone, but I am thrilled that I am not getting acne anymore.</li>
            <li>The difference has been spectacular.  </li>
            <li>This product is really nice if you have combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I liked the ingredients and the reviews were good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li>I had a really nice tea tree oil product that I was using and it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>The added moisturization is also nice.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil/BP combo is very effective, and the texture of the product is ver smooth.</li>
            <li>After looking for a product that had both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide I found this highly rated product and ordered it hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin has been very calm, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, seems to work well (been using it for almost a month), and smells good.</li>
            <li>i used it for 3 days, without telling anybody, most people said that my face looks better!</li>
            <li>Anyways she prescribed me a cream that was not as drying, but more effective.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>There is a warm healthy glow that is acne-free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are myriad options when it comes to acne treatments, not all are equally effective, and many have unwanted side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and also WAY more effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more effective than proactive and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by the many good reviews on this.</li>
            <li>Definitely effective, my face is better, I look better, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope this will be a good match for me along with drinking more water and having a almost clean diet.</li>
            <li>If Amazon finds a way to consistently distribute this product I would gladly change my response and say more great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s very light weight, quick-drying, and non-greasy, but any of your favorite moisturizers will do.</li>
            <li>It is great to have this option - something that is effective, and not harsh on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect formula!</li>
            <li>It is the second bottle I am purchasing, great product!</li>
            <li>It does work :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li>It even managed to bleach the top of my comforter if it happens to lay against my face at night.</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and smooth after applying.</li>
            <li>In fact, this worked better for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try this again after my pregnancy, but more or so just to finish using it up.</li>
            <li>Atm, I am 100% satisfied w/ the charcoal bar soap, so I might not order this again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>As soon as you feel a break out this stuff by Create Cosmetics works like magic and stops acne from developing.</li>
            <li>I had acne along my jawline most</li>
            <li>I use this product all over my face day and night and it has been working like magic.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stopped taking birth control after many years, so I believe this was the cause.</li>
            <li>My acne became much better.</li>
            <li>as many know</li>
            <li>(I am sure you can relate if you are looking at this product).</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the counter product purchased at my grocery store, but none seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the moisturizer dries, I then apply the Create Cosmetic mixture - again, I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this stuff feels on your face.</li>
            <li>and my complexion looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Among its many uses I discovered was &#x27;treats acne&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I can safely say this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me and I assume it&#x27;s just another aspect of the healthy ingredients that go into it.</li>
            <li>Better than the alternatives...</li>
            <li>That being said, it cured most of my acne overnight.  </li>
            <li>She is able to wear makeup over it and it is not effected.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>the $4.99 acne spot on cream from neutrogena works better.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels on the skin and how it doesn&#x27;t overdry.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that this works better, and doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, so</li>
            <li>I like it better.</li>
            <li>I hope Create Cosmetics add more products.&lt;br /&gt;PS.  </li>
            <li>I love the combo of tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also suggest trying to eat more omega 3 to get rid of your acne.</li>
            <li>It has cleared or started to shrink most of the spots and the inflammation has reduced, where the &amp;#34;visibly clear&amp;#34; wash</li>
            <li>Historically, the best treatment I could find was</li>
            <li>, end result is id still have acne more than i wanted</li>
            <li>These to products work better than anything the dermatologists has prescribed.</li>
            <li>Love the benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil combination.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after reading many reviews on this item but he never worked for me, I wanted to work for me as I saw that it worked for many people</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this WONDERFUL moisturizer to prevent future acne along with a cleanser from Murad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would&#x27;ve cleared up FASTER if I discovered this product sooner.</li>
            <li>but it never got better.  </li>
            <li>This is the first oil based lotion I&#x27;ve tried, I was a bit concerned at first about that, but it seems to work great!</li>
            <li>Some people may love this product.</li>
            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>but im sure</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I can safely say this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li>I hope that I am able to continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>You notice the tea tree oil when you first put it on (which I find pleasant), but that fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>, the smell is fine, it isn&#x27;t greasy and has an easy pump which I liked.  </li>
            <li>not only has her skin cleared up beautifully, it has taken on a really nice healthy-looking glow.  </li>
            <li>Ive experienced none of the drying side effects I normally do with benzoyl peroxide products.</li>
            <li>+ - 4/5 worked good for myself but cost too much!</li>
            <li>At first I loved this item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great product for even the most sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it&#x27;s helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to research and find him the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; and this one has been the absolute best by far!!!  </li>
            <li>This product is the perfect balance for me as my skin is clearing up tremendously and is not dry at all</li>
            <li>This is a great solution for people with acne and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smell - very mild.</li>
            <li>I still great breakouts and this works better than products with larger amounts of medication.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been able to downgrade the foundation coverage from one of those chalky &amp;#34;marathon wear&amp;#34; full coverage foundations to a</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the full results!</li>
            <li>My daughter applied this twice a day after she washed her face, and followed up with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, it feels great going on, and I actually just got the Lactic Acid &amp; Tea Tree Oil as a promo and it is DIVINE.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the results, and I have worked with many different types of treatments for my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>After reading such great reviews on this product, I had to try it</li>
            <li>, I can finally say that I&#x27;m happy with my skin.</li>
            <li>I started light and gradually increased the dosage.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a residue feeling and is light.</li>
            <li>For now I would avoid this product and pick one that is actually available.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If I needed a BPO lotion again I would get this over a sticky water based one with parabens, otherwise I&#x27;m going to try a preservative free moisturizer instead.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Christ, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ll never be free of acne.</li>
            <li>) use moisturizer on your face once or twice a day (seems important now/</li>
            <li>&amp; my forehead has remained acne free.</li>
            <li>but im just so happy that this is possible!!</li>
            <li>It is great for the overall anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, this product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This lotion must have a perfect blended combination of ingredients which hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin at all</li>
            <li>Once you love this product as much as i do, do me a favor and ask create cosmetics to make more cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>above - not as effective as id have liked</li>
            <li>OK so I had a couple of spots right around the corners of my mouth that have broke out.  </li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this one in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I have some significant combination skin that I have been fighting with since a teenager.</li>
            <li>I paid full price for this item, don&#x27;t know how others get it free or discounted, but</li>
            <li>Please this is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because it has tea tree oil and Benzoyl Peroxide, two ingredients to help acne.</li>
            <li>As with most products, when I first started using it</li>
            <li>the first purchase makes it a better deal.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes the skin better than other benzoyl peroxide containing treatments I&#x27;ve tried and seems more effective.</li>
            <li>My make up works well over it and it feels clean.</li>
            <li>It certainly seems potent against acne.</li>
            <li>This blend is great for sensitive skin and any skin type as it has jojoba for one of the main carrier oils.</li>
            <li>This is an all-in-one product that I have really been enjoying.</li>
            <li>am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>though flare-ups have occurred, they didn&#x27;t turn into full blown cysts/</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good 5 years since the last time that happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Most efficient acne cream I have tried, spots dries out fast and the cream does not discolor my clothes.</li>
            <li>The little bottle lasts a surprising amount of time too!</li>
            <li>While it smells nice and looks like it reduces some swelling on certain areas, if used too much it dries out my skin and</li>
            <li>dries my skin out a little bit, so I make sure to put on a good moisturizing SPF after.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal diligent fan.</li>
            <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me, this is the best skin product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get rid of my mild acne for weeks now.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different treatments but most are not go for my combo skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours.</li>
            <li>As I said, we both have mild acne , and this has been working for us.</li>
            <li>My acne is mild when I have it at all, but the sides of my nose do get blackheads and acne.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne solutions and am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and dries out very easily.</li>
            <li>I finally came across this and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>But as has already been said, this cream wasn&#x27;t the sole reason for my happiness and clean skin, it was a combination of many other factors, but most of all, its diligence in treating your face morning, afternoon, and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do believe this is a great product and feel I am breaking out less with using it.</li>
            <li>It lasts about a month and a half to two months and the price is great.</li>
            <li>when reading another review it stated to wash your face first (makes sense!).</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but I used with a little Aveeno face cream.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed this product... looking for something which was not drying, just right for adult break-outs!</li>
            <li>I apply only at night, and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot, a LOT of acne products with varying levels of success.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts me about 9 months using it every day (and still effective up to the last pump).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so I started breaking out when I was 23 years old.</li>
            <li>but I have found that it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am grateful for this product, and the upside is that it&#x27;s natural and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>, definitley worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always looking for more natural products for my face.</li>
            <li>I already knew benzoyl peroxide was an acne weapon, I thought the combination was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>More natural than products like Pro-Active, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>While the 15 helps, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate irritation from sun exposure, so she&#x27;s going to try an SPF 30 to see if that works better.  </li>
            <li>I have had acne for years and am now in my 30&#x27;s and thus has a moisturizing effect while using powerful anti acne ingredients.  </li>
            <li>(i rarely even get that anymore after using these steps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been a proactive user for over 10 years and trying to convert to a more natural product.</li>
            <li>I found this to be much gentler on her fair skin while still taking care of the problem...it actually cleared up one of her blemishes overnight!</li>
            <li>blend from Create Cosmetics gets everything right.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that gives me the right balance.  </li>
            <li>I found this product and thought that with the moisturizers, it may just have the right balance for me.  </li>
            <li>If you apply this to your face at the first signs of an acne flareup it honestly &#x27;takes the red out&#x27;, cools the infection, and helps to lessen the infection overnight.  </li>
            <li>I would say that my skin is smooth (I also use a retinol at night) and normal moisture.  </li>
            <li>I also got off all cleaners and as instructed started treating my skin more gently, apparently that&#x27;s supposed to reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li>out the product is a rich cream that is very oily at first.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic in a little bottle. : )</li>
            <li>after it helped to get rid of all the acne, i now maintain with pure organic tea tree oil instead !</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a bit strong for people who are sensitive, as I</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick refund.</li>
            <li>Unlike my generic, the cream has a very nice, but not strong or overwhelming smell (because of the tea tree oil, I presume).</li>
            <li>so I found a very gentle organic soap and a face cleansing  sponge.</li>
            <li>Fights blemishes, and very gently</li>
            <li>He would often use a strong product for acne which would be majorly over drying!</li>
            <li>Also, not listed are two new ingredients that were not in the original formula: Polysorbate 60 and Xanthan Gum.      </li>
            <li>and he is always willing to refund or have you try something else instead.</li>
            <li>I was pretty disapointed.</li>
            <li>however, i would prefer a higher benzoyl peroxide percentage.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for about a month and saw no improvement.</li>
            <li>Create Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment is a product I have come to use and consistently rely on.</li>
            <li>love seeing the results delivered by this product, will definitely buy again if needed-</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use and order more.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my skin so much!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>so I am always willing to try anything to help him reduce it.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>, i will order again, thanks!</li>
            <li>I notice his skin clearing up within the first week.</li>
            <li>Which is really saying something!  </li>
            <li>It worked for my teenager son like a wonder, it cleared out most of the pimples he had on his forehead, definitely recommended</li>
            <li>One star because they can&#x27;t offer a consistent supply.  </li>
            <li>Purchased my first bottle a year ago.  </li>
            <li>Acne treatment is dependent on consistent use.  </li>
            <li>-16- After several additional years of using this product I have been able to get it consistently, and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works for lots of acne; but I have one acne sometimes, and this product helps to get rid of it pretty soon.</li>
            <li>so at first it seems to not be doing anything</li>
            <li>This product is the first one that showed immediate effect.</li>
            <li>First thing...</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s only 0.5% more BP than I&#x27;m already using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the only BP I have EVER been able to wear under foundation makeup</li>
            <li>She started as instructed, and moved to twice-a-day use over the first week.  </li>
            <li>It seems like the oil makes the cream more efficient than traditional acne treatments.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that it seemed to help some of my acne scars heal faster, if only it hadn&#x27;t created more.</li>
            <li>and it was really hot and itchy.  </li>
            <li>This is the first benzoyl peroxide product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>After the first 3 weeks there was noticeable improvement on some of the deeper acne.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty damn close.  </li>
            <li>Meaning, this stuff really works at keeping combination oily and dry skin in a relatively clear state (and I do say relatively because no one has perfect skin, ever).  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many over-the-counter treatments with limited success.</li>
            <li>I want to again emphasize though, that this cream really got it right</li>
            <li>He responded quickly and sent a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;for spot treatment I would use clean and clear products.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more hydrated too thanks to the different ingredients it has.</li>
            <li>On my 2nd bottle has made such a good improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Positive</li>
            <li>The cream is thicker and soaks into the skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it in conjunction with bar soap, first stripping my skin from oils then applying the oil-based lotion, and that works great at eliminating acne and actually makes my skin less oily.</li>
            <li>There are too many affordable high quality skin care products on the market today such as this one to settle for products that still contain those known to be harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>, he was very excited, I will continue to use this product as long as I see these type of results.</li>
            <li>I hope this moisturizer is available consistently because the last time I checked, it wasn&#x27;t here</li>
            <li>I appreciate the short list of recognizable ingredients and that it is free of harmful fragrances, sulfates, parabens, phthalates.</li>
            <li>But i am certain that my milk and egg consumption had a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I needed to be more patient and consistent to see results, but since then I&#x27;ve moved on to other products.</li>
            <li>I found this product to really help control my breakouts and acne</li>
            <li>Severe - 4/5 Cheap 15$ and works decently (last around 2-3 months&lt;</li>
            <li>Her skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>Has really helped my skin and not drying at all.</li>
            <li>This is been my absolute saving grace.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my acne cure up.</li>
            <li>They package very conscientiously and don&#x27;t try to oversell or over-hype their products.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to try this product because although benzoyl peroxide works for me it is usually very drying and causes a lot of itching,  redness and burning.</li>
            <li>This product has a very lotion-y texture and I can wear it under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It has a very lite scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this product over-dries your skin and is quite gentle.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>I am close to 30 and have had very oily skin since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Works absolutely wonders for me.</li>
            <li>It really opens the pores up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this product doesn&#x27;t work, but I can&#x27;t really vouch for</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li>It works, fast.</li>
            <li>The combo of an oil based benzoyl peroxide + tea tree oil is a bit unusual, but seems to work a treat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at the difference in those spots.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect -- was it a serum?</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sensitivity to the ingredients in this products, then it is probably worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is very non-drying and gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to spend much on cosmetics</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pleasing experience as soon as you apply and the smell fades away soon.</li>
            <li>We are stationed in Japan and the shipping was fast...</li>
            <li>Also the odor dissipates really</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to my acne.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have much effect.</li>
            <li>We much prefer natural remedies, whenever possible and appropriate, and I decided to try this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now, and his skin is so much clearer now.  </li>
            <li>Didnt really prevent or heal acne very well.</li>
            <li>and I really think it is working.  </li>
            <li>I am very optimistic this is a real solution.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it clears up MUCH faster</li>
            <li>and it really calmed the itching and lessened the severity of the rash.  </li>
            <li>I did so much research and felt like I became an EXPERT at acne.</li>
            <li>Changing my diet didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>So bummed I really, really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>We were really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li>and I also really like using that with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product really works...</li>
            <li>It is important to not use too much of this product at first because this acne treatment can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>At first this did dry me out where I used it (which surprised me, I have tried so many hardcore products) -- but now that my skin has gotten used to it, this is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li>Go natural though, Apple cider vinegar!!!</li>
            <li>All the essential oils for healthy skin with the right formulation such that it is light-weight, ultra absorbent, non-drying, and smells absolutely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After adding this to my daily regimen, I&#x27;ve been acne clean for a month, which has not happened in about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, there&#x27;re other products that work too, but this one has more bang</li>
            <li>So often you hear about tea tree oil being good for acne treatment and prevention, yet some people try to apply it topically without diluting it which is too extreme for skincare.</li>
            <li>First you should know that my acne is not very serious, just a couple of them on my face.</li>
            <li>Better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Definitely much better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried-</li>
            <li>Also i like the smell of it better than other stuff.</li>
            <li>but the product has not been overly harsh--a problem he has had with many other products (proactiv to name one).  </li>
            <li>I really like this product since it is effective without being over harsh!</li>
            <li>and it really took care of the acne, highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The cream has a really nice texture and absorbs into the skin quickly without feeling greasy, and due to the low benzoyl peroxide content also doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel super dry.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this is the first product that has kept my face almost clear without the heaviness, dryness and greasiness that you experience.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure it was working effectively to prevent acne for me.</li>
            <li>this is the ONLY BP I&#x27;ve ever been able to use twice a day nearly every day of the week along with BHA (salicylic acid) to improve/fade old scars</li>
            <li>the results have been AMAZING!!!One side of my face looks brand new!</li>
            <li>the beginning my goal was to be able to wear less make up</li>
            <li>kit I am trying out is called Exposed, hopefully this is decent.</li>
            <li>I stated with acne when I was older and was put on birth control.</li>
            <li>As a face owner with occasional breakouts, I often look to the assistance of over the counter acne medications for a quick clear-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had mostly gotten my acne under control by a combination of avoiding all dairy and all peanuts/PB, along with BP 2.5% and BHA over the last several</li>
            <li>Sure some different things will work for different people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>proactive: expensive, worked great, too much of a pain to do all 3 steps with all the bottles every night with cotton balls and everything</li>
            <li>Then I spent over $600 at Sephora changing my make up and skin care to more natural mineral based ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Although it has kept some of that at bay, there hasn&#x27;t been any more improvement since the third week (been using it for a total of 6 weeks now) and I will try something else.</li>
            <li>We will definitely purchase more as she goes through her teen years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it based on our experience.</li>
            <li>Conjunction with some other stuff to help with my adult acne and my skin looks sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I decided to give Create Cosmetics BPT3.1 a try, because though it has 3% benzoyl peroxide (a much lower concentration than that of the cream I had been using previously), it has had a profound effect on my skin as a preventive treatment, in contrast to the ineffective spot-treatments I was performing with the generic 10%.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out frequently, but when I undergo periods of particularly high stress, I do break out, and my acne can be very stubborn.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin unexpectedly super soft!</li>
            <li>product works very well to clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li>It has completely cleared up my breakouts and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as to how fast it cleared up my face, but now its all i use to mosturize my face.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with clean and dry</li>
            <li>Has really helped clear up acne, even cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I think this may be a great product, unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find tea tree oil and BP together and even rarer in a formula that actually moisturizes your skin (and be non comedogenic).</li>
            <li>I also switched my gentle cleanser to a charcoal soap bar which reduced my small bumps and cleared my acne up better.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t over-endorse anything</li>
            <li>It might not be as harsh as most though</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how this would work on severe acne, but for his moderate acne, it&#x27;s a resounding success.</li>
            <li>This week I can feel the sore spots where the cysts would normally form</li>
            <li>but none have come close to becoming bumps big enough to bother me and are gone within a day or 2.</li>
            <li>No dangerous ingredients and the cream actually works!</li>
            <li>I had prior tried tea tree oil diluted in jojoba oil without success.  </li>
            <li>Possibilities could be: in frequent exercise as much as I did before, hormone changes, new job position stress, or age.</li>
            <li>I have been using various acne treatment products for over a year to get rid of mild adult acne issues.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s more natural and less chemically.  </li>
            <li>This works and is affordable, is one super easy step, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes/sheets, doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li>I had to right a brief review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was just looking for a spot treatment and acne prevention/reducing treatment because I just wanted to reduce the formation of new acne.</li>
            <li>The new bottle is 2oz instead of the 2.2oz that it shows on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The new one works.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination, hyper-pigmentation skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting my face, though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Some had too many steps, and usually 1 step would run out before the others.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever left a review for any product...</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product it caused my face to become itchy, red, and swollen.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this for preventing acne in places where it reoccurs frequently... and it works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure oil-based lotions are better for everyone, but it worked well for me.</li>
            <li>watchout because if you apply this and you go to workout and your body gets hot and sweats, it will bleach your clothes but only on the surface it touches not all the way through.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found that the teenage acne products are too harsh for my skin now and that I really have more t-zone and combination skin problems.  </li>
            <li>My acne got harder to control now at 27 and pregnant.</li>
            <li>With this product assisting with flareups I was able to keep it under control and have had decent skin since starting a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>(i use one that has the course rough particles, pretty much buy whats on sale)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love tea tree, but I&#x27;ve tried pure tea tree oil in the past and it only soothed my acne, but never healed it.   </li>
            <li>Have had limited success over the years; prescription creams or combinations of store bought products, but never anything that continued to work or was affordable over time.  </li>
            <li>My acne is only mild, but has surprisingly recently flared up.</li>
            <li>While she only has mild to moderate acne, with this product</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream daily for a week for mild acne on my chest and back.</li>
            <li>and it seems to have just made my overall skin so much smoother and clear!</li>
            <li>Which with the big companies you certainly cannot do.</li>
            <li>I starting reducing certain chemical items in my skin care and adding others.  </li>
            <li>It is a light cream and it goes on a little greasy for me.</li>
            <li>The tiny little bumps on my skin are gone and my face looks much more even.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several weeks and it had done a good job of drying up my acne even the tough one.</li>
            <li>Look, anyone who tells you that their face is clear after a day is well, lying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a price I don&#x27;t mind paying if my skin is going to stay clear.</li>
            <li>I also use Elta-MD UV Clear SPF 45 and La-Roch Posay Toleriane Lotion.  </li>
            <li>After just a couple weeks my skin is still clear and softer.  </li>
            <li>but I know that happens sometimes as your pores clear</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t clear the blackheads</li>
            <li>Now his face is clear again.</li>
            <li>I am human but let me tell you not as much as I used to</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The blackheads are almost completely gone and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any redness or irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a product review for people who are specifically sensitive to benzoyl peroxide and still get acne.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, here&#x27;s how you can use it.</li>
            <li>I read about Tea Tree Oil and found this which is a mixture you can apply directly with out mixing with anything else .</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until about a year ago that I started breaking out on my cheeks frequently.</li>
            <li>I found this acne lotion on a whim while browsing natural products on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin near my nose- leading to unsightly blackheads-</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not experience any skin irritation with this tea tree acne treatment.</li>
            <li>At the age of 24 I started getting adult acne around my chin and lips.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne for 10years.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of natural helping ingredients used that are non-irritating on the face.  </li>
            <li>but I feel I need to share my regimen for the sake of others who may be struggling with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Together with the spironolactone, this product has completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again and recommend it to anyone who has adult acne.</li>
            <li>30 years old and still dealing with acne is not fun...have tried everything and in every combination since being a teenager.  </li>
            <li>My skin is to sensitive to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is Scandinavian and quite sensitive, but I seem to tolerate this cream well.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency, and it actually does seem to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Again, the oil-based formulation seems counterintuitive, but leaves my face soft and</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I would recommend this to any of my clients.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect such an oily cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not bother my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I had to do something about my adult acne.  </li>
            <li>its effect is temporary but at least it works better than this nonsense</li>
            <li>But adding BHA or AHA just fried my skin because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has not dried my skin like Clearasil did</li>
            <li>cleared up my acne completely</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide or Tea Tree Oil it might not be for you.  </li>
            <li>It rubs into the skin completely, leaving no shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff definitely helps me not break out as much.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a problem with adult acne and some hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li>Day time: An oil-free natural sunscreen that is also used as a primer.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3 months for my acne to clear up completely.</li>
            <li>Ordered it for my husband who has been struggling with adult acne for years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I saw results really after a month of almost daily application.</li>
            <li>I like it that this is not messy to apply.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>some were to harsh on my skin and caused more problems (red and irritated).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle only because I use this as the treatment portion of an overall skin routine that includes healthier eating habits (e.g., more water, less sugar), regular exercise, and consistent sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gritty like other benzoyl peroxide products and I think this helps it work more deeply into the pores.</li>
            <li>I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>I have used it all, murad, proactive, oxyclean,skinceuticals, Mary Kay, clickr, bliss, origins, clean and clear, beauty society just to name a few.</li>
            <li>The tube attaching to the pump is missing on the original bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how they developed a product that actually clears up acne while working more like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different acne prevention techniques: first is what works great for me now that i would recommend, then ill list the other stuff that hasnt worked:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I was actually using both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide as two separate topical treatments, so was interested to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Create Cosmetics TTO 3% BP has given me a decent complexion back and almost (but not quite) the courage to wear no foundation.</li>
            <li>If you have ever smelled 100% pure Tea Tree Oil, this is so minor compared to that</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering this product again and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(if anyone from the company is reading, please go back to the old caps with the new pumps).</li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li>This product caught my attention because of the ingredients it contains I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and oily skin so finding one that won&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and actually moisturizes is a huge hassle.</li>
            <li>- When I received it, I had a pretty significant breakout that would not clear, including one cystic blemish and several other smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 days of using it you could see a noticeable difference--no new breakouts and reduced redness and inflammation of the breakout he had currently been experiencing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, yet really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Even tried prescription ones i got from a friend but didnt really do much and would totally dry my face out</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>My skin calmed right down and my acne blemishes noticeably reduced within a week&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li>it will get inflamed right after you scrub but it will go down within an hour.</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin....and is now starting have &#x27;break-outs&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I had major acne that kept spreading day after day on my chin/jawline.</li>
            <li>I do not use it twice a day as the bottle directs and have not noticed any major drying of the skin.</li>
            <li>I decided it was time for a major upgrade to my up until then, lacking skin carely routine.</li>
            <li>it only took about 2.5 months until it completely disappeared!</li>
            <li>Since those first few weeks, using this product and my new skin care routine, I have had only ONE pimple (that was so small, it barely could be called a pimple, more a red bump).</li>
            <li>For example, better to be using a non-irritating wash, washing for only a few seconds, and let skin dry.</li>
            <li>I get dry and itchy skin even when I use their new sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>Product is a little bit costly, but def worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for 2 weeks and her skin is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>After two applications (once daily before bedtime) the area was clear and redness in my skin was visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been almost completely clear since starting using this 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>I am an adult woman who has tried literally everything for my acne including Accutane, oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, Proactiv and any number of over the counter products.</li>
            <li>I also would like the products because to me it is not overly drying, as I am an mature female still dealing with flare ups</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone fighting adult acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li>My 14 yr old daughter and I both use this daily.  </li>
            <li>I get adult acne only on my chin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and my skin is finally clearing up!</li>
            <li>I got this product back in early January 2014</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d rather buy stuff through Amazon than deal with individual companies direct and re-enter my credit card.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it for probably 3-4 weeks now, with barely a lone pimple here and there.  </li>
            <li>I only use this product in my T-zone as that is the only place I normally get pimples.</li>
            <li>I only use it sparingly, and wash twice a day with a very mild soap-free cleanser or just water, pat dry, moisturize all over with a few dabs of hemp oil, and then apply this product to &amp;#34;trouble areas.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>the other side is improving and healing more everyday!</li>
            <li>I get small ones, but using the Create they go away really quickly.</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed it was such a small bottle, but given how nicely it spreads, you really don&#x27;t need that much for each use.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin only use diluted tea tree oil only.  </li>
            <li>a 29 year old female and have moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>and  it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>Since I have scars from the major perimenopausal breakouts of the last year, I still wear foundation.</li>
            <li>Along with that came unpredictable hormonal surges causing hot flashes and new multi-cyst adult acne breakouts that my previous Acne DOT org regimen no longer controlled.</li>
            <li>If it clears my complexion even more I might order again, but I honestly hate relying on BP because I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin gets use to it and constantly relies on it, but it never seems to fully stop acne from reoccurring and tends to get less effective with time.</li>
            <li>I did have some minor break-outs in the first couple weeks, but I kept on using it, like some other reviews have said.</li>
            <li>Works well as long as you catch the zits early.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first, because the cream was not coming out of the pump, but it turns out there was just air in the straw, so after priming the pump (squirting air a few times), the BPT 3.1 cream started to come</li>
            <li>If skin isn&#x27;t dry then it burns because the product penetrates more deeply with wet skin (I personally don&#x27;t mind a little burning).</li>
            <li>I was breaking out a little more than usual</li>
            <li>Previously I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>it is powerful and you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I only use this at night and have found that my skin is very soft in the morning with a few new tiny pimples each day.</li>
            <li>This cream I had been using, which smells really... unsettling... would typically take weeks to work (and I suspect my acne just went away on its own, as my stress levels receded), and left my skin looking and feeling oily in the short-term, and dry in the long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Twice a day was a little too much for my skin because it started drying it out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am happy to have found this product at a great price and offer my honest opinion about regarding this product.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, there was no oily effect or shine.  </li>
            <li> This one has a not so pleasant smell, like a medicinal smell</li>
            <li> they work fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> but it was a fairly good size rash.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so happy I got this product for discounted price in return for honest review.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll never find anything as good as this at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fairly gooey.</li>
            <li> I never took off my make-up at night, but always washed my face every morning with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> We have found that the light therapy and a drying agent is the best bet.</li>
            <li> Seems to work - smells good and isn&#x27;t greasy  </li>
            <li> My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Saw this here at Amazon and with its good reviews, ordered one.</li>
            <li> I was more then happy to try this product when it was offered to e during a promotion for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I love the process Create has for improving it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> in my opinion, the best for acne prone skin as it is antibacterial and no weird additives)</li>
            <li> He also works in an industrial setting with a lot of heat, smoke, and dirt...which seemed to irritate his skin even more!  </li>
            <li> I love this oil!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> this is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I use it under my moisturizer and makeup in the mornings and on its own at night.</li>
            <li> Besides this product I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Pure-Castille Soap and Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li> I was about to make a dermatology appointment but held off after one day of using this because it is so effective.</li>
            <li> So, my focus has been on finding affordable, effective, non-irritating products without the pore-clogging ingredients....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative: It took me 2 weeks to see good results, and it was initially more drying than moisturizing, but it seems my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li> received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice to me, and goes on no problem.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that this product will work for everyone, but I am thrilled that I am not getting acne anymore.</li>
            <li> The difference has been spectacular.  </li>
            <li> This product is really nice if you have combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the ingredients and the reviews were good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li> I had a really nice tea tree oil product that I was using and it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> The added moisturization is also nice.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil/BP combo is very effective, and the texture of the product is ver smooth.</li>
            <li> After looking for a product that had both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide I found this highly rated product and ordered it hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin has been very calm, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, seems to work well (been using it for almost a month), and smells good.</li>
            <li> i used it for 3 days, without telling anybody, most people said that my face looks better!</li>
            <li> Anyways she prescribed me a cream that was not as drying, but more effective.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> There is a warm healthy glow that is acne-free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While there are myriad options when it comes to acne treatments, not all are equally effective, and many have unwanted side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and also WAY more effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more effective than proactive and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by the many good reviews on this.</li>
            <li> Definitely effective, my face is better, I look better, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this will be a good match for me along with drinking more water and having a almost clean diet.</li>
            <li> If Amazon finds a way to consistently distribute this product I would gladly change my response and say more great things about this product.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s very light weight, quick-drying, and non-greasy, but any of your favorite moisturizers will do.</li>
            <li> It is great to have this option - something that is effective, and not harsh on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect formula!</li>
            <li> It is the second bottle I am purchasing, great product!</li>
            <li> It does work :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li> It even managed to bleach the top of my comforter if it happens to lay against my face at night.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and smooth after applying.</li>
            <li> In fact, this worked better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this again after my pregnancy, but more or so just to finish using it up.</li>
            <li> Atm, I am 100% satisfied w/ the charcoal bar soap, so I might not order this again.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> As soon as you feel a break out this stuff by Create Cosmetics works like magic and stops acne from developing.</li>
            <li> I had acne along my jawline most</li>
            <li> I use this product all over my face day and night and it has been working like magic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped taking birth control after many years, so I believe this was the cause.</li>
            <li> My acne became much better.</li>
            <li> as many know</li>
            <li> (I am sure you can relate if you are looking at this product).</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the counter product purchased at my grocery store, but none seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li> and I am extremely pleased</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the moisturizer dries, I then apply the Create Cosmetic mixture - again, I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this stuff feels on your face.</li>
            <li> and my complexion looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Among its many uses I discovered was &#x27;treats acne&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I can safely say this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me and I assume it&#x27;s just another aspect of the healthy ingredients that go into it.</li>
            <li> Better than the alternatives...</li>
            <li> That being said, it cured most of my acne overnight.  </li>
            <li> She is able to wear makeup over it and it is not effected.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> the $4.99 acne spot on cream from neutrogena works better.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on the skin and how it doesn&#x27;t overdry.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that this works better, and doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, so</li>
            <li> I like it better.</li>
            <li> I hope Create Cosmetics add more products.&lt;br /&gt;PS.  </li>
            <li> I love the combo of tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also suggest trying to eat more omega 3 to get rid of your acne.</li>
            <li> It has cleared or started to shrink most of the spots and the inflammation has reduced, where the &amp;#34;visibly clear&amp;#34; wash</li>
            <li> Historically, the best treatment I could find was</li>
            <li> , end result is id still have acne more than i wanted</li>
            <li> These to products work better than anything the dermatologists has prescribed.</li>
            <li> Love the benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil combination.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading many reviews on this item but he never worked for me, I wanted to work for me as I saw that it worked for many people</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this WONDERFUL moisturizer to prevent future acne along with a cleanser from Murad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would&#x27;ve cleared up FASTER if I discovered this product sooner.</li>
            <li> but it never got better.  </li>
            <li> This is the first oil based lotion I&#x27;ve tried, I was a bit concerned at first about that, but it seems to work great!</li>
            <li> Some people may love this product.</li>
            <li> :)))</li>
            <li> but im sure</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I can safely say this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> I hope that I am able to continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> You notice the tea tree oil when you first put it on (which I find pleasant), but that fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> , the smell is fine, it isn&#x27;t greasy and has an easy pump which I liked.  </li>
            <li> not only has her skin cleared up beautifully, it has taken on a really nice healthy-looking glow.  </li>
            <li> Ive experienced none of the drying side effects I normally do with benzoyl peroxide products.</li>
            <li> + - 4/5 worked good for myself but cost too much!</li>
            <li> At first I loved this item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great product for even the most sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it&#x27;s helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to research and find him the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; and this one has been the absolute best by far!!!  </li>
            <li> This product is the perfect balance for me as my skin is clearing up tremendously and is not dry at all</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for people with acne and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smell - very mild.</li>
            <li> I still great breakouts and this works better than products with larger amounts of medication.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been able to downgrade the foundation coverage from one of those chalky &amp;#34;marathon wear&amp;#34; full coverage foundations to a</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the full results!</li>
            <li> My daughter applied this twice a day after she washed her face, and followed up with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , it feels great going on, and I actually just got the Lactic Acid &amp; Tea Tree Oil as a promo and it is DIVINE.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the results, and I have worked with many different types of treatments for my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this product, I had to try it</li>
            <li> , I can finally say that I&#x27;m happy with my skin.</li>
            <li> I started light and gradually increased the dosage.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a residue feeling and is light.</li>
            <li> For now I would avoid this product and pick one that is actually available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> If I needed a BPO lotion again I would get this over a sticky water based one with parabens, otherwise I&#x27;m going to try a preservative free moisturizer instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Christ, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ll never be free of acne.</li>
            <li> ) use moisturizer on your face once or twice a day (seems important now/</li>
            <li> &amp; my forehead has remained acne free.</li>
            <li> but im just so happy that this is possible!!</li>
            <li> It is great for the overall anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, this product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> This lotion must have a perfect blended combination of ingredients which hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin at all</li>
            <li> Once you love this product as much as i do, do me a favor and ask create cosmetics to make more cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> above - not as effective as id have liked</li>
            <li> OK so I had a couple of spots right around the corners of my mouth that have broke out.  </li>
            <li> So I was excited to try this one in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have some significant combination skin that I have been fighting with since a teenager.</li>
            <li> I paid full price for this item, don&#x27;t know how others get it free or discounted, but</li>
            <li> Please this is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because it has tea tree oil and Benzoyl Peroxide, two ingredients to help acne.</li>
            <li> As with most products, when I first started using it</li>
            <li> the first purchase makes it a better deal.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the skin better than other benzoyl peroxide containing treatments I&#x27;ve tried and seems more effective.</li>
            <li> My make up works well over it and it feels clean.</li>
            <li> It certainly seems potent against acne.</li>
            <li> This blend is great for sensitive skin and any skin type as it has jojoba for one of the main carrier oils.</li>
            <li> This is an all-in-one product that I have really been enjoying.</li>
            <li> am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> though flare-ups have occurred, they didn&#x27;t turn into full blown cysts/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good 5 years since the last time that happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Most efficient acne cream I have tried, spots dries out fast and the cream does not discolor my clothes.</li>
            <li> The little bottle lasts a surprising amount of time too!</li>
            <li> While it smells nice and looks like it reduces some swelling on certain areas, if used too much it dries out my skin and</li>
            <li> dries my skin out a little bit, so I make sure to put on a good moisturizing SPF after.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal diligent fan.</li>
            <li> Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me, this is the best skin product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> and it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of my mild acne for weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different treatments but most are not go for my combo skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours.</li>
            <li> As I said, we both have mild acne , and this has been working for us.</li>
            <li> My acne is mild when I have it at all, but the sides of my nose do get blackheads and acne.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne solutions and am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and dries out very easily.</li>
            <li> I finally came across this and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> But as has already been said, this cream wasn&#x27;t the sole reason for my happiness and clean skin, it was a combination of many other factors, but most of all, its diligence in treating your face morning, afternoon, and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do believe this is a great product and feel I am breaking out less with using it.</li>
            <li> It lasts about a month and a half to two months and the price is great.</li>
            <li> when reading another review it stated to wash your face first (makes sense!).</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but I used with a little Aveeno face cream.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed this product... looking for something which was not drying, just right for adult break-outs!</li>
            <li> I apply only at night, and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot, a LOT of acne products with varying levels of success.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts me about 9 months using it every day (and still effective up to the last pump).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay so I started breaking out when I was 23 years old.</li>
            <li> but I have found that it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am grateful for this product, and the upside is that it&#x27;s natural and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> , definitley worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always looking for more natural products for my face.</li>
            <li> I already knew benzoyl peroxide was an acne weapon, I thought the combination was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> More natural than products like Pro-Active, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> While the 15 helps, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate irritation from sun exposure, so she&#x27;s going to try an SPF 30 to see if that works better.  </li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and am now in my 30&#x27;s and thus has a moisturizing effect while using powerful anti acne ingredients.  </li>
            <li> (i rarely even get that anymore after using these steps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a proactive user for over 10 years and trying to convert to a more natural product.</li>
            <li> I found this to be much gentler on her fair skin while still taking care of the problem...it actually cleared up one of her blemishes overnight!</li>
            <li> blend from Create Cosmetics gets everything right.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that gives me the right balance.  </li>
            <li> I found this product and thought that with the moisturizers, it may just have the right balance for me.  </li>
            <li> If you apply this to your face at the first signs of an acne flareup it honestly &#x27;takes the red out&#x27;, cools the infection, and helps to lessen the infection overnight.  </li>
            <li> I would say that my skin is smooth (I also use a retinol at night) and normal moisture.  </li>
            <li> I also got off all cleaners and as instructed started treating my skin more gently, apparently that&#x27;s supposed to reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li> out the product is a rich cream that is very oily at first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a little bottle. : )</li>
            <li> after it helped to get rid of all the acne, i now maintain with pure organic tea tree oil instead !</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bit strong for people who are sensitive, as I</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick refund.</li>
            <li> Unlike my generic, the cream has a very nice, but not strong or overwhelming smell (because of the tea tree oil, I presume).</li>
            <li> so I found a very gentle organic soap and a face cleansing  sponge.</li>
            <li> Fights blemishes, and very gently</li>
            <li> He would often use a strong product for acne which would be majorly over drying!</li>
            <li> Also, not listed are two new ingredients that were not in the original formula: Polysorbate 60 and Xanthan Gum.      </li>
            <li> and he is always willing to refund or have you try something else instead.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disapointed.</li>
            <li> however, i would prefer a higher benzoyl peroxide percentage.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for about a month and saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> Create Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment is a product I have come to use and consistently rely on.</li>
            <li> love seeing the results delivered by this product, will definitely buy again if needed-</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to use and order more.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my skin so much!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> so I am always willing to try anything to help him reduce it.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> , i will order again, thanks!</li>
            <li> I notice his skin clearing up within the first week.</li>
            <li> Which is really saying something!  </li>
            <li> It worked for my teenager son like a wonder, it cleared out most of the pimples he had on his forehead, definitely recommended</li>
            <li> One star because they can&#x27;t offer a consistent supply.  </li>
            <li> Purchased my first bottle a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Acne treatment is dependent on consistent use.  </li>
            <li> -16- After several additional years of using this product I have been able to get it consistently, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for lots of acne; but I have one acne sometimes, and this product helps to get rid of it pretty soon.</li>
            <li> so at first it seems to not be doing anything</li>
            <li> This product is the first one that showed immediate effect.</li>
            <li> First thing...</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s only 0.5% more BP than I&#x27;m already using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the only BP I have EVER been able to wear under foundation makeup</li>
            <li> She started as instructed, and moved to twice-a-day use over the first week.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the oil makes the cream more efficient than traditional acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that it seemed to help some of my acne scars heal faster, if only it hadn&#x27;t created more.</li>
            <li> and it was really hot and itchy.  </li>
            <li> This is the first benzoyl peroxide product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> After the first 3 weeks there was noticeable improvement on some of the deeper acne.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty damn close.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, this stuff really works at keeping combination oily and dry skin in a relatively clear state (and I do say relatively because no one has perfect skin, ever).  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many over-the-counter treatments with limited success.</li>
            <li> I want to again emphasize though, that this cream really got it right</li>
            <li> He responded quickly and sent a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;for spot treatment I would use clean and clear products.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more hydrated too thanks to the different ingredients it has.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle has made such a good improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Positive</li>
            <li> The cream is thicker and soaks into the skin pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it in conjunction with bar soap, first stripping my skin from oils then applying the oil-based lotion, and that works great at eliminating acne and actually makes my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> There are too many affordable high quality skin care products on the market today such as this one to settle for products that still contain those known to be harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> , he was very excited, I will continue to use this product as long as I see these type of results.</li>
            <li> I hope this moisturizer is available consistently because the last time I checked, it wasn&#x27;t here</li>
            <li> I appreciate the short list of recognizable ingredients and that it is free of harmful fragrances, sulfates, parabens, phthalates.</li>
            <li> But i am certain that my milk and egg consumption had a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I needed to be more patient and consistent to see results, but since then I&#x27;ve moved on to other products.</li>
            <li> I found this product to really help control my breakouts and acne</li>
            <li> Severe - 4/5 Cheap 15$ and works decently (last around 2-3 months&lt;</li>
            <li> Her skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> Has really helped my skin and not drying at all.</li>
            <li> This is been my absolute saving grace.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my acne cure up.</li>
            <li> They package very conscientiously and don&#x27;t try to oversell or over-hype their products.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try this product because although benzoyl peroxide works for me it is usually very drying and causes a lot of itching,  redness and burning.</li>
            <li> This product has a very lotion-y texture and I can wear it under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> It has a very lite scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product over-dries your skin and is quite gentle.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> I am close to 30 and have had very oily skin since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Works absolutely wonders for me.</li>
            <li> It really opens the pores up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product doesn&#x27;t work, but I can&#x27;t really vouch for</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> It works, fast.</li>
            <li> The combo of an oil based benzoyl peroxide + tea tree oil is a bit unusual, but seems to work a treat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at the difference in those spots.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect -- was it a serum?</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sensitivity to the ingredients in this products, then it is probably worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is very non-drying and gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to spend much on cosmetics</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pleasing experience as soon as you apply and the smell fades away soon.</li>
            <li> We are stationed in Japan and the shipping was fast...</li>
            <li> Also the odor dissipates really</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to my acne.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have much effect.</li>
            <li> We much prefer natural remedies, whenever possible and appropriate, and I decided to try this based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now, and his skin is so much clearer now.  </li>
            <li> Didnt really prevent or heal acne very well.</li>
            <li> and I really think it is working.  </li>
            <li> I am very optimistic this is a real solution.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it clears up MUCH faster</li>
            <li> and it really calmed the itching and lessened the severity of the rash.  </li>
            <li> I did so much research and felt like I became an EXPERT at acne.</li>
            <li> Changing my diet didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> So bummed I really, really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> We were really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li> and I also really like using that with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product really works...</li>
            <li> It is important to not use too much of this product at first because this acne treatment can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> At first this did dry me out where I used it (which surprised me, I have tried so many hardcore products) -- but now that my skin has gotten used to it, this is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> Go natural though, Apple cider vinegar!!!</li>
            <li> All the essential oils for healthy skin with the right formulation such that it is light-weight, ultra absorbent, non-drying, and smells absolutely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After adding this to my daily regimen, I&#x27;ve been acne clean for a month, which has not happened in about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, there&#x27;re other products that work too, but this one has more bang</li>
            <li> So often you hear about tea tree oil being good for acne treatment and prevention, yet some people try to apply it topically without diluting it which is too extreme for skincare.</li>
            <li> First you should know that my acne is not very serious, just a couple of them on my face.</li>
            <li> Better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Definitely much better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried-</li>
            <li> Also i like the smell of it better than other stuff.</li>
            <li> but the product has not been overly harsh--a problem he has had with many other products (proactiv to name one).  </li>
            <li> I really like this product since it is effective without being over harsh!</li>
            <li> and it really took care of the acne, highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The cream has a really nice texture and absorbs into the skin quickly without feeling greasy, and due to the low benzoyl peroxide content also doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel super dry.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this is the first product that has kept my face almost clear without the heaviness, dryness and greasiness that you experience.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it was working effectively to prevent acne for me.</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY BP I&#x27;ve ever been able to use twice a day nearly every day of the week along with BHA (salicylic acid) to improve/fade old scars</li>
            <li> the results have been AMAZING!!!One side of my face looks brand new!</li>
            <li> the beginning my goal was to be able to wear less make up</li>
            <li> kit I am trying out is called Exposed, hopefully this is decent.</li>
            <li> I stated with acne when I was older and was put on birth control.</li>
            <li> As a face owner with occasional breakouts, I often look to the assistance of over the counter acne medications for a quick clear-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had mostly gotten my acne under control by a combination of avoiding all dairy and all peanuts/PB, along with BP 2.5% and BHA over the last several</li>
            <li> Sure some different things will work for different people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> proactive: expensive, worked great, too much of a pain to do all 3 steps with all the bottles every night with cotton balls and everything</li>
            <li> Then I spent over $600 at Sephora changing my make up and skin care to more natural mineral based ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Although it has kept some of that at bay, there hasn&#x27;t been any more improvement since the third week (been using it for a total of 6 weeks now) and I will try something else.</li>
            <li> We will definitely purchase more as she goes through her teen years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it based on our experience.</li>
            <li> Conjunction with some other stuff to help with my adult acne and my skin looks sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I decided to give Create Cosmetics BPT3.1 a try, because though it has 3% benzoyl peroxide (a much lower concentration than that of the cream I had been using previously), it has had a profound effect on my skin as a preventive treatment, in contrast to the ineffective spot-treatments I was performing with the generic 10%.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out frequently, but when I undergo periods of particularly high stress, I do break out, and my acne can be very stubborn.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin unexpectedly super soft!</li>
            <li> product works very well to clear up problem skin.</li>
            <li> It has completely cleared up my breakouts and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as to how fast it cleared up my face, but now its all i use to mosturize my face.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with clean and dry</li>
            <li> Has really helped clear up acne, even cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I think this may be a great product, unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find tea tree oil and BP together and even rarer in a formula that actually moisturizes your skin (and be non comedogenic).</li>
            <li> I also switched my gentle cleanser to a charcoal soap bar which reduced my small bumps and cleared my acne up better.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t over-endorse anything</li>
            <li> It might not be as harsh as most though</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how this would work on severe acne, but for his moderate acne, it&#x27;s a resounding success.</li>
            <li> This week I can feel the sore spots where the cysts would normally form</li>
            <li> but none have come close to becoming bumps big enough to bother me and are gone within a day or 2.</li>
            <li> No dangerous ingredients and the cream actually works!</li>
            <li> I had prior tried tea tree oil diluted in jojoba oil without success.  </li>
            <li> Possibilities could be: in frequent exercise as much as I did before, hormone changes, new job position stress, or age.</li>
            <li> I have been using various acne treatment products for over a year to get rid of mild adult acne issues.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s more natural and less chemically.  </li>
            <li> This works and is affordable, is one super easy step, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes/sheets, doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> I had to right a brief review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a spot treatment and acne prevention/reducing treatment because I just wanted to reduce the formation of new acne.</li>
            <li> The new bottle is 2oz instead of the 2.2oz that it shows on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The new one works.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination, hyper-pigmentation skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting my face, though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Some had too many steps, and usually 1 step would run out before the others.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever left a review for any product...</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it caused my face to become itchy, red, and swollen.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this for preventing acne in places where it reoccurs frequently... and it works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure oil-based lotions are better for everyone, but it worked well for me.</li>
            <li> watchout because if you apply this and you go to workout and your body gets hot and sweats, it will bleach your clothes but only on the surface it touches not all the way through.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found that the teenage acne products are too harsh for my skin now and that I really have more t-zone and combination skin problems.  </li>
            <li> My acne got harder to control now at 27 and pregnant.</li>
            <li> With this product assisting with flareups I was able to keep it under control and have had decent skin since starting a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> (i use one that has the course rough particles, pretty much buy whats on sale)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love tea tree, but I&#x27;ve tried pure tea tree oil in the past and it only soothed my acne, but never healed it.   </li>
            <li> Have had limited success over the years; prescription creams or combinations of store bought products, but never anything that continued to work or was affordable over time.  </li>
            <li> My acne is only mild, but has surprisingly recently flared up.</li>
            <li> While she only has mild to moderate acne, with this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream daily for a week for mild acne on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> and it seems to have just made my overall skin so much smoother and clear!</li>
            <li> Which with the big companies you certainly cannot do.</li>
            <li> I starting reducing certain chemical items in my skin care and adding others.  </li>
            <li> It is a light cream and it goes on a little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> The tiny little bumps on my skin are gone and my face looks much more even.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several weeks and it had done a good job of drying up my acne even the tough one.</li>
            <li> Look, anyone who tells you that their face is clear after a day is well, lying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a price I don&#x27;t mind paying if my skin is going to stay clear.</li>
            <li> I also use Elta-MD UV Clear SPF 45 and La-Roch Posay Toleriane Lotion.  </li>
            <li> After just a couple weeks my skin is still clear and softer.  </li>
            <li> but I know that happens sometimes as your pores clear</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t clear the blackheads</li>
            <li> Now his face is clear again.</li>
            <li> I am human but let me tell you not as much as I used to</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The blackheads are almost completely gone and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any redness or irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a product review for people who are specifically sensitive to benzoyl peroxide and still get acne.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, here&#x27;s how you can use it.</li>
            <li> I read about Tea Tree Oil and found this which is a mixture you can apply directly with out mixing with anything else .</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until about a year ago that I started breaking out on my cheeks frequently.</li>
            <li> I found this acne lotion on a whim while browsing natural products on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin near my nose- leading to unsightly blackheads-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not experience any skin irritation with this tea tree acne treatment.</li>
            <li> At the age of 24 I started getting adult acne around my chin and lips.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne for 10years.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of natural helping ingredients used that are non-irritating on the face.  </li>
            <li> but I feel I need to share my regimen for the sake of others who may be struggling with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Together with the spironolactone, this product has completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again and recommend it to anyone who has adult acne.</li>
            <li> 30 years old and still dealing with acne is not fun...have tried everything and in every combination since being a teenager.  </li>
            <li> My skin is to sensitive to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is Scandinavian and quite sensitive, but I seem to tolerate this cream well.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency, and it actually does seem to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Again, the oil-based formulation seems counterintuitive, but leaves my face soft and</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I would recommend this to any of my clients.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect such an oily cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not bother my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I had to do something about my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> its effect is temporary but at least it works better than this nonsense</li>
            <li> But adding BHA or AHA just fried my skin because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has not dried my skin like Clearasil did</li>
            <li> cleared up my acne completely</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide or Tea Tree Oil it might not be for you.  </li>
            <li> It rubs into the skin completely, leaving no shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely helps me not break out as much.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne and some hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> Day time: An oil-free natural sunscreen that is also used as a primer.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 months for my acne to clear up completely.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband who has been struggling with adult acne for years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I saw results really after a month of almost daily application.</li>
            <li> I like it that this is not messy to apply.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> some were to harsh on my skin and caused more problems (red and irritated).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle only because I use this as the treatment portion of an overall skin routine that includes healthier eating habits (e.g., more water, less sugar), regular exercise, and consistent sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gritty like other benzoyl peroxide products and I think this helps it work more deeply into the pores.</li>
            <li> I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li> I have used it all, murad, proactive, oxyclean,skinceuticals, Mary Kay, clickr, bliss, origins, clean and clear, beauty society just to name a few.</li>
            <li> The tube attaching to the pump is missing on the original bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how they developed a product that actually clears up acne while working more like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different acne prevention techniques: first is what works great for me now that i would recommend, then ill list the other stuff that hasnt worked:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I was actually using both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide as two separate topical treatments, so was interested to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Create Cosmetics TTO 3% BP has given me a decent complexion back and almost (but not quite) the courage to wear no foundation.</li>
            <li> If you have ever smelled 100% pure Tea Tree Oil, this is so minor compared to that</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this product again and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (if anyone from the company is reading, please go back to the old caps with the new pumps).</li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> This product caught my attention because of the ingredients it contains I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily skin so finding one that won&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and actually moisturizes is a huge hassle.</li>
            <li> - When I received it, I had a pretty significant breakout that would not clear, including one cystic blemish and several other smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 days of using it you could see a noticeable difference--no new breakouts and reduced redness and inflammation of the breakout he had currently been experiencing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, yet really does the job.  </li>
            <li> Even tried prescription ones i got from a friend but didnt really do much and would totally dry my face out</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> My skin calmed right down and my acne blemishes noticeably reduced within a week&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> it will get inflamed right after you scrub but it will go down within an hour.</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin....and is now starting have &#x27;break-outs&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I had major acne that kept spreading day after day on my chin/jawline.</li>
            <li> I do not use it twice a day as the bottle directs and have not noticed any major drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time for a major upgrade to my up until then, lacking skin carely routine.</li>
            <li> it only took about 2.5 months until it completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> Since those first few weeks, using this product and my new skin care routine, I have had only ONE pimple (that was so small, it barely could be called a pimple, more a red bump).</li>
            <li> For example, better to be using a non-irritating wash, washing for only a few seconds, and let skin dry.</li>
            <li> I get dry and itchy skin even when I use their new sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Product is a little bit costly, but def worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for 2 weeks and her skin is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> After two applications (once daily before bedtime) the area was clear and redness in my skin was visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been almost completely clear since starting using this 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I am an adult woman who has tried literally everything for my acne including Accutane, oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, Proactiv and any number of over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I also would like the products because to me it is not overly drying, as I am an mature female still dealing with flare ups</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone fighting adult acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li> My 14 yr old daughter and I both use this daily.  </li>
            <li> I get adult acne only on my chin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and my skin is finally clearing up!</li>
            <li> I got this product back in early January 2014</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather buy stuff through Amazon than deal with individual companies direct and re-enter my credit card.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for probably 3-4 weeks now, with barely a lone pimple here and there.  </li>
            <li> I only use this product in my T-zone as that is the only place I normally get pimples.</li>
            <li> I only use it sparingly, and wash twice a day with a very mild soap-free cleanser or just water, pat dry, moisturize all over with a few dabs of hemp oil, and then apply this product to &amp;#34;trouble areas.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> the other side is improving and healing more everyday!</li>
            <li> I get small ones, but using the Create they go away really quickly.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed it was such a small bottle, but given how nicely it spreads, you really don&#x27;t need that much for each use.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin only use diluted tea tree oil only.  </li>
            <li> a 29 year old female and have moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> and  it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I have scars from the major perimenopausal breakouts of the last year, I still wear foundation.</li>
            <li> Along with that came unpredictable hormonal surges causing hot flashes and new multi-cyst adult acne breakouts that my previous Acne DOT org regimen no longer controlled.</li>
            <li> If it clears my complexion even more I might order again, but I honestly hate relying on BP because I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin gets use to it and constantly relies on it, but it never seems to fully stop acne from reoccurring and tends to get less effective with time.</li>
            <li> I did have some minor break-outs in the first couple weeks, but I kept on using it, like some other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> Works well as long as you catch the zits early.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first, because the cream was not coming out of the pump, but it turns out there was just air in the straw, so after priming the pump (squirting air a few times), the BPT 3.1 cream started to come</li>
            <li> If skin isn&#x27;t dry then it burns because the product penetrates more deeply with wet skin (I personally don&#x27;t mind a little burning).</li>
            <li> I was breaking out a little more than usual</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> it is powerful and you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I only use this at night and have found that my skin is very soft in the morning with a few new tiny pimples each day.</li>
            <li> This cream I had been using, which smells really... unsettling... would typically take weeks to work (and I suspect my acne just went away on its own, as my stress levels receded), and left my skin looking and feeling oily in the short-term, and dry in the long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Twice a day was a little too much for my skin because it started drying it out.</li>
            <li> Bottle looks high end, but label needs to be improved because it gets dirty easily.  </li>
            <li> A little more expensive than your average gal, but she&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are all the other things ive tried that didnt work nearly as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive acne prone skin since puberty and have to be very careful with every product I use.</li>
            <li> I usually would wake up with about 4-5 new zits starting to form daily - some whiteheads, some deep cystic pimples which would last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a 27 year old Black female.</li>
            <li> SO, I  know this was a long back story, but I want anyone who reads this review to understand where I started and where I am now.</li>
            <li> I had to use this everyday for 3 months to keep my face somewhat normal.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this over the standard harsh walgreens/cvs benzoyl peroxide stuff!</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t completely fry my skin into dryness and flakiness (let alone dry, cracked and oozing) like any other BP has when combined BHA or when used alone twice a day every day, probably because of the jojoba oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> like they have all this past year, unless I picked my face -- and any that did cleared up quickly and didn&#x27;t scar if I didn&#x27;t mess with them&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1/5 Left my skin so dry</li>
            <li> I personally use it both as a preventive and spot treatment addition and it helps dry spots, blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li> It not only has helped with my breakouts but also with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> i pat dry with my towel (i use a different towel, now, for my hair and body!)</li>
            <li> black man with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> really makes my face look/feel better even though i absolutely hate putting it on)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Before I give my review, first a little about me: I&#x27;m 46 with combination skin that tans after one day of slight redness.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be ok with my skin type, but unfortunately after 3 weeks of use my acne is worse.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed to see that they used phenoxyethanol to preserve what I looked like a very clean, non-toxic, high quality product.  </li>
            <li> I do suffer with acne and have seen improvements from other brands such as proactive with respect to treatment but not prevention as it would always come back.</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t look like it is going to dry my skin out, but it has only been few days</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wash with Cetaphil facial wash (or the generic equivalent, whichever is cheaper/on sale), occasionally adding a little baking soda to exfoliate/polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This also moisturizes my skin more and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drying on the skin until your skin gets used to it, and it hurts if used on open skin, as it&#x27;s alcohol based, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twicevso far and they are nearly dried up and gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for less than 2 weeks &amp; have seen major improvement.</li>
            <li> She gets typical teen acne and blackheads and since starting to use this her acne has cleared up and blackhead are non existent.  </li>
            <li> They seem to just shrink back into the surface after a few days of spot treatment, and this does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> , I asked my doctor and she advised me to avoid BP products until after my pregnancy due to possible safety risks for my baby.</li>
            <li> My skin does not immediately get red, which it would do with every other BP product.</li>
            <li> As long as it works!</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, but found them ineffective.</li>
            <li> I only wish they made other products - cleansers, lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> product seems expensive but it will last a really long time and just works so well, totally worth it to me without question.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It also causes my skin to dry out</li>
            <li> I even use diluted tea tree oil to dry up existing acne.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do have a dry forehead</li>
            <li> Because I am prone to in-grown hairs and cystic acne, I then wait for skin to dry and apply Tend Skin to my face (http://www.amazon.com/Tend-Skin-Liquid-For-Women/dp/B000EBFJVK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416935479&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tend+skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tend</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> 25 years ago I began shaving my head, and for the last few years I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne on the back of my scalp, along the hairline.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a spot treatment when I feel those random single pimples form and they never appear, the cream spreads very well and is not too heavy, a little really does go a long way especially if you are using it as moderately as I do.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually combination dry/oily and extremely sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne the past couple of years</li>
            <li> first week, my acne got worse</li>
            <li> Within just a few weeks my skin calmed down completely, redness went away, and my skin is now dewy!  </li>
            <li> (dry patches around the pimple that would not go away!) ,</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up in only a week and a half.</li>
            <li> everyone is different and might need to change other things or use other products to help with the situation, but this one is working for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin has actually gotten less oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to reduce the appearance of red blemishes slightly, but not really treat them.</li>
            <li> I am still breaking out a little, but I have also recently stopped my birth control.</li>
            <li> If anything it grew a little faster when I left it on.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds on acne products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder for me to find something that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I do have a few pimples still, but it has only been two weeks since i started using this product</li>
            <li> I saw no real difference.</li>
            <li> Burns a bit and turns your face red for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It not miraculous, meaning it&#x27;s not like there is absolutely no trace of bumps now,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get acne frequently, but when I do it can be pretty annoying, so I was looking for something to use occasionally and a friend recommended I try this.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily combination, and I developed adult acne in my early 20s, I did manage to get it under control with Neutrogena&#x27;s 3 step system for a few years, but it dries out my skin (making it flaky which is impossible to wear make-up over).  </li>
            <li> about once a month I still get what I believe are hormonal, deep, painful pimples-just a few, but that&#x27;s a few too many.  </li>
            <li> I am 31 and lately have been getting the most painful, deep, scar leaving breakouts.</li>
            <li> but it usually would last me 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> Spread it on your problem areas every other day, and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> It now sits in my bathroom drawer with the other &amp;#34;reject&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I was using the proactive kit (which is essentially benzoyl peroxide) because that has helped in the past</li>
            <li> Then used a regular ponds moisturizer as usual.</li>
            <li> am giving four stars out of five due to the bottle itself - the pump does not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been prescribed benzoyl peroxide face washes and other topical gels in the past as well.</li>
            <li> It works like an other over the counter medicine.</li>
            <li> If you have the money I guess go ahead and try it, it&#x27;s worked for other people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for advertising other products here.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually review, but this actually works for me.  </li>
            <li> and it took them out quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> oil based, so based on the glowing reviews from other suffering from acne</li>
            <li> This product is the one thing that has finally cleared up the small acne on my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from my dermatologist-prescribed acne cream due to all of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I was not willing to take that route.</li>
            <li> I use it on my chest and back when I get small break outs in those areas too along with an apple cider vinager astringent before hand.</li>
            <li> so I looked for other alternative.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve tried other stuff that hasn&#x27;t worked, give this a try.</li>
            <li> No tingling skin sensation, no smell -which seems odd for its ingredient list, no real indication that it was doing anything.</li>
            <li> which says it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide (as the active ingredient).</li>
            <li> Apparently the very small percentages that are in this do the trick without causing redness and peeling.  </li>
            <li> if you at least reduce your animal protein intake and drink green smoothies a few times a week that you will definitely see similar results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out a lot of products the past year and here some other minor product reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less drying than other benzoyl peroxide containing products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots from where the zits were.</li>
            <li> Seems to have cut down my acne quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Cosmetics BPT 3.1 is hands down one of my favorites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the small bottle fool you.</li>
            <li> It is not so harsh to skin as other products.</li>
            <li> 3% BP comes in a small bottle, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I probably use about 3 pumps on my face, and that&#x27;s enough to cover past my jawline and my ears (I sometimes get giant cysts in my ears, earlobes, behind the ear, etc.)</li>
            <li> Way less blemishes except when I started my cycle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for less than a week and my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li> About less than a week, the acne on my face disappeared.</li>
            <li> The rod connecting to the pump is less than 1 cm</li>
            <li> somewhat sheerer, much less chalky</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit less costly though so one star off.</li>
            <li> I would seriously recommend trying this stuff if you&#x27;ve been having similar issues!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late 20&#x27;s, male never had super bad acne by any means, but always had a little bit every few days or week or two.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pump with a little opening.</li>
            <li> He could see the little ones disappearing over night</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with other acne products, this helps but still get a few breakouts every couple of weeks/months when I get lazy.</li>
            <li> I think the benzoyl peroxide works because it&#x27;s a lotion which is actually absorbed rather than just sitting on your skin and the moisturizing properties keep from over-drying your skin which can be just as bad as being too oily.  </li>
            <li> I get painful cystic acne deep under the skin that I frequently agitate until they form scabs.</li>
            <li> The product was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for a few days now</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have few acne that needs to be treated</li>
            <li> and it is the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> Now I just have to deal with the marks left behind by the acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products and they either make my face look worse or just do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I have had few stubborn pimples, that would just not go away, no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> Its not too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> No dryness, no breakout of skin, and not at all harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li> this product is rubbish, a waste of money and a waste of anything else.</li>
            <li> I just get a few pimples every now</li>
            <li> His skin is not breaking out--nor is it peeling from harsh chemical acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> and now I get a few with hormonal changes around the time of the month.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and can&#x27;t say that I see any difference in my skin/acne.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, ONE in two and a half months!</li>
            <li> In the past I had tried to use tea tree oil, BP, or witch hazel (all of which are in this product) and was not able to tolerate them due to severe irritation.  </li>
            <li> But as I turned into my mid-40&#x27;s I began to get one or two painful pimples, that took ages to go away, could never be &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; without major pain/skin damage and when finally gone was leaving scars monthly.</li>
            <li> I am the acne sufferer who always has at least 2 active pimples.</li>
            <li> What worked for me was to scrub my back daily (don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub hard</li>
            <li> Often large, painful, swollen, cyst-like pimples.  </li>
            <li> I used moisterizer every morning, but very little sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> He is a small business which to me is also a plus.  </li>
            <li> but I kept at it for at least 3 weeks everyday and night</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide usually helps keep my acne under control in the past</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil in the past by itself but it was also drying.</li>
            <li> This is the skin product I have been searching for for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the day I moisturize once again, usually after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is benzoyl peroxide (have never used it before)</li>
            <li> and then we realized there were no more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I use a salcylic acid cleanser in the morning followed by a makeup primer/moisturizer made by Napoleon followed by studio makeup when im not too lazy to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> , I ended up just being too lazy and</li>
            <li> Noticed difference with a few days!</li>
            <li> cuz you&#x27;re getting all the dead pore-clogging skin cells out!</li>
            <li> Proactive works, but it seems needlessly complicated, and with time it worked less and less.</li>
            <li> He complained about that it stings when he put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t believe the problem.</li>
            <li> I am in my late forties and</li>
            <li> So start off with one application per day and increase slowly.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil worked but dried my poor skin in the process.</li>
            <li> I am trying home microderm abrasion once or twice weekly to work on the scarring and it seems tobe working slowly.</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours of using this product my few hurting bumps had reduced inflammation and decreased redness.  </li>
            <li> - it appears the formulation is too thick to travel through the very small tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to for this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for over 10 years, previously I&#x27;ve tried various oral antibiotics, Differin, other benzoyl peroxide creams like zapzyt and epiduo, even accutane (horrible side effects).</li>
            <li> and then that are a pain in the butt to get rid of (the ones that seem to get worse over time, and not better).</li>
            <li> but my never experienced excessive drying.</li>
            <li> The caps are really difficult to snap on, so often I don&#x27;t quite snap them down all the way</li>
            <li> I seriously wish I didnt buy it.</li>
            <li> seriously think I&#x27;ll have to keep ordering this for the rest of my life -- or the rest of the life of my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit on the expensive side though.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has moderately bad acne...</li>
            <li> I have really bad white heads</li>
            <li> I have not struggled with acne and did not have it bad as a teen</li>
            <li> I was breaking out really really badly with cystic acne that came OUT OF THE BLUE!!!</li>
            <li> I was stupid in thinking it would clear up on</li>
            <li> The ones that kill the acne dry out my skin terribly, and leave my face red and sore.  </li>
            <li> Epiduo (very expensive and minimal results).</li>
            <li> It has given me small little painful acne bumps.</li>
            <li> My acne is very hard to keep under control (even with a diet trying to help keep it under control).</li>
            <li> so any benzoyl peroxide product makes it break out worse.  </li>
            <li> Some products started to work then made it worse or just didnt work at all.</li>
            <li> I hate to give it only one star.  </li>
            <li> It can be used as a preventive treatment as it&#x27;s not overly irritating</li>
            <li> dont worry it will NOT make it worse..</li>
            <li> I can no longer use harsh products on my face because my skin will dry out terribly.  </li>
            <li> The new caps they are using are terrible</li>
            <li> Dramatic improvement in my skin within days of use when nothing else has been working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and I&#x27;ve actually tried weening myself off of products before, but every time I try to cut this one out of my regimen, bad things happen to my face!  </li>

            <li> It is the second bottle I am purchasing, great product! It does work :)</li>
            <li> I found this product to really help control my breakouts and acne I have been using these for almost 2 years now and have expanded to the Skin by Pom range too, to help specifically with scarring. I like the fact that I can contact the owner/developer and let him know what is working and what is not and he is always willing to refund or have you try something else instead. Which with the big companies you certainly cannot do. He is a small business which to me is also a plus.  They located on the west coast and I am on east coast and will always get a response no longer than 48 hours out. I like the fact that I now have someone to help keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> Look, anyone who tells you that their face is clear after a day is well, lying. But let me tell you this stuff works. So&lt;br /&gt;First you must actually use it every day and night. Second you must actually rub it in your face not just plop it on. There is tea tree in it but its not overpowering. Here is the key. You must be patient. My face wasn&#x27;t the worst but it wasn&#x27;t the best in complexion either but I kept at it for at least 3 weeks everyday and night and I saw results. Actual results!&lt;br /&gt; I have used it all, murad, proactive, oxyclean,skinceuticals, Mary Kay, clickr, bliss, origins, clean and clear, beauty society just to name a few. Let me tell you this is the first product that has kept my face almost clear without the heaviness, dryness and greasiness that you experience. If I said I don&#x27;t break out at all I would be lying. I do break out. I am human but let me tell you not as much as I used to and I wouldn&#x27;t go A day without using this.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product. Once you love this product as much as i do, do me a favor and ask create cosmetics to make more cosmetics.  I promise I use it everywhere on my body that I break out and I am so happy I discovered this. I am a loyal diligent fan. Keep up the good work and make more amazing beauty products!!! Please!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I felt I needed to. I am one of those people that have tried everything for my moderate to severe acne. I can&#x27;t believe that I finally found something that works. I hope that they don&#x27;t discontinue this at any time, it has been a godsend.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with other acne products, this helps but still get a few breakouts every couple of weeks/months when I get lazy. I was having some really bad breakouts for months and then I started doing research and realized my whey protein and mass gainer were causing me to breakout (I workout 4-5 days a week).  I would recommend doing research and watching what you eat. I myself have to stay away from dairy, wheat(noo my beer ;( ), and soy or else I will breakout around my neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out a lot of products the past year and here some other minor product reviews. Also a note, I have OILY skin.&lt;br /&gt;AcneFree Severe - 4/5 Cheap 15$ and works decently (last around 2-3 months&lt;br /&gt;proactive + - 4/5 worked good for myself but cost too much! I was using this before I started watching my diet and this helped with the breakouts big time. Last time I checked it was around 130$ for a 60 day supply but it usually would last me 4-5 months. Maybe try the trial and then cancel if it blows.&lt;br /&gt;Glytone kit - garbage! 1/5 Left my skin so dry and it felt like it was making everything worse.&lt;br /&gt;next kit I am trying out is called Exposed, hopefully this is decent. I don&#x27;t like the price of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for spot treatment I would use clean and clear products. they work fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully this helps someone, sorry for spelling etc but idgafos! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> The product was too harsh for my skin. I have sensitive skin so any benzoyl peroxide product makes it break out worse.  If you have sensitive skin only use diluted tea tree oil only.  The delivery was great but I couldn&#x27;t use the product anymore.</li>
            <li> I have occasional acne issues (blackheads and some breakouts) This product I have been using for a few days now and it seems to be working quite well for me. The blackheads are almost completely gone and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any redness or irritation on my skin. I am so very happy I received this product for an honest review. It is managing my acne issues quite well. I will definitely be ordering this product again and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I was pretty disapointed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great; wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> This is a product review for people who are specifically sensitive to benzoyl peroxide and still get acne. I&#x27;ve tried a lot, a LOT of acne products with varying levels of success. This one actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well to clear up problem skin. Your zits will disappear within one to two days. However, it&#x27;s a bit strong for people who are sensitive, as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, here&#x27;s how you can use it. Don&#x27;t use it every day. Spread it on your problem areas every other day, and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> My daughter has moderate acne. We have tried several different acne treatments and none have worked. So I was excited to try this one in return for my unbiased opinion. My daughter applied this twice a day after she washed her face, and followed up with a light moisturizer. She has been using it for 2 weeks and her skin is starting to clear up. Her skin looks much healthier. We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i like it. it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin at all. however, i would prefer a higher benzoyl peroxide percentage.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Seems to have cut down my acne quite a bit. I would recommend this. I use it after washing with Murad face wash and I put jojoba oil to moisturize after putting this on. This is the best combination I have found for my acne-prone face.</li>
            <li> Helped prevent breakouts. Can even skip your moisturizer. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me, this is the best skin product I have ever tried. My skin is usually combination dry/oily and extremely sensitive (prone to redness, peeling, itching, breakouts, splotches, you name it). In the past I had tried to use tea tree oil, BP, or witch hazel (all of which are in this product) and was not able to tolerate them due to severe irritation.  But not with this product! Apparently the very small percentages that are in this do the trick without causing redness and peeling.  Within just a few weeks my skin calmed down completely, redness went away, and my skin is now dewy!  I only use it sparingly, and wash twice a day with a very mild soap-free cleanser or just water, pat dry, moisturize all over with a few dabs of hemp oil, and then apply this product to &amp;#34;trouble areas.&amp;#34;  Presto, flawless skinâ€¦wow!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with break outs at all. I used it consistently for about a month and saw no improvement. It now sits in my bathroom drawer with the other &amp;#34;reject&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to through this away.  It made me break out terrible I am guessing from an allergic reaction. I don&#x27;t know what ingredient I reacted to but it was a fairly good size rash.  It looked like a heat rash.</li>
            <li> I am Loving this stuff!!!! I have tried many products over the years. Some had too many steps, and usually 1 step would run out before the others. some were to harsh on my skin and caused more problems (red and irritated). when reading another review it stated to wash your face first (makes sense!). but product states may cause dryness. so I found a very gentle organic soap and a face cleansing  sponge. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now in the morning and before bed. the results have been AMAZING!!!One side of my face looks brand new! the other side is improving and healing more everyday!</li>
            <li> My teenage son has moderately bad acne... I read about Tea Tree Oil and found this which is a mixture you can apply directly with out mixing with anything else . Works great no redness at all for us . If you can&#x27;t afford the $$$ perscription meds give this a try . He also spot treats any on his back and chest they are gone the next day . Very happy .</li>
            <li> if you suffering from acne problems you should definely give this a try,personally for me this was the solution,i use it in combination with the Cetaphil oil control foam wash and it works wonderfully I could never say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Has really helped my skin and not drying at all.</li>
            <li> This is been my absolute saving grace. I am the acne sufferer who always has at least 2 active pimples. It wasn&#x27;t until about a year ago that I started breaking out on my cheeks frequently. I also have cystic pimples on my chin. I found this acne lotion on a whim while browsing natural products on amazon. I took a risk and I cannot imagine my skin without it now! The 3% benzoyl perozide seems to work perfect for my skin in combo with the tea tree and moisturizing jojoba oil. And oddly enough my skin doesn&#x27;t flake like it did with prescription topical benzoyl peroxide. It works best for me if I apply it after I wash my face at night. The only con is that it literally bleaches everything your face touches for the following 2 hours after you apply. I have even tried applying it at 6:30 in the evening and even going to bed at 10pm I still had bleach marks on my pillow case. It even managed to bleach the top of my comforter if it happens to lay against my face at night. I have also found that applying it just in the daytime doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick. Maybe if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup with it it might work well too, but I just prefer the nightly application. It&#x27;s a price I don&#x27;t mind paying if my skin is going to stay clear. I will never be without</li>
            <li> I have some significant combination skin that I have been fighting with since a teenager. I have oily skin near my nose- leading to unsightly blackheads- and whiteheads that crop up around my monthly cycle. I have tried so many over-the-counter treatments with limited success. Create Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment is a product I have come to use and consistently rely on. I started off using this product once a day, and recently increasing my usage to twice a day, using this product as directed. The cream is thicker and soaks into the skin pretty fast. My skin feels nice and smooth after applying. I have sensitive skin and have not experience any skin irritation with this tea tree acne treatment. It is important to not use too much of this product at first because this acne treatment can dry out your skin. (This was mentioned as well in the item description.) So start off with one application per day and increase slowly. I am happy to have found this product at a great price and offer my honest opinion about regarding this product. Great quality product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This has really helped my acne cure up. GREAT (and cheaper) alternative for proactive. In fact, this worked better for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It&#x27;s rare to find tea tree oil and BP together and even rarer in a formula that actually moisturizes your skin (and be non comedogenic). A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the small bottle fool you.</li>
            <li> I used this product before applying foundation, makeup and etc. I have few acne that needs to be treated but I&#x27;m so happy I got this product for discounted price in return for honest review.Im so happy with the product,it controls the growing of my acne. Acne start healing and drying and turn into scars. I can see the big difference after weeks of using it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I paid full price for this item, don&#x27;t know how others get it free or discounted, but oh well. At first I loved this item. For the first 2 weeks I saw some improvement or reduction, but I actually kept getting cystic acne and small bumps reoccuring so I&#x27;m not sure it was working effectively to prevent acne for me. I love tea tree, but I&#x27;ve tried pure tea tree oil in the past and it only soothed my acne, but never healed it.   My skin is oily combination, and I developed adult acne in my early 20s, I did manage to get it under control with Neutrogena&#x27;s 3 step system for a few years, but it dries out my skin (making it flaky which is impossible to wear make-up over).  My acne got harder to control now at 27 and pregnant. I was just looking for a spot treatment and acne prevention/reducing treatment because I just wanted to reduce the formation of new acne. Benzoyl peroxide usually helps keep my acne under control in the past so I decided to get this, but after almost a month and not seeing anymore improvement, I asked my doctor and she advised me to avoid BP products until after my pregnancy due to possible safety risks for my baby. Anyways she prescribed me a cream that was not as drying, but more effective. I also switched my gentle cleanser to a charcoal soap bar which reduced my small bumps and cleared my acne up better. I still have some acne, but I&#x27;m preggo still, so we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ll try this again after my pregnancy, but more or so just to finish using it up. If it clears my complexion even more I might order again, but I honestly hate relying on BP because I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin gets use to it and constantly relies on it, but it never seems to fully stop acne from reoccurring and tends to get less effective with time. Atm, I am 100% satisfied w/ the charcoal bar soap, so I might not order this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and I&#x27;ve actually tried weening myself off of products before, but every time I try to cut this one out of my regimen, bad things happen to my face!  Meaning, this stuff really works at keeping combination oily and dry skin in a relatively clear state (and I do say relatively because no one has perfect skin, ever).  It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, it&#x27;s creamy (not oily), it feels great going on, and I actually just got the Lactic Acid &amp; Tea Tree Oil as a promo and it is DIVINE.  I use this during the day and the lactic acid at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fights blemishes, and very gently so.&lt;br /&gt;- No bleaching effect whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizes without oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;- No fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;- Glass bottle (this thing is durable too--I have dropped it many times).&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent longevity. One bottle lasts me about 9 months using it every day (and still effective up to the last pump).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The new caps they are using are terrible (if anyone from the company is reading, please go back to the old caps with the new pumps). The caps are really difficult to snap on, so often I don&#x27;t quite snap them down all the way and when I go to pick the bottle up (often by the cap), it comes off and the bottle falls (see &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; note above).&lt;br /&gt;- Obviously can&#x27;t combat hormonal breakouts.  C&#x27;est la vie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company is great too.  They package very conscientiously and don&#x27;t try to oversell or over-hype their products.</li>
            <li> love seeing the results delivered by this product, will definitely buy again if needed-it is powerful and you only need a small amount.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I am an adult woman who has tried literally everything for my acne including Accutane, oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, Proactiv and any number of over the counter products. I was nervous to try this product because although benzoyl peroxide works for me it is usually very drying and causes a lot of itching,  redness and burning. This product is amazing. It has completely cleared up my breakouts and it is very moisturizing. Ive experienced none of the drying side effects I normally do with benzoyl peroxide products. This product has a very lotion-y texture and I can wear it under my makeup. I love it. TRY IT. IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product.  I was actually using both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide as two separate topical treatments, so was interested to try this product.  Very happy with the results, and I have worked with many different types of treatments for my adult acne.  It&#x27;s not gritty like other benzoyl peroxide products and I think this helps it work more deeply into the pores.</li>
            <li> I have been searching all over for a product like this. I am 31 and lately have been getting the most painful, deep, scar leaving breakouts. I was using the proactive kit (which is essentially benzoyl peroxide) because that has helped in the past and it wasnt working, only drying my skin out. I used tea tree oil in the past by itself but it was also drying. This product is the perfect balance for me as my skin is clearing up tremendously and is not dry at all and it is the dead of winter. Will definitely continue to use and order more.</li>
            <li> Worked fantastically. Very impressed. The packaging tells you everything you need to know- the rest is up to you! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I will never stop using this product. I am 23 and have been struggling with acne for years. It cleared up my skin so much! As soon as you feel a break out this stuff by Create Cosmetics works like magic and stops acne from developing. My skin was really bad, I had laser genesis treatments once a month as well as salicylic acid peels, that worked for about a week controlling my break outs but then it would flare up again. I had acne along my jawline most but it was everywhere and it was bad. I have been using \\&quot;Tea Tree Oil and 3% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment by Create Cosmetics\\&quot; for 4 months now. I am about to run out so I am placing another order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and I never had a problem with this product. I use this product all over my face day and night and it has been working like magic. I might get one break out every couple of weeks and that&#x27;s fine.  I use it under my moisturizer and makeup in the mornings and on its own at night. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning my goal was to be able to wear less make up and then no make up eventually (concealer, cover up, foundation). And I feel like I&#x27;m getting there! Now I just have to deal with the marks left behind by the acne. I am so thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> At the age of 24 I started getting adult acne around my chin and lips. I stopped taking birth control after many years, so I believe this was the cause. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that helped. It was really depressing. My skin is sensitive and dries out very easily. I even had prescriptions. I started using this at 28 with an antioxidant lotion from Trader Joe&#x27;s. My acne became much better. Way less blemishes except when I started my cycle. I got sick in the winter and started using a humidifier. Ever since then my acne is almost gone! I get small ones, but using the Create they go away really quickly. So happy!!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works! I was surprised as to how fast it cleared up my face, but now its all i use to mosturize my face. The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but I used with a little Aveeno face cream. This stuff is magic in a little bottle. : )</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t really work. I use it twice a day, rub it in each affected area for 30 seconds and haven&#x27;t seen an improvement. It also causes my skin to dry out</li>
            <li> Okay so I started breaking out when I was 23 years old. Before that I had beautiful skin. This can be totally heart-breaking as many know (I am sure you can relate if you are looking at this product). At first this did dry me out where I used it (which surprised me, I have tried so many hardcore products) -- but now that my skin has gotten used to it, this is no longer a problem. This only took about 4-5 days to get used to. I am still breaking out a little, but I have also recently stopped my birth control. I do believe this is a great product and feel I am breaking out less with using it. I use it morning and night, but only in my acne prone areas (lower cheeks and chin). I wouldn&#x27;t use it in spots where you aren&#x27;t prone to pimples. I will be buying this again. I am curious to see how I will get this product out of the bottle once it is near the bottom .. it&#x27;s pump with a little opening. But overall, I would recommend this product and will re-order when needed.</li>
            <li> YES BUY THIS PRODUCT! I have had adult acne for 10years. Have tried EVERYTHING possible. Some products started to work then made it worse or just didnt work at all. Proactiv, clinique, etccccccccccc. I even use diluted tea tree oil to dry up existing acne. Tea tree oil worked but dried my poor skin in the process. I have spent hundreds on acne products. I may have cursed myself but i felt compelled to rave about this product. I have used it for 5 days and my skin is nearly flawless!!!! I had major acne that kept spreading day after day on my chin/jawline. I washed day and evening and used this only on that area. Then used a regular ponds moisturizer as usual. My skin looks radiant and no drying! Use it only on acne prone areas though. Please this is worth the money! I am crossing my fingers that it stays so beautiful!</li>
            <li> My teen has horrible acne so I am always willing to try anything to help him reduce it. I was more then happy to try this product when it was offered to e during a promotion for my honest opinion. It has a very lite scent. He did not have any problem applying it, it is not runny, but it  isnt too think either. He could see the little ones disappearing over night , he was very excited, I will continue to use this product as long as I see these type of results.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to find that upon entering menopause that I once again am getting acne! I can no longer use harsh products on my face because my skin will dry out terribly.  I have tried many over the counter product purchased at my grocery store, but none seem to do the job.  The ones that kill the acne dry out my skin terribly, and leave my face red and sore.  I looked at this product and purchased it in spite of the price - but I have found that it&#x27;s well worth it.  If you apply this to your face at the first signs of an acne flareup it honestly &#x27;takes the red out&#x27;, cools the infection, and helps to lessen the infection overnight.  I am grateful for this product, and the upside is that it&#x27;s natural and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> really enjoyed this product... looking for something which was not drying, just right for adult break-outs! i would highly recommend this over the standard harsh walgreens/cvs benzoyl peroxide stuff!</li>
            <li> For quite some time I was dealing with issues of cystic acne on my chin.  At 29 that form of acne had never been a problem for me.  I starting reducing certain chemical items in my skin care and adding others.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that SLS was causing the cystic acne.  With this product assisting with flareups I was able to keep it under control and have had decent skin since starting a few months ago.  I don&#x27;t feel this product over-dries your skin and is quite gentle.  There are plenty of natural helping ingredients used that are non-irritating on the face.  Besides this product I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Pure-Castille Soap and Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel.  I also use Elta-MD UV Clear SPF 45 and La-Roch Posay Toleriane Lotion.  I would say that my skin is smooth (I also use a retinol at night) and normal moisture.  Sometimes I do have a dry forehead but I feel it is contributed to by wearing a side bang.  I normally don&#x27;t over-endorse anything but I feel I need to share my regimen for the sake of others who may be struggling with adult acne.  Give it a try if you just can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s contributing to your skin care concerns.  So far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several weeks and it had done a good job of drying up my acne even the tough one. I also would like the products because to me it is not overly drying, as I am an mature female still dealing with flare ups, I don&#x27;t need a drying agent.</li>
            <li> The product: I have been using the product once a day for three days and I am extremely pleased - When I received it, I had a pretty significant breakout that would not clear, including one cystic blemish and several other smaller blemishes.  I would categorize it as moderately severe. After two applications (once daily before bedtime) the area was clear and redness in my skin was visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving four stars out of five due to the bottle itself - the pump does not work - it appears the formulation is too thick to travel through the very small tube.</li>
            <li> Love this. I personally use it both as a preventive and spot treatment addition and it helps dry spots, blemishes and pimples. Very versatile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with some hormonal acne recently that has just been driving me nuts. I have tried countless products and they either make my face look worse or just do nothing at all. I was really excited to try this product because it has tea tree oil and Benzoyl Peroxide, two ingredients to help acne. I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s harder for me to find something that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I was a bit worried because it has Jojoba oil and Macadamia seed oil in it and I thought it would clog my pores. So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product. My face has cleared up in only a week and a half. The tiny little bumps on my skin are gone and my face looks much more even. My skin is softer and more hydrated too thanks to the different ingredients it has. This product also includes Shea butter which is an Anti-inflammatory that includes Vitamin A and E as well as Witch Hazel which is an Anti-inflammatory, with soothing and astringent effects. This is an all-in-one product that I have really been enjoying. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Better than other products I have tried. It is not so harsh to skin as other products. Try to apply twice a day after cleaning your face with a face wash (I use neutrogena salicyclic acid face wash). It also moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> I never had troubles with acne until I was in my 30&#x27;s, I now get moderate acne along my jaw line and cheeks every month. Now I use this product when I notice these flare ups and it really works! I do not use it twice a day as the bottle directs and have not noticed any major drying of the skin. I also use it as a spot treatment when I feel those random single pimples form and they never appear, the cream spreads very well and is not too heavy, a little really does go a long way especially if you are using it as moderately as I do.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference overnight with this product. I was about to make a dermatology appointment but held off after one day of using this because it is so effective. I have used all sorts of treatments including antibiotics and spironolactone. I&#x27;ve been prescribed benzoyl peroxide face washes and other topical gels in the past as well. Together with the spironolactone, this product has completely cleared my skin. It is truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> This is the skin product I have been searching for for the past 15 years. I am close to 30 and have had very oily skin since I was a teenager. I apply only at night, and have had amazing results. My skin has been almost completely clear since starting using this 3 months ago. I would definitely recommend to anyone fighting adult acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li> i used it for 3 days, without telling anybody, most people said that my face looks better! and it really took care of the acne, highly recommend it, i will order again, thanks!</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this product, I had to try it and it does work. I do suffer with acne and have seen improvements from other brands such as proactive with respect to treatment but not prevention as it would always come back. This product however within two days a pimple will dissapeared, and it is yet to return. I do have a few pimples still, but it has only been two weeks since i started using this product and I am optimistic that I will soon be acne free.&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike is the price, as i find it too pricey....but for the results it give, the price would be the tradeoff.</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots from where the zits were. It works like an other over the counter medicine. It might not be as harsh as most though and I like the tea tree oil smell.</li>
            <li> I notice his skin clearing up within the first week. I was truly amazed. I will recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> I stated with acne when I was older and was put on birth control. his stuff is wonderful I put it on in the am. and pm. after washing my face and if I get a spot starting to develop I massage it into it and it goes away quickly and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> this is amazing. i typicallly dont buy beauty products like this bc i.figure it wont work. but i was having horrible breakouts and i tried this worked immediately i would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> It works but also causes me to break out on my neck area for some reason. I would use it as a spot treatment rather than an all over face one even though it is low potency bp</li>
            <li> Dramatic improvement in my skin within days of use when nothing else has been working.</li>
            <li> Within three days this product was already clearing my face up.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, yet really does the job.  After just a couple weeks my skin is still clear and softer.  I will buy this product again and recommend it to anyone who has adult acne.</li>
            <li> I seriously wish I didnt buy it. For some reason my acne was not responsive to this! If anything it grew a little faster when I left it on. I have really bad white heads and whenever I smear some of this stuff on it did not help one bit!! If you have the money I guess go ahead and try it, it&#x27;s worked for other people. Go natural though, Apple cider vinegar!!! Works absolutely wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I want to preface this with the fact that I never write Amazon reviews, but as a long-time sufferer of moderate to severe acne I had to right a brief review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blend from Create Cosmetics gets everything right. All the essential oils for healthy skin with the right formulation such that it is light-weight, ultra absorbent, non-drying, and smells absolutely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After adding this to my daily regimen, I&#x27;ve been acne clean for a month, which has not happened in about 10 years. I usually would wake up with about 4-5 new zits starting to form daily - some whiteheads, some deep cystic pimples which would last for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male who suffered from in-grown hairs after shaving to very bad cystic acne, I can finally say that I&#x27;m happy with my skin. There is a warm healthy glow that is acne-free. But as has already been said, this cream wasn&#x27;t the sole reason for my happiness and clean skin, it was a combination of many other factors, but most of all, its diligence in treating your face morning, afternoon, and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this cream once daily in morning after your morning routine (or again at night if aren&#x27;t prescribed a retinoid. Can be used as spot treatment during the day as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine necessarily includes, shaving, then rinsing with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser (http://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Cleanser-12-Ounce/dp/B000YJ2SKM). Because I am prone to in-grown hairs and cystic acne, I then wait for skin to dry and apply Tend Skin to my face (http://www.amazon.com/Tend-Skin-Liquid-For-Women/dp/B000EBFJVK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416935479&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tend+skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin is a godsend for anyone suffering from cystic acne or in-grown hairs after shaving. I use it daily morning and night. It really opens the pores up. It&#x27;s drying on the skin until your skin gets used to it, and it hurts if used on open skin, as it&#x27;s alcohol based, so be careful. But if used diligently, it will greatly help with your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Tend Skin is drying, I moisturize with CeraVe (http://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-12-oz/dp/B000YJ2SLG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416935626&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;cerave+moisturizer). I like that it&#x27;s very light weight, quick-drying, and non-greasy, but any of your favorite moisturizers will do. The trick is to keep your face moisturized as BP and Tend Skin and the retinoid are all drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the moisturizer dries, I then apply the Create Cosmetic mixture - again, I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this stuff feels on your face. If you&#x27;ve been using the 5% or crappy 10% benzoyl from Target, get rid of that. This mixture is leaps and bounds ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the day I moisturize once again, usually after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then at night I conclude with again washing with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, Tend Skin, and then apply a prescribed Retinoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinoid tends to cause my skin to flake off so in the morning I have an abrasive washcloth to wash the skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for advertising other products here. I want to again emphasize though, that this cream really got it right, definitley worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, don&#x27;t go into buying this cream thinking that it will cure your acne, it won&#x27;t. But if you are diligent, and add this to your repertoire, I think you will truly be amazed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever left a review for any product...and I do 99% of my shopping online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this product works for me. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle only because I use this as the treatment portion of an overall skin routine that includes healthier eating habits (e.g., more water, less sugar), regular exercise, and consistent sleep. However, I have seen a noticeable improvement in the frequency of my breakouts and a softening of my skin. As with most products, when I first started using it I was breaking out a little more than usual (the purge). Then after about 2 weeks my skin calmed and others started complimenting the smoothness of my skin (FYI - I don&#x27;t wear makeup so this is huge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells wonderful, predominantly like tea tree, which I like. It is a light cream and it goes on a little greasy for me. I use it at night and sometimes during the day if I&#x27;m having a breakout. I started light and gradually increased the dosage. I apply this product using the same steps recommended by Acne.org and I think it makes the difference. For example, better to be using a non-irritating wash, washing for only a few seconds, and let skin dry. If skin isn&#x27;t dry then it burns because the product penetrates more deeply with wet skin (I personally don&#x27;t mind a little burning). I also use a moisturizer with SPF during the day. (I wish Create Cosmetics would also develop a moisturizer, that would be AWESOME).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 27 year old Black female. I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for almost 15 years. I have very sensitive, combination, hyper-pigmentation skin. So, my focus has been on finding affordable, effective, non-irritating products without the pore-clogging ingredients.... THIS...IS...IT!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have been trying to get rid of my mild acne for weeks now. I have had few stubborn pimples, that would just not go away, no matter what I did. After just 2 days of using it, I can see my face clearing out and my complexion looks so much better. In addition to this product I am using Neutrogena face wash, toner and moisturizer. So far it doesn&#x27;t look like it is going to dry my skin out, but it has only been few days and I am using moisturizer to prevent that.</li>
            <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: Works great. Wish I could use it at night without messing up with my non-white sheets</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He complained about that it stings when he put it on. There is also a lot of dryness involved too. I am hoping it works on the acne...we will see.</li>
            <li> Wish this Tea Tree Oil and 3% BP Acne treatment worked for me but it didn&#x27;t.  Thanks for the quick refund.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually review, but this actually works for me.  Which is really saying something!  30 years old and still dealing with acne is not fun...have tried everything and in every combination since being a teenager.  Have had limited success over the years; prescription creams or combinations of store bought products, but never anything that continued to work or was affordable over time.  This works and is affordable, is one super easy step, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes/sheets, doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  I think the benzoyl peroxide works because it&#x27;s a lotion which is actually absorbed rather than just sitting on your skin and the moisturizing properties keep from over-drying your skin which can be just as bad as being too oily.  Hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product doesn&#x27;t work, but I can&#x27;t really vouch for it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to reduce the appearance of red blemishes slightly, but not really treat them. Maybe I needed to be more patient and consistent to see results, but since then I&#x27;ve moved on to other products.</li>
            <li> I use this strictly for when i shave and have razor bump under my neck.  My skin is to sensitive to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Positive: Clears my skin, after using this cream for a month I&#x27;m convinced. My acne is only mild, but has surprisingly recently flared up. I also got off all cleaners and as instructed started treating my skin more gently, apparently that&#x27;s supposed to reduce inflammation. My skin is Scandinavian and quite sensitive, but I seem to tolerate this cream well. I&#x27;ve only gotten one whitehead since starting this treatment. I was a bit skeptical about an oil based treatment, but my pores seem better than ever. I really like the consistency, and it actually does seem to moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: It took me 2 weeks to see good results, and it was initially more drying than moisturizing, but it seems my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with break out. I have tried many different treatments but most are not go for my combo skin. I received a sample and am happy with this product. It not only has helped with my breakouts but also with my dry skin. My skin is sensitive and this does not bother me at all. It does not leave a residue feeling and is light. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It worked for my teenager son like a wonder, it cleared out most of the pimples he had on his forehead, definitely recommended</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;ve been using the product for less than a week and my skin is clearing up. Its not too harsh on my skin and I like the smell of tea tree oil. I&#x27;m excited to see the full results!</li>
            <li> This is great. I started using it in. Conjunction with some other stuff to help with my adult acne and my skin looks sooooo much better. You only need to use it once a day!</li>
            <li> Product works great!  One star because they can&#x27;t offer a consistent supply.  Purchased my first bottle a year ago.  I went to reorder over the winter and I had to wait a month.  I&#x27;m trying to reorder now, and it&#x27;s unavailable.  Shame on Amazon for offering a product that has inconsistent availability - especially for a pharmaceutical.  Acne treatment is dependent on consistent use.  If Amazon finds a way to consistently distribute this product I would gladly change my response and say more great things about this product.  For now I would avoid this product and pick one that is actually available. Update 10-12-16- After several additional years of using this product I have been able to get it consistently, and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It heals my acne after a couple days. I don&#x27;t know if it works for lots of acne; but I have one acne sometimes, and this product helps to get rid of it pretty soon. The coupon $5 off after the first purchase makes it a better deal.</li>
            <li> This made my face break out in a rash. Use either the tea tree oil or the benzoyl peroxide but not both. I use Panoxyl now and it works great.</li>
            <li> When I have an emerging zit, this is a life saver! They seem to just shrink back into the surface after a few days of spot treatment, and this does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, there&#x27;re other products that work too, but this one has more bang, I&#x27;ve not had any problems with drying using it, which is impressive in itself. A little bit on the expensive side though.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It cleared up my acne in two days just in time for my friend&#x27;s wedding. My skin was flawless. What a great find!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from monthly hormonal cystic acne, it&#x27;s nasty and difficult to get rid of. From the reviews on this product I thought that I had found a solution to my tricky acne problem. Sadly for me, after a month of using this product nothing changed. I really wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> As a face owner with occasional breakouts, I often look to the assistance of over the counter acne medications for a quick clear-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are myriad options when it comes to acne treatments, not all are equally effective, and many have unwanted side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Create Cosmetics BPT 3.1 is hands down one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt; + It works, fast. I use this once or twice a day, and my acne is reduced by about 90%. I still get the occasional bump when under stress, but they&#x27;re hardy noticeable and go away quickly.&lt;br /&gt; + Great formulation - The combo of an oil based benzoyl peroxide + tea tree oil is a bit unusual, but seems to work a treat.&lt;br /&gt; + Smell - very mild. You notice the tea tree oil when you first put it on (which I find pleasant), but that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt; + No dryness. Again, the oil-based formulation seems counterintuitive, but leaves my face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt; -  A little more expensive than your average gal, but she&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> OK so I had a couple of spots right around the corners of my mouth that have broke out.  I have used this product twicevso far and they are nearly dried up and gone.  I am absolutely amazed at the difference in those spots.  I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product.  My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this product, I did some research. Tea Tree oil? Never heard of it. Among its many uses I discovered was &#x27;treats acne&#x27;. I am always looking for more natural products for my face. I already knew benzoyl peroxide was an acne weapon, I thought the combination was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed. I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there. I can safely say this product has been working for me. I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in our home. I have been using it and my teenage son has been tolerating it; he hates anything &#x27;smelly&#x27;. All acne medication is smelly! Perhaps the tea tree oil cuts the benzoyl peroxide smell because he does not mind using this. If it works for me and my teenage son is tolerant, this is a win-win. As I said, we both have mild acne , and this has been working for us.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. It does the job without drying out your skin. Definitely much better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried- you&#x27;ll never find anything as good as this at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;Some people may take issue with the consistency- it&#x27;s fairly gooey. It doesn&#x27;t bother me and I assume it&#x27;s just another aspect of the healthy ingredients that go into it. Better than the alternatives...</li>
            <li> If used a directed this is an excellent product. I had several blemishes that popped up and it took them out quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I am a professional makeup artist and I would recommend this to any of my clients.</li>
            <li> After looking for a product that had both tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide I found this highly rated product and ordered it hoping for the best. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect -- was it a serum? Gel? Oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the product is a rich cream that is very oily at first. Every dermatologist I have ever seen for my acne has always advised to stay away from anything oil based, so based on the glowing reviews from other suffering from acne I really didn&#x27;t expect such an oily cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for almost a week, I haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in acne. I only use this at night and have found that my skin is very soft in the morning with a few new tiny pimples each day. I&#x27;m hoping this is just a transition phase that will subside in the upcoming weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2/7/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See comments below for update</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for people with acne and sensitive skin. The tea tree oil/BP combo is very effective, and the texture of the product is ver smooth. My skin does not immediately get red, which it would do with every other BP product. In fact, my skin has been very calm, which is amazing! Thank goodness for this stuff!</li>
            <li> First you should know that my acne is not very serious, just a couple of them on my face. I kept using this acne treatment twice a day, morning and night. There is no discomfort. About less than a week, the acne on my face disappeared. So it does work. Great product, deserve five star!</li>
            <li> Works well as long as you catch the zits early.</li>
            <li> This product is the one thing that has finally cleared up the small acne on my face. I have used prescription medication and over-the-counter. This is the only thing I have found that actually works. I use it once a day (I have oily skin) and cover with Mario Badescu Buttermilk moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know if it is tea tree oil or the benzoyl peroxide, but I don&#x27;t care. As long as it works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I really like it. I will Definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it caused my face to become itchy, red, and swollen. It took about 30 hours, ice, and anti-itching cream to make it go away.  That being said, it cured most of my acne overnight.  I am not sure if it is benzoyl peroxide (have never used it before) that I am allergic to or something else.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sensitivity to the ingredients in this products, then it is probably worth the money.  It certainly seems potent against acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by the many good reviews on this. I&#x27;m a bit underwhelmed by this product. I saw no real difference. No tingling skin sensation, no smell -which seems odd for its ingredient list, no real indication that it was doing anything. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin. Regardless I won&#x27;t be purchasing it  again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year, and just re-ordered.  The new bottle is 2oz instead of the 2.2oz that it shows on Amazon.  Also, not listed are two new ingredients that were not in the original formula: Polysorbate 60 and Xanthan Gum.      I use this after shaving and think the tea tree oil base works well for moisturization and anti-bacterial properties.  The pump doesn&#x27;t squirt enough out and when the bottle gets to the end it&#x27;s impossible to get any product out.  I was also disappointed to see that they used phenoxyethanol to preserve what I looked like a very clean, non-toxic, high quality product.  If I needed a BPO lotion again I would get this over a sticky water based one with parabens, otherwise I&#x27;m going to try a preservative free moisturizer instead.</li>
            <li> My 14 yr old daughter and I both use this daily.  She gets typical teen acne and blackheads and since starting to use this her acne has cleared up and blackhead are non existent.  It is very non-drying and gentle so at first it seems to not be doing anything but if used regularly you will notice a big difference.  It took about 3 days to notice acne clearing and then we realized there were no more breakouts.  I get adult acne only on my chin.  I use this first thing in the morning on my chin and no more acne breakouts.  It does not bother my sensitive skin and  it does not dry out your skin.  She is able to wear makeup over it and it is not effected.</li>
            <li> Definitely effective, my face is better, I look better, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, [geeking out] I love the process Create has for improving it! Look at their website for the details.</li>
            <li> I debated about buying this acne treatment.  I&#x27;m not one to spend much on cosmetics but I had to do something about my adult acne.  The anti-inflammatory properties of the tea tree oil sounded helpful but I was worried about the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; effect.  To my pleasant surprise, there was no oily effect or shine.  My skin calmed right down and my acne blemishes noticeably reduced within a week&#x27;s time.  My two teens had the same results.  I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> I hate to give it only one star.  I think mine is defective.  The rod connecting to the pump is less than 1 cm, so short that the cream won&#x27;t come out.  My son only used it once.  Afterwards, we couldn&#x27;t get any cream out with the pump.  I am hoping the seller will replace this one if it is defective.  If not, I will have to request a refund since it is not usable.    update on 11/3/14:  I contacted the seller with the email provided in the questions and answers section.  He responded quickly and sent a new bottle.  The tube attaching to the pump is missing on the original bottle.  The new one works.  Add 2 stars for customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using various acne treatment products for over a year to get rid of mild adult acne issues. This product is the first one that showed immediate effect. I love the fact that it has tea tree oil. It&#x27;s very pleasing experience as soon as you apply and the smell fades away soon. No dryness, no breakout of skin, and not at all harsh to the skin. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and I recommended this product to my friends who have similar acne issues.</li>
            <li> this product is rubbish, a waste of money and a waste of anything else. it does not work. my husband kept lugging at me cos i would wake up after using this with painful acne. the $4.99 acne spot on cream from neutrogena works better. its effect is temporary but at least it works better than this nonsense</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and my skin is finally clearing up! My make up works well over it and it feels clean.</li>
            <li> I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  I love the way this product feels on the skin and how it doesn&#x27;t overdry.  It also has a nice smell.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. More natural than products like Pro-Active, Neutrogena, etc. and also WAY more effective. Instead of drying you out like most Benzoyl Peroxide treatments, this one does a really great job at moisturizing as well! I do not have severe acne. I just get a few pimples every now and then that are a pain in the butt to get rid of (the ones that seem to get worse over time, and not better). It is great to have this option - something that is effective, and not harsh on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect formula! Do not change it! And do not stop selling it!</li>
            <li> First thing...We are stationed in Japan and the shipping was fast...got here way before delivery date said.&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this product so far. It smells nice to me, and goes on no problem. Im using it as a spot treatment. I put some on my cystic acne last night and it has almost vanished. I hope this will be a good match for me along with drinking more water and having a almost clean diet. I think the Jobabo oil in it is a match for my skin...I have ordered the acne.org products to go along with this. Thank you Create Cosmetics...will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. I had mostly gotten my acne under control by a combination of avoiding all dairy and all peanuts/PB, along with BP 2.5% and BHA over the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then perimenopause came about a year ago, and wrecked my clockwork-regular cycle. Along with that came unpredictable hormonal surges causing hot flashes and new multi-cyst adult acne breakouts that my previous Acne DOT org regimen no longer controlled. Christ, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ll never be free of acne. And the 2.5% BP was no longer enough. But adding BHA or AHA just fried my skin because I have sensitive skin. I read the reviews of this and thought, what the hell have I got to lose? Plus it&#x27;s only 0.5% more BP than I&#x27;m already using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I&#x27;ve been using this about 6 weeks now, and this is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;(1) though flare-ups have occurred, they didn&#x27;t turn into full blown cysts/zits like they have all this past year, unless I picked my face -- and any that did cleared up quickly and didn&#x27;t scar if I didn&#x27;t mess with them&lt;br /&gt;(2) this is the ONLY BP I&#x27;ve ever been able to use twice a day nearly every day of the week along with BHA (salicylic acid) to improve/fade old scars&lt;br /&gt;(3) this doesn&#x27;t completely fry my skin into dryness and flakiness (let alone dry, cracked and oozing) like any other BP has when combined BHA or when used alone twice a day every day, probably because of the jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;(4) this is the only BP I have EVER been able to wear under foundation makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Create Cosmetics TTO 3% BP has given me a decent complexion back and almost (but not quite) the courage to wear no foundation. Since I have scars from the major perimenopausal breakouts of the last year, I still wear foundation. However, I&#x27;ve been able to downgrade the foundation coverage from one of those chalky &amp;#34;marathon wear&amp;#34; full coverage foundations to a somewhat sheerer, much less chalky foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wash with Cetaphil facial wash (or the generic equivalent, whichever is cheaper/on sale), occasionally adding a little baking soda to exfoliate/polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Create Cosmetic TTO 3% BP comes in a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. I probably use about 3 pumps on my face, and that&#x27;s enough to cover past my jawline and my ears (I sometimes get giant cysts in my ears, earlobes, behind the ear, etc.) and all the way up to the hairline. In 6 weeks, I think I&#x27;ve used 1/5 to 1/4 of the bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is that of a creamy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews say it smells really bad. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true. If you have ever smelled 100% pure Tea Tree Oil, this is so minor compared to that, it&#x27;s nothing. Also the odor dissipates really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting my face, though I have very sensitive skin. However, I had already been using TTO as a spot-treatment (not all over) for years, so perhaps my skin was already used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously think I&#x27;ll have to keep ordering this for the rest of my life -- or the rest of the life of my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some Dr. Song&#x27;s 2.5% BP at the same time as this. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with Dr. Song&#x27;s... it&#x27;s just that this works better, and doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, so I like it better. I use the Dr. Song&#x27;s on my shoulders/upper arms/upper back when needed, and reserve this for my face/neck.</li>
            <li> It Works!  So glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get acne frequently, but when I do it can be pretty annoying, so I was looking for something to use occasionally and a friend recommended I try this. Even though it&#x27;s not designed to be used for spot treatment, it&#x27;s been working well for me in that capacity, helping resolve the acne within a day or two. The cream has a really nice texture and absorbs into the skin quickly without feeling greasy, and due to the low benzoyl peroxide content also doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel super dry. At first I was disappointed it was such a small bottle, but given how nicely it spreads, you really don&#x27;t need that much for each use.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to my acne. I guess I fall into the 1% that this doesn&#x27;t work with. Or maybe because my skin doesn&#x27;t work with BP at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, seems to work well (been using it for almost a month), and smells good.</li>
            <li> I got this product back in early January 2014 and it is now April, so I have been using this product almost always two times a day for three months.Before I give my review, first a little about me: I&#x27;m 46 with combination skin that tans after one day of slight redness. I have not struggled with acne and did not have it bad as a teen and I have often, throughout my life been given compliments on my skin. But as I turned into my mid-40&#x27;s I began to get one or two painful pimples, that took ages to go away, could never be &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; without major pain/skin damage and when finally gone was leaving scars monthly. I decided it was time for a major upgrade to my up until then, lacking skin carely routine. I never took off my make-up at night, but always washed my face every morning with a good cleanser. I used moisterizer every morning, but very little sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;At the same time that I began using this product twice daily, I also began removing my make-up every night and moisterizing at night as well. I only use this product in my T-zone as that is the only place I normally get pimples. SO, I  know this was a long back story, but I want anyone who reads this review to understand where I started and where I am now. I did have some minor break-outs in the first couple weeks, but I kept on using it, like some other reviews have said. Since those first few weeks, using this product and my new skin care routine, I have had only ONE pimple (that was so small, it barely could be called a pimple, more a red bump). That&#x27;s it, ONE in two and a half months! It has not dried my skin like Clearasil did (dry patches around the pimple that would not go away!) , and I use it 2X a day, but again, I only use it in my T-zone. I cannot say that this product will work for everyone, but I am thrilled that I am not getting acne anymore. I hope Create Cosmetics add more products.&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I am trying home microderm abrasion once or twice weekly to work on the scarring and it seems tobe working slowly.</li>
            <li> Our teenage daughter&#x27;s skin is irritated by the 10% solution.  After reading numerous reviews for different products, we decided to test this one out.  The difference has been spectacular.  While she only has mild to moderate acne, with this product not only has her skin cleared up beautifully, it has taken on a really nice healthy-looking glow.  She started as instructed, and moved to twice-a-day use over the first week.  Because she still has some sun sensitivity even with the reduced level of peroxide, she has been combining this product with an SPF 15 moisturizer during the day.  While the 15 helps, it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate irritation from sun exposure, so she&#x27;s going to try an SPF 30 to see if that works better.  All in all, however, my daughter couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice if you have combination skin.  I have had acne for years and am now in my 30&#x27;s and thus has a moisturizing effect while using powerful anti acne ingredients.  I love the combo of tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide.  This is a perfect combo for me and has replaced the need for an additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I have acne. It&#x27;s been a good 5 years since the last time that happened.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 29 year old female and have moderate acne.  I&#x27;ve tried 10+ different products which all improved my acne but didn&#x27;t eliminate it. I bought this product because I liked the ingredients and the reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;The first week, my acne got worse but I know that happens sometimes as your pores clear so I continued using it. After two weeks, no acne!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my routine: (in case it helps anyone) I use a salcylic acid cleanser in the morning followed by a makeup primer/moisturizer made by Napoleon followed by studio makeup when im not too lazy to put on makeup. also used to use Almay medicated consealer. At bedtime, I use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and the create cosmetics cream. I used to do the same routine with a different benzoyl peroxide cream at nighte and since I switched to this one, I&#x27;m amazed at the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It cleared up my acne completely and it&#x27;s moisturizing too! My face feels great.</li>
            <li> Proactive works, but it seems needlessly complicated, and with time it worked less and less. I&#x27;ve been shopping around for different products, and this one is among my favorites - it&#x27;s more effective than proactive and only one product! I wish it was a bit less costly though so one star off. I&#x27;d also suggest trying to eat more omega 3 to get rid of your acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream daily for a week for mild acne on my chest and back. It has cleared or started to shrink most of the spots and the inflammation has reduced, where the &amp;#34;visibly clear&amp;#34; wash I was using before didn&#x27;t have much effect. My sister also applied some to a spot and 2 days later there is no sign of it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this for preventing acne in places where it reoccurs frequently... and it works!  My acne is mild when I have it at all, but the sides of my nose do get blackheads and acne.  This product doesn&#x27;t clear the blackheads but it does prevent zits and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I get occasional spots, and was looking for something to work as a spot-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The cream works great as a spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  It can be used as a preventive treatment as it&#x27;s not overly irritating&lt;br /&gt;  The cream is immediately invisible on the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;re sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide or Tea Tree Oil it might not be for you.  It seems like the oil makes the cream more efficient than traditional acne treatments.  I tolerate both Benzoyl Peroxide and Tea Tree Oil, so I had no issues with sensitivity.  I&#x27;m not sure oil-based lotions are better for everyone, but it worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s teenage son who has been battling acne for a couple of years now especially on his forehead.  His mom had him on harsh--and expensive--prescription meds that left his skin irritated and peeling.  We much prefer natural remedies, whenever possible and appropriate, and I decided to try this based on the reviews.  This stuff works!  He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now, and his skin is so much clearer now.  He hasn&#x27;t experienced any irritation in using it, either.  I can&#x27;t say how this would work on severe acne, but for his moderate acne, it&#x27;s a resounding success. I would highly recommend it based on our experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out frequently, but when I undergo periods of particularly high stress, I do break out, and my acne can be very stubborn. Historically, the best treatment I could find was a generic brand \\&quot;Maximum Strength Benzoyl Peroxide Gel,\\&quot; which says it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide (as the active ingredient). This cream I had been using, which smells really... unsettling... would typically take weeks to work (and I suspect my acne just went away on its own, as my stress levels receded), and left my skin looking and feeling oily in the short-term, and dry in the long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I decided to give Create Cosmetics BPT3.1 a try, because though it has 3% benzoyl peroxide (a much lower concentration than that of the cream I had been using previously), it has had a profound effect on my skin as a preventive treatment, in contrast to the ineffective spot-treatments I was performing with the generic 10%. It rubs into the skin completely, leaving no shine or oily feeling. Unlike my generic, the cream has a very nice, but not strong or overwhelming smell (because of the tea tree oil, I presume). I was worried at first, because the cream was not coming out of the pump, but it turns out there was just air in the straw, so after priming the pump (squirting air a few times), the BPT 3.1 cream started to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I will continue to explore the Create Cosmetics product line!</li>
            <li> very impressed with how well this dries up my oily skin! I put it on every night before bed and I wake up with clean and dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;I always have such a problem with oily skin on my face and this saves me from having to wash my face a bunch throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, as it has helped control my acne. I&#x27;ve tried using it in conjunction with bar soap, first stripping my skin from oils then applying the oil-based lotion, and that works great at eliminating acne and actually makes my skin less oily. It&#x27;s less drying than other benzoyl peroxide containing products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late 20&#x27;s, male never had super bad acne by any means, but always had a little bit every few days or week or two. You can read a million things online/I&#x27;ve tried a number of different acne prevention techniques: first is what works great for me now that i would recommend, then ill list the other stuff that hasnt worked:&lt;br /&gt;1) dont use bath towel on face&lt;br /&gt;2) wash face morning and/or night with whatever acne face wash (i use one that has the course rough particles, pretty much buy whats on sale)&lt;br /&gt;3) use moisturizer on your face once or twice a day (seems important now/i never used to do this. really makes my face look/feel better even though i absolutely hate putting it on)&lt;br /&gt;4) use this stuff on nose/creases on your face or wherever you would historically get acne and actual spot acne (i rarely even get that anymore after using these steps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems expensive but it will last a really long time and just works so well, totally worth it to me without question. Also i like the smell of it better than other stuff. Sure some different things will work for different people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all the other things ive tried that didnt work nearly as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) just use whatever of the name brand face acne washes: theyre all basically the same just different brands. I&#x27;d still get acne&lt;br /&gt;2) Random brands spot acne medications combined with 1) above - not as effective as id have liked, end result is id still have acne more than i wanted&lt;br /&gt;3) proactive: expensive, worked great, too much of a pain to do all 3 steps with all the bottles every night with cotton balls and everything, I ended up just being too lazy and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;4) face wipe alcohol pad things: would end up never using/would rather wash my face fully. Didnt really prevent or heal acne very well. Even tried prescription ones i got from a friend but didnt really do much and would totally dry my face out</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I really think it is working.  I get painful cystic acne deep under the skin that I frequently agitate until they form scabs. This week I can feel the sore spots where the cysts would normally form but none have come close to becoming bumps big enough to bother me and are gone within a day or 2. I am very optimistic this is a real solution.</li>
            <li> great! cleared up my acne within a week. dries my skin out a little bit, so I make sure to put on a good moisturizing SPF after.</li>
            <li> My son uses this with &amp;#34;Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Wash with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;. These to products work better than anything the dermatologists has prescribed. Clears his skin without irritation. He has used Retin A (skin was constantly irritated to get results). Epiduo (very expensive and minimal results). A couple different prescription face washes, and prescription antibiotics (causing stomach upset). Nothing he used worked as well without side effects as our purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle has made such a good improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 4 weeks now and I can honestly say it&#x27;s helped tremendously. It also left my skin unexpectedly super soft!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne solutions and am quite pleased with this product. I wanted to get away from my dermatologist-prescribed acne cream due to all of the chemicals. I tried several other products, but found them ineffective. I finally came across this and was very pleased. No dangerous ingredients and the cream actually works! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely helps me not break out as much. After getting an IUD inserted I started to get bad breakouts. I had to use this everyday for 3 months to keep my face somewhat normal. It helped a lot, though I still did break out some. Now I can just use it for the occasional breakouts. The little bottle lasts a surprising amount of time too!</li>
            <li> I never got acne until my mid-20s -- bumpy forehead &amp; zits that would last for 7-10 days. I tried various brands of salicylic acid &amp; benzoyl peroxide, and even La Roche products but nothing worked. Within 2 days of using this product, I had the same amount of acne but my skin looked healthier. After 1 week, my forehead was visibly smoother. After 2 weeks, my acne had been reduced by 60-70%. I still get acne but it clears up MUCH faster &amp; my forehead has remained acne free. I have somewhat sensitive skin but my never experienced excessive drying.</li>
            <li> Love the benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil combination.  Has really helped clear up acne, even cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I really like this product since it is effective without being over harsh!</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading many reviews on this item but he never worked for me, I wanted to work for me as I saw that it worked for many people but eventually I had to throw it away because it did nothing :(</li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne and some hormonal acne.  While I still get a bump or two, this product minimizes the outbreak and soothes the skin.  I have used it on a rash as well and it really calmed the itching and lessened the severity of the rash.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out really really badly with cystic acne that came OUT OF THE BLUE!!! I&#x27;ve never had horrible acne before. Just one or two around my menstrual time. Possibilities could be: in frequent exercise as much as I did before, hormone changes, new job position stress, or age. I did so much research and felt like I became an EXPERT at acne. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t believe the problem. Changing my diet didn&#x27;t really help. I started taking fish oil for the hell of it and my face started clearing up. Then I spent over $600 at Sephora changing my make up and skin care to more natural mineral based ingredients.  This moisturizer HELPED A LOT. I don&#x27;t think it cured it, but it HELPS PREVENT IT now. I don&#x27;t break out anymore. Literally, ZERO ACNE. EVEN AROUND MY PERIOD TIME I GET NONE! I take fish oil, evening primrose, vitex, and (occasionally) Milk thistle and papaya extract. I use this WONDERFUL moisturizer to prevent future acne along with a cleanser from Murad. I even stocked up with Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil to use as a toner (don&#x27;t forget to dilute it) to massage it in before massaging Create&#x27;s moisturizer in. Twice a day was a little too much for my skin because it started drying it out. I stuck to using it at night-time only and added an oil-free hydrating serum on my face. Day time: An oil-free natural sunscreen that is also used as a primer.  It took about 3 months for my acne to clear up completely. I&#x27;m sure it would&#x27;ve cleared up FASTER if I discovered this product sooner. I was stupid in thinking it would clear up on it&#x27;s own... but after month 2 I started researching like a crazy person and found this gem.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. My girlfriend (same age) had the same problem OUT OF THE BLUE and hers cleared up within a month after she changed her makeup and skin care (for acne prone skin) because she saw the hell I went through with my face. Some of my girlfriends went to a doctor and they prescribed birth control... and I was not willing to take that route. Hope this help for others... everyone is different and might need to change other things or use other products to help with the situation, but this one is working for me.  I hope this moisturizer is available consistently because the last time I checked, it wasn&#x27;t here and I&#x27;d rather buy stuff through Amazon than deal with individual companies direct and re-enter my credit card.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product. I loved the way it felt on my skin. My acne is very hard to keep under control (even with a diet trying to help keep it under control). At first I thought it would be ok with my skin type, but unfortunately after 3 weeks of use my acne is worse. It has given me small little painful acne bumps. So bummed I really, really wanted this to work. Trying skin by Pom products now to see if those will work. I did notice that it seemed to help some of my acne scars heal faster, if only it hadn&#x27;t created more. I think this may be a great product, unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type. I have been a proactive user for over 10 years and trying to convert to a more natural product.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately did nothing for my son but make his acne much worse.  We gave it 3 weeks but it never got better.  We were really hoping it would work.  Seems too grease for acne type skin.  We have found that the light therapy and a drying agent is the best bet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for over 10 years, previously I&#x27;ve tried various oral antibiotics, Differin, other benzoyl peroxide creams like zapzyt and epiduo, even accutane (horrible side effects). This is the first oil based lotion I&#x27;ve tried, I was a bit concerned at first about that, but it seems to work great! Moisturizes the skin better than other benzoyl peroxide containing treatments I&#x27;ve tried and seems more effective. Bravo!</li>
            <li> I have never been allergic to a thing in my life, but my face had a horrible reaction to this product.  My face turned all red and swelled up and it was really hot and itchy.  I returned the product.  I would give 1 star for the product but I added a couple because of the ease of returning it.</li>
            <li> Burns a bit and turns your face red for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Some people may love this product. It just didn&#x27;t do well for my skin.</li>
            <li> purchased this April 2014. Noticed difference with a few days! Helped kill 99.9% of the zit-causing bacterias on my back! watchout because if you apply this and you go to workout and your body gets hot and sweats, it will bleach your clothes but only on the surface it touches not all the way through. (and yes, apply this before you workout to prevent any pores getting clogged by germs) What worked for me was to scrub my back daily (don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub hard cuz you&#x27;re getting all the dead pore-clogging skin cells out! dont worry it will NOT make it worse..it will get inflamed right after you scrub but it will go down within an hour. the next day after you applied the cream to sit overnight, you will feel and see a difference!) i scrub with any srubbing bath towels or gloves with a tea tree soap(i use Dr Bronners! in my opinion, the best for acne prone skin as it is antibacterial and no weird additives) i pat dry with my towel (i use a different towel, now, for my hair and body!) apply this product and done! after it helped to get rid of all the acne, i now maintain with pure organic tea tree oil instead ! :))) ahhh! amazing results! i can&#x27;t believe i no longer have backne!!!!!! it has always been my biggest insecurity and now it is gone! it only took about 2.5 months until it completely disappeared! and I&#x27;ve had it for over 5 years! I still get bumps here and there but only 1 teeny tiny one at a time and not 30 at a time YUCK! i know lol but im just so happy that this is possible!! ooh and i should mention that I was vegetarian at the time consuming dairy and eggs still and now vegan and it seems to have just made my overall skin so much smoother and clear! but im sure if you at least reduce your animal protein intake and drink green smoothies a few times a week that you will definitely see similar results! But i am certain that my milk and egg consumption had a lot to do with it. I hope you find what works for you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to for this product!  Ordered it for my husband who has been struggling with adult acne for years.  Often large, painful, swollen, cyst-like pimples.  It has been very frustrating for him!  He also works in an industrial setting with a lot of heat, smoke, and dirt...which seemed to irritate his skin even more!  I&#x27;ve been trying to research and find him the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; and this one has been the absolute best by far!!!  Within 2 days of using it you could see a noticeable difference--no new breakouts and reduced redness and inflammation of the breakout he had currently been experiencing.  It only has improved from there--his skin is the clearest I&#x27;ve ever seen it!! He&#x27;s been using it for probably 3-4 weeks now, with barely a lone pimple here and there.  Not only that, but the product has not been overly harsh--a problem he has had with many other products (proactiv to name one).  He would often use a strong product for acne which would be majorly over drying! His skin is not breaking out--nor is it peeling from harsh chemical acne treatment.  I would seriously recommend trying this stuff if you&#x27;ve been having similar issues!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work - smells good and isn&#x27;t greasy  Update:  I used this for about 6 months and it seemed to work, the smell is fine, it isn&#x27;t greasy and has an easy pump which I liked.  But randomly my skin decided it didn&#x27;t like it. My face turns red for an hour and it BURNS  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but my skin definitely doesn&#x27;t like this stuff</li>
            <li> This is the first benzoyl peroxide product I&#x27;ve tried.  Previously I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to do much. This also moisturizes my skin more and I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain artificial fragrance. Bottle looks high end, but label needs to be improved because it gets dirty easily.  Product is a little bit costly, but def worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop buying this product. It has done wonders for my blemishes. I used to have them all over my jaw line, forehead, cheeks and now I get a few with hormonal changes around the time of the month. Does the trick with pimples while not drying you out. My skin has actually gotten less oily. I use it on my chest and back when I get small break outs in those areas too along with an apple cider vinager astringent before hand. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I have had sensitive acne prone skin since puberty and have to be very careful with every product I use. This oil feels great on my skin and it works to prevent and treat acne. So often you hear about tea tree oil being good for acne treatment and prevention, yet some people try to apply it topically without diluting it which is too extreme for skincare. This blend is great for sensitive skin and any skin type as it has jojoba for one of the main carrier oils. It is great for the overall anti-inflammatory effects. I appreciate the short list of recognizable ingredients and that it is free of harmful fragrances, sulfates, parabens, phthalates. There are too many affordable high quality skin care products on the market today such as this one to settle for products that still contain those known to be harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Added this to a daily routine: washed, applied this product, then moisturizer morning and night. After the first 3 weeks there was noticeable improvement on some of the deeper acne. Although it has kept some of that at bay, there hasn&#x27;t been any more improvement since the third week (been using it for a total of 6 weeks now) and I will try something else.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily skin so finding one that won&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and actually moisturizes is a huge hassle. This product caught my attention because of the ingredients it contains I have mild adult acne, a few pimples here and there. I can safely say this product has been working for me. I cannot attest to severe acne, but this has been working to remediate mild breakouts within 36 hours. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in our home. I have been using it and my teenage son has been tolerating it; he hates anything &#x27;smelly&#x27;. All acne medication is smelly! I have such sensitive skin and so far I am not having any adverse reactions to this product. My skin feels good and the bumps are almost gone. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne the past couple of years and I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that gives me the right balance.  I&#x27;m 38 so I&#x27;ve found that the teenage acne products are too harsh for my skin now and that I really have more t-zone and combination skin problems.  I had a really nice tea tree oil product that I was using and it was discontinued.  Then I tried the Body Shop tea tree oil products but they didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  So I started a search on Amazon.  I found this product and thought that with the moisturizers, it may just have the right balance for me.  I also switched up my toner to a naruko tea tree oil product and I also really like using that with this product.  I think they are both controling the oil and preventing break outs without overly drying my skin out.  I hope that I am able to continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I still great breakouts and this works better than products with larger amounts of medication.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it&#x27;s a great product for even the most sensitive skin.  It lasts about a month and a half to two months and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s more natural and less chemically.  But, I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and can&#x27;t say that I see any difference in my skin/acne.</li>
            <li> My 13 yo son who started to break out just this year has tried Proactive (the system) but that did not seem to help so I looked for other alternative. Saw this here at Amazon and with its good reviews, ordered one. This one has a not so pleasant smell, like a medicinal smell but I tried to apply it to my son&#x27;s face whenever I can. (My son won&#x27;t do it if I entrust everything to him). I saw results really after a month of almost daily application. I think what also helped in my son&#x27;s case is the X-out cleanser from proactive. He use that in conjunction with this product. Now his face is clear again. I like it that this is not messy to apply. It has a cream like consistency. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell. I like it for the result but not the application part.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, this product is fabulous.  I am in my late forties and about once a month I still get what I believe are hormonal, deep, painful pimples-just a few, but that&#x27;s a few too many.  I used to use Proactive but have become allergic to it this year. I get dry and itchy skin even when I use their new sensitive formula. Within 48 hours of using this product my few hurting bumps had reduced inflammation and decreased redness.  I had prior tried tea tree oil diluted in jojoba oil without success.  This lotion must have a perfect blended combination of ingredients which hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin at all and I&#x27;ve used it for two days in a row, morning and evening.  I have never written a review before and all I can say is WOW-TRY IT!</li>
            <li> While it smells nice and looks like it reduces some swelling on certain areas, if used too much it dries out my skin and the acne does not go away. Even using a moisturizer doesn&#x27;t help. Might work for some, but did not work for me</li>
            <li> Most efficient acne cream I have tried, spots dries out fast and the cream does not discolor my clothes. The added moisturization is also nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50-y.o. black man with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been dealing with skin issues my entire life.  25 years ago I began shaving my head, and for the last few years I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne on the back of my scalp, along the hairline.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products over the years, including the entire Dermalogica and Clinique systems, among others.  Nothing ever worked for any amount of time.  That is, until I tried this tea tree oil and benzoyl peroxide cream from Create Cosmetics.  This stuff works!  What else can I say?  It not miraculous, meaning it&#x27;s not like there is absolutely no trace of bumps now, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close.  I use it on both my scalp and my face.  I only wish they made other products - cleansers, lotions, etc.  If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;ve tried other stuff that hasn&#x27;t worked, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I used it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin....and is now starting have &#x27;break-outs&#x27;. I found this to be much gentler on her fair skin while still taking care of the problem...it actually cleared up one of her blemishes overnight! And no harmful redness or drying occurred. Not sure how they developed a product that actually clears up acne while working more like a moisturizer. We will definitely purchase more as she goes through her teen years. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This product really works... I&#x27;ve been using for less than 2 weeks &amp; have seen major improvement. I wish I had before and after photos. When I started you could play connect the dots w/ my pimples. I had almost 6 in a row. &amp; now 1</li>
