            <li> This works great on my hair.  I have extremely thick long hair.  I&#x27;ve been charged extra by hairdressers due to my thick hair.  I didn&#x27;t know certain hairdressers had thin and thick scales to charge by but this one did in Rhode Island.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is absolutely fantastic for tangles.  I went to a different hairdresser that used this on my hair and I looked it up on amazon and bought it.</li>
            <li> My go to leave-in conditioner! Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this line of conditioners. I usually use one from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply which is good but this is far better. It leaves my hair silky. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Stinks and does nothing for my hair....</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected. I wanted the Earthly Body Argon &amp; hemp oil. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME! Smells like AMAZINGNESS and makes my fianc√©s hair feel and look like that of a Greek GODDESS !!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair silky and smooth. Love the smell as well, reminds me of incense</li>
            <li> No tangles, and I like the smell.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving.  The picture denotes the original Marrakesh OIL, which i wasnted.  Instead I received the leave in treatment.  WATCH the fine print and misleading pictures!!</li>
            <li> Like Hemp &amp; Argan Oils to put on my hair as a detangler and helps my hair from frizzing. The reason I only gave it 3 Stars is because it so difficult to spray on my hair and I get frustrated and end up pouring some in my hand and running it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t live without it. The smell is  wonderful. It detangler and makes my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It makes my hair soft and totally manageable. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other marrakesh oils, this looks like a lotion in the spray bottle but it works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> smells great and smoothes out my hair.  my hair is average, washed and conditioned daily.  i use this product daily.  also blow dry hair daily, length of hair is to middle of back.  works well on detangling.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!! My hairdresser used it on me and I just had to have it! I have very short hair so I just use it to keep my hair styled. I don&#x27;t have any damage to my hair so I can&#x27;t tell you if it helps with that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair would be a giant frizzball without it.</li>
            <li> Picture was not what I received. I paid more because the old formula bottle was pictured and it smells better but got the new formula. I could have paid less!!!</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!</li>
