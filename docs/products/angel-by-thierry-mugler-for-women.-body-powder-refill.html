            <li>What a wonderful way to start the day or evening especially!!</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I always receive compliments (from men and women) and it has a light shimmer that puts me in a festive, diva girl mood - my ANGEL powder ROCKS!</li>

            <li>If you like powder choose this for the iconic whiff of angel.  </li>
            <li>however I know many who like this .</li>
            <li>my favorite scent, but there was no product to transfer the powder from the container to the powder brush.  </li>
            <li>But it is still my favorite</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, and I try to get a deal on it any time I can.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy this at Nordstrom&#x27;s any more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ANGEL PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find something to put this in to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance but the sparkly effect all over the place</li>
            <li>I love Angel perfume and the body powder....</li>
            <li>Made the mistake in ordering, thought I was ordering body cream, but I love the prowder, use it every day.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel very Special</li>
            <li>smells good, for very picky person like,</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Thierry Mugler and all things Angel.....</li>
            <li>The ANGEL powder scent is light and airy BUT demands attention.</li>
            <li>but scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely, fresh smell; not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the description that it was a refill, so I won&#x27;t be able to sprinkle it on like normal powders.</li>
            <li>Originally saw/smelled this product on a lady at a funeral and asked what it was.</li>
            <li>The scent of the actual liquid perfume is too powerful for me, but this powder has a very nice light scent...</li>
            <li>I get many positive comments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love everything they make, but this did not have much fragrance and the shimmer (or glitter) that they put in it</li>
            <li>It is a nice body powder with a soft scent which is enhanced with the use of the body cream and the perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful light fragrance that makes me feel so complete after my intial shower and makeup is applied.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Got here super quick.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really smell like Angel!!</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Love the scent of the product and will be back for me when I need to!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH..</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>is just too much</li>
            <li>ONCE IN AWHILE, YOU FIND SOMETHING you cant live without!  </li>
            <li>I had an empty container that previously held body butter - wash and dried, and i am using that with a pink powder puff that I recently purchadsed from amazon (perfect fit) - love</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This powder has very fine glittering particles, but they are so small and blends in the skin so well that they are almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  </li>
            <li>It was new and in an unopened box.</li>
            <li>Cannot buy this body powder in Europe, I live in France.  </li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>I have the original container that my Angel powder came it, and this was a refill that was half the price I would have given for a new container.  </li>
            <li>The powder is something that one would definately apply after parfume to add to the beauty of this fragrance and to complete the final touch, plus the sparkles just enhance the whole experience.</li>
            <li>Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li>Completely refilled my jar.</li>
            <li>Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
            <li>I emptied the refill box into another pretty, glass &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; container I had saved from a previous purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, and after using a few of the parfumes in the past as my favorites, I now use nothing else but \\&quot;Angel\\&quot;.</li>

            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is my fragrance!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!  Just be careful powdering yourself when wearing dark thin material.  It sparkles!  Haha!</li>
            <li> I want to share with all of you the satisfaction of wearing Angel Parfumes is so angelic. It&#x27;s such a beautiful light fragrance that makes me feel so complete after my intial shower and makeup is applied. It lasts and others that come into contact with me always ask me what fragrance that I&#x27;m wearing. I have received comments that , \\&quot;that smells so heavenly\\&quot;, or that fragrance is beautiful. I just love it, and after using a few of the parfumes in the past as my favorites, I now use nothing else but \\&quot;Angel\\&quot;. The powder is something that one would definately apply after parfume to add to the beauty of this fragrance and to complete the final touch, plus the sparkles just enhance the whole experience. What a wonderful way to start the day or evening especially!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li> I ove Angel and I loves this powder. It was a great price. It came on time. It was new and in an unopened box.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Angel.  Cannot buy this body powder in Europe, I live in France.  I used to be able to get it in London at Christmas time.  I am glad I can still get it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used Angel for 7-8.years now. I use it all!&lt;br /&gt; deodorant , power, shower gel,  perfume oil spray (lov),  and my ANGEL PERFUME!&lt;br /&gt;  I LOVE IT SO MUCH..I DONT LIKE TRYING ANYTHING BUT..THE ORIGINAL! ! ANGEL MAKES ME FEEL.SPECIAL. . IT IS EXPENSIVE...FOR SOMEONE  LIKE ME....WHO CONSERVATIVE...BUT....EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE, YOU FIND SOMETHING you cant live without!  Please please. ..NEVER TAKE.MY.ANGEL AWAY!  I know ..this review is.more about all the angel products, then just the powder..but ...JUST SAYING...LOL</li>
            <li> smells good, for very picky person like, i am.&lt;br /&gt;also has little sparkles, very little. you don&#x27;t notice the sparkles, unless your in the sun or lite.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased the ANGEL perfume and lotion set as a birthday gift (good job Sweetheart). I thoroughly loved the set but wanted the powder also. I wear it 2 - 3 times a week although I have several fragrance sets (confessed perfume-holic). The ANGEL powder scent is light and airy BUT demands attention. I always receive compliments (from men and women) and it has a light shimmer that puts me in a festive, diva girl mood - my ANGEL powder ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This powder lasts longer than any I have ever used before.  You smell it all day and you will get compliments.</li>
            <li> somewhat glittery . . awesome fragrance! Goes on so silky - a great addition to your Angel collection. Layering of your fragrances assists in helping it last all day</li>
            <li> I like the product but need to know if there is some kind of dispenser to order that it can be put into.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the ease of purchase is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the sparkle it gives you when applied.  The fragrance is wonderful as well.  I can&#x27;t stop purchasing this line.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it - and great service</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Reasonable price. Color was a little off but scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer in this product! But it doesn&#x27;t really smell like Angel!!</li>
            <li> If you like powder choose this for the iconic whiff of angel.  I don&#x27;t use powder however I know many who like this . It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent, but there was no product to transfer the powder from the container to the powder brush.  But it is still my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this powder! The scent of the actual liquid perfume is too powerful for me, but this powder has a very nice light scent...its the same scent just lighter.  It has a nice sparkle too, no too glittery.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is Angel powder. Got here super quick. Completely refilled my jar. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have the original container that my Angel powder came it, and this was a refill that was half the price I would have given for a new container.  I love this fragrance, and I try to get a deal on it any time I can.  It is my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel very Special</li>
            <li> What a beautiful fragrance.  Have been using for past 3 years but first time purchasing on Amazon.  This powder has very fine glittering particles, but they are so small and blends in the skin so well that they are almost unnoticeable.  I had an empty container that previously held body butter - wash and dried, and i am using that with a pink powder puff that I recently purchadsed from amazon (perfect fit) - love that powder - I think one must use a powder puff to experience that long lasting fragrance on body.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy this at Nordstrom&#x27;s any more. All I can get is a very expensive powder with a pretty container. I already have the container, and didn&#x27;t want to pay for another. Just wanted the powder. Also good for travel. Very happy to find this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ANGEL PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I love everything they make, but this did not have much fragrance and the shimmer (or glitter) that they put in it transferred from my hands to my eyes.  I had to use eye drops to try to remove the miniscule particulates, so wish they gave you a choice to purchase without the shimmer.  Very expensive mistake!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is a nice body powder with a soft scent which is enhanced with the use of the body cream and the perfume. The subtle sparkling glitter makes me feel very feminine. I get many positive comments about the fragrance. The Amazon price is very good.</li>
            <li> I love it when people ask me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing. The smell is fresh and sweet. I love this powder. So soft!</li>
            <li> love it and the price was great ty and i will order again soon I will be needing a powder puff and</li>
            <li> Ok, so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the description that it was a refill, so I won&#x27;t be able to sprinkle it on like normal powders. I&#x27;ll have to find something to put this in to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Thierry Mugler and all things Angel.....the smell of this powder will not disappoint ...I like to layer my fragrance by using the shower gel..then the lotion or cream...then powder....the combination smells AMAZING.....HOWEVER....I have to take off a point for the glittery stuff in the powder.....love the fragrance but the sparkly effect all over the place is just too much...gets on your clothes and if you don&#x27;t&#x27; shower before bed...you awaken to glittery sheets as well....I still use mine...but unless I&#x27;m going out dancing....I can&#x27;t use it on my neck or arms</li>
            <li> I love Angel perfume and the body powder....but I hate paying their prices :)  The body powder refill is a great price and  my order was delivered promptly.  Great product great value.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product---love it! Great transaction.Love the scent of the product and will be back for me when I need to!</li>
            <li> Originally saw/smelled this product on a lady at a funeral and asked what it was. Bought this to see how it was before investing in the perfume. It is a lovely, fresh smell; not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I misunderstand what was this product, and I bought the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear anything &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; by Thierry Mugler, Perfume, hand cream, deodorant....you name it....it smells wonderful !!</li>
            <li> Made the mistake in ordering, thought I was ordering body cream, but I love the prowder, use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  It provides a very pretty sparkle to the skin, the powder is silky and beautifully scented.  I liked the value of the refill.  I emptied the refill box into another pretty, glass &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; container I had saved from a previous purchase.  I apply the powder to my body with a cosmetic brush.  It works.</li>
            <li> One word.......Awesome!</li>
