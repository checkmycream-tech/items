            <li> This body cream is thick and gloppy and, while the fragrance is delightful initially, it does not have much staying power.  Also, it did not really keep my skin noticeably soft throughout the day.  And I expected it to as the majority of other reviews were quite complementary.</li>

            <li> This is the best body butter I have ever used.  I ordered 3 additional jars.  First, it is made in USA, which is part of my criteria.  Supporting Made in USA products is of utmost importance to our economy and country.  But, it moisturizers better than anything I have ever tried.
