    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect price and the nail polish is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very happy to have found this product!  </li>
            <li>This color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>Absolutely a beautiful color.  </li>
            <li>Great Product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying but not the best look but love the color.</li>
            <li>Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  </li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>This color looks great with my warm toned, fair skin.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out</li>
            <li>Love that I can save money on a manicure by doing my nails at home!  </li>
            <li>but this is a nice shimmery pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks good with the glitter coat on top also.  </li>
            <li>Strawberry Smoothie is not what I would pick for a color by itself, but a good color for layering CND polish to create a unique color.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but it had a lot of lint in it as I applied it.</li>
            <li>It is a perfectly feminine sheer color that is not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I purchased a light and began doing my own nails with shellac.  </li>
            <li>Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to keep polish on.  </li>
            <li>I have no pets in my home and my home is very clean.</li>
            <li>It stays on good and has a pretty shine, but just too light.</li>
            <li>It came on time and was an accurate color match.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be a good natural look.</li>
            <li>Great for new to DIY gel nails because the color is very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, it stays stick untill you are finished and clean your nails with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day.</li>
            <li>Product is as described and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I loved it nice pretty shiny pink subtle - great color to use first time..</li>
            <li>This color is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>This just isn&#x27;t the right color for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I&#x27;ll use it, just not as much in love with it as I am the other one I got!</li>
            <li>Love the CND line, this color however, was more pale than I like.  </li>
            <li>On many others, it will easily last 2 + weeks</li>
            <li>This is my first CND shellac purchase and after hours of deliberating on colors and trying to see pictures of colors I took the leap and chose this one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted to for a first timer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this color!</li>
            <li>I love CND polishes and this color is a very pretty pale pink, a nice neutral color.</li>
            <li>I bought it to go on top of other colors.</li>
            <li>I like CND Gel polish better than other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Now on the prowl for another slightly bolder color:)</li>
            <li>Light pink in color, works well for summer polish.</li>
            <li>and it was advertised new.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased a complete at home Gel system and this color was the first one I tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other CND polishes from other vendors and they were thick and unusable, but this product was perfect.  </li>
            <li>this was the natural sprinkling color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Think it was old as well.</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments on the color so far.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and just a lovely shade of pink perfect for the additives base color!!</li>
            <li>Trying to find just the right pink and this wasn&#x27;t it, but</li>
            <li>The bottle shows a rich, opaque, dusty rose and even with two coats it finishes to a pale pink that is quite sheer or see-through.</li>

            <li> What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  </li>
            <li> It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> Once I get the system down I will start using the bolder colors that won&#x27;t be as forgiving.</li>
            <li> my mistakes went unnoticed.</li>
            <li> but I had a lot of trouble getting this color not to show variations with my brush strokes.  </li>
            <li> so I am tough on my hands.  </li>

            <li> I love CND polishes and this color is a very pretty pale pink, a nice neutral color. Lasts long too</li>
            <li> Absolutely a beautiful color.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.  I was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out and it was as described.</li>

            <li> Light pink in color, works well for summer polish. Looks good.</li>
            <li> this was the natural sprinkling color I was looking for. It took me a couple of trials to find it but I eventually got it</li>
            <li> A pretty pale shade of pink that is usable, but not what I had hoped for. The bottle color does not accurarely represent the finished color. The bottle shows a rich, opaque, dusty rose and even with two coats it finishes to a pale pink that is quite sheer or see-through. Trying to find just the right pink and this wasn&#x27;t it, but it&#x27;ll be a good natural look.</li>
            <li> Perfect price and the nail polish is perfect.  I&#x27;ve purchased other CND polishes from other vendors and they were thick and unusable, but this product was perfect.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it had a lot of lint in it as I applied it. I have no pets in my home and my home is very clean. I think it was used and it was advertised new. Will buy polishes at local stores now instead of online. And it was also like tar. Think it was old as well.</li>
            <li> Strawberry Smoothie is not what I would pick for a color by itself, but a good color for layering CND polish to create a unique color.</li>
            <li> Bought this color because I saw it used in a number of different layering images with other colors.  I haven&#x27;t yet done any layering but this is a nice shimmery pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a UV cured &#x27;gel&#x27; polish.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic &#x27;off brand&#x27; gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit &amp; do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day. What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.  On many others, it will easily last 2 + weeks</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just a lovely shade of pink perfect for the additives base color!!</li>
            <li> This is my first CND shellac purchase and after hours of deliberating on colors and trying to see pictures of colors I took the leap and chose this one.  Its very sheer and I applied 2 coats and still you can see a bit of the white of my nail at the end but the color is understated and a bit shimmery.  Exactly what I wanted to for a first timer.  Great for new to DIY gel nails because the color is very forgiving.  Lots of compliments on the color so far.  Now on the prowl for another slightly bolder color:)</li>
            <li> This just isn&#x27;t the right color for me. I thought it would be darker. It stays on good and has a pretty shine, but just too light.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and came quickly.  It is a pearly color which I was looking for.  I bought it to go on top of other colors.</li>
            <li> I like CND Gel polish better than other kinds I&#x27;ve tried. I really like this color!</li>
            <li> It came on time and was an accurate color match.</li>
            <li> This color looks great with my warm toned, fair skin. It is a perfectly feminine sheer color that is not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll repurchase!</li>

            <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and I have never been able to keep polish on.  This works.  Just remember, it stays stick untill you are finished and clean your nails with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found this product!  Love that I can save money on a manicure by doing my nails at home!  This color is beautiful!</li>

            <li> It maybe my inexperience but I had a lot of trouble getting this color not to show variations with my brush strokes.  I&#x27;ll keep trying but not the best look but love the color.</li>
