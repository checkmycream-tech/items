            <li>and they make my nails look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>the perfect shade i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the color</li>
            <li>These arent a good product...</li>
            <li>Put them on right before an event or before you go out for the best look.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be able to find another use for these but would not recommend them to anyone looking for those &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; nails!</li>
            <li>The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Once on they look amazing</li>
            <li>For $1.30 I must say I was thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>as soon as you put them on they are literally coming right off!!!</li>
            <li>I kind of thought there were more cons</li>
            <li>It fits very well and it looks great on my nails.</li>
            <li>I am overall very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li>Ammm it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I did apply this to acrylic nails and it did not stay on for more than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>She watched many videos before applying them for me.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering more for myself and mom and sister.  </li>
            <li>I got them because silver is my favorite color and</li>
            <li>I love a shiny silver nail</li>
            <li>You may have better luck if you have someone to put these on for you.  </li>
            <li>More of a matted look.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t say it was a satisfying product.</li>
            <li>They only looked nice in the pack!!!</li>
            <li>They come off really easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought nail wrap from Walgreens that went on smooth.</li>
            <li>and they agreed to send me the silver ones free of charge.</li>
            <li>After applying the product I saw there were a lot of wrinkles in them that I tried to smooth out, but no matter what I did, it wouldn’t smooth out.</li>
            <li>after i used my nails were as hipper cool as i expect, was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The good part is that the peeling is hardly visible and no one else will know, and they truly are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>After a few days I noticed they had lost their brilliant shine from scuffing, but unless you protect it with gel tips like they do at a salon, you can&#x27;t expect that not to happen from any product.  </li>
            <li>This was only a sticker and it wasn&#x27;t that good, it doesn&#x27;t even stay for a day!!!&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li>I received my foils quickly and they arrived as described.</li>
            <li>I got the shipment fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I gave these stickers 2 stars only becase they look nice once you put them on your fingers.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Fell right off.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t break in the right place so they are not flush with your cuticle</li>
            <li>I tried to apply a clear polish over the tips to smooth put</li>
            <li>These were pretty for about twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>I do like how this product has kind of a robotic look to it, nonetheless-</li>
            <li>Took several weeks to get but they came from Hong Kong, so I guess that was fine.</li>
            <li>Looks very nice day 1 but as a busy person, washing dishes, cleaning house, gardening, it did not last long.</li>
            <li>I think these foils are pretty good, and I have found other uses for them on my nails without using the entire foil on the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>They are very sticky, but chipped almost immediately at the nail edge.</li>
            <li>and I tried every thing possible that I could think of to smooth them out</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to try these foils, because they are very shiny.  </li>
            <li>They were also very short so they didn&#x27;t fit on nails.</li>
            <li>i really like it ,</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t even last a full day.</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of silver nail polishes but only a sticker, I learned, could provide that true \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; effect.  </li>
            <li>…as most of the other reviews experienced, I could not smooth out the wrinkles (unlike other nail strips).</li>
            <li>The main stickers didn&#x27;t even stick to my nails and they were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and I normally use polish to achieve the look.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really like these, but said they marred easily even with a clear top coat &amp; were difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>Got a clear, sparkly wrap.</li>
            <li>no scratching things or using your nails really, as the ends will peel back).  </li>
            <li>NO MORE THEN A FEW HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;i wish it did because it looks nice!</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars because these nail wraps are new and different.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used acetone nail polish remover and even though it did remove them for the most part it left a sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li>The clear cover peels easily and quickly :(.</li>
            <li>Well, they are fine, but very hard to work with.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I mean you&#x27;ll feel it peeling by the next day if you&#x27;re not super careful about how you touch things (they kind of need to be treated like wet nail polish--</li>
            <li> is not the one which is like a pill-off nail polish, it is NOT the one which you have to use nail polish remover to take it off, its only a sticker which doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> No scissors to cut and didn&#x27;t last as long as I had wished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it was a waste of two hours of my life, but I would only do it again professionally.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money, same as the gold version i also tried.</li>
            <li> but they do not have a long life as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT STICK ON FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Also this ships from china so expect to wait a LONG time to recieve them.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of experience with other types of nail foils and nail wraps and these are of seriously low quality.</li>
            <li> They still come off if you put clear coat on them, and the clear coat makes them wrinkle up weird.</li>
            <li> Like with all nail foils just be careful when you wash your hands or take a showers, or itll wear quickyly.</li>
            <li> The rough edge from the filing looked unacceptable</li>
            <li> They have a strange bumpy texture and are very difficult to apply and fit to a nail.</li>
            <li> Other than that it wasn’t a bad product and it was cheap, but I think I’ll stick with Sally Hansen in the future.</li>
            <li> Also when I was cutting down the nail stickers, it would make it more messy and wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail artist and have worked with other nail wraps before, these just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Once applied you have to remove the excess foil and with other nail strips</li>
            <li> lasts forever, even when washing hands, dishes doing other housework.</li>
            <li> they are nothing like the sally hanson stick on nail wrappers or any other brand for nails.</li>
            <li> These foils were very cheap and worthless.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it looks pretty (for a short time)</li>
            <li> Thankfully they were less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> stayed on a half day...terrible</li>
            <li> Besides that they are hard stickers, once you file them to your nail length they are rough.</li>
            <li> Once you finish, they just start pulling up at the edge of the nail and start peeling off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, did not like them at all</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> do not buy, waste of money and time, try something else!</li>
            <li> they are hard to get on in the sense that yes they stick</li>
            <li> Really hard to put on!</li>
            <li> dumb stuff</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> They bubble like crazy, even if you even it out with a cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> so thats crap</li>
            <li> but they looked awful.</li>
            <li> This product was honestly horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These wraps do not look like they do in the photo. They have a strange bumpy texture and are very difficult to apply and fit to a nail. I&#x27;m a nail artist and have worked with other nail wraps before, these just don&#x27;t compare. They are very sticky, but chipped almost immediately at the nail edge. Of course they are inexpensive so I&#x27;m not heartbroken. I will absolutely be able to find another use for these but would not recommend them to anyone looking for those &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; nails!</li>
            <li> It fits very well and it looks great on my nails. Like with all nail foils just be careful when you wash your hands or take a showers, or itll wear quickyly. I got the shipment fast and easy. I am overall very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> I received my foils quickly and they arrived as described. The application time was no different than comparable products. the effect is awesome. You can&#x27;t achieve this chrome look with polish and i loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT…as most of the other reviews experienced, I could not smooth out the wrinkles (unlike other nail strips). Once applied you have to remove the excess foil and with other nail strips you can simply file off with emery board, but that does not work for these. MAYBE trimming with scissors would get a cleaner effect.  I tried to apply a clear polish over the tips to smooth put but I ended up ruining them. The rough edge from the filing looked unacceptable so I had to take them off right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used acetone nail polish remover and even though it did remove them for the most part it left a sticky residue behind. I removed that with olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a waste of two hours of my life, but I would only do it again professionally.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of experience with other types of nail foils and nail wraps and these are of seriously low quality. They bubble like crazy, even if you even it out with a cuticle pusher. Once you finish, they just start pulling up at the edge of the nail and start peeling off after a few hours. What a waste.</li>
            <li> The are to cumbersome to put on. Once on they look amazing but they didn&#x27;t even last a full day. After being out shopping for the day, the next morning the had already begun to peal backwards so I had to remove them</li>
            <li> Really hard to put on! No scissors to cut and didn&#x27;t last as long as I had wished. dumb stuff</li>
            <li> Ammm it&#x27;s okay I think.</li>
            <li> I did apply this to acrylic nails and it did not stay on for more than a couple minutes. I had the lady at the salon apply them. She watched many videos before applying them for me. Fell right off.</li>
            <li> I have been looking far and wide for this effect.  I tried a bunch of silver nail polishes but only a sticker, I learned, could provide that true \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; effect.  They peel with wear, and I mean you&#x27;ll feel it peeling by the next day if you&#x27;re not super careful about how you touch things (they kind of need to be treated like wet nail polish--no scratching things or using your nails really, as the ends will peel back).  The good part is that the peeling is hardly visible and no one else will know, and they truly are gorgeous.  After a few days I noticed they had lost their brilliant shine from scuffing, but unless you protect it with gel tips like they do at a salon, you can&#x27;t expect that not to happen from any product.  For $1.30 I must say I was thrilled with this purchase.  These things made me very happy and everyone who saw them was like \\&quot;WHAT\\&quot;.  I ended up ordering more for myself and mom and sister.  Put them on right before an event or before you go out for the best look.</li>
            <li> Took several weeks to get but they came from Hong Kong, so I guess that was fine. I got them because silver is my favorite color and my silver nail polish always ends up with tiny bubbles in it. These foils were very cheap and worthless. I put on two and took them off. I could not smooth them out enough to make them look decent. I&#x27;ve bought nail wrap from Walgreens that went on smooth. But these had ridges around the edges and I tried every thing possible that I could think of to smooth them out but they looked awful. Thankfully they were less than a dollar. I don&#x27;t not recommend getting them, even for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I loved the color but they do not have a long life as I had hoped. The clear cover peels easily and quickly :(.</li>
            <li> I gave these stickers 2 stars only becase they look nice once you put them on your fingers. Besides that they are hard stickers, once you file them to your nail length they are rough.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT STICK ON FOR A LONG TIME. NO MORE THEN A FEW HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;i wish it did because it looks nice!</li>
            <li> I ordered silver and got gold instead. I contacted the seller and offered to keep the gold ones and pay for them to send me silver ones also and they agreed to send me the silver ones free of charge. I never received the silver stickers and they never contacted me again.</li>
            <li> I love a shiny silver nail and I normally use polish to achieve the look.  However, I wanted to try these foils, because they are very shiny.  Well, they are fine, but very hard to work with.  You may have better luck if you have someone to put these on for you.  I think these foils are pretty good, and I have found other uses for them on my nails without using the entire foil on the nail bed.  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money, same as the gold version i also tried. they are hard to get on in the sense that yes they stick but they don&#x27;t break in the right place so they are not flush with your cuticle so thats crap and then they don&#x27;t last! as soon as you put them on they are literally coming right off!!! bananas!!! do not buy, waste of money and time, try something else!</li>
            <li> These were pretty for about twenty minutes. They come off really easily. They still come off if you put clear coat on them, and the clear coat makes them wrinkle up weird.</li>
            <li> Was not a mirror finish. More of a matted look.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because these nail wraps are new and different.  I like to stand out and they make my nails look wonderful.  I have found no one else has nails like mine when I wear them</li>
            <li> stayed on a half day...terrible</li>
            <li> This product was honestly horrible. The main stickers didn&#x27;t even stick to my nails and they were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Got a clear, sparkly wrap. This never came. They were also very short so they didn&#x27;t fit on nails. Sad.</li>
            <li> I do like how this product has kind of a robotic look to it, nonetheless- I wouldn’t say it was a satisfying product. I kind of thought there were more cons then there were pros. After applying the product I saw there were a lot of wrinkles in them that I tried to smooth out, but no matter what I did, it wouldn’t smooth out. Also when I was cutting down the nail stickers, it would make it more messy and wrinkly.  Other than that it wasn’t a bad product and it was cheap, but I think I’ll stick with Sally Hansen in the future.</li>
            <li> They only looked nice in the pack!!! Waste of money, did not like them at all, you need to take them off Amazon....</li>
            <li> Looks very nice day 1 but as a busy person, washing dishes, cleaning house, gardening, it did not last long. Too bad because it looks pretty (for a short time)</li>
            <li> lasts forever, even when washing hands, dishes doing other housework. it works. the perfect shade i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> i really like it , after i used my nails were as hipper cool as i expect, was easy to use.</li>
            <li> These arent a good product...they are stickers like youd find in a supply store not a nail salon..they are nothing like the sally hanson stick on nail wrappers or any other brand for nails. Also this ships from china so expect to wait a LONG time to recieve them. No where does it say it comes from China even after i checked the sellers profile.. A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Everything that I wanted was what I got. The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These wraps suck. They didn&#x27;t wrap at all</li>
            <li> My daughter really like these, but said they marred easily even with a clear top coat &amp; were difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> This was only a sticker and it wasn&#x27;t that good, it doesn&#x27;t even stay for a day!!!&lt;br /&gt;if you have just done your nail and you have some hand cream or oil for the edge, then, this wont stick on your nail!!&lt;br /&gt;This is not the one which is like a pill-off nail polish, it is NOT the one which you have to use nail polish remover to take it off, its only a sticker which doesn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
