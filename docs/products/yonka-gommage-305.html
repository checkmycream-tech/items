    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My facialist turned me on to Yonka many years ago.  While I have crept over to using mostly the Olay Pro-X line at this time, this is the one Yonka item that I can&#x27;t live without (actually the Pamplemousse for dark circles is pretty outstanding, too!).  Use this peel once a week for a youthful complexion and freshness that is noteworthy.  Gets rid of all the tired and dead cells and leaves your skin like a babe&#x27;s bottom, very bright but with no evident redness.  Takes a few tries to get the hang of rolling off the peel (my facialist helped me with the technique), you don&#x27;t rub you stimply stroke the fingers across the dried mask and it will begin to roll off your face along with all those nasty dead cells.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product An excellent exfoliant for over 20 years. It really makes your skin appear brighter.</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle exfolliant that even works overnight to shed dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> New product I&#x27;m trying really like!</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive, and dry skin. I had been given a very small sample tube of this product from a former employer of mine a few years ago. It worked beautifully then as it does now! From the first use, my skin felt totally rejuvenated and soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! I could not remember the name of the maker (Yonka) let alone exact product until recently, when I stumbled across it on the net somewhere. I was thrilled--I ordered this in a full-size tube &amp; it is definitely worth the money IMO!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smooths the entire area that I apply it to! It  would even better if I could leave it on and apply makeup over it once it drys!!!</li>
            <li> The product is a wonderful face treatment I have used before and arrived promptly. It makes my skin feel soft and rejuvenated. I would recommend it to anyone. The price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Face looks great after using it.</li>
            <li> I found the Yonka brand after reading somewhere that Martha Stewart uses this product. Her skin looks fantastic at her age.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it only once and love the way my skin feels after just one use. It did not peel off like it was supposed to do, but the package says if your skin is too dry, it might soak in and you need another application of gel before you get the peel effect. I might try more Yonka products if this continues to work for me. It does have a yucky armpit smell though. Like BO.</li>
            <li> Ok, I had to get past the foul smell. The product goes on easily; dries quickly; washes off with a cloth ( I want to be sure to get it all off).  I leave it on for approximately 15-30 minutes and then when I do wash it off, my skin is amazing.&lt;br /&gt; This leaves my skin very smooth so when I put on all my serums and moisturizers  the are absorbed very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product... and I got used to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Fast ship and good packaging that was easy to open.</li>
            <li> Having difficulty getting the correct thickness to be of any use. Will keep trying but don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. I have tried similar products but always come back to the Yonka Gommage. The botanical extracts leave your face feeling smooth and your complexion clear. If you are searching for a gel peel I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> excellent product which works very well for my skin type . . sensitive and prone to dryness and hormonal breakouts</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Just received 2 days ago too soon to say how it works.  I&#x27;ve used YonKa products years ago and love the way it made my skin feel, so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I had the pleasure of using this outstanding product was several years ago while visiting my mother.  She uses NOTHING but Yonka products &amp; I hate to admit it but she looks younger than I do.  She gave me a facial like back in the old days when I was in my teens &amp; after she used the Gommage on me I couldn&#x27;t believe the wonderful results.  A few hours later dead skin was STILL peeling off of my face.  I&#x27;ve wanted some of my own and I finally got it in the mail today.  I was so excited!!!!  And I&#x27;m now getting ready to go and start with the peeling process.  Thank you for making this wonderful product available to the public instead of making it one of those things you can only have used on you at a Spa.  God bless you all!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I read raving reviews about yonka and decidied to try. It is OK cream but nothing special compare to other lines</li>
            <li> I use only Yonka products and have never been disappointed.  Not what I expected.  Too soon to tell what results will be.</li>
            <li> makeup goes on  smoother after using this. i apply every other night...scrub off in a.m. with warm washcloth...</li>
            <li> I have used this before from a salon , and now I ended up finding on here. Its a great product its all natural!</li>
            <li> Read about this on many blogs and thought it would help clear my dry skin&#x27;s flakes. It may be that I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of using it but so far I haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li> I have used this before. This time it did not feel as thick &amp; peel ws not as good.</li>
            <li> I introduced by dermatologist. it&#x27;s very mild and make my skin brightly.&lt;br /&gt;I wanna change all cosmatics yonka!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll recommand it my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this! Found it on Amazon for cheaper than retail after they used it on me at a salon during a facial. I use it about once per week. It takes about 10 minutes to use because you have to rub it in slowly until it flakes off. There&#x27;s a specific technique they say to use on the box- make sure you follow that. It&#x27;s not a simple apply and wash-off situation. The seller I used did not package it properly, however, and the box was damaged.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but definatly worth the money,will buy the larger one next time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I love it. I use it about twice a week and you can feel how smooth your face looks and feels. I run and daily washings don&#x27;t always get rid of pore clogging dirt, along with all the sunblocks and so forth I apply to my face everyday. When you see what comes off your face it is amazing! I feel so clean and at 60, people tell me how beautiful my skin looks, I have to say, this product is very much part of it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect way to exfoliate your skin without harsh abrasions or chemicals.  I love the way my skin feels after I use it.  I use it once a week at night to exfoliate dead skin.  Works great !</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Masque 105. I first use the gommage 305 , wash off, then masque. The gommage will rid my skin of dead skin cells and the maque will finish cleansing my pores. After using both products, you will immediately notice the difference of a brighter cleaner face. Afterwards I use a hydrating cream.Routinely use these products 1-2 times weekly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old product or what, but the lotion would not get tight on my skin and peel away. I had to wash it off and it&#x27;s not supposed to work like that.  I&#x27;ll go back ordering it from my spa, much better product.</li>
