    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I might try it again in the summer,  but there was nothing especially appealing about it - not the texture or the feeling or the scent</li>
            <li>This face lotion worked great for keeping my face moisturized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for slicking on after you wash your face!</li>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I think it would be perfect for summer, as it&#x27;s moisturizing but not at all</li>

            <li>All very good products.</li>
            <li>I am delighted she has found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin and that moisturizes well!</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample of this lotion and loved it!</li>
            <li>Really great moisturizer, using it morning &amp; night, under makeup.</li>
            <li>I had great hopes.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer worked great for me.</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer for a great price.</li>
            <li>LOL - one of my daughter&#x27;s uses it</li>
            <li>and this does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very nice after using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have used this on my arms and legs and hands and it feels amazing on those parts, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d call this a nighttime moisturizer for most people, as it has no spf, which is a shame, because it&#x27;s otherwise perfect for summer daytime use.</li>
            <li>I have used it as a grab and go hand lotion, for which it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a good, no-nonsense moisturizer.</li>
            <li>that it contains things that are good for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for day use, but not for night.  </li>
            <li>like  smell either which was good with me.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>She says it is good</li>
            <li>It did not irritate, and worked as a good skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a good sign for me.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried before may be great before bed but not under makeup.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out and is very light and pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li>However, I used it before bed for the first time, and it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This one is awesome and it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Well, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, but it makes my face (great on the hands, legs and feet too!) feel fresh, moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>how nice it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>(Tho I suspect the texture wouldn&#x27;tbe so nice if it had sunscreen in it.)</li>
            <li>nice consistency. . . . .</li>
            <li>difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is nice moisturizer for the winter.</li>
            <li>The face wash is nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped this moisturizer might work nicely on wintertime dry-ish skin.</li>
            <li>My wife, who uses a variety of moisturizers, liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people rave about this product and how nicely it works for them.</li>
            <li>&quot; they claim on the packaging but it doesn&#x27;t feel nice.</li>
            <li>It is kind of greasy and takes a while to sink in.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t try the face wipes yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy at some point.</li>
            <li>wow, this is the best stuff ever, but then, what moisturizer would ever make one do that.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the fingers as you apply it to your face, and it feels good on your face, but as for the replenishing and nourishment it promises, well, how exactly are you supposed to tell?</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, fairly odorless, and feels good on the skin when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and feels good and clean.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, effective, but light, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I had great hopes it would willingly accept this product.</li>
            <li>It is a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did feel the need to reapply more often than I would have preferred; I have oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what causes my reactions.  </li>
            <li>Seems to okay for that.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li>but there is so much better out there for me.</li>
            <li>Who can say for sure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s tone more even.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay moisturizer but it would not make my shopping list.</li>
            <li>I love that it is scent-free.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my forties and since forever my skin is mostly oily.</li>
            <li>She has asked me to buy more of it.</li>
            <li>Most makeup has SPF.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this one by accident.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t NOT like the lotion, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t outstanding, or anything that made her jump and yell</li>
            <li>and I am ver satisfied with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is an okay moisturizer but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>Inability to remove the top from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I received this item for free as a sample and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I love that they do do not feel oily.</li>
            <li>Love that the moisturizer has spf 15 included.</li>
            <li>I love that it has no smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily like many moisturizers are.</li>
            <li>My coco butter lotion works way better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I can buy something better</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure for a while if this was working or not.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and light, but</li>
            <li>using for plenty of days, i see this is drying my skin out more, not helping</li>
            <li>Many  &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Really great for those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I got this on sale at my supermarket because I needed moisturizer and it was on some sort of special deal - it came with a moisturizer, face wash and cleansing wipes in a very nice, large reusable zip up bag, for about $15.</li>
            <li>I recived this item as a free trial item it works great leaving your face soft but definetley wished it was more amount</li>
            <li>A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, and it does a good job for much less money than many others.  </li>
            <li>For new Simple Kind To Skin Replenishing Moisturizer, I was definitely impressed with it.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent and it moisturizes your skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li>- just for one, smaller moisturizer it cost more than this whole awesome package, and they had all the junk and sunscreens and perfumes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very good for those with not so dry skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and non-greasy and is easy to use under make-up.  </li>
            <li>This is SUPER moisturizing!</li>
            <li>bottle design is great, it opens easily, but it also seals well and stays closed, making it safe to carry in my purse</li>
            <li>Super great leaving your skin soft and smooth without the drying effects and chemicals.</li>
            <li>and so I do tend to need a rich moisturizer and do my best to avoid product that list any kind of alcohol in the first few ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although I did notice a light lotion smell, it was not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>Not being well versed in girly matters like moisturizers, I didn&#x27;t realize this was primarily meant for use on your face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for people who need light moisturizing</li>
            <li>than I like before I could comfortably apply a layer of foundation.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and goes on smoothly, but it had me sneezing after I put it on.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is so light, yet so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is hypo-allergenic and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>: I received this product for free as part of a Klout</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>smooth, creamy, light scent, no perfume scent, moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I never heard of this product before, I just somehow found a free sample offer online and thought I&#x27;d go for it.</li>
            <li>Then I applied it lightly to my face and it burned.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m thinking about switching to Alba Botanica&#x27;s Even Advanced line).</li>
            <li>need a time to be comfortable with this smell tho.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free so that I could try it out.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s good product to buy it more in the future</li>
            <li>My skin looks a little plumper with a bit more color after using it and at 67 that is a good thing!</li>
            <li>Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works great.</li>
            <li>These products feel very fresh.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky as you rub it in, though not as rich as some of the competition.</li>
            <li>It feels rich, yet light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smoothly over it, but I would never describe it as \\&quot;rich \\&quot;</li>
            <li>Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] does not have any type of perfumed scent, it is very effective, and it worked will on my combination (dry/oily) skin.  </li>
            <li>It also kept my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so fresh and the moisture lasts longer!</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product that my wife says worked fine.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing lotion feels light weight and disappears quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The three selling points on the box are the vital vitamin Pro-Vitamin B5 that helps restore, soften and smooth, the skin loving nutrients Glycern, Bisabolol, and Allantoin, and that is has no perfume or dyes that could irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant skin care line but found that the soap was a bit too drying on my skin; and I was none to pleased when they bumped up the price of the moisturizer either.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea that this was a replenishing rich moisturizer, made with vitamins and no harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This product is nothing special.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right in the skin!</li>
            <li>For the first week or so, I thought that I finally found a great moisturizer that suits my skin.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin, and have used and liked this brand before.</li>
            <li>This products is kind of watery feeling and doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft or moisturized.</li>
            <li>No scent, goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly,</li>
            <li>Let me start with the positive - this is a great daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>moisturizer is seriously the best moisturizer I have found for this purpose to date.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not scented,</li>
            <li>It seemed to disappear into my skin fairly quickly</li>
            <li>thanks Simple your great.</li>
            <li>, I noticed an improvement and my skin was acne-free quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Simple, for greatly strengthening my Neutrogena brand loyalty.</li>
            <li>There was a mild burning sensation on my skin</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have experienced more acne since I turned 25 than I ever did in my teens and to top it off, my skin is sensitive so finding a product that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate, cause acne or make me look like an oil slick is</li>
            <li>Even though it feels very rich when you put in on your face, it quickly absorbed into the skin, and it leaves your face feeling very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t pack enough emmolient for my dry winter skin, this is a lovely light feeling moisturizer that absorbs quickly, has a great texture, and a silky feel.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely on my skin, with comfort and quality without the worry of other skin moisturizers.</li>
            <li>After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I think most people with normal skin would like it.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re likely to be very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>Is light and airy but need something with higher SPF.  </li>
            <li>For a busy mom like me it was very quick and easy to put on</li>
            <li>I dislike having too many steps in my skin-care routine, and this moisturizer will be a new staple in the mornings.</li>
            <li>think if you have completely dry skin rather than combination like mine, and if you&#x27;re not using retinal at night that requires you to wear SPF during the day, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] which I liked very much, I this time purchased the [[ASIN:B005TI7L6O</li>
            <li>lotion absorbs quickly and is fast drying, so makeup application is smooth and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said that it felt a bit strange going on at first-- that it had a kind of light</li>
            <li>It does initially leave your hands feeling kind of silky, but the effect is short-lived.</li>
            <li>My wife used this product and she liked it well enough.</li>
            <li>My skin is more moody than sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel moist, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Really nice overall product.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and prefer something that blends in more completely than this did.  </li>
            <li>Tarquin Hall&#x27;s books are just fun.</li>
            <li>and none of them have been as effective at moisturizing compared to Simple while not having a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>I love that they are all natural</li>
            <li>One thing that&#x27;s nice is that there&#x27;s no extra junk in the product, so my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all from using it!  </li>
            <li>I rarely use mascara</li>
            <li>It is simple and nice, moizturizes my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not found a better one than this so far.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has an SPF of 15 and protects from powerful UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li>But so far I love it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about was that it didn&#x27;t bother my acne.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, mostly because I have been suffering with eczema all my life.</li>
            <li>figured worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I did receive it for free from BzzAgent, but after looking at the prices I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>This very light lotion is great for someone looking just to simply moisturize her/his face without any scents or other long-term benefits/miracles.  </li>
            <li>I guess this moisturizer is 100% original pure product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As mentioned, it soaks right in to your skin and hydrates it.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be any more effective than the usual drug store products.  </li>
            <li>I want to give this product a full 5 stars, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>They have the same great scent but same crappy result.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the product my skin felt fine; but towards the 4th and 5th usage I realized my face would feel warm after I applied this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin and simple cleanser and moisturizer are wonderful.</li>
            <li>do feel as if the advertising for this lotion is attempting to describe it as different than most or special but as far as I can tell, there is nothing special in this</li>
            <li>so that was a first for me.</li>
            <li>Here in S. FL, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It came through as advertised: this moisturizer did leave her skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this moisturizer and would recommend it to others and buy it again!</li>
            <li>They are now soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li>my makeup doesn&#x27;t slide off my face and I have enough reasons to buy more.</li>
            <li>She has tried many different brands but raves about this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it does the job, I found that the Goldbond actually works better, I had a \\&quot;plateau\\&quot; on this moisturizer after about 6 months in which it stopped working as well (?)</li>
            <li>, so I switched back to just the Goldbond, but I still use this product now and again for touching up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper if you buy on amazon than at the drugstore!</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;Simple&#x27; products!</li>
            <li>It is a sensitive skin formula that works very well onto the skin, and provides the most intimate skin protection.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works just as well as some of the othr higher prized moisturizers.</li>
            <li>First of all, I would like to explain my skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was after a shower, meaning I washed off my makeup and used a cleanser and a scrub to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Each time I would get the same greasy and on top of the skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>Which is why i needed lotion in the first place.</li>
            <li>My hands feel better, don&#x27;t have that white and cracked look to them.</li>
            <li>I use it more on my neck and at night for my face, but only because I like a matte finish.</li>
            <li>This is a light, but very moisturizing face lotion for those with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I forgot my normal moisturizer at the hotel when traveling and needed to get a quick replacement.</li>
            <li>No smelly sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and your skin feels clean and natural after applying.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Simple products and they are very recommended by me.  </li>
            <li>it is a very light lotion and for how dry my skin is, it is moisturizing it.</li>
            <li>and it lasts pretty much all day for me.  </li>
            <li>Not 12 hours like it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I am suspicious that it doesn&#x27;t work for my skin because the first ingredient is \\&quot;Water\\&quot; and because I have eczema that is always triggered by moisture and water, it just irritates my skin too much for me to use</li>
            <li>I just really have had a rough time for many, many years finding a facial moisturizer that works for me.</li>
            <li>well and does not feel dry and stretchy any more.</li>
            <li>but it does have a certain smell.</li>
            <li>After seeing the tv adverts when I found this at my local grocery store I was super psyched!</li>
            <li>It is really nice, but it does leave your face a little dewey, which some people like.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth, and I think it even looks a little more brighter</li>
            <li>I use this as a night cream, it&#x27;s really moist</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my skin and my lips have not broken out.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have any appreciable scent and seems to be gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li>This goes away after it has some time to absorb but gives a much longer period</li>
            <li>Worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I always use too much I might as well use it on something.  </li>
            <li>Finally here is a moisturizer that is light, creamy, no dyes, no perfumes, no sting and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer for those reasons.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reasonably priced. . . .</li>
            <li>Really is.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>and it feels very calming when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>It was very dense and my face was tacky all day.</li>
            <li>They have no perfume and are gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 and always had very oily skin</li>
            <li>I think people expect too much sometimes and feel like</li>
            <li>I apply Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer to finish my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Its white, non-greasy and light.</li>
            <li>I really like how this stuff helps hydrates my skin, but the smell is so off putting I just can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it made on my skin till it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, and actually moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Decent, mild moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just wanted one that would keep my skin from becoming dry or too oily.</li>
            <li>I think it is an adequate general moisturizer, but I did not notice any \\&quot;wow\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li>Also found out my particular skin does not react well to B5 so at certain times of the month when I tend to break out</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate, you may need to use more of it or get a brand with a thicker formulation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne &amp; blackhead prone combination skin with large pores that has got to be the most difficult skin type to buy any kind of moisturizer for.</li>
            <li>first tried Simple on my hands and a spot on my leg to make sure it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or gross on my skin.</li>
            <li>Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] for a change.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my large pores at all, does a great job at balancing my skin&#x27;s moisture out by hydrating the dry parts without making them oily/greasy and controls the oily/greasy parts so they don&#x27;t get as bad as they normally do, soothes the irritation from the acne treatment, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, leaves my skin feeling fresh and natural immediately after application because it soaks right in, and just generally is EXACTLY the kind of moisturizer I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not thick and sits very well on your face and does not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>Very very happy with this product, which I bought because all the other creams were more expensive, without even the extra bonus items and bags</li>
            <li>If you want a full body moisturizer, you may want to get something that comes in a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>This product surprised me because all the other face lotions I have tried have felt like a mask on my face, but the Simple Moisturizer was actually very light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this facial moisturizer-it seemed thick and very rich, and I have combination skin.  </li>
            <li>It might be to light for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I sometimes get dry patches in the winter and this cleared those up with no irritation, no annoying smell and no break outs.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m expecting miracles, but I don&#x27;t see how this product, supposedly the number one moisturizer in the U.K., is any different than most such products</li>
            <li>I do wish I could just take the sinus agony though because it is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I definitely was surprised about it, and Simple Kind To Skin is definitely a brand on the rise worth trying</li>
            <li>I had been using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for over a year and it (a super hydrating formula) wasn&#x27;t even effecting my face anymore.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a moisturizer that I would purchase and also one that I would feel comfortable to let my kids use on their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, I highly doubt that any woman in her 40s or older is going to find this product</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t break me out significantly, and that it travels well in my purse, but I&#x27;m not wild about it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li>The 4.2 oz bottle was not enough for us to notice a significant improvement as far as a healthier looking skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I could apply my foundation within a few minutes after the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes an hour or more after applying a moisturizer under my foundation and it will \\&quot;reappear\\&quot; and make my face SUPER shiny and greasy feeling, especially my forehead</li>
            <li>The Replenishing Rich Moisturizer by Simple is a vitamin enriched moisturizer without perfume or dyes designed for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a free sample of this not really expecting anything - or even expecting the sample to show up.</li>
            <li>I have very dry/very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would not buy again for myself, but I would think that people with normal skin would like this.  </li>
            <li>Dried out my skin more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different sensitive skin brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to put on my makeup over it without getting a heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin around my eyebrows and I hoped this would be a good alternative, back-up, or addition to my Goldbond lotion that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>top.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I would have hope and really would love if simple made a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I used this right before bed time and in the morning before applying my makeup and after two weeks of the same routine my face has done a complete 180!</li>
            <li>We live in South Dakota and the dryness in winter here can be so damaging to the skin.</li>
            <li>I think there is some ingredient in these new products that they claim as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that makes my skin break-out although I never suffered from acne otherwise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for new moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It is dry in some areas and super oily in others.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and nothing else works as well.  </li>
            <li>I use this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer on a daily basis after I shave.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of Simple before, but I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this moisturizer for those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I had the exact same reaction to my skin as \\&quot; Jorge L. Benitez\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I first used this, last December, I bought it because it claimed to be for sensitive skin and help my dryness.</li>
            <li>well, i recently purchased this simple rich moisturizer from walmart because cetaphil moisturizer wasnt cutting it with all the sunscreen &amp; this seems to be simple enough for my sensitive skin, let me tell you THIS STUFF IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li>The results were similar to using pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>Like most such products, Replenishing Rich Moisturizer delivers a little less than it claims.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my dry face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this affordable facial moisturize which has no fragrance and works well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>But it has been keeping our skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps make skin soft and silky feeling, and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily/dry, aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It is nearly odorless.  </li>
            <li>Passed the test for my ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised because I was expecting it to burn a bit because of how chapped my face felt &amp; it has not caused me any acne either.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very sticky even an hour after applied.</li>
            <li>Quit using my old lotion.</li>
            <li>I also would recommend this for all skin types, not just sensitive.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s working for me so far.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this moisturizer does not irritate my skin or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young, with no aging at all.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m a sensitive skin expert, since I&#x27;ve had it all my life, and this &amp;#34;rich, calming moisturizer&amp;#34; is stinging my face as I write this.  </li>
            <li>SO in short even thought I really really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and has a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it that isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light-weight, reasonably priced moisturizer, I&#x27;d definitely try this one.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer left my face feeling clean and soft, and I have dry skin on my face which it helped with as well.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not a moisturizer that makes you feel like you are wearing a mask, it is very lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells faintly of sunscreen like all sunscreen products smell of, its good smelling and not overbearing in any way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other moisturizers in the past, both drugstore and higher end</li>
            <li>And lastly, my skin is super dry in the winter and oily-combination in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I decided to use it at night because it was a rich moisturizer that I thought was going to be too heavy for daytime use, and because it has no SPF.</li>
            <li>After using for a few days I began to break out significantly on my chin area.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive facial skin and will develop red, raised blotches as a reaction to certain ingredients...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many moisturizers for my sensitive skin ranging from cheap $3 bottles from my local drug store, all the way to expensive moisturizers that I bought from different spas.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a daily moisturizer for your face.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is powerful enough for seriously dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensative and I have to be extra careful about what I put on it.</li>
            <li>While Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is indeed completely scentless, the amount of stearyl alcohol in the product reduces its ability to moisturize -- at least for my (older) skin.  </li>
            <li>Infact, I felt the same way with the new \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; line of Johnson &amp; Johnson moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I personal am not outside as much as I would like</li>
            <li>When I first bought this, it was like any other l.</li>
            <li>It may have been made for the younger set, but as a 67 year old woman, I recommend it!</li>
            <li>One night I was fed up and went to my local CVS and bought this Simple product with the intention I would replace it with a higher end product later in the week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super duper pale, if that helps.</li>
            <li>It is a little thicker in formula but is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, with a constant lip allergy issue.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they remove waterproof eye makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a fairly small bottle, so you want to use this for face and neck, and not your entire body or you would go through it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s mostly scentless and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li>That makes me kind of sad because I wish it worked for me</li>
            <li>I received some free samples of this product in the mail and was kind of skeptical as I do not use skin care products so I am not very knowledgeable on the subject.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a slight burning sensation when I first apply this.  </li>
            <li>There are no overpowering fragrances that other products have, which is what made me buy Simple products in the first place.</li>
            <li>but after little search on online, just found out that kind of smell is common to these non-fragrance products.</li>
            <li>My skin gets red and irritated from almost any product, but Simple surprised me.  </li>
            <li>There is no question that there are few and far between skin enhancers that work very well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry sky</li>
            <li>The bottles are exactly the same shape and size, so I&#x27;m prepared to have to turn this one upside down when the product is nearing its end,</li>
            <li>I continue to use it, although at first it made me break out a little (yes, at my age).  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry and windy state</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This did nothing for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also , even though this product doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent it did smell slightly like plastic.</li>
            <li>Because it was such a small tube that she tried, she only applied the moisturizer to her face, which is typically what she is most concerned with anyway.</li>
            <li>so I can finally have soft skin, but the odor does linger all day long.  </li>
            <li>its well moisturized &amp; i dont shine like crazy, LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I usually just wash my face with water and leave it at that but have always been searching for a moisturizer in the winter months when my skin gets super dry.</li>
            <li>and I had very chapped, severe, dry, facial skin the other day</li>
            <li>After two days of use my face is bright red, bumpy, blotchy, peeling and painful.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I might try it again in the summer,  but there was nothing especially appealing about it - not the texture or the feeling or the scent</li>
            <li> This face lotion worked great for keeping my face moisturized!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for slicking on after you wash your face!</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very nice after using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have used this on my arms and legs and hands and it feels amazing on those parts, too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d call this a nighttime moisturizer for most people, as it has no spf, which is a shame, because it&#x27;s otherwise perfect for summer daytime use.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a grab and go hand lotion, for which it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a good, no-nonsense moisturizer.</li>
            <li> that it contains things that are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for day use, but not for night.  </li>
            <li> like  smell either which was good with me.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> She says it is good</li>
            <li> It did not irritate, and worked as a good skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a good sign for me.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried before may be great before bed but not under makeup.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out and is very light and pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li> However, I used it before bed for the first time, and it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This one is awesome and it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li> Well, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It may not work for everyone, but it makes my face (great on the hands, legs and feet too!) feel fresh, moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> how nice it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> (Tho I suspect the texture wouldn&#x27;tbe so nice if it had sunscreen in it.)</li>
            <li> nice consistency. . . . .</li>
            <li> difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is nice moisturizer for the winter.</li>
            <li> The face wash is nice too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped this moisturizer might work nicely on wintertime dry-ish skin.</li>
            <li> My wife, who uses a variety of moisturizers, liked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people rave about this product and how nicely it works for them.</li>
            <li> &quot; they claim on the packaging but it doesn&#x27;t feel nice.</li>
            <li> It is kind of greasy and takes a while to sink in.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try the face wipes yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy at some point.</li>
            <li> wow, this is the best stuff ever, but then, what moisturizer would ever make one do that.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the fingers as you apply it to your face, and it feels good on your face, but as for the replenishing and nourishment it promises, well, how exactly are you supposed to tell?</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, fairly odorless, and feels good on the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and feels good and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, effective, but light, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I had great hopes it would willingly accept this product.</li>
            <li> It is a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did feel the need to reapply more often than I would have preferred; I have oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure what causes my reactions.  </li>
            <li> Seems to okay for that.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li> but there is so much better out there for me.</li>
            <li> Who can say for sure.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s tone more even.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer but it would not make my shopping list.</li>
            <li> I love that it is scent-free.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my forties and since forever my skin is mostly oily.</li>
            <li> She has asked me to buy more of it.</li>
            <li> Most makeup has SPF.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this one by accident.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t NOT like the lotion, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t outstanding, or anything that made her jump and yell</li>
            <li> and I am ver satisfied with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> Inability to remove the top from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free as a sample and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I love that they do do not feel oily.</li>
            <li> Love that the moisturizer has spf 15 included.</li>
            <li> I love that it has no smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily like many moisturizers are.</li>
            <li> My coco butter lotion works way better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I can buy something better</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure for a while if this was working or not.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and light, but</li>
            <li> using for plenty of days, i see this is drying my skin out more, not helping</li>
            <li> Many  &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Really great for those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I got this on sale at my supermarket because I needed moisturizer and it was on some sort of special deal - it came with a moisturizer, face wash and cleansing wipes in a very nice, large reusable zip up bag, for about $15.</li>
            <li> I recived this item as a free trial item it works great leaving your face soft but definetley wished it was more amount</li>
            <li> A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant, and it does a good job for much less money than many others.  </li>
            <li> For new Simple Kind To Skin Replenishing Moisturizer, I was definitely impressed with it.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent and it moisturizes your skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li> - just for one, smaller moisturizer it cost more than this whole awesome package, and they had all the junk and sunscreens and perfumes.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, very good for those with not so dry skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and non-greasy and is easy to use under make-up.  </li>
            <li> This is SUPER moisturizing!</li>
            <li> bottle design is great, it opens easily, but it also seals well and stays closed, making it safe to carry in my purse</li>
            <li> Super great leaving your skin soft and smooth without the drying effects and chemicals.</li>
            <li> and so I do tend to need a rich moisturizer and do my best to avoid product that list any kind of alcohol in the first few ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> although I did notice a light lotion smell, it was not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Not being well versed in girly matters like moisturizers, I didn&#x27;t realize this was primarily meant for use on your face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for people who need light moisturizing</li>
            <li> than I like before I could comfortably apply a layer of foundation.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and goes on smoothly, but it had me sneezing after I put it on.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is so light, yet so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is hypo-allergenic and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> : I received this product for free as part of a Klout</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> smooth, creamy, light scent, no perfume scent, moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I never heard of this product before, I just somehow found a free sample offer online and thought I&#x27;d go for it.</li>
            <li> Then I applied it lightly to my face and it burned.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m thinking about switching to Alba Botanica&#x27;s Even Advanced line).</li>
            <li> need a time to be comfortable with this smell tho.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free so that I could try it out.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s good product to buy it more in the future</li>
            <li> My skin looks a little plumper with a bit more color after using it and at 67 that is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works great.</li>
            <li> These products feel very fresh.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky as you rub it in, though not as rich as some of the competition.</li>
            <li> It feels rich, yet light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smoothly over it, but I would never describe it as \\&quot;rich \\&quot;</li>
            <li> Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] does not have any type of perfumed scent, it is very effective, and it worked will on my combination (dry/oily) skin.  </li>
            <li> It also kept my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so fresh and the moisture lasts longer!</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product that my wife says worked fine.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing lotion feels light weight and disappears quickly into skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The three selling points on the box are the vital vitamin Pro-Vitamin B5 that helps restore, soften and smooth, the skin loving nutrients Glycern, Bisabolol, and Allantoin, and that is has no perfume or dyes that could irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant skin care line but found that the soap was a bit too drying on my skin; and I was none to pleased when they bumped up the price of the moisturizer either.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea that this was a replenishing rich moisturizer, made with vitamins and no harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This product is nothing special.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right in the skin!</li>
            <li> For the first week or so, I thought that I finally found a great moisturizer that suits my skin.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, and have used and liked this brand before.</li>
            <li> This products is kind of watery feeling and doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft or moisturized.</li>
            <li> No scent, goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly,</li>
            <li> Let me start with the positive - this is a great daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> moisturizer is seriously the best moisturizer I have found for this purpose to date.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not scented,</li>
            <li> It seemed to disappear into my skin fairly quickly</li>
            <li> thanks Simple your great.</li>
            <li> , I noticed an improvement and my skin was acne-free quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Simple, for greatly strengthening my Neutrogena brand loyalty.</li>
            <li> There was a mild burning sensation on my skin</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have experienced more acne since I turned 25 than I ever did in my teens and to top it off, my skin is sensitive so finding a product that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate, cause acne or make me look like an oil slick is</li>
            <li> Even though it feels very rich when you put in on your face, it quickly absorbed into the skin, and it leaves your face feeling very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t pack enough emmolient for my dry winter skin, this is a lovely light feeling moisturizer that absorbs quickly, has a great texture, and a silky feel.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely on my skin, with comfort and quality without the worry of other skin moisturizers.</li>
            <li> After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I think most people with normal skin would like it.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re likely to be very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> Is light and airy but need something with higher SPF.  </li>
            <li> For a busy mom like me it was very quick and easy to put on</li>
            <li> I dislike having too many steps in my skin-care routine, and this moisturizer will be a new staple in the mornings.</li>
            <li> think if you have completely dry skin rather than combination like mine, and if you&#x27;re not using retinal at night that requires you to wear SPF during the day, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] which I liked very much, I this time purchased the [[ASIN:B005TI7L6O</li>
            <li> lotion absorbs quickly and is fast drying, so makeup application is smooth and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said that it felt a bit strange going on at first-- that it had a kind of light</li>
            <li> It does initially leave your hands feeling kind of silky, but the effect is short-lived.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and she liked it well enough.</li>
            <li> My skin is more moody than sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel moist, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Really nice overall product.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and prefer something that blends in more completely than this did.  </li>
            <li> Tarquin Hall&#x27;s books are just fun.</li>
            <li> and none of them have been as effective at moisturizing compared to Simple while not having a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> I love that they are all natural</li>
            <li> One thing that&#x27;s nice is that there&#x27;s no extra junk in the product, so my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all from using it!  </li>
            <li> I rarely use mascara</li>
            <li> It is simple and nice, moizturizes my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found a better one than this so far.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has an SPF of 15 and protects from powerful UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li> But so far I love it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about was that it didn&#x27;t bother my acne.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, mostly because I have been suffering with eczema all my life.</li>
            <li> figured worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I did receive it for free from BzzAgent, but after looking at the prices I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> This very light lotion is great for someone looking just to simply moisturize her/his face without any scents or other long-term benefits/miracles.  </li>
            <li> I guess this moisturizer is 100% original pure product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As mentioned, it soaks right in to your skin and hydrates it.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be any more effective than the usual drug store products.  </li>
            <li> I want to give this product a full 5 stars, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> They have the same great scent but same crappy result.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the product my skin felt fine; but towards the 4th and 5th usage I realized my face would feel warm after I applied this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and simple cleanser and moisturizer are wonderful.</li>
            <li> do feel as if the advertising for this lotion is attempting to describe it as different than most or special but as far as I can tell, there is nothing special in this</li>
            <li> so that was a first for me.</li>
            <li> Here in S. FL, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It came through as advertised: this moisturizer did leave her skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this moisturizer and would recommend it to others and buy it again!</li>
            <li> They are now soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li> my makeup doesn&#x27;t slide off my face and I have enough reasons to buy more.</li>
            <li> She has tried many different brands but raves about this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to put up with the scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it does the job, I found that the Goldbond actually works better, I had a \\&quot;plateau\\&quot; on this moisturizer after about 6 months in which it stopped working as well (?)</li>
            <li> , so I switched back to just the Goldbond, but I still use this product now and again for touching up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper if you buy on amazon than at the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;Simple&#x27; products!</li>
            <li> It is a sensitive skin formula that works very well onto the skin, and provides the most intimate skin protection.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works just as well as some of the othr higher prized moisturizers.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would like to explain my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was after a shower, meaning I washed off my makeup and used a cleanser and a scrub to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Each time I would get the same greasy and on top of the skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> Which is why i needed lotion in the first place.</li>
            <li> My hands feel better, don&#x27;t have that white and cracked look to them.</li>
            <li> I use it more on my neck and at night for my face, but only because I like a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is a light, but very moisturizing face lotion for those with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I forgot my normal moisturizer at the hotel when traveling and needed to get a quick replacement.</li>
            <li> No smelly sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and your skin feels clean and natural after applying.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Simple products and they are very recommended by me.  </li>
            <li> it is a very light lotion and for how dry my skin is, it is moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> and it lasts pretty much all day for me.  </li>
            <li> Not 12 hours like it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I am suspicious that it doesn&#x27;t work for my skin because the first ingredient is \\&quot;Water\\&quot; and because I have eczema that is always triggered by moisture and water, it just irritates my skin too much for me to use</li>
            <li> I just really have had a rough time for many, many years finding a facial moisturizer that works for me.</li>
            <li> well and does not feel dry and stretchy any more.</li>
            <li> but it does have a certain smell.</li>
            <li> After seeing the tv adverts when I found this at my local grocery store I was super psyched!</li>
            <li> It is really nice, but it does leave your face a little dewey, which some people like.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth, and I think it even looks a little more brighter</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream, it&#x27;s really moist</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my skin and my lips have not broken out.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have any appreciable scent and seems to be gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li> This goes away after it has some time to absorb but gives a much longer period</li>
            <li> Worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I always use too much I might as well use it on something.  </li>
            <li> Finally here is a moisturizer that is light, creamy, no dyes, no perfumes, no sting and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer for those reasons.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reasonably priced. . . .</li>
            <li> Really is.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped a lot.  </li>
            <li> and it feels very calming when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> It was very dense and my face was tacky all day.</li>
            <li> They have no perfume and are gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and always had very oily skin</li>
            <li> I think people expect too much sometimes and feel like</li>
            <li> I apply Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer to finish my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Its white, non-greasy and light.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff helps hydrates my skin, but the smell is so off putting I just can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it made on my skin till it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light, and actually moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Decent, mild moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just wanted one that would keep my skin from becoming dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> I think it is an adequate general moisturizer, but I did not notice any \\&quot;wow\\&quot; results.  </li>
            <li> Also found out my particular skin does not react well to B5 so at certain times of the month when I tend to break out</li>
            <li> If you live in a dry climate, you may need to use more of it or get a brand with a thicker formulation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne &amp; blackhead prone combination skin with large pores that has got to be the most difficult skin type to buy any kind of moisturizer for.</li>
            <li> first tried Simple on my hands and a spot on my leg to make sure it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or gross on my skin.</li>
            <li> Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] for a change.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my large pores at all, does a great job at balancing my skin&#x27;s moisture out by hydrating the dry parts without making them oily/greasy and controls the oily/greasy parts so they don&#x27;t get as bad as they normally do, soothes the irritation from the acne treatment, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, leaves my skin feeling fresh and natural immediately after application because it soaks right in, and just generally is EXACTLY the kind of moisturizer I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not thick and sits very well on your face and does not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this product, which I bought because all the other creams were more expensive, without even the extra bonus items and bags</li>
            <li> If you want a full body moisturizer, you may want to get something that comes in a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> This product surprised me because all the other face lotions I have tried have felt like a mask on my face, but the Simple Moisturizer was actually very light and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this facial moisturizer-it seemed thick and very rich, and I have combination skin.  </li>
            <li> It might be to light for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get dry patches in the winter and this cleared those up with no irritation, no annoying smell and no break outs.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m expecting miracles, but I don&#x27;t see how this product, supposedly the number one moisturizer in the U.K., is any different than most such products</li>
            <li> I do wish I could just take the sinus agony though because it is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I definitely was surprised about it, and Simple Kind To Skin is definitely a brand on the rise worth trying</li>
            <li> I had been using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for over a year and it (a super hydrating formula) wasn&#x27;t even effecting my face anymore.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a moisturizer that I would purchase and also one that I would feel comfortable to let my kids use on their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, I highly doubt that any woman in her 40s or older is going to find this product</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t break me out significantly, and that it travels well in my purse, but I&#x27;m not wild about it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> The 4.2 oz bottle was not enough for us to notice a significant improvement as far as a healthier looking skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I could apply my foundation within a few minutes after the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes an hour or more after applying a moisturizer under my foundation and it will \\&quot;reappear\\&quot; and make my face SUPER shiny and greasy feeling, especially my forehead</li>
            <li> The Replenishing Rich Moisturizer by Simple is a vitamin enriched moisturizer without perfume or dyes designed for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a free sample of this not really expecting anything - or even expecting the sample to show up.</li>
            <li> I have very dry/very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again for myself, but I would think that people with normal skin would like this.  </li>
            <li> Dried out my skin more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different sensitive skin brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to put on my makeup over it without getting a heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin around my eyebrows and I hoped this would be a good alternative, back-up, or addition to my Goldbond lotion that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> top.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I would have hope and really would love if simple made a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this right before bed time and in the morning before applying my makeup and after two weeks of the same routine my face has done a complete 180!</li>
            <li> We live in South Dakota and the dryness in winter here can be so damaging to the skin.</li>
            <li> I think there is some ingredient in these new products that they claim as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that makes my skin break-out although I never suffered from acne otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for new moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is dry in some areas and super oily in others.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and nothing else works as well.  </li>
            <li> I use this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer on a daily basis after I shave.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of Simple before, but I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this moisturizer for those with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I had the exact same reaction to my skin as \\&quot; Jorge L. Benitez\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I first used this, last December, I bought it because it claimed to be for sensitive skin and help my dryness.</li>
            <li> well, i recently purchased this simple rich moisturizer from walmart because cetaphil moisturizer wasnt cutting it with all the sunscreen &amp; this seems to be simple enough for my sensitive skin, let me tell you THIS STUFF IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> The results were similar to using pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> Like most such products, Replenishing Rich Moisturizer delivers a little less than it claims.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my dry face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this affordable facial moisturize which has no fragrance and works well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> But it has been keeping our skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps make skin soft and silky feeling, and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily/dry, aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly odorless.  </li>
            <li> Passed the test for my ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised because I was expecting it to burn a bit because of how chapped my face felt &amp; it has not caused me any acne either.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very sticky even an hour after applied.</li>
            <li> Quit using my old lotion.</li>
            <li> I also would recommend this for all skin types, not just sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s working for me so far.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this moisturizer does not irritate my skin or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young, with no aging at all.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a sensitive skin expert, since I&#x27;ve had it all my life, and this &amp;#34;rich, calming moisturizer&amp;#34; is stinging my face as I write this.  </li>
            <li> SO in short even thought I really really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and has a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it that isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light-weight, reasonably priced moisturizer, I&#x27;d definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer left my face feeling clean and soft, and I have dry skin on my face which it helped with as well.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not a moisturizer that makes you feel like you are wearing a mask, it is very lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells faintly of sunscreen like all sunscreen products smell of, its good smelling and not overbearing in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other moisturizers in the past, both drugstore and higher end</li>
            <li> And lastly, my skin is super dry in the winter and oily-combination in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I decided to use it at night because it was a rich moisturizer that I thought was going to be too heavy for daytime use, and because it has no SPF.</li>
            <li> After using for a few days I began to break out significantly on my chin area.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin and will develop red, raised blotches as a reaction to certain ingredients...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturizers for my sensitive skin ranging from cheap $3 bottles from my local drug store, all the way to expensive moisturizers that I bought from different spas.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a daily moisturizer for your face.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is powerful enough for seriously dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensative and I have to be extra careful about what I put on it.</li>
            <li> While Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is indeed completely scentless, the amount of stearyl alcohol in the product reduces its ability to moisturize -- at least for my (older) skin.  </li>
            <li> Infact, I felt the same way with the new \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; line of Johnson &amp; Johnson moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I personal am not outside as much as I would like</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, it was like any other l.</li>
            <li> It may have been made for the younger set, but as a 67 year old woman, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> One night I was fed up and went to my local CVS and bought this Simple product with the intention I would replace it with a higher end product later in the week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super duper pale, if that helps.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker in formula but is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, with a constant lip allergy issue.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they remove waterproof eye makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a fairly small bottle, so you want to use this for face and neck, and not your entire body or you would go through it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s mostly scentless and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li> That makes me kind of sad because I wish it worked for me</li>
            <li> I received some free samples of this product in the mail and was kind of skeptical as I do not use skin care products so I am not very knowledgeable on the subject.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a slight burning sensation when I first apply this.  </li>
            <li> There are no overpowering fragrances that other products have, which is what made me buy Simple products in the first place.</li>
            <li> but after little search on online, just found out that kind of smell is common to these non-fragrance products.</li>
            <li> My skin gets red and irritated from almost any product, but Simple surprised me.  </li>
            <li> There is no question that there are few and far between skin enhancers that work very well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry sky</li>
            <li> The bottles are exactly the same shape and size, so I&#x27;m prepared to have to turn this one upside down when the product is nearing its end,</li>
            <li> I continue to use it, although at first it made me break out a little (yes, at my age).  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry and windy state</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also , even though this product doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent it did smell slightly like plastic.</li>
            <li> Because it was such a small tube that she tried, she only applied the moisturizer to her face, which is typically what she is most concerned with anyway.</li>
            <li> so I can finally have soft skin, but the odor does linger all day long.  </li>
            <li> its well moisturized &amp; i dont shine like crazy, LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I usually just wash my face with water and leave it at that but have always been searching for a moisturizer in the winter months when my skin gets super dry.</li>
            <li> and I had very chapped, severe, dry, facial skin the other day</li>
            <li> After two days of use my face is bright red, bumpy, blotchy, peeling and painful.</li>
            <li> This one contains a single Vitamin and the other has two, but all other descriptions are very close to the same as far as being simple, just like the name of the product line.  </li>
            <li> Normally moisturizers are too thick, where I feel like I have too much \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on my face, or too thin, where my face feels dry again 10 minutes later, but Simple left my face feeling soft and juust right.  </li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve really needed is a basic moisturizer to put on at night when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup to follow up my topical salicylic acid treatment with, which usually dries out and irritates my skin if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer afterwards to not only restore moisture to my skin but also sooth it from the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips will break out in a rash due to products used around them, not even directly on them, so I am always on the look-out for products that don&#x27;t cause any problems.  </li>
            <li> But a few more uses after that I noticed that with the warmth little red spots would appear and stay at the skins surface for about five to ten minutes; and leave noticeable little bumps after they receded.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that once I started using it my skin overall wasn&#x27;t as dry the next day after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Works only when my skin is extremely dry, not a daily moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> a lotion is supposed to instantly hydrate your skin and keep it that way all day long.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and have a difficult time finding the right products for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, since I have skin that is oily in places and dry in places and this seemed to make everything oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for dry skin, though.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it as a body lotion,  and it was fine as that,  though expensive.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful products without the outrageous prices of other brands.  </li>
            <li> (I know simple products are usually unscented for sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li> If only I had a dime for every dime I have spent searching for a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break me out or feel like lard or burn...</li>
            <li> so I was really surprised (not to mention POed) to wake up with a few zits on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that was because it was sitting in the bottle for a long time</li>
            <li> It is essential in the cold weather, and is easy to apply on the face without worry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Evan Healy eye cream for my entire face and have never had a reaction, but those little jars are pricey, so I decided to try the Simple replenishing cream.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products by Simple.</li>
            <li> Changing to Simple products has cleared up all my bumps, breakouts, and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry hands, though, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I used this a couple of times but despite calling it&#x27;s self a 24 hour cream,  my skin felt dry and scratchy after a couple of hours</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get dry and flaky during the winter months, and that&#x27;s not happening since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product the moisturizer dry out in the bottle .</li>
            <li> It just works, for someone with dry skin who is of northern Euro extraction (like me)</li>
            <li> blotchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> and I was happier with this one for alleviating my dry face when I wake up in the winter desert-dry heat in my house.</li>
            <li> Need richer cream for my dry skin at night.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve got dry skin it does take time to heal it and then you have to keep up with protecting it and keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of one thing negative, even the price is decent.</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it on my face a few hours after the initial application.</li>
            <li> It also has lasted me a very long time!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little oily but after the winter my skin was left extremely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction just broke out a little and at my age that&#x27;s simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li> and then it turned a little red, even!</li>
            <li> It was only after a few uses that it started giving me a reaction.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel heavy, oily or gross.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen and is too heavy to add this and foundation with sunscreen in the summer.</li>
            <li> However, after a few applications it started showing different reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;m over the cold and my skin is back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, I still feel the burn when I first apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I like that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> finally a moisturizer that works for me, no more flaking&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> But with other moisturizers, my skin would get greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problems out of this moisturizer as some other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for other short-term or long-term benefits, I did not see any after using this for almost a month.  </li>
            <li> just like I had to do with the other one.  </li>
            <li> It soaked into my skin and didn&#x27;t just sit on my skin like lots of other products with sunscreen do.</li>
            <li> I use it in addition to other face creams</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not distracted on trying to rub it into my skin like other lotions that sit on</li>
            <li> BUT,label claims, among other things, that it&#x27;s made by &amp;#34;sensitive skin experts&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Other cons about this product for me were.</li>
            <li> I find it extremely watery for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Neutrogena oil free moisture or similar generic brand, but they&#x27;re bit pricey, and I hate the way the pumps give out when the bottle&#x27;s still almost half-full.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful when using moisturizers because some of them turn my face into a shiny, greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never experienced a reaction like this to any other product.</li>
            <li> New York in winter is not for the faint hearted or dry skinned.  </li>
            <li> There is no protective seal, so I am going to naively assume that it was not tampered with or used by anyone else prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li> Probably the biggest complaint I have overall</li>
            <li> Other than that, this moisturizer is one of the few that hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning and wash my face, a slight residue can still be detected when the water contacts</li>
            <li> The lotion also has a slightly greasy feel to I, altho</li>
            <li> I tried using less of the product</li>
            <li> I was doubt about weird smell(like old wet clothing or baby&#x27;s vomit?)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I had a head cold</li>
            <li> but now it can get a tad dry and especially with winter here and the heat on and the dry cold air.</li>
            <li> Sadly this moisturizer was not sensitive enough for my skin</li>
            <li> and then I get little bumps on my face</li>
            <li> , greasy feel to it; but after a few applications she got used to it.</li>
            <li> Add that I can put it on a few minutes before makeup and</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now everyday</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is lite, helps make up go on smoothly, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Having trouble with mine face skin, this company was recomended to me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer kept my face hydrated all day and did not feel heavy after I applied make-up.</li>
            <li> do have to reapply it a few times on my hands</li>
            <li> I find that it has a heavy almost waxy/silicon mask like way of sitting on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since was an all natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding moisturizers that did not leave my skin feeling greasy or that were really heavy.</li>
            <li> and my skin was a little chapped and raw under my nose.  </li>
            <li> This product may work for some skin types but my sensitive skin responded very poorly to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sick of looking for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and have seen a dramatic improvement in the dryness.</li>
            <li> so if i were to just touch my face or try some new product my skin will break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> the negatives - not sure what ingredient causes this,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting my money back, because it&#x27;s expensive at $10.00.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out or get itchy either which is what usually happens when I put anything on my face.</li>
            <li> though is that it is extremely difficult to find just a basic moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen or age defying/anti wrinkle properties to it.</li>
            <li> i have had the MOST HORRIBLE combination skin ever, i shine, i flake, acne</li>
            <li> AND my skin is crazy sensitive</li>
            <li> This product did not absorb well at all, and it felt very heavy and greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> I read some negative comments online about this product</li>
            <li> and I can still smell the soured milk vomit smell.</li>
            <li> After serving my time with some serious literature, I figure I need a break.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so terrible that I am actually embarrassed to go to work and have been hiding in my office as much as possible this week.</li>
            <li> Vish Puri is a little silly, but sometimes that&#x27;s just what I want.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion and year after year would never buy lotion and would barely apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the faint smell of the lotion (which is hardly there)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture, too thin or the smell.</li>
            <li> Sucks!!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have any SPF in it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it did not.</li>
            <li> Yet, unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish and I have terrible skin.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to remove the lid no matter what I tried.  </li>
            <li> 1)It smells faintly chemically.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t subject yourself to this terrible product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to moisturize! :(</li>
            <li> No burning or itching or annoying odor.</li>
            <li> It has a VERY unpleasant smell and sticky texture.  </li>
            <li> but this product gave me horrible, painful allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I used this three times and this is the worst break out I have had in years, maybe I can use as hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the worst.</li>
            <li> Well, it works once you get used to the terrible smell, the burning (face-melting) sensation, and having to reapply 2 or 3 times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Decent, mild moisturizer for sensitive skin. I did feel the need to reapply more often than I would have preferred; I have oily skin so that was a first for me. I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t break me out significantly, and that it travels well in my purse, but I&#x27;m not wild about it. Will probably keep on hand for a backup moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have used the moisturizer and the face cleanser.  Wonderful products without the outrageous prices of other brands.  There are no overpowering fragrances that other products have, which is what made me buy Simple products in the first place.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer alot. It is unscented (no smell) and it is creamy and not oily.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is great, it opens easily, but it also seals well and stays closed, making it safe to carry in my purse</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin and will develop red, raised blotches as a reaction to certain ingredients...I&#x27;m not even sure what causes my reactions.  I&#x27;ve been using Evan Healy eye cream for my entire face and have never had a reaction, but those little jars are pricey, so I decided to try the Simple replenishing cream.  Nope.  I had a reaction and will get my money back.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream, it&#x27;s really moist</li>
            <li> Really great moisturizer, using it morning &amp; night, under makeup.</li>
            <li> After Origins changed their formulas or discontinued the products I used, I needed to find a replacement that was suitable for sensitive skin.  The “Simple” product line was the answer.  The Simple Foaming Cleanser, Simple Soothing Facial Toner, Simple Soothing Eye Balm, Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, Simple Soothing Facial Scrub are gentle, effective, and do not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a basic moisturizer that gets the job done.  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan, since I have skin that is oily in places and dry in places and this seemed to make everything oily.  My wife stole this from me and has been using it every day, however her skin isn&#x27;t quite as oily.  It absorbs quickly and is not scented, although I did notice a light lotion smell, it was not obnoxious. I would not buy again for myself, but I would think that people with normal skin would like this.  It might be to light for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not being well versed in girly matters like moisturizers, I didn&#x27;t realize this was primarily meant for use on your face. I have used it as a grab and go hand lotion, for which it works fairly well. If you have really dry hands, though, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for. It does initially leave your hands feeling kind of silky, but the effect is short-lived. I&#x27;ve also used it to sooth some irritation after shaving. Seems to okay for that.</li>
            <li> New York in winter is not for the faint hearted or dry skinned.  I used this a couple of times but despite calling it&#x27;s self a 24 hour cream,  my skin felt dry and scratchy after a couple of hours, the moisture just didn&#x27;t go deep enough.  I ended up using it as a body lotion,  and it was fine as that,  though expensive.  I might try it again in the summer,  but there was nothing especially appealing about it - not the texture or the feeling or the scent (I know simple products are usually unscented for sensitive skin)  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s not awful but there is so much better out there for me.</li>
            <li> While Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is indeed completely scentless, the amount of stearyl alcohol in the product reduces its ability to moisturize -- at least for my (older) skin.  I live in a very dry and windy state and so I do tend to need a rich moisturizer and do my best to avoid product that list any kind of alcohol in the first few ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I know about skin -- we are all different and our skins will always react differently to moisturizer.  However, I highly doubt that any woman in her 40s or older is going to find this product useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel as if the advertising for this lotion is attempting to describe it as different than most or special but as far as I can tell, there is nothing special in this and it does not seem to penetrate even as well as something like Curel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product --  but it may work well for some so if you can check it out with a sample, you can decide for yourself!</li>
            <li> Like most such products, Replenishing Rich Moisturizer delivers a little less than it claims. It feels good on the fingers as you apply it to your face, and it feels good on your face, but as for the replenishing and nourishment it promises, well, how exactly are you supposed to tell? Maybe I&#x27;m expecting miracles, but I don&#x27;t see how this product, supposedly the number one moisturizer in the U.K., is any different than most such products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both been using this product for a several weeks and like it. It is reasonably priced, fairly odorless, and feels good on the skin when applied. No burning or itching or annoying odor. It is smooth and silky as you rub it in, though not as rich as some of the competition. When I wake up in the morning and wash my face, a slight residue can still be detected when the water contacts my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a good, no-nonsense moisturizer. If you live in a dry climate, you may need to use more of it or get a brand with a thicker formulation. Here in S. FL, it works pretty well. Our skin has not had any drying issues since using it. Will it prevent wrinkles? Who can say for sure. But it has been keeping our skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> I use this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer on a daily basis after I shave.  It cools my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.  There is no scent from the moisturizer which I like.  I highly recommend this as a daily moisturizer for your face.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and she liked it well enough. She said that it felt a bit strange going on at first-- that it had a kind of light, greasy feel to it; but after a few applications she got used to it. Because it is noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic, that put this moisturizer in the plus column. Because it was such a small tube that she tried, she only applied the moisturizer to her face, which is typically what she is most concerned with anyway. It came through as advertised: this moisturizer did leave her skin feeling soft and smooth. The 4.2 oz bottle was not enough for us to notice a significant improvement as far as a healthier looking skin tone.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, and have used and liked this brand before. but this product gave me horrible, painful allergic reaction</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensative and I have to be extra careful about what I put on it. I had great hopes it would willingly accept this product. Unfortunately for me it did not. I had to discontinue use. I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction just broke out a little and at my age that&#x27;s simply unacceptable. I had great hopes.</li>
            <li> Let me start with the positive - this is a great daily moisturizer.  It does exactly what it should do.  My skin feels soft and smooth, and I think it even looks a little more brighter and it&#x27;s tone more even.  My skin tends to get dry and flaky during the winter months, and that&#x27;s not happening since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives - not sure what ingredient causes this, but there&#x27;s a slight burning sensation when I first apply this.  The first time I used this, I had a head cold and my skin was a little chapped and raw under my nose.  I figured that&#x27;s why I felt the burning.  But now that I&#x27;m over the cold and my skin is back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, I still feel the burn when I first apply the lotion.  The lotion also has a slightly greasy feel to I, altho it does NOT leave your skin feeling greasy or make it look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs quickly and is fast drying, so makeup application is smooth and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this moisturizer and would recommend it to others and buy it again!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, it was like any other l. It was only after a few uses that it started giving me a reaction. Put it on my face and lips today, and it immediately started to burn, followed by a numbness in the lips. Would not recommend. Dried out my skin more. A nightmare for someone like me, who has psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I guess this stuff&#x27;s been around in Europe for awhile.  My wife&#x27;s been using this product for a couple of weeks and likes it a lot.  The moisturizer is unscented, and this is a MUST for people like her who have allergies and can&#x27;t use the myriad of scented lotions.  The moisturizer is not greasy.  Helps make skin soft and silky feeling, and lasts for hours.  I couldn&#x27;t think of one thing negative, even the price is decent.</li>
            <li> This face lotion worked great for keeping my face moisturized! It&#x27;s no-odor, so my face didn&#x27;t smell like roses, which I like! It&#x27;s great for slicking on after you wash your face! It leaves me going to bed refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, with a constant lip allergy issue.  This product doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my skin and my lips have not broken out.  My lips will break out in a rash due to products used around them, not even directly on them, so I am always on the look-out for products that don&#x27;t cause any problems.  This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have any appreciable scent and seems to be gentle on skin.  I think it is an adequate general moisturizer, but I did not notice any \\&quot;wow\\&quot; results.  It does not seem to be any more effective than the usual drug store products.  I would recommend it for people who need light moisturizing but I don&#x27;t think it is powerful enough for seriously dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer but it would not make my shopping list. It goes on with a greasy feel. This goes away after it has some time to absorb but gives a much longer period than I like before I could comfortably apply a layer of foundation. Also it has no SPF which is a must for any moisturizer that I buy.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for me.  I have very sensitive and dry sky and it lasts pretty much all day for me.  I also noticed that once I started using it my skin overall wasn&#x27;t as dry the next day after a shower.  It also worked well for elbows and arms if you have some extra.  I always use too much I might as well use it on something.  They are now soft and smooth after using this.  It didn&#x27;t break me out and is very light and pleasant smelling.  I liked it.</li>
            <li> My skin is more moody than sensitive. It is dry in some areas and super oily in others. I have to be careful when using moisturizers because some of them turn my face into a shiny, greasy mess. I had never heard of Simple before, but I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried Simple on my hands and a spot on my leg to make sure it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or gross on my skin. I was impressed with the results, so I tried it on my face too. This moisturizer worked great for me. It makes my skin feel moist, soft and healthy. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel heavy, oily or gross. It also kept my skin feeling great all day long. I love that it is scent-free. I like scented lotion for my legs and arms, but not my face. Plus, the lack of fragrance means my Husband can use it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this moisturizer. It may not work for everyone, but it makes my face (great on the hands, legs and feet too!) feel fresh, moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> i wear it under my make it burn my skin just throw all there product the moisturizer dry out in the bottle .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This doesn&#x27;t make me breakout at all. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive.  Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried before may be great before bed but not under makeup.  Or the smell turns me off no matter how nice it makes my skin feel.  Finally here is a moisturizer that is light, creamy, no dyes, no perfumes, no sting and is not greasy.  Add that I can put it on a few minutes before makeup and my makeup doesn&#x27;t slide off my face and I have enough reasons to buy more.</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t pack enough emmolient for my dry winter skin, this is a lovely light feeling moisturizer that absorbs quickly, has a great texture, and a silky feel. I think it would be perfect for summer, as it&#x27;s moisturizing but not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d call this a nighttime moisturizer for most people, as it has no spf, which is a shame, because it&#x27;s otherwise perfect for summer daytime use. (Tho I suspect the texture wouldn&#x27;tbe so nice if it had sunscreen in it.)</li>
            <li> Best face cream out there for guys.  No scent, goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  It just works, for someone with dry skin who is of northern Euro extraction (like me), it&#x27;s an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of skin care products that are lite and don&#x27;t make my skin look or feel oily.  I really like this moisturizer for those reasons.  My skin always feel refreshed after I apply this every night.  It also has lasted me a very long time! Over a year.  I like that a little goes a long way.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and goes on smoothly, but it had me sneezing after I put it on. Took it back the next day. Glad I&#x27;ll be getting my money back, because it&#x27;s expensive at $10.00. I do wish I could just take the sinus agony though because it is a decent moisturizer. Yet, unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s non-greasy. . . it doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell. .  .. it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. . . it&#x27;s reasonably priced. . . . nice consistency. . . . . Really nice overall product.  I look forward to trying other products by Simple.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this facial moisturizer-it seemed thick and very rich, and I have combination skin.  However, I used it before bed for the first time, and it was wonderful.  Even though it feels very rich when you put in on your face, it quickly absorbed into the skin, and it leaves your face feeling very hydrated.  [[ASIN:B005TI7L6O Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] does not have any type of perfumed scent, it is very effective, and it worked will on my combination (dry/oily) skin.  I would recommend this moisturizer for those with sensitive skin!  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my forties and since forever my skin is mostly oily. I&#x27;ve come not to mind this as my dermatologist says it will keep me younger looking longer than if it was too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have experienced more acne since I turned 25 than I ever did in my teens and to top it off, my skin is sensitive so finding a product that I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate, cause acne or make me look like an oil slick is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this moisturizer. I sometimes get dry patches in the winter and this cleared those up with no irritation, no annoying smell and no break outs. It seemed to disappear into my skin fairly quickly so I could apply my foundation within a few minutes after the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes an hour or more after applying a moisturizer under my foundation and it will \\&quot;reappear\\&quot; and make my face SUPER shiny and greasy feeling, especially my forehead but I didn&#x27;t experience that with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this again because it worked well for me and I like that it contains things that are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea that this was a replenishing rich moisturizer, made with vitamins and no harsh ingredients.  But I found that it left my skin with a &#x27;coated&#x27; feeling.  I have combination skin and prefer something that blends in more completely than this did.  I continue to use it, although at first it made me break out a little (yes, at my age).  But I also need something with SPF and this doesn&#x27;t have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have completely dry skin rather than combination like mine, and if you&#x27;re not using retinal at night that requires you to wear SPF during the day, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I used this three times and this is the worst break out I have had in years, maybe I can use as hand lotion.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves this product! She has asked me to buy more of it. She has tried many different brands but raves about this one. We live in South Dakota and the dryness in winter here can be so damaging to the skin. I am delighted she has found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin and that moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> This is SUPER moisturizing! Really is. And it doesn&#x27;t make you break out. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen and is too heavy to add this and foundation with sunscreen in the summer. My face melts in 80 degrees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 and I try to take care of my face and I like this.  It doesn&#x27;t smell, sting or bother my skin.  My skin looks a little plumper with a bit more color after using it and at 67 that is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish and I have terrible skin.  It gets red. blotchy and dry.  This stuff has really helped a lot.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist.  I have been using it for a few years now everyday and it&#x27;s pretty good.  I use the face wash too.</li>
            <li> Vish Puri is a little silly, but sometimes that&#x27;s just what I want. After serving my time with some serious literature, I figure I need a break. Tarquin Hall&#x27;s books are just fun. (Although you do learn a bit about about Indian customs and society.)</li>
            <li> This is a light, but very moisturizing face lotion for those with very sensitive skin. I use it at night and in the morning before applying makeup.  I&#x27;ve tried many different sensitive skin brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  There is no fragrance and it feels very calming when you put it on.  I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is so light, yet so moisturizing. Only a pea-sized amount it needed and my skin feels hydrated without being greasy. Changing to Simple products has cleared up all my bumps, breakouts, and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> Sucks!! I bought this along with the face wash and it broke my face out into itchy red, bumps. I immediately returned it</li>
            <li> I found this lotion on sale and decided to give it a try. Big mistake. After two days of use my face is bright red, bumpy, blotchy, peeling and painful. I feel like my face has been dipped in acid. My skin looks so terrible that I am actually embarrassed to go to work and have been hiding in my office as much as possible this week. I haven&#x27;t used it in three days and there has been no improvement in the condition of my skin. I do not have sensitive skin and have never experienced a reaction like this to any other product. Please don&#x27;t subject yourself to this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why, but this actually makes my skin drier. Even after several applications, my face started flaking out. What a waste of money. I&#x27;m so sick of looking for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest face lotion I have ever found.  I have very sensitive skin and nothing else works as well.  I will stick with this product.  It is wonderful.  It may have been made for the younger set, but as a 67 year old woman, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Simple.  Just that.  I have sensitive, oily/dry, aging skin.  This product is what it promises to be.  It is nearly odorless.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  It feels rich, yet light on my skin.  It is hypo-allergenic and cruelty free.  If only I had a dime for every dime I have spent searching for a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break me out or feel like lard or burn...the list goes on.  Well, I&#x27;d have a pile of dimes anyway.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and I hope this product isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  It is a FIND!  (There is a trial set for $4.97 that I might get so I can try the cleanser and wipes. Ooh.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other moisturizers in the past, both drugstore and higher end (Aveeno, Neutrogena, Clinique, Biotherm, etc.) and none of them have been as effective at moisturizing compared to Simple while not having a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel. I have combination skin, and this moisturizer is perfect for wearing under foundation. I dislike having too many steps in my skin-care routine, and this moisturizer will be a new staple in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Simple products and they are very recommended by me.  I love that they are all natural and I have already seen a difference.  This is not thick and sits very well on your face and does not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> finally a moisturizer that works for me, no more flaking&lt;br /&gt;and itching skin that I had thanks Simple your great.</li>
            <li> This is nice moisturizer for the winter. It has a very mild scent and it moisturizes your skin without being greasy. I have another product from the health food store and I was happier with this one for alleviating my dry face when I wake up in the winter desert-dry heat in my house.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture, too thin or the smell. Works only when my skin is extremely dry, not a daily moisturizer for me. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I use this and have been very happy with it.  We also like it because it does not have SPF, etc.  Most makeup has SPF.  I personal am not outside as much as I would like so if I don&#x27;t need SPF then I don&#x27;t like to use it because it makes my face oily.  This does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer before and like it.  It is lite, helps make up go on smoothly, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturizers for my sensitive skin ranging from cheap $3 bottles from my local drug store, all the way to expensive moisturizers that I bought from different spas.  My skin gets red and irritated from almost any product, but Simple surprised me.  This stuff is amazing!  Normally moisturizers are too thick, where I feel like I have too much \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on my face, or too thin, where my face feels dry again 10 minutes later, but Simple left my face feeling soft and juust right.  One thing that&#x27;s nice is that there&#x27;s no extra junk in the product, so my skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all from using it!  The one flaw with this product is that I do not like how it smells. I&#x27;m willing to put up with the scent so I can finally have soft skin, but the odor does linger all day long.  I want to give this product a full 5 stars, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I got this to alleviate my psoriasis symptoms. I get dry skin around my eyebrows and I hoped this would be a good alternative, back-up, or addition to my Goldbond lotion that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does the job, I found that the Goldbond actually works better, I had a \\&quot;plateau\\&quot; on this moisturizer after about 6 months in which it stopped working as well (?), so I switched back to just the Goldbond, but I still use this product now and again for touching up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin would likely find it moisturizing enough for them though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this moisturizer left my face feeling. It was very dense and my face was tacky all day. I tried using less of the product but I still couldn&#x27;t help but notice my sticky face all day. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Sadly this moisturizer was not sensitive enough for my skin I still had a reaction to it so it&#x27;s back to Mychelle products for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my skin in any way. I&#x27;m probably on my 6th bottle now. It&#x27;s definitely not for dry skin, though. I have oily skin and use this as my day and night lotion. Much cheaper if you buy on amazon than at the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;Simple&#x27; products! I have very sensitive, dry skin and simple cleanser and moisturizer are wonderful. They have no perfume and are gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> There is no question that there are few and far between skin enhancers that work very well. For new Simple Kind To Skin Replenishing Moisturizer, I was definitely impressed with it. It is a sensitive skin formula that works very well onto the skin, and provides the most intimate skin protection. It can be compared to Olay skin care in the blink of an eye. It works very nicely on my skin, with comfort and quality without the worry of other skin moisturizers. It is essential in the cold weather, and is easy to apply on the face without worry. I definitely was surprised about it, and Simple Kind To Skin is definitely a brand on the rise worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B 1/2+</li>
            <li> Passed the test for my ultra sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for day use, but not for night.  Need richer cream for my dry skin at night.  Otherwise, very good for those with not so dry skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so fresh and the moisture lasts longer! I will purchase again! And recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> I got this on sale at my supermarket because I needed moisturizer and it was on some sort of special deal - it came with a moisturizer, face wash and cleansing wipes in a very nice, large reusable zip up bag, for about $15. I love it! No smelly sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and your skin feels clean and natural after applying. Very very happy with this product, which I bought because all the other creams were more expensive, without even the extra bonus items and bags - just for one, smaller moisturizer it cost more than this whole awesome package, and they had all the junk and sunscreens and perfumes. I&#x27;m so glad I found this one by accident. I&#x27;ll keep using it. I can apply makeup after putting this moisturizer on and it&#x27;s not greasy. I&#x27;m 39 and always had very oily skin but now it can get a tad dry and especially with winter here and the heat on and the dry cold air. But with other moisturizers, my skin would get greasy. This stuff rocks, I will definitely buy again! The face wash is nice too. Didn&#x27;t try the face wipes yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come in handy at some point. Apparently they remove waterproof eye makeup. I rarely use mascara but when I do, I&#x27;ll try them out!</li>
            <li> I received some free samples of this product in the mail and was kind of skeptical as I do not use skin care products so I am not very knowledgeable on the subject. I usually just wash my face with water and leave it at that but have always been searching for a moisturizer in the winter months when my skin gets super dry. This product surprised me because all the other face lotions I have tried have felt like a mask on my face, but the Simple Moisturizer was actually very light and clean feeling. It didn&#x27;t have a perfume like  smell either which was good with me. I didn&#x27;t break out or get itchy either which is what usually happens when I put anything on my face. All in all I would definitely consider buying this at the store.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received this product for free as part of a Klout perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped this moisturizer might work nicely on wintertime dry-ish skin. This stuff is the worst. I&#x27;m 25 and don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin, but this product made me break out persistently. As soon as I switched back to [[ASIN:B000052ZB8 Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Combination Skin, 4 Ounce]], I noticed an improvement and my skin was acne-free quite quickly. Thanks, Simple, for greatly strengthening my Neutrogena brand loyalty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problems out of this moisturizer as some other reviewers have. I like the faint smell of the lotion (which is hardly there) and I had very chapped, severe, dry, facial skin the other day and that is why I picked this up (I bought it at wal-mart not on here) anyway, I&#x27;ve used it and it didn&#x27;t burn my skin and I was surprised because I was expecting it to burn a bit because of how chapped my face felt &amp; it has not caused me any acne either. This is hypoallergenic, and it is also supposed to not give you pimples, etc...and I&#x27;ve had no problem. I do not feel that this is greasy at all it is a very light lotion and for how dry my skin is, it is moisturizing it. I think people expect too much sometimes and feel like a lotion is supposed to instantly hydrate your skin and keep it that way all day long. When you&#x27;ve got dry skin it does take time to heal it and then you have to keep up with protecting it and keeping it moisturized. I&#x27;ve used this several times now and have seen a dramatic improvement in the dryness. It just takes time and routine. I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing lotion feels light weight and disappears quickly into skin.  It is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Makeup goes on smoothly over it, but I would never describe it as \\&quot;rich \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would describe this lotion as a very simple (\\&quot;no bells or whistles\\&quot;), and no miracles, moisturizer.  This very light lotion is great for someone looking just to simply moisturize her/his face without any scents or other long-term benefits/miracles.  It goes on light and non-greasy and is easy to use under make-up.  However, if you are looking for other short-term or long-term benefits, I did not see any after using this for almost a month.  The results were similar to using pure aloe vera gel.  I don&#x27;t NOT like the lotion, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> The Replenishing Rich Moisturizer by Simple is a vitamin enriched moisturizer without perfume or dyes designed for sensitive skin.  It is a good moisturizer.  My wife, who uses a variety of moisturizers, liked it.  It wasn&#x27;t outstanding, or anything that made her jump and yell wow, this is the best stuff ever, but then, what moisturizer would ever make one do that.  She says it is good and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three selling points on the box are the vital vitamin Pro-Vitamin B5 that helps restore, soften and smooth, the skin loving nutrients Glycern, Bisabolol, and Allantoin, and that is has no perfume or dyes that could irritate your skin.  It did not irritate, and worked as a good skin moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly small bottle, so you want to use this for face and neck, and not your entire body or you would go through it pretty fast.  If you want a full body moisturizer, you may want to get something that comes in a bigger bottle.  Overall, a good product that my wife says worked fine.</li>
            <li> Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works great. This moisturizer does not have perfume or dyes to iritate the skin. I apply in the morning and my skin stays moisturized all day. I like the fact tha it does not have the extras like perfumes and dyes. I have been using a while and I am ver satisfied with this moisturizer. This moisturizer works just as well as some of the othr higher prized moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer but nothing to write home about. It left my skin feeling very sticky even an hour after applied. I only use it at night because of this. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is soooo perfect for my face!! Super great leaving your skin soft and smooth without the drying effects and chemicals. Really great for those with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> After finishing a bottle of [[ASIN:B005TI7L7I Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] which I liked very much, I this time purchased the [[ASIN:B005TI7L6O Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]] for a change.  This one contains a single Vitamin and the other has two, but all other descriptions are very close to the same as far as being simple, just like the name of the product line.  The bottles are exactly the same shape and size, so I&#x27;m prepared to have to turn this one upside down when the product is nearing its end, just like I had to do with the other one.  I was unable to remove the lid no matter what I tried.  I&#x27;m really liking this affordable facial moisturize which has no fragrance and works well on my sensitive skin.  It is a little thicker in formula but is easily absorbed into the skin.  I&#x27;m deducting a star from this review for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Inability to remove the top from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is no protective seal, so I am going to naively assume that it was not tampered with or used by anyone else prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for a great price. No frills product just keeps your face hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> It is simple and nice, moizturizes my skin well and does not feel dry and stretchy any more. I&#x27;ve not found a better one than this so far.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. smooth, creamy, light scent, no perfume scent, moisturizes well. Quit using my old lotion. Will continue using.</li>
            <li> Having trouble with mine face skin, this company was recomended to me. I do think it&#x27;s good product to buy it more in the future</li>
            <li> I apply Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer to finish my skincare routine. This moisturizer has an SPF of 15 and protects from powerful UVA and UVB rays. I used about a nickel sized amount each time. It smells faintly of sunscreen like all sunscreen products smell of, its good smelling and not overbearing in any way. Its white, non-greasy and light. It soaked into my skin and didn&#x27;t just sit on my skin like lots of other products with sunscreen do. I have used this on my arms and legs and hands and it feels amazing on those parts, too! There is no residue or greasy feeling after. This moisturizer kept my face hydrated all day and did not feel heavy after I applied make-up. I also would recommend this for all skin types, not just sensitive. I got this for free from BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> I received this item for free as a sample and really liked it. These products feel very fresh. I love that they do do not feel oily. Love that the moisturizer has spf 15 included.</li>
            <li> I like this cream but it&#x27;s not quite rich enough for my dry face LOL - one of my daughter&#x27;s uses it and she loves it. It&#x27;s creamy and feels good and clean. I use it in addition to other face creams and I also use it for my hands. I think most people with normal skin would like it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, effective, but light, moisturizer.  The fragrance is pleasant, and it does a good job for much less money than many others.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne &amp; blackhead prone combination skin with large pores that has got to be the most difficult skin type to buy any kind of moisturizer for. I&#x27;m not even going to bother to list all the complaints I have about the vast majority of facial moisturizers on the market... it may take writing a book. I just really have had a rough time for many, many years finding a facial moisturizer that works for me. Probably the biggest complaint I have overall though is that it is extremely difficult to find just a basic moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen or age defying/anti wrinkle properties to it. All I&#x27;ve really needed is a basic moisturizer to put on at night when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup to follow up my topical salicylic acid treatment with, which usually dries out and irritates my skin if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer afterwards to not only restore moisture to my skin but also sooth it from the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is seriously the best moisturizer I have found for this purpose to date. It doesn&#x27;t clog my large pores at all, does a great job at balancing my skin&#x27;s moisture out by hydrating the dry parts without making them oily/greasy and controls the oily/greasy parts so they don&#x27;t get as bad as they normally do, soothes the irritation from the acne treatment, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, leaves my skin feeling fresh and natural immediately after application because it soaks right in, and just generally is EXACTLY the kind of moisturizer I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mostly scentless and leaves no residue behind. As mentioned, it soaks right in to your skin and hydrates it. If you&#x27;re looking for just a basic moisturizer with no fuss to help balance your skin after drying it out from cleansing/treating it for acne/toning/etc., you&#x27;re likely to be very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered a free sample of this not really expecting anything - or even expecting the sample to show up. I never heard of this product before, I just somehow found a free sample offer online and thought I&#x27;d go for it. Well, it really is amazing. I love that it has no smell. It&#x27;s not oily like many moisturizers are. My skin feels very nice after using it. I&#x27;m impressed. I read some negative comments online about this product so I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody, but it&#x27;s working for me so far. If I keep using it and I break out or something happens I&#x27;ll update my review. But so far I love it. And I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Weird burning smell after using it. Almost like a chemical peel or something.</li>
            <li> moisturizes without clogging my pores. used together with scrub and toner, it has evened out the red blotches and brightened the skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this does a great job. I also have sensitive skin and this moisturizer does not irritate my skin or leave it feeling oily. I would definitely recommend this product as well as their facial wipes.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff helps hydrates my skin, but the smell is so off putting I just can&#x27;t use it anymore. It smells like vomit. I even tried putting a scented lotion over it and I can still smell the soured milk vomit smell.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dry sensitive skin. This products is kind of watery feeling and doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft or moisturized. My coco butter lotion works way better than this stuff. The only thing I liked about was that it didn&#x27;t bother my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people rave about this product and how nicely it works for them. That makes me kind of sad because I wish it worked for me but it just doesn&#x27;t. First of all, I would like to explain my skin. I&#x27;m young, with no aging at all. I have extremely sensitive skin, mostly because I have been suffering with eczema all my life. I&#x27;m super duper pale, if that helps. And lastly, my skin is super dry in the winter and oily-combination in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this, last December, I bought it because it claimed to be for sensitive skin and help my dryness. I thought it would be my holy grail. I decided to use it at night because it was a rich moisturizer that I thought was going to be too heavy for daytime use, and because it has no SPF. The first time I used it was after a shower, meaning I washed off my makeup and used a cleanser and a scrub to exfoliate. I smelled it, no smell. This was a good sign for me. Then I applied it lightly to my face and it burned. It burned like nobodies business. It made my face slightly red. Eventually, the burning stopped. But I figured, maybe my skin just wasn&#x27;t used to it. I continued to try it but it still leaves a burning sensation every time I use it after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, it doesn&#x27;t relieve any dryness for my skin. I have to apply it two, sometimes three times in a row (after the burning stops) to get it to somewhat moisturize my skin for an hour. Not 12 hours like it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I am suspicious that it doesn&#x27;t work for my skin because the first ingredient is \\&quot;Water\\&quot; and because I have eczema that is always triggered by moisture and water, it just irritates my skin too much for me to use it.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame to hear that it works so well for others, but not me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I forgot my normal moisturizer at the hotel when traveling and needed to get a quick replacement. I have very dry/very sensitive skin. This product did not absorb well at all, and it felt very heavy and greasy on my face. After using for a few days I began to break out significantly on my chin area. This product may work for some skin types but my sensitive skin responded very poorly to this product. I threw the remainder of the bottle away and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> i have had the MOST HORRIBLE combination skin ever, i shine, i flake, acne (ugh) AND my skin is crazy sensitive so if i were to just touch my face or try some new product my skin will break out like crazy. well, i recently purchased this simple rich moisturizer from walmart because cetaphil moisturizer wasnt cutting it with all the sunscreen &amp; this seems to be simple enough for my sensitive skin, let me tell you THIS STUFF IS WONDERFUL!! my skin looks &amp; feels softer &amp; smoother...its well moisturized &amp; i dont shine like crazy, LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I hate lotion and year after year would never buy lotion and would barely apply it to my skin. Each time I would get the same greasy and on top of the skin feeling.  They have the same great scent but same crappy result. I had gotten a sample of this lotion and loved it! I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it made on my skin till it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, and actually moisturizers.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance but it does have a certain smell. It goes away after so it doesn&#x27;t have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to reapply it a few times on my hands but that&#x27;s only cause I wash my hands about 15 times a day. Which is why i needed lotion in the first place. My hands feel better, don&#x27;t have that white and cracked look to them. And I&#x27;m not distracted on trying to rub it into my skin like other lotions that sit on top.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is smaller than I would have hope and really would love if simple made a bigger bottle. Regardless I am buying this and only this from now on.</li>
            <li> Is light and airy but need something with higher SPF.  Also found out my particular skin does not react well to B5 so at certain times of the month when I tend to break out this doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the situation.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It&#x27;s not slimy or sticky!  It absorbs right in the skin! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Neutrogena oil free moisture or similar generic brand, but they&#x27;re bit pricey, and I hate the way the pumps give out when the bottle&#x27;s still almost half-full.  No pump on this brand, so that&#x27;s a plus; figured worth a try.  BUT,label claims, among other things, that it&#x27;s made by &amp;#34;sensitive skin experts&amp;#34;.  Well, I&#x27;m a sensitive skin expert, since I&#x27;ve had it all my life, and this &amp;#34;rich, calming moisturizer&amp;#34; is stinging my face as I write this.  Bottle claims stuff is &amp;#34;perfume free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34;, and blah, blah, blah...  It has a VERY unpleasant smell and sticky texture.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my feet in a pinch.  Otherwise, back to Neutrogena I go.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant skin care line but found that the soap was a bit too drying on my skin; and I was none to pleased when they bumped up the price of the moisturizer either. After seeing the tv adverts when I found this at my local grocery store I was super psyched! Right off the bat I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have any SPF in it whatsoever. I brushed my feelings aside and bought it anyway. The first few times I used the product my skin felt fine; but towards the 4th and 5th usage I realized my face would feel warm after I applied this. I thought it was supposed to do that. But a few more uses after that I noticed that with the warmth little red spots would appear and stay at the skins surface for about five to ten minutes; and leave noticeable little bumps after they receded. I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have acne prone skin so I was really surprised (not to mention POed) to wake up with a few zits on my face. Other cons about this product for me were. 1)It smells faintly chemically. 2). I find it extremely watery for a moisturizer. 3). I find that it has a heavy almost waxy/silicon mask like way of sitting on your skin. I can definitely feel it on my face a few hours after the initial application. I don&#x27;t know if this is the \\&quot;12hr moisture\\&quot; they claim on the packaging but it doesn&#x27;t feel nice. I find myself suffering to get through this bottle as quickly as possible (I&#x27;m putting it on my elbows &amp; knees) so I can buy something better (I&#x27;m thinking about switching to Alba Botanica&#x27;s Even Advanced line). SO in short even thought I really really wanted to like this product I will DEFINITELY NOT be repurchasing it!</li>
            <li> Does what a face moisturizer should do without any odor or subsequent sting to the eyes. Have used it for years and swear by it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is really nice, but it does leave your face a little dewey, which some people like. I use it more on my neck and at night for my face, but only because I like a matte finish.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little oily but after the winter my skin was left extremely dry and flaky. I had been using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for over a year and it (a super hydrating formula) wasn&#x27;t even effecting my face anymore. One night I was fed up and went to my local CVS and bought this Simple product with the intention I would replace it with a higher end product later in the week. I used this right before bed time and in the morning before applying my makeup and after two weeks of the same routine my face has done a complete 180! My skin feels so soft and has a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it that isn&#x27;t oily. I will continue to use this product as it has worked great for my skin!</li>
            <li> I had the exact same reaction to my skin as \\&quot; Jorge L. Benitez\\&quot;! For the first week or so, I thought that I finally found a great moisturizer that suits my skin. However, after a few applications it started showing different reaction to my skin. Whenever I apply it, it makes my face burn and then I get little bumps on my face and I DO NOT have acne-prone skin at all otherwise!! Infact, I felt the same way with the new \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; line of Johnson &amp; Johnson moisturizer. I think there is some ingredient in these new products that they claim as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; that makes my skin break-out although I never suffered from acne otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer daily since I purchased it. It is not sticky or oily feeling. i have very sensitive skin and have a difficult time finding the right products for my skin.  I find that you don&#x27;t need to use alot of the product. I also use Simple facial scrub and eye makeup remover. All very good products.</li>
            <li> It is a very light moisturizer. I have combination to oily skin and I&#x27;d have to keep reapplying so this might work for people with oily skin. Also , even though this product doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent it did smell slightly like plastic. I don&#x27;t know if that was because it was sitting in the bottle for a long time or that is how it is supposed to be. Overall this product isn&#x27;t for me, and I will not be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> This product works! Well, it works once you get used to the terrible smell, the burning (face-melting) sensation, and having to reapply 2 or 3 times. Other than that, this moisturizer is one of the few that hasn&#x27;t made me break out. Once I run out, I will not be buying it again, and will probably switch back to my Origins favorites.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, lightweight, and provides for the basic needs of my skin. Simply great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure for a while if this was working or not. It goes on nice and light, but&lt;br /&gt;after using for plenty of days, i see this is drying my skin out more, not helping&lt;br /&gt;to moisturize! :(</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is supposed to be for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; and it actually irritated my skin. There was a mild burning sensation on my skin and then it turned a little red, even! Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Literally felt like smearing elmer&#x27;s glue across my face. Caused hella breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing special. It is kind of greasy and takes a while to sink in. It also doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough. Do not buy if your skin needs a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> Great product. It works.</li>
            <li> I was doubt about weird smell(like old wet clothing or baby&#x27;s vomit?) of this product when I opened....but after little search on online, just found out that kind of smell is common to these non-fragrance products. Many  &amp;#34;no fragrance&amp;#34; product in the market has &amp;#34;No smell&amp;#34; which means they use something to make not smelly. I guess this moisturizer is 100% original pure product.&lt;br /&gt;I need a time to be comfortable with this smell tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for new moisturizers. I wanted one that did not cause me to break out. I just wanted one that would keep my skin from becoming dry or too oily. This one is awesome and it&#x27;s not expensive.  I did receive it for free from BzzAgent, but after looking at the prices I would definitely purchase more. If you&#x27;re looking for a light-weight, reasonably priced moisturizer, I&#x27;d definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free so that I could try it out. I was skeptical since was an all natural moisturizer. I have always had trouble finding moisturizers that did not leave my skin feeling greasy or that were really heavy. This moisturizer left my face feeling clean and soft, and I have dry skin on my face which it helped with as well. For a busy mom like me it was very quick and easy to put on and I was able to put on my makeup over it without getting a heavy feeling on my face. It is definitely not a moisturizer that makes you feel like you are wearing a mask, it is very lightweight and non-greasy. This is definitely a moisturizer that I would purchase and also one that I would feel comfortable to let my kids use on their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recived this item as a free trial item it works great leaving your face soft but definetley wished it was more amount</li>
    </ol>
