            <li> Although I can get in for less cost on other sites, they were out</li>
            <li> but, I expected it to be at least a week or so before I received it.</li>
            <li> Item just as described, shipping was a little slow; however, the weather was the reason for the shut down of transportation in the midwest and east.</li>

            <li> i am so disappointed in the curve products on here.</li>

            <li> Every time I wear this a woman complements me! This is second only to curve Soul.[[ASIN:B000VOLNNS Curve Kicks By Liz Claiborne For Men, Cologne Spray, 4.2-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Curve Kicks By Liz Claiborne For Men, Cologne Spray, 4.2-Ounce Bottle smells mad good. The ladies really love this one.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the shipping speed. I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take but, I expected it to be at least a week or so before I received it. I believe it came in 3 days. This is the primary cologne my SO uses. When he ran out and started using another cologne, I missed this smell so much that I knew I had to get him another bottle. I guess this purchase was as much for me, as it was for him! It was a Christmas present and as soon as he opened it, he sprayed some on. Apparently, he missed the scent as much as I did!</li>
            <li> I allways use Curve Kicks by Liz Claiborne for men, for 5 years, since everybody tell me how nice I smelled, That makes me feel good That&#x27;s All!</li>
            <li> This cologne isn&#x27;t bad necessarily, but it was a bit strong and a little too distinctive for me.

            <li> Item just as described, shipping was a little slow; however, the weather was the reason for the shut down of transportation in the midwest and east. Arrived in time for Christmas and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Mmm... smells divine!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.....&lt;br /&gt;Totally love it...</li>
            <li> I liked the scent a lot but not the way it came. Might buy again if they improve the way things are handled.</li>
            <li> Excellent. As expected</li>
            <li> I desperately needed this for a Christmas present... Although I can get in for less cost on other sites, they were out so I had to order from Amazon.  It was exactly what I needed, and the receipient was thrilled to get it..  The only negative thing about it was the cost...  other than that, I was completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> spray on cologne every one say&#x27;s i smell so good so i use it every day it really nice to know you smell so good</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift to a young man and he loved it.</li>

            <li> Great smell great price</li>
            <li> Love this Cologne is not strong just what i was looking for n a PLUS the bottle is BLUE !!</li>
            <li> It fades away like 3 mins after it has been sprayed. Scent is good but doesn&#x27;t even last enough for you to leave the bed room to the living room. i have been buying a lot of curve cologne, but i keep changing to different curves with the intention i will get one that actually last more than 30 mins. i am so disappointed in the curve products on here. the prices are great though and delivery is always on time.</li>
            <li> fast shippinig, great product</li>
            <li> didnt like it at all!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smell wonderful and last a very long time. The women love this smell. So men, you need to buy some for yourself and try it.</li>
