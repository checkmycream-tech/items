            <li>Came with 5 good quality (Derby brand) blades and a plastic case.</li>
            <li>so it will make a good travel razor.  </li>
            <li>Razor it good but blade that comes with</li>

            <li>This is a really good and efficient razor.</li>

            <li>I get just as good a shave as anything else and won&#x27;t have to keep disposables on hand anymore.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t even bother to upgrade unless something happens to this one or I see a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good razor to use if you are looking a product that well not give you razor bumps</li>

            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a close but very safe shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver doesn&#x27;t work as good as multiblade shaver I own</li>
            <li>and I love it!   </li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>Im glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li>Just had my best shave in years, this razor is easy to use light and attractive, giving a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>If you can avoid it, good, if not, you do get a travel case for a better razor.</li>
            <li>This razor looks nice and shiney in its case.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I am now hooked on shaving this way.</li>
            <li>A nice product that brings a&lt;br /&gt;great shave.</li>
            <li>She knows that years ago I had this kind of shaver</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed he liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice razor.  </li>
            <li>but it can save money and it shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice razor for the price and it allows the guys to take their time while shaving so as not to get razor burn and</li>
            <li>The double edge razor is of a good quality and a GREAT quality when compared to the price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s butterfly design, this one is easy to change blades and gives a good close</li>
            <li>The TTO is very easy to use as compared to the ones you have to dismantle in order to change the blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild shave and very effective.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the case will come in handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li>I use locally-bought Wilkinson Sword blades, but the Derby blades available here are good, too.</li>
            <li>He loves using this old style and the best part?  </li>
            <li>The razor seems to slips and slides while shaving so, you can easily cut yourself while shaving!  </li>
            <li>good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>also arrived within 3 days of placing the order AND came with 10 free blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a heavier handle but for the price, this is great and very economical.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor, economical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good clean shave, a lot better than the plastic multi blade razors.  </li>
            <li>All-metal construction, easy to handle, grips the blade with a nice bit of curve.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if there is something better out there.</li>
            <li>It requires more time and concentration to use than the newer multi-head cartridge razors do, and for 15 minutes afterwards it feels like you&#x27;ve shaved.     </li>
            <li>Some people here have said that it&#x27;s not aggressive enough for them, but I find the shave to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>A comparable razor was much better 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>I then purchased a different brand and he&#x27;s very happy</li>
            <li>Having always wanted to try old-fashioned shaving I ordered and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a beginner, why pay more.</li>
            <li>If you are spending $10-$25 dollars a month or MORE on refills then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>My shave costs me 17 cents each time and am able to use the blade twice.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it and  </li>
            <li>love using this retro razor</li>
            <li>he says he gets a better shave.</li>
            <li>I love the shave and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>I also love the weight of the metal.</li>
            <li>therefore he gets more shaves from the blade.</li>
            <li>it is ok</li>
            <li>but I bought a 1940&#x27;s gillette butterfly that is better balanced.</li>
            <li>I knew I could do better on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>He says they give him a better shave then</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>The wife says I&#x27;m more kissable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose the shaving factory razor</li>
            <li>but i am pleased with it</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I have bought a total of three, all of the ones I recieved were excellent with no issues.</li>
            <li>This razor is OK and it works.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is a Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>The razor is okay as a reproduction item I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought some used Gillette razors and they fit in case nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is a much better product and gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li>They better and sharper the blade; the better the shave.</li>
            <li>Ok?</li>
            <li>Has a nice feel to it and made of good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Very nice workmanship, and it gives a good shave, even for a DE novice such as myself.</li>
            <li>I like this razor... great for shaving my sideburns and cheeks but not so great shaving under my neck because of razor bumps I tend to cut myself when I use it below my jawline other than that it is made of a sturdy design.</li>
            <li>have a Gillette at home, so I am very familiar with shaving with these types of razors.</li>
            <li>I feel that I got more than I paid for with this razor and the fact that it comes with 10 double edged blades as well is a very, very good deal.</li>
            <li>safe cut and easy to use</li>
            <li>this razor performed perfectly for the money, it was more than expected</li>
            <li>Just remember to not actually put pressure on the blade, and let its own weight do the work, and you will have a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li>All I can say is the case is nice, and the razor looks nice, but I can&#x27;t get a good shave with the single edge blade.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you purchase the correct type to fit.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to find a NEW razor that is as good as my OLD one.</li>
            <li>My razor arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Then it is easy peasy.</li>
            <li>The multi-blades became easily clogged with whiskers and shave cream to make them non-functioning.</li>
            <li>easy to shave with .  </li>
            <li>The case allows for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and replace the blade.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an easy to carry DE experience, I&#x27;d recommend this sturdy &amp; inexpensive razor from the Shaving Factory.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change blades, and saves me a lot of money on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like a strong razor,</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels pretty nice in your hand and comes with derby blades however</li>
            <li>This razer though it looks fine does not do a good job, and I am not sure why cuts a great deal.</li>
            <li>Quality seems to be fine</li>
            <li>it work just fine.  </li>
            <li>cheap but works just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and switch out blades.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought the company</li>
            <li>This razor is a great starter double edge if you&#x27;re looking to dip your feet in.</li>
            <li>The razor opens and closes smoothly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because the blades were cheap.  </li>
            <li>Plastic box is cheap and not well balanced.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>if its scruffy I just don&#x27;t like how blades sold separately but either way it&#x27;s worth the price :)</li>
            <li>Great idea to bring the razor back</li>
            <li>Works well on light hair</li>
            <li>I bought this because blades are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Far superior to throw away razors</li>
            <li>I wanted to provide alittle feedback on this product so far so good.</li>
            <li>You could probably pay a lot more and get a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger, but this is the perfect product for the beginner who is wading into the welcoming waters of classic wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>It would be wise to invest a little more money to get a better product.</li>
            <li>Even using higher quality blades did not make the experience better.</li>
            <li>It does not seem as aggressive as my original razor, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li>would recommend it if you like to clean your blade after each swipe and when you are through shaving.</li>
            <li>It is still the most effective shaving system that only costs pennies that is delivered to your door!</li>
            <li>In a year or so, I might think about another better razor, but right here, right now, this is working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li>had it right!</li>
            <li>way more affordable and a much closer shave than &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li>the fact that its metal&lt;br /&gt;Best shave on my neck , better than my straight on my neck...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but wanted a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to change back to a retro razor, this is a good buy for your money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a *lot* easier to cut oneself than with a more modern design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems kind of loose but tightens up nice when closed, it cleans real easy and is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Very good inexpensive razor, similar in style to the old Gilette models.</li>
            <li>This razor/blade combo is also extremely mild.  </li>
            <li>It is not entirely metal, just fyi and one side of mine came with some extra material; not the greatest manufacturing quality.</li>
            <li>I thought that no one made these any more, but I am very happy to know that I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I have a strait razer which I was using, but though t it would be nice to have a double edge available.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and works as described and the blades they send you with</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a travel razor since the case would give adequate protection.  </li>
            <li>They have tutorials, which I highly recommend, as well as product reviews, and much more.</li>
            <li>Being new to DE shaving this is my first razor of this kind.</li>
            <li>I now use a glycerin bar soap (Neutrogena is a popular one) and an inexpensive shaving brush to whisk up a good lather and use either the Derby Extra blades that come with the razor or a local \\&quot;house brand\\&quot; blade from the grocery store (6 cents a blade) and I get the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>And when I had my first shave it was amazed it was the cleanest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly well built, it came with 10 free Derby blades, and the little case has a mirror inside.</li>
            <li>well worth the effort until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor is nice, but its a bit short.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>not bad ,had to get use to it at first,.</li>
            <li>I thought the plastic carry case was something I would be discarding, but it holds the razor just right.</li>
            <li>the first few times you might cut yourself often lol</li>
            <li>After seeing the prices of replacement blades for modern two/three/four/five-blade razors, I decided that it would be a good economic move to go back to an old-fashioned double-edge safety</li>
            <li>It works, but if you spend just a little more  money you can get a better product.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave quickly with no nicks.</li>
            <li>easy to clean, blades last 4-5 times longer than mach 3&#x27;s or disposable.</li>
            <li>The product came in early and it actually shaves your face really good</li>
            <li>I myself was very impressed with sturdiness of how this razor is made, because when you buy a product for such a low price you don&#x27;t expect much, but this razor surprised me!</li>
            <li>These little razors are a really good deal.</li>
            <li>When I first got the razor I did get a nick or two</li>
            <li>First, the case that it comes in includes an inside mirror</li>
            <li>Funny...</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>up after first time?????????????????</li>
            <li>I will try what my father and grand father used  and update the results later.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like the newer ones on market now with the double blades or triple blades.</li>
            <li>This type of razor (safety razor) is great for avoiding minor nicks and is low maintenance in comparison to multi blade rivals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will keep it but probably look for something more substantial in the future.</li>
            <li>It twists open at the top which is neat.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at a national beauty supply chain, and got this exact DE safety razor sans the fancy box.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Good produt for just a few dollars</li>
            <li>The razor is extremely light, especially compared to the vintage Gillette Super Speeds it is meant to resemble.  </li>
            <li>It just plain feels good in you hands with its hefty weight.</li>
            <li>I have been using a friends old Gillette double edge razor, and it was so nice</li>
            <li>liked using the old Gillette, and especially after I had switched to using Schick&#x27;s no-longer made 2002 razor blades (the name was meant to seem modern in the 1970s, the copyright on the packages was 1979).</li>
            <li>The head seems to large for the blade or something</li>
            <li>I can see this being good for new DE shavers scared of cutting their face, but anyone able to build their technique will quickly outgrow this razor unless they pair it with a much sharper blade.      </li>
            <li>I was surprised how good of a shave u get and with less pain</li>
            <li>Try a new blade right from the get-go.</li>
            <li>The extra blades were fine as well as the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly because of</li>
            <li>With the amount of money that I spent in one year on replacement cartridges for the fusion, I got a good shaving brush, the Murker razor, 100 shark blades (each blade easily lasts over a week), and several different types of shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li>the handle is a bit short and its hard to twist open to rinse the blade while your fingers are wet, but that said great razor well made great price</li>
            <li>It seems a much sharper blade would need to be paired with this razor to get a close shave in 2 passes.  </li>
            <li>I like this so much....</li>
            <li>DE blades are much friendlier on you wallet and the environment.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the double edge razor, as it provides closer shave then those 3-5 blade razors.</li>
            <li>Besides, the blades last for weeks, and overall it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a very volatile tool with a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li>I used the blades alone and needed a whole tissue box to nurse my cuts.</li>
            <li>I received the razor in an reasonable amount of time after my order was placed.</li>
            <li>The learning curve was fast.  </li>
            <li>I got nicked way too much.</li>
            <li>I quit using the modern, multi-bladed, disposable razors for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li>The one I use is a real pleasure when I&#x27;m in a hurry and not wanting something as aggressive as my Merkur.</li>
            <li>Because of the case, it is very convenient and portable.</li>
            <li>Have used this item and it performs very well.</li>
            <li>Seems to be constructed very well.</li>
            <li>Price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>Every Man should be using this in conjunction with modern razors, us e</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It has too much play in it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend spending around $30 and it will be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after shaving a few times realized that this inexpensive razor was actually of really nice quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally find a double-edge razor for my daughter!  </li>
            <li>A great, inexpensive entry point for those new to traditional, old school wet shaving.</li>
            <li>this by far is the best razor ive had in a long long time,but u have to use shaving cream,, i tend to dry shave</li>
            <li>My son loves his razor so much that now my boyfriend wants a new razor as well</li>
            <li>I blow the water out of the razor as best I can and then wipe the edges of the blade on the paper towel to remove any remaining hair and water drops then replace the blade in the razor and put it back into the hard case for next time.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice in the hand, weighs a good weight, twists open easily and closes tightly, and comes with a travel case with a small mirror inside and a single sample blade.</li>
            <li>Good value, stainless steel, heavy, handle could be longer for larger hands.  </li>
            <li>but with this ull tear the crap outta ur face if you dont use shaving cream,, its a nice product easy to use, has a twist nob on bottom to open &amp;#34;blade flaps?&amp;#34; comes in a nice plastic box with a mirror inside</li>
            <li>I got it because of the unreasonably high prices of Fusion razor blades.      </li>
            <li>I would recommend a septic stick, because you most likely will nick yourself the first few times at first.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a saftey razor before, I would highly recommend it if you have issues with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Good quality metal, but screw action to open and close the blade holder is a little &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not has comfortable in my hand as the one I paid $70 for, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush and soap for a few months and this is the icing on top.</li>
            <li>It does take patience to shave with a double edge razor but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a few reviews saying they were cut by this razor when shaving; in response, make sure you buy a quality blade.</li>
            <li>Until I have to use it for travel, I will use it at home to see how well it holds up under normal use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this razor, but I think I&#x27;ll end up with a vintage Gillette (probably a Super Adjustable) in the near future.  </li>
            <li>Multiblade disposables just filled up with hair under the blades and I had to go over the same areas again and again to get anything approaching a decent shave.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cheap safety razor just get a Parker or merkur for a few bucks extra because it will last you a lot longer and shave a lot better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new the world of safety razors so take this review for what that&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the product and if you&#x27;re new to the world of safety razors then give this inexpensive model a go.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re new to using this type of razor, take care.  </li>
            <li>It handles easily, cleans in a flash, blades are cheaper and less wasteful than the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and last for long time.</li>
            <li>Looking back, I could have done better for the same money buying individual items.    </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Today he used it for the first time and he came out of the bathroom with multiple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have other razors, I might not notice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the weight as the original Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>This is my first double edged razor.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for travel purposes only, and it will definitely work for that.</li>
            <li>If you are buying a double edged razer spend the extra few bucks and get a good one, Parker etc.</li>
            <li>I have a thick heavy beard and have tried multiple razors gillette fusion, straight razors, and many more.</li>
            <li>I know I need to build some technique over time, but this razor has fairly minimal blade exposure and a deep blade angle, leading to a very mild shave.  </li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better than buying those super expensive razors at the store.</li>
            <li>the part that twists open at the top looked a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>I would have been much happier starting with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I really like the double edge razors, but not this one.</li>
            <li>Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li>The quality surprised me.</li>
            <li>If this thing is as sturdy as it looks and feels, I&#x27;ll be using it well into old age.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>He used as young.</li>
            <li>shaves now cost me $.25 of a penny ( 4 shaves &#x3D; 1 penny), instead of $1.00/shave plus a considerably smoother shave.</li>
            <li>: When it arrived, the metal plug at the end of the handle had fallen out, but a bit of superglue fixed that.  </li>
            <li>It does tarnish/stain fairly easily, so frequent cleaning is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for all adult men that shave</li>
            <li>Old 1950&#x27;s style.</li>
            <li>Pay an extra $5 or $10 and get a much better razor than the other low end items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I bought was very cheap bit difficult to load because I had to unscrew the handle and dismantle the head to change blades.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So when I found the Shaving Factory double edge razor for such a reasonable price I had to buy one for my son and he loves it!</li>
            <li>I got this razor because it was inexpensive and since i was new to de wet shaving i didnt want to spend too much</li>
            <li>Overall, you have to be careful and re-learn proper shaving techniques but the shave is a SMOOTH one and</li>
            <li>I wish some small scale company would consider this concept again.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Shaving Factory is a pretty well-made razor, much like my old Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have used it one time and it does exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>If after I put a blade in this razor I only \\&quot;close the doors\\&quot; so that very little pressure is holding them shut the blade edge will be further away from the razors edge and thus more aggressive (a closer shave).</li>
            <li>I received this item exactly as described and on the first day of the expected delivery range, even with the previous day being a holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using the normal way of shaving and other ways the product did not shave me very well at all, I had to go back to my throw away razors which did the job.</li>
            <li>He has only had it a few weeks, but he loves how he can clean the blade after each use so</li>
            <li>The razor is sharp, and if you are careful enough, it is easy to use without injury.</li>
            <li>much thinner than we expected in construction.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useable but just barely.  </li>
            <li>But temporary irritation and a few nicks is well worth the savings I&#x27;ll make up in blades.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten tired of paying 15$ and more for refill blades .  </li>
            <li>My normal procedure is to dry my face after shaving with a paper towel</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has used a butterfly double edged razor similar to this one for many years due to it&#x27;s mechanical convenience and performance and simply because he can&#x27;t use anything else due to the coarseness of his beard.</li>
            <li>without the blade installed it is very safe to use but leaves some beard behind, not a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The handle was awkwardly short and thick at first compared to the sleeker and longer cartridge razor handle, but I soon grew accustomed to the new razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new DE shaver but have been wet shaving for awhile and have experience with brush/soap/creme lathering technique.  </li>
            <li>the first few times I used it, but I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to using a disposable razor - granddad</li>
            <li>Easy to use and WAY less expensive than the new high tech disposable razors.</li>
            <li>So far the razor has worked well and has shown no tendency for anything to come loose or break.</li>
            <li>I was tired of paying 10$ for refills, replacement blades for this can be bought locally and it shaves just fine.</li>
            <li>Just be very careful with a new blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, the good outweighs the bad, so if you&#x27;re on the go, this is the handle to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too bad we retired a good shaving system for throw away razors.</li>

            <li> and I love it!   </li>
            <li> love it!  </li>
            <li> Im glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> Just had my best shave in years, this razor is easy to use light and attractive, giving a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> If you can avoid it, good, if not, you do get a travel case for a better razor.</li>
            <li> This razor looks nice and shiney in its case.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I am now hooked on shaving this way.</li>
            <li> A nice product that brings a&lt;br /&gt;great shave.</li>
            <li> She knows that years ago I had this kind of shaver</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed he liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  </li>
            <li> but it can save money and it shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice razor for the price and it allows the guys to take their time while shaving so as not to get razor burn and</li>
            <li> The double edge razor is of a good quality and a GREAT quality when compared to the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s butterfly design, this one is easy to change blades and gives a good close</li>
            <li> The TTO is very easy to use as compared to the ones you have to dismantle in order to change the blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild shave and very effective.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the case will come in handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I use locally-bought Wilkinson Sword blades, but the Derby blades available here are good, too.</li>
            <li> He loves using this old style and the best part?  </li>
            <li> The razor seems to slips and slides while shaving so, you can easily cut yourself while shaving!  </li>
            <li> good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> also arrived within 3 days of placing the order AND came with 10 free blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a heavier handle but for the price, this is great and very economical.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, economical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave, a lot better than the plastic multi blade razors.  </li>
            <li> All-metal construction, easy to handle, grips the blade with a nice bit of curve.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if there is something better out there.</li>
            <li> It requires more time and concentration to use than the newer multi-head cartridge razors do, and for 15 minutes afterwards it feels like you&#x27;ve shaved.     </li>
            <li> Some people here have said that it&#x27;s not aggressive enough for them, but I find the shave to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> A comparable razor was much better 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I then purchased a different brand and he&#x27;s very happy</li>
            <li> Having always wanted to try old-fashioned shaving I ordered and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a beginner, why pay more.</li>
            <li> If you are spending $10-$25 dollars a month or MORE on refills then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> My shave costs me 17 cents each time and am able to use the blade twice.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it and  </li>
            <li> love using this retro razor</li>
            <li> he says he gets a better shave.</li>
            <li> I love the shave and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> I also love the weight of the metal.</li>
            <li> therefore he gets more shaves from the blade.</li>
            <li> it is ok</li>
            <li> but I bought a 1940&#x27;s gillette butterfly that is better balanced.</li>
            <li> I knew I could do better on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> He says they give him a better shave then</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> The wife says I&#x27;m more kissable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I chose the shaving factory razor</li>
            <li> but i am pleased with it</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I have bought a total of three, all of the ones I recieved were excellent with no issues.</li>
            <li> This razor is OK and it works.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is a Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay as a reproduction item I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I have since bought some used Gillette razors and they fit in case nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is a much better product and gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li> They better and sharper the blade; the better the shave.</li>
            <li> Ok?</li>
            <li> Has a nice feel to it and made of good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Very nice workmanship, and it gives a good shave, even for a DE novice such as myself.</li>
            <li> I like this razor... great for shaving my sideburns and cheeks but not so great shaving under my neck because of razor bumps I tend to cut myself when I use it below my jawline other than that it is made of a sturdy design.</li>
            <li> have a Gillette at home, so I am very familiar with shaving with these types of razors.</li>
            <li> I feel that I got more than I paid for with this razor and the fact that it comes with 10 double edged blades as well is a very, very good deal.</li>
            <li> safe cut and easy to use</li>
            <li> this razor performed perfectly for the money, it was more than expected</li>
            <li> Just remember to not actually put pressure on the blade, and let its own weight do the work, and you will have a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> All I can say is the case is nice, and the razor looks nice, but I can&#x27;t get a good shave with the single edge blade.  </li>
            <li> so make sure you purchase the correct type to fit.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy to find a NEW razor that is as good as my OLD one.</li>
            <li> My razor arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Then it is easy peasy.</li>
            <li> The multi-blades became easily clogged with whiskers and shave cream to make them non-functioning.</li>
            <li> easy to shave with .  </li>
            <li> The case allows for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and replace the blade.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an easy to carry DE experience, I&#x27;d recommend this sturdy &amp; inexpensive razor from the Shaving Factory.  </li>
            <li> Easy to change blades, and saves me a lot of money on replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like a strong razor,</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels pretty nice in your hand and comes with derby blades however</li>
            <li> This razer though it looks fine does not do a good job, and I am not sure why cuts a great deal.</li>
            <li> Quality seems to be fine</li>
            <li> it work just fine.  </li>
            <li> cheap but works just fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and switch out blades.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought the company</li>
            <li> This razor is a great starter double edge if you&#x27;re looking to dip your feet in.</li>
            <li> The razor opens and closes smoothly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because the blades were cheap.  </li>
            <li> Plastic box is cheap and not well balanced.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> if its scruffy I just don&#x27;t like how blades sold separately but either way it&#x27;s worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Great idea to bring the razor back</li>
            <li> Works well on light hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because blades are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Far superior to throw away razors</li>
            <li> I wanted to provide alittle feedback on this product so far so good.</li>
            <li> You could probably pay a lot more and get a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger, but this is the perfect product for the beginner who is wading into the welcoming waters of classic wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> It would be wise to invest a little more money to get a better product.</li>
            <li> Even using higher quality blades did not make the experience better.</li>
            <li> It does not seem as aggressive as my original razor, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> would recommend it if you like to clean your blade after each swipe and when you are through shaving.</li>
            <li> It is still the most effective shaving system that only costs pennies that is delivered to your door!</li>
            <li> In a year or so, I might think about another better razor, but right here, right now, this is working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li> had it right!</li>
            <li> way more affordable and a much closer shave than &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> the fact that its metal&lt;br /&gt;Best shave on my neck , better than my straight on my neck...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but wanted a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to change back to a retro razor, this is a good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a *lot* easier to cut oneself than with a more modern design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems kind of loose but tightens up nice when closed, it cleans real easy and is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Very good inexpensive razor, similar in style to the old Gilette models.</li>
            <li> This razor/blade combo is also extremely mild.  </li>
            <li> It is not entirely metal, just fyi and one side of mine came with some extra material; not the greatest manufacturing quality.</li>
            <li> I thought that no one made these any more, but I am very happy to know that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a strait razer which I was using, but though t it would be nice to have a double edge available.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and works as described and the blades they send you with</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a travel razor since the case would give adequate protection.  </li>
            <li> They have tutorials, which I highly recommend, as well as product reviews, and much more.</li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving this is my first razor of this kind.</li>
            <li> I now use a glycerin bar soap (Neutrogena is a popular one) and an inexpensive shaving brush to whisk up a good lather and use either the Derby Extra blades that come with the razor or a local \\&quot;house brand\\&quot; blade from the grocery store (6 cents a blade) and I get the closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> And when I had my first shave it was amazed it was the cleanest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly well built, it came with 10 free Derby blades, and the little case has a mirror inside.</li>
            <li> well worth the effort until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor is nice, but its a bit short.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> not bad ,had to get use to it at first,.</li>
            <li> I thought the plastic carry case was something I would be discarding, but it holds the razor just right.</li>
            <li> the first few times you might cut yourself often lol</li>
            <li> After seeing the prices of replacement blades for modern two/three/four/five-blade razors, I decided that it would be a good economic move to go back to an old-fashioned double-edge safety</li>
            <li> It works, but if you spend just a little more  money you can get a better product.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave quickly with no nicks.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, blades last 4-5 times longer than mach 3&#x27;s or disposable.</li>
            <li> The product came in early and it actually shaves your face really good</li>
            <li> I myself was very impressed with sturdiness of how this razor is made, because when you buy a product for such a low price you don&#x27;t expect much, but this razor surprised me!</li>
            <li> These little razors are a really good deal.</li>
            <li> When I first got the razor I did get a nick or two</li>
            <li> First, the case that it comes in includes an inside mirror</li>
            <li> Funny...</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> up after first time?????????????????</li>
            <li> I will try what my father and grand father used  and update the results later.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like the newer ones on market now with the double blades or triple blades.</li>
            <li> This type of razor (safety razor) is great for avoiding minor nicks and is low maintenance in comparison to multi blade rivals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> will keep it but probably look for something more substantial in the future.</li>
            <li> It twists open at the top which is neat.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at a national beauty supply chain, and got this exact DE safety razor sans the fancy box.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Good produt for just a few dollars</li>
            <li> The razor is extremely light, especially compared to the vintage Gillette Super Speeds it is meant to resemble.  </li>
            <li> It just plain feels good in you hands with its hefty weight.</li>
            <li> I have been using a friends old Gillette double edge razor, and it was so nice</li>
            <li> liked using the old Gillette, and especially after I had switched to using Schick&#x27;s no-longer made 2002 razor blades (the name was meant to seem modern in the 1970s, the copyright on the packages was 1979).</li>
            <li> The head seems to large for the blade or something</li>
            <li> I can see this being good for new DE shavers scared of cutting their face, but anyone able to build their technique will quickly outgrow this razor unless they pair it with a much sharper blade.      </li>
            <li> I was surprised how good of a shave u get and with less pain</li>
            <li> Try a new blade right from the get-go.</li>
            <li> The extra blades were fine as well as the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very highly because of</li>
            <li> With the amount of money that I spent in one year on replacement cartridges for the fusion, I got a good shaving brush, the Murker razor, 100 shark blades (each blade easily lasts over a week), and several different types of shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> the handle is a bit short and its hard to twist open to rinse the blade while your fingers are wet, but that said great razor well made great price</li>
            <li> It seems a much sharper blade would need to be paired with this razor to get a close shave in 2 passes.  </li>
            <li> I like this so much....</li>
            <li> DE blades are much friendlier on you wallet and the environment.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the double edge razor, as it provides closer shave then those 3-5 blade razors.</li>
            <li> Besides, the blades last for weeks, and overall it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very volatile tool with a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li> I used the blades alone and needed a whole tissue box to nurse my cuts.</li>
            <li> I received the razor in an reasonable amount of time after my order was placed.</li>
            <li> The learning curve was fast.  </li>
            <li> I got nicked way too much.</li>
            <li> I quit using the modern, multi-bladed, disposable razors for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> The one I use is a real pleasure when I&#x27;m in a hurry and not wanting something as aggressive as my Merkur.</li>
            <li> Because of the case, it is very convenient and portable.</li>
            <li> Have used this item and it performs very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to be constructed very well.</li>
            <li> Price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> Every Man should be using this in conjunction with modern razors, us e</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It has too much play in it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend spending around $30 and it will be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after shaving a few times realized that this inexpensive razor was actually of really nice quality.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally find a double-edge razor for my daughter!  </li>
            <li> A great, inexpensive entry point for those new to traditional, old school wet shaving.</li>
            <li> this by far is the best razor ive had in a long long time,but u have to use shaving cream,, i tend to dry shave</li>
            <li> My son loves his razor so much that now my boyfriend wants a new razor as well</li>
            <li> I blow the water out of the razor as best I can and then wipe the edges of the blade on the paper towel to remove any remaining hair and water drops then replace the blade in the razor and put it back into the hard case for next time.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice in the hand, weighs a good weight, twists open easily and closes tightly, and comes with a travel case with a small mirror inside and a single sample blade.</li>
            <li> Good value, stainless steel, heavy, handle could be longer for larger hands.  </li>
            <li> but with this ull tear the crap outta ur face if you dont use shaving cream,, its a nice product easy to use, has a twist nob on bottom to open &amp;#34;blade flaps?&amp;#34; comes in a nice plastic box with a mirror inside</li>
            <li> I got it because of the unreasonably high prices of Fusion razor blades.      </li>
            <li> I would recommend a septic stick, because you most likely will nick yourself the first few times at first.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a saftey razor before, I would highly recommend it if you have issues with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Good quality metal, but screw action to open and close the blade holder is a little &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not has comfortable in my hand as the one I paid $70 for, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush and soap for a few months and this is the icing on top.</li>
            <li> It does take patience to shave with a double edge razor but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few reviews saying they were cut by this razor when shaving; in response, make sure you buy a quality blade.</li>
            <li> Until I have to use it for travel, I will use it at home to see how well it holds up under normal use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this razor, but I think I&#x27;ll end up with a vintage Gillette (probably a Super Adjustable) in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Multiblade disposables just filled up with hair under the blades and I had to go over the same areas again and again to get anything approaching a decent shave.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a cheap safety razor just get a Parker or merkur for a few bucks extra because it will last you a lot longer and shave a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new the world of safety razors so take this review for what that&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like the product and if you&#x27;re new to the world of safety razors then give this inexpensive model a go.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re new to using this type of razor, take care.  </li>
            <li> It handles easily, cleans in a flash, blades are cheaper and less wasteful than the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and last for long time.</li>
            <li> Looking back, I could have done better for the same money buying individual items.    </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Today he used it for the first time and he came out of the bathroom with multiple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have other razors, I might not notice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the weight as the original Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> This is my first double edged razor.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for travel purposes only, and it will definitely work for that.</li>
            <li> If you are buying a double edged razer spend the extra few bucks and get a good one, Parker etc.</li>
            <li> I have a thick heavy beard and have tried multiple razors gillette fusion, straight razors, and many more.</li>
            <li> I know I need to build some technique over time, but this razor has fairly minimal blade exposure and a deep blade angle, leading to a very mild shave.  </li>
            <li> MUCH MUCH better than buying those super expensive razors at the store.</li>
            <li> the part that twists open at the top looked a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I would have been much happier starting with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I really like the double edge razors, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> The quality surprised me.</li>
            <li> If this thing is as sturdy as it looks and feels, I&#x27;ll be using it well into old age.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> He used as young.</li>
            <li> shaves now cost me $.25 of a penny ( 4 shaves &#x3D; 1 penny), instead of $1.00/shave plus a considerably smoother shave.</li>
            <li> : When it arrived, the metal plug at the end of the handle had fallen out, but a bit of superglue fixed that.  </li>
            <li> It does tarnish/stain fairly easily, so frequent cleaning is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for all adult men that shave</li>
            <li> Old 1950&#x27;s style.</li>
            <li> Pay an extra $5 or $10 and get a much better razor than the other low end items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I bought was very cheap bit difficult to load because I had to unscrew the handle and dismantle the head to change blades.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So when I found the Shaving Factory double edge razor for such a reasonable price I had to buy one for my son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I got this razor because it was inexpensive and since i was new to de wet shaving i didnt want to spend too much</li>
            <li> Overall, you have to be careful and re-learn proper shaving techniques but the shave is a SMOOTH one and</li>
            <li> I wish some small scale company would consider this concept again.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Shaving Factory is a pretty well-made razor, much like my old Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have used it one time and it does exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> If after I put a blade in this razor I only \\&quot;close the doors\\&quot; so that very little pressure is holding them shut the blade edge will be further away from the razors edge and thus more aggressive (a closer shave).</li>
            <li> I received this item exactly as described and on the first day of the expected delivery range, even with the previous day being a holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using the normal way of shaving and other ways the product did not shave me very well at all, I had to go back to my throw away razors which did the job.</li>
            <li> He has only had it a few weeks, but he loves how he can clean the blade after each use so</li>
            <li> The razor is sharp, and if you are careful enough, it is easy to use without injury.</li>
            <li> much thinner than we expected in construction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useable but just barely.  </li>
            <li> But temporary irritation and a few nicks is well worth the savings I&#x27;ll make up in blades.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten tired of paying 15$ and more for refill blades .  </li>
            <li> My normal procedure is to dry my face after shaving with a paper towel</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has used a butterfly double edged razor similar to this one for many years due to it&#x27;s mechanical convenience and performance and simply because he can&#x27;t use anything else due to the coarseness of his beard.</li>
            <li> without the blade installed it is very safe to use but leaves some beard behind, not a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The handle was awkwardly short and thick at first compared to the sleeker and longer cartridge razor handle, but I soon grew accustomed to the new razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new DE shaver but have been wet shaving for awhile and have experience with brush/soap/creme lathering technique.  </li>
            <li> the first few times I used it, but I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to using a disposable razor - granddad</li>
            <li> Easy to use and WAY less expensive than the new high tech disposable razors.</li>
            <li> So far the razor has worked well and has shown no tendency for anything to come loose or break.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying 10$ for refills, replacement blades for this can be bought locally and it shaves just fine.</li>
            <li> Just be very careful with a new blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, the good outweighs the bad, so if you&#x27;re on the go, this is the handle to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad we retired a good shaving system for throw away razors.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying such high prices for modern cartridges so decided to return to the basic safety razor that I started on years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I twist the handle harder the \\&quot;doors\\&quot; will press down more on the blade edge making the blade angle less aggressive (less prone to nick or cut skin).</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband last year when we went back to using a single blade.</li>
            <li> While the case does have a mirror, it&#x27;s too small to be of much use.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was, as usual, fast.</li>
            <li> Shaved my beard without cutting me and left me satisfied.</li>
            <li> I started out in 1970 or so with a an old Gillette, bought for less than 2 bucks at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Yes, this razor will shave you, but it has been my opinion that if you are going to get a really close and non-irritating shave, you really get what you pay for, buy an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that this will last long before it doesn&#x27;t open and close well due to rust, possibly?  </li>
            <li> so when you use it, 1 side of the blade doesn&#x27;t touch your face at all &amp; the other side barely touches.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone due to the convenient mechanics, overall performance, and especially the price.  </li>
            <li> The doctor said with a little plastic surgery I should be ale to mingle with the general public again.</li>
            <li> I thought this would do the same thing, but it is rough and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a multiblade razor for several years.</li>
            <li> careful and use the blades only in conjunction with the razor.</li>
            <li> Gives close shave, but takes a painfully long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> have been a long long time electric razor user, but I have a wedding soon and wanted to work towards a close shave.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard or sensitive skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> cause it gave me one of the closest shaves in a long time</li>
            <li> (Except for the long adjustable ones.)</li>
            <li> We will be using these for a long time and saving money too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as heavy as the Gillette, so it may not last as long under heavy use, but it does seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> In the first few days I nicked myself quite a few times.     </li>
            <li> It took me 2 WTG passes, an ATG pass, and several touch-ups to get a shave roughly equivalent to a single ATG pass with a Mach 3 or Pro Glide.  </li>
            <li> This razor is not only sharp looking but with</li>
            <li> The only thing I might do in the future is get one with a little longer handle.  </li>
            <li> Just a reminder, when shaving with this razor, (especially your head), be very careful.  </li>
            <li> He leaves the blade out to dry - which he says also helps with the life of the blade (no rusting).</li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth with electric razors and disposables for years using the disposables when I had several days beard as the electric takes all day with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I bought one a few months ago and used it extensively, these are made by the Chinese so they are hit and miss on quality.</li>
            <li> I spent the money and bought a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> The problem is it just seems really loose in it&#x27;s mechanism.  </li>
            <li> No problem, I just tightened it back down.</li>
            <li> He said he&#x27;ll never go back to using any other razor!</li>
            <li> Fusion razor blades cost me $30 for an 8-pack and last a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> The one I have is at least 40 years old</li>
            <li> Would recommend for those that want to start wet shaving .</li>
            <li> A few articles and research later I settled on the notion that a safety razor is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a double edge razor for quite a few years</li>
            <li> so when I recieved my razor I examined it and everything seemed in order everything work as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for a bit and have mastered my technique on this beauty.  </li>
            <li> For the price though, I guess that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I have used various disposable razors in the past forty years (and the occasional electric), but wanted to see if I was missing anything from never having used a DE razor.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I was curious.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, He&#x27;s tired of paying high dollars, for, disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The new cartridges were getting too expensive and hard to find for some of the older systems.</li>
            <li> then I rampaged the other safety razor companies with my masonic pen knife.</li>
            <li> Upon reading alot of the other comments about this product I wanted to keep my expectations within reason</li>
            <li> I have no idea where to purchase them other than by ordering them on line.</li>
            <li> the the other brand on the market  </li>
            <li> It is a little slippery when wet so some deeper art work would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last razor(lords) it doesn&#x27;t cut as close and I think its hard to nick your</li>
            <li> But the double edge blades are hard to find in stores now a days.</li>
            <li> The blades last at least 1 week and average 14-16 cents.</li>
            <li> This razor beets them hands down.</li>
            <li> , that breaks down to less than 3¢ a shave, netting me a savings of $87.82 in one year alone.</li>
            <li> It will be very sharp.</li>
            <li> But as previously stated it is not the smoothest razer, if you want a close shave or work on a bald head.</li>
            <li> However, the typical multi blade razors frankly don&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Works well once your learn how to use it...slight learning curve resulting in number of cuts and slight bleeding.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a vacation replacement for a different brand razor and it was not good.</li>
            <li> The case is convenient, and feels durable, and there&#x27;s a little mirror inside.</li>
            <li> It has a mirror and even a little room for some water for rinsing yet its still compact.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of online demonstrations of how to use it, but still, if I&#x27;m in even a little hurry, pieces of kleenex don&#x27;t even touch the blood flow.</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase this product again, and will definitely be going through this seller for any shaving or hair cutting needs.</li>
            <li> so my beard is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s qualities are not important since it is the blade used that determines the comfort or lack of comfort, not the razor.  </li>
            <li> Well since my son was having trouble with all types of disposable razors, my boyfriend let him try his out</li>
            <li> No more $25 for five blades.  </li>
            <li> The case even comes with a small mirror inside.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than other razors but a rougher shave.  </li>
            <li> I have just learned that I can adjust the \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; of this razor by how hard I twist the handle.</li>
            <li> the newer models to get those hard to get to spots.  </li>
            <li> Over several days of trying to keep from cutting my face, and scraping the skin off my face.</li>
            <li> Just Remember to go slow, but I&#x27;m pumped that I will no longer be wasting money on disposal razors.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the quality control, it seems they do have some bad ones from time to time</li>
            <li> Disposable razors and canned shaving cream are simply ridiculous (no offense meant to those that still use them).  </li>
            <li> If this your first time using this type of razor you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped broken, not made of metal but plastic dipped in metal.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> The combination of a mediocre razor and mediocre brush made for a mediocre combo.  </li>
            <li> Why buy expensive, overpriced cartridges?</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong?  </li>
            <li> Total piece of crap!  </li>
            <li> GET one,you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> If I had known that the razor was mad in Chine, I would not have bought it.  </li>
            <li> Then, about five months after purchase, the butterfly doors just locked and it became impossible to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> BAD:</li>
            <li> This razor will cut your face so bad you&#x27;ll need a transfusion.</li>
            <li> bad quality</li>
            <li> Poor product which gives terrible shaves.</li>
            <li> UGLY</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get sick of using it.</li>
            <li> recommend this type of razor to anyone who is ill and sleepy of paying outrageous prices for blades.</li>
            <li> I had this razor for about 3 months and had some very bad shaves with it.  </li>
            <li> The ad lied and im very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is very dangerous!!!  </li>
            <li> This Razor Is Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this razor and blades as part of [[ASIN:B0032QZXXS this combo]] along with the [[ASIN:B0030JZCLK Shaving Factory Hand Made Shaving Brush (XS)]] and [[ASIN:B002A5OLHQ Arko Shaving Soap Stick]].  It looked like a great starter set for the price.  Looking back, I could have done better for the same money buying individual items.    The razor is extremely light, especially compared to the vintage Gillette Super Speeds it is meant to resemble.  I&#x27;m a new DE shaver but have been wet shaving for awhile and have experience with brush/soap/creme lathering technique.  This razor/blade combo is also extremely mild.  It took me 2 WTG passes, an ATG pass, and several touch-ups to get a shave roughly equivalent to a single ATG pass with a Mach 3 or Pro Glide.  I know I need to build some technique over time, but this razor has fairly minimal blade exposure and a deep blade angle, leading to a very mild shave.  It seems a much sharper blade would need to be paired with this razor to get a close shave in 2 passes.  I can see this being good for new DE shavers scared of cutting their face, but anyone able to build their technique will quickly outgrow this razor unless they pair it with a much sharper blade.      I&#x27;ll continue to use this razor, but I think I&#x27;ll end up with a vintage Gillette (probably a Super Adjustable) in the near future.  The combination of a mediocre razor and mediocre brush made for a mediocre combo.  I would have been much happier starting with the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] and a vintage Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> As a recent convert to safety razor shaving, I was overjoyed with the closeness of the shave this device provided. Then, about five months after purchase, the butterfly doors just locked and it became impossible to replace the blade. So on the plus side the morning chore of shaving has become a pleasure, and I will continue my morning ritual for the rest of my days. I just won&#x27;t spend money with this make again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about eight months and I love it!   I have used various disposable razors in the past forty years (and the occasional electric), but wanted to see if I was missing anything from never having used a DE razor. Wow! Was I ever! What a difference! This razor (and a good glycerin soap) give me the closest shave I have ever experienced, and also save money!  I generally only shave about every three days so my beard is quite heavy. Multiblade disposables just filled up with hair under the blades and I had to go over the same areas again and again to get anything approaching a decent shave. That has changed!   I now use a glycerin bar soap (Neutrogena is a popular one) and an inexpensive shaving brush to whisk up a good lather and use either the Derby Extra blades that come with the razor or a local \\&quot;house brand\\&quot; blade from the grocery store (6 cents a blade) and I get the closest shave I have ever had. I can use the same blade for several weeks!  My normal procedure is to dry my face after shaving with a paper towel and then I open my razor and take out the blade. I blow the water out of the razor as best I can and then wipe the edges of the blade on the paper towel to remove any remaining hair and water drops then replace the blade in the razor and put it back into the hard case for next time.  When I first got the razor I did get a nick or two the first few times I used it, but I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to using a disposable razor - granddad had it right! Disposable razors and canned shaving cream are simply ridiculous (no offense meant to those that still use them).  I have only given this razor 4 out of 5 stars because it is the only DE razor I have ever used and I don&#x27;t know if there is something better out there. So far the razor has worked well and has shown no tendency for anything to come loose or break. I expect to use this razor for years to come.  Addendum: I have just learned that I can adjust the \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; of this razor by how hard I twist the handle. If after I put a blade in this razor I only \\&quot;close the doors\\&quot; so that very little pressure is holding them shut the blade edge will be further away from the razors edge and thus more aggressive (a closer shave). If I twist the handle harder the \\&quot;doors\\&quot; will press down more on the blade edge making the blade angle less aggressive (less prone to nick or cut skin). I still love this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally find a double-edge razor for my daughter!  The one I have is at least 40 years old so I was happy to find a NEW razor that is as good as my OLD one.</li>
            <li> if you drop it, it will break.&lt;br /&gt;great for a travel razor.&lt;br /&gt;still way more affordable and a much closer shave than &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever. I have a thick heavy beard and have tried multiple razors gillette fusion, straight razors, and many more. This razor beets them hands down. It gives a very close shave quickly with no nicks. The blades last at least 1 week and average 14-16 cents.</li>
            <li> Very good inexpensive razor, similar in style to the old Gilette models. Came with 5 good quality (Derby brand) blades and a plastic case. A great, inexpensive entry point for those new to traditional, old school wet shaving. Once you learn how to handle one of these properly, you&#x27;ll get a barbershop shave for pennies compared to disposables.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a vacation replacement for a different brand razor and it was not good. Even using higher quality blades did not make the experience better. If you can avoid it, good, if not, you do get a travel case for a better razor.</li>
            <li> All I can say is the case is nice, and the razor looks nice, but I can&#x27;t get a good shave with the single edge blade.  I didn&#x27;t grow up in the 50&#x27;s when this is all they had. I&#x27;m not use to using one. I went back to my electric and once in while a triple edge razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using a friends old Gillette double edge razor, and it was so nice I wanted one.  I thought this would do the same thing, but it is rough and scratchy.  I really like the double edge razors, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Great razor that feels good on your face. I shave every day and I don&#x27;t get sick of using it. It&#x27;s easy to clean and switch out blades. It just plain feels good in you hands with its hefty weight. Only took about a week to get used to it and not cut myself. what else can I say? I&#x27;m never going back to disposables or Gillette again.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful purchase. I have been using DE shavers for a while now but my wife took the shaver that I usualy use, so I decided to purchase another one.  The TTO is very easy to use as compared to the ones you have to dismantle in order to change the blade.  It feels pretty nice in your hand and comes with derby blades however, I think using a sharper blade (Feather) will probably help the performance.  Im very happy with this razor as it came though. It does the job!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this razor.  First, the case that it comes in includes an inside mirror so it will make a good travel razor.  I got it because of the unreasonably high prices of Fusion razor blades.      It took me a week to learn how to use it.  The handle was awkwardly short and thick at first compared to the sleeker and longer cartridge razor handle, but I soon grew accustomed to the new razor.  In the first few days I nicked myself quite a few times.     It requires more time and concentration to use than the newer multi-head cartridge razors do, and for 15 minutes afterwards it feels like you&#x27;ve shaved.     It also doesn&#x27;t give the close shave like the multihead razors do.      But temporary irritation and a few nicks is well worth the savings I&#x27;ll make up in blades.  Fusion razor blades cost me $30 for an 8-pack and last a week and a half.  That works out to 27¢ a shave.  With 100 razors at $10.99 a shave with [[ASIN:B001ZV67YQ 100 \\&quot;Derby Extra\\&quot; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades]], that breaks down to less than 3¢ a shave, netting me a savings of $87.82 in one year alone.</li>
            <li> I like this so much....good clean shave.  I liked it so much I bought the company then I rampaged the other safety razor companies with my masonic pen knife.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly well built, it came with 10 free Derby blades, and the little case has a mirror inside. Some people here have said that it&#x27;s not aggressive enough for them, but I find the shave to be perfect. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> Just had my best shave in years, this razor is easy to use light and attractive, giving a smooth, close shave. Far superior to throw away razors</li>
            <li> Poor product which gives terrible shaves. A comparable razor was much better 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> Razor it good but blade that comes with it hurts when shaving. Try a new blade right from the get-go.</li>
            <li> This razor is a great starter double edge if you&#x27;re looking to dip your feet in. It feels nice in the hand, weighs a good weight, twists open easily and closes tightly, and comes with a travel case with a small mirror inside and a single sample blade. It&#x27;s a mild shave and very effective.</li>
            <li> My razor arrived very quickly. Compared to my last razor(lords) it doesn&#x27;t cut as close and I think its hard to nick your self.&lt;br /&gt;So the setting is good for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Good transaction.  Razor is fair quality, works well.  It is not entirely metal, just fyi and one side of mine came with some extra material; not the greatest manufacturing quality.</li>
            <li> Great starter razor. Would recommend for those that want to start wet shaving . Provides close shave never buying cartridge razors agian</li>
            <li> Pay an extra $5 or $10 and get a much better razor than the other low end items.</li>
            <li> This razor looks nice and shiney in its case.When my husband went to use it,it simply does not work. The head seems to large for the blade or something so when you use it, 1 side of the blade doesn&#x27;t touch your face at all &amp; the other side barely touches. Maybe this one is defective.I then purchased a different brand and he&#x27;s very happy</li>
            <li> Being new to DE shaving this is my first razor of this kind. After reading other reviews I was curious. Having always wanted to try old-fashioned shaving I ordered and am glad I did. Don&#x27;t let the price deceive you, this razor is very nice. The quality surprised me. I can honestly say I am now hooked on shaving this way. The case is convenient, and feels durable, and there&#x27;s a little mirror inside. The razor opens and closes smoothly. The included Derby blades give a close yet forgiving shave. If you&#x27;re a beginner, why pay more. If this thing is as sturdy as it looks and feels, I&#x27;ll be using it well into old age. Why buy expensive, overpriced cartridges? DE blades are much friendlier on you wallet and the environment.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped broken, not made of metal but plastic dipped in metal. If your looking for a cheap safety razor just get a Parker or merkur for a few bucks extra because it will last you a lot longer and shave a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is a really good and efficient razor. Has a nice feel to it and made of good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Very good tool&lt;br /&gt;Like the fact that its metal&lt;br /&gt;Best shave on my neck , better than my straight on my neck...&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a multiblade razor for several years. I saw this razor and made the jump, finally. A great shave with the derby blades. This seems kind of loose but tightens up nice when closed, it cleans real easy and is comfortable in my hand. Apply no pressure, let the blade do it&#x27;s job. I will get another razor eventually and keep this one in my luggage. A nice product that brings a&lt;br /&gt;great shave.</li>
            <li> Getting back to basics here. The double edge razor is of a good quality and a GREAT quality when compared to the price! Overall, you have to be careful and re-learn proper shaving techniques but the shave is a SMOOTH one and well worth the effort until you get used to it. Then it is easy peasy. MUCH MUCH better than buying those super expensive razors at the store. If you are spending $10-$25 dollars a month or MORE on refills then this is the way to go. My shave costs me 17 cents each time and am able to use the blade twice. so, 9 cents a shave!!!  May i suggest &amp;#34;Wilkinson Sword&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Personna&amp;#34; razor blades. I spend $20 a year on refills. Once you go double blade you will never go back to being ripped off at the store!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only way to go!  I used to like Gillette, Schick. no longer.  This is an excellent razor.  I wanted to try this because the blades were cheap.  No more $25 for five blades.  those days r over.  This razor......5 blades for 1.76.  love it!  I also shave my head with this razor! Just a reminder, when shaving with this razor, (especially your head), be very careful.  Excellent buy!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.Great travel case.Easy to use and WAY less expensive than the new high tech disposable razors. If yoy just want to shave and not have a hair removing experience this is the razor for you.Once you get use to using one blade, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> This shaver was a gift from my wife.  She knows that years ago I had this kind of shaver and I really liked it.  It shaves very close and does a good job.  I thought that no one made these any more, but I am very happy to know that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The price was great it&#x27;s well made for the  price happy I bought it my legs look great thank u</li>
            <li> This razer though it looks fine does not do a good job, and I am not sure why cuts a great deal. I have a strait razer which I was using, but though t it would be nice to have a double edge available. But as previously stated it is not the smoothest razer, if you want a close shave or work on a bald head. If you are buying a double edged razer spend the extra few bucks and get a good one, Parker etc.</li>
            <li> Good quality metal, but screw action to open and close the blade holder is a little &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;.  Razor does work however.</li>
            <li> I love it and  it was what I promise which this product does. It was easy to use and last for long time.</li>
            <li> I received the razor on time. I was worried about the quality if the razor. But after shaving a few times realized that this inexpensive razor was actually of really nice quality. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the plastic carry case was something I would be discarding, but it holds the razor just right. I may be getting my father-in-law one of these soon, since he possibly has an interest in DE shaving.</li>
            <li> love using this retro razor</li>
            <li> Enjoy the double edge razor, as it provides closer shave then those 3-5 blade razors. Besides, the blades last for weeks, and overall it&#x27;s easy to clean.Im glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a very volatile tool with a multitude of uses. without the blade installed it is very safe to use but leaves some beard behind, not a clean shave. Once he blade is installed it just surpasses all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful and use the blades only in conjunction with the razor. I used the blades alone and needed a whole tissue box to nurse my cuts. The doctor said with a little plastic surgery I should be ale to mingle with the general public again.</li>
            <li> Got to used to the 4 blade razors.  Gives close shave, but takes a painfully long time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle for christmas. It arrived on christmas even, even though it wasn&#x27;t supposed to until a week after christmas. My uncle loves it and is actually considering buying another. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> He saw it on TV and I noticed he liked it. Funny...he says he gets a better shave. He used as young.</li>
            <li> These little razors are a really good deal. I love the shave and the ease of use. I prefer the short handle as it doesn&#x27;t get in the way. I also love the weight of the metal. It feels like an actual tool not a plastic toy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! He has only had it a few weeks, but he loves how he can clean the blade after each use so therefore he gets more shaves from the blade. He leaves the blade out to dry - which he says also helps with the life of the blade (no rusting). I received the razor in an reasonable amount of time after my order was placed. Wished I thought to get him this razor years ago!</li>
            <li> well i thought i would save money and go back to a safety razor and received mine to day. Tried it and i have blood sprouting all over my head and it burns some, but i will survive. Donot remember bleeding like this when i used a safty razor 50 plus years ago. maybe some trick to useing the razor especially on my head which is bald.&lt;br /&gt;give up after first time?????????????????</li>
            <li> it is ok but I bought a 1940&#x27;s gillette butterfly that is better balanced.</li>
            <li> Quality seems to be fine and I&#x27;m sure the case will come in handy when traveling.  Delivery was prompt.  I&#x27;m so happy that it works for me.  The learning curve was fast.  Just Remember to go slow, but I&#x27;m pumped that I will no longer be wasting money on disposal razors.  I would recommend a septic stick, because you most likely will nick yourself the first few times at first.  Just wished I started sooner.  Look forward to upgrading when the day comes or getting another one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> this razor performed perfectly for the money, it was more than expected all so came with enough razor blades to last a while</li>
            <li> grew up with type of razor. excellent. easy to clean, blades last 4-5 times longer than mach 3&#x27;s or disposable. shaves now cost me $.25 of a penny ( 4 shaves &#x3D; 1 penny), instead of $1.00/shave plus a considerably smoother shave. given the angle of the blade/razor, had to learn to shave again. recommend this type of razor to anyone who is ill and sleepy of paying outrageous prices for blades.</li>
            <li> I received my razor on time but I did not get any blades so I could not even use it. I had to go buy blades from the store. The ad lied and im very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I had known that the razor was mad in Chine, I would not have bought it.  It&#x27;s qualities are not important since it is the blade used that determines the comfort or lack of comfort, not the razor.  When I find one made in the USA, this item will be placed where it should be - in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new the world of safety razors so take this review for what that&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long long time electric razor user, but I have a wedding soon and wanted to work towards a close shave. However, the typical multi blade razors frankly don&#x27;t do it for me. I have sensitive skin, but wanted a nice close shave. A few articles and research later I settled on the notion that a safety razor is the way to go. The weight of the razor is nice, but its a bit short. It is also critical to get quality blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product and if you&#x27;re new to the world of safety razors then give this inexpensive model a go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.  This product is very dangerous!!!  The razor seems to slips and slides while shaving so, you can easily cut yourself while shaving!  It would be wise to invest a little more money to get a better product.</li>
            <li> This Razor Is Terrible! It Ripped My Face And Neck Up Something Bad. I Would Not Recommend This To EveN An Enemy.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tired of paying 15$ and more for refill blades .  I will try what my father and grand father used  and update the results later.</li>
            <li> This razor will take your face off. I got nicked way too much. It might work for you but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I put it on a shelf and it will stay there.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than other razors but a rougher shave.  If you have a heavy beard or sensitive skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> This razor is not only sharp looking but with a safety razor blade installed it will give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  Just needed to get used to shaving a bit differently from a regular razor but once that is done you are good.</li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth with electric razors and disposables for years using the disposables when I had several days beard as the electric takes all day with a heavy beard.  When I saw one of these on tv I knew I could do better on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It arrived quickly and works as described and the blades they send you with it work just fine.  I get just as good a shave as anything else and won&#x27;t have to keep disposables on hand anymore.  The only thing I might do in the future is get one with a little longer handle.  I got an extra 100 blades for like 10 bucks.  How can you go wrong?  I probably won&#x27;t even bother to upgrade unless something happens to this one or I see a good deal.  Why didn&#x27;t I do this years ago?</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas thinking it was a great choice. Today he used it for the first time and he came out of the bathroom with multiple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before you purchase this product, especially if the person using it has been using the triple blade shavers for awhile.</li>
            <li> Good value, stainless steel, heavy, handle could be longer for larger hands.  Plastic box is cheap and not well balanced.</li>
            <li> I purchased these items for my husband. He says they give him a better shave then the disposable razors he use to use.</li>
            <li> safe cut and easy to use</li>
            <li> I got it for my son and he likes it real good. He wanted one because his Dad had one.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Good clean shave, a lot better than the plastic multi blade razors.  The wife says I&#x27;m more kissable.</li>
            <li> Works just great and real good service.</li>
            <li> I have used it one time and it does exactly what I expected.  Shaved my beard without cutting me and left me satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor!  Great shave, great balance and comfortable.  It does everything a person could want from a double edged razor.  I quit using the modern, multi-bladed, disposable razors for a number of reasons. 1. The multi-blades became easily clogged with whiskers and shave cream to make them non-functioning. 2. I like the idea that I am not throwing away chunks of plastic each time I need to change the blade. If you are looking to change back to a retro razor, this is a good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a double edge razor for quite a few years so I thought I would give it another try and I&#x27;m glad I chose the shaving factory razor cause it gave me one of the closest shaves in a long time</li>
            <li> I looked like I was staring in a horror movie after using this razor.  Total piece of crap!  The razor doesn&#x27;t tighten enough to hold the blade in place. I spent the money and bought a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> Works well once your learn how to use it...slight learning curve resulting in number of cuts and slight bleeding. Bleeding</li>
            <li> I got this razor because it was inexpensive and since i was new to de wet shaving i didnt want to spend too much but i am pleased with it the handle is a bit short and its hard to twist open to rinse the blade while your fingers are wet, but that said great razor well made great price</li>
            <li> I picked this Shaving Factory Double Edge razor to see what a return to the double edged razor. I started out in 1970 or so with a an old Gillette, bought for less than 2 bucks at the drugstore. I used it up until about 1991 or so, when I received a Schick Tracer razor.&lt;br /&gt;I liked using the old Gillette, and especially after I had switched to using Schick&#x27;s no-longer made 2002 razor blades (the name was meant to seem modern in the 1970s, the copyright on the packages was 1979). This was a safety razor blade that was double-edged. I wish some small scale company would consider this concept again.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Shaving Factory is a pretty well-made razor, much like my old Gillette. It does not seem as aggressive as my original razor, but I don&#x27;t mind that. I am using this razor a couple of times a week to see how I like, and on occasions when I am not in a hurry. I don&#x27;t like gouging my face and bleeding profusely, so for now, I think this is the razor for me. In a year or so, I might think about another better razor, but right here, right now, this is working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after some months of use for 1-2 days a week, the razor&#x27;s head started twirling around on the handle. No problem, I just tightened it back down. Then one day, I was wiping the razor head off after using it and the wing on the Twist to Tighten head broke off. It is possible to buy Gillete razors made forty and fifty+ years ago that still do what they were designed to do. Not so this one!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Marine son. He likes the close shave and the storage case that comes with it is an added bonus. It has a mirror and even a little room for some water for rinsing yet its still compact.</li>
            <li> easy to shave with .  i personally would avoid shaving the no no area.  takes practice. but it can save money and it shaves nicely.  the first few times you might cut yourself often lol</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush and soap for a few months and this is the icing on top. Best shave I&#x27;ve had since the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Good produt for just a few dollars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy my wife bought this for me.  Very good for the money.  The handle could be a couple inches longer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, He&#x27;s tired of paying high dollars, for, disposable razors. He loves it. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gave this away as a gift.... He loves it and has retired his electric razor. It&#x27;s not has comfortable in my hand as the one I paid $70 for, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It takes a little getting use to. But it works great and saves you a lot of money from buying all those disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Good razor to use if you are looking a product that well not give you razor bumps</li>
            <li> Does not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few months ago and used it extensively, these are made by the Chinese so they are hit and miss on quality. I have bought a total of three, all of the ones I recieved were excellent with no issues. A friend of mine bought one and somehow the head is lopsided with different blade gaps on each side. The one I use is a real pleasure when I&#x27;m in a hurry and not wanting something as aggressive as my Merkur. I also take it on the road, it works well for me as a travel razor and if I lose it then I&#x27;m out $8 instead of $80. The only negative is the quality control, it seems they do have some bad ones from time to time but I&#x27;m happy with all three I&#x27;ve recieved (two were gifts).</li>
            <li> Probably a good item yet I have not had the opportunity to try product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like the newer ones on market now with the double blades or triple blades. I had to go over my shave with a triple blade shaver.</li>
            <li> The product works well</li>
            <li> This type of razor (safety razor) is great for avoiding minor nicks and is low maintenance in comparison to multi blade rivals.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it if you like to clean your blade after each swipe and when you are through shaving.</li>
            <li> After seeing the prices of replacement blades for modern two/three/four/five-blade razors, I decided that it would be a good economic move to go back to an old-fashioned double-edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set out in search of a handle and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD: All-metal construction, easy to handle, grips the blade with a nice bit of curve.  The case allows for easy storage.  It also comes with a five-pack of Derby blades to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: It&#x27;s short, befitting something made for travel.  Had I know this, I probably would not have bought it.  While the case does have a mirror, it&#x27;s too small to be of much use.  Also, if you&#x27;re new to using this type of razor, take care.  It&#x27;s a *lot* easier to cut oneself than with a more modern design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE UGLY: When it arrived, the metal plug at the end of the handle had fallen out, but a bit of superglue fixed that.  It does tarnish/stain fairly easily, so frequent cleaning is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the good outweighs the bad, so if you&#x27;re on the go, this is the handle to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades?  Those are up to you.  I use locally-bought Wilkinson Sword blades, but the Derby blades available here are good, too.</li>
            <li> I wanted to provide alittle feedback on this product so far so good. Upon reading alot of the other comments about this product I wanted to keep my expectations within reason so when I recieved my razor I examined it and everything seemed in order everything work as expected. And when I had my first shave it was amazed it was the cleanest shave I have ever had! If this your first time using this type of razor you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nice shaver doesn&#x27;t work as good as multiblade shaver I own</li>
            <li> Works well for me,what else is there to say? I would recommend this product for all adult men that shave</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close but very safe shave. Because of the case, it is very convenient and portable. I recommend it very highly because of it&#x27;s proficiency and portability.</li>
            <li> This razor is OK and it works.  But the double edge blades are hard to find in stores now a days. Too bad we retired a good shaving system for throw away razors.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Have used this item and it performs very well. Seems to be constructed very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, this razor will shave you, but it has been my opinion that if you are going to get a really close and non-irritating shave, you really get what you pay for, buy an expensive razor. My favorite is a Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> much thinner than we expected in construction.  don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that this will last long before it doesn&#x27;t open and close well due to rust, possibly?  will keep it but probably look for something more substantial in the future.</li>
            <li> razor does not take standard size razor blades. I did not see that in any description of the product. Razor blades are a smaller size. I have no idea where to purchase them other than by ordering them on line. I can&#x27;t go into any drug store an purchase that size blade.</li>
            <li> I like this razor... great for shaving my sideburns and cheeks but not so great shaving under my neck because of razor bumps I tend to cut myself when I use it below my jawline other than that it is made of a sturdy design. Definitely my emergency go to blade. Easy to use and replace the blade.</li>
            <li> Very nice, it will take you a bit to get used to at the begining with skinning yourself but after you get the hang of it is very nice close shave, just be patient.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a travel razor since the case would give adequate protection.  The razor is okay as a reproduction item I suppose.  If I didn&#x27;t have other razors, I might not notice, but it doesn&#x27;t have the weight as the original Gillette razors.  I have since bought some used Gillette razors and they fit in case nicely.  (Except for the long adjustable ones.)</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my husband. He&#x27;s been wanting a safety razor for 2 years now. He flippin loves it! It gives him the closest shave ever! He said he&#x27;ll never go back to using any other razor!</li>
            <li> I wanted this because multi blade razors irritate my skin. I&#x27;m still learning how to use this without cutting myself but so far I love it. It does take patience to shave with a double edge razor but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors for my sons for Christmas to let them experience shaving with a double edge razor.  They are the perfect starter razor and my sons love them. I thought they were a great value and well worth the money. Delivery was, as usual, fast.</li>
            <li> The product works great. This shaver makes a good gift for any man who is looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shave he gets with this razor.  It handles easily, cleans in a flash, blades are cheaper and less wasteful than the disposable razors.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift. It twists open at the top which is neat. I don&#x27;t know how it shaves though. It didn&#x27;t seem like a strong razor, the part that twists open at the top looked a little flimsy. I guess we will see.  Price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, economical and easy to clean. Gives a good and close shave. Definitely would recommend it.  This was an excellent purchase</li>
            <li> What can I say. The product came in early and it actually shaves your face really good even know you have to go over it twice, if its scruffy I just don&#x27;t like how blades sold separately but either way it&#x27;s worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Every Man should be using this in conjunction with modern razors, us e the newer models to get those hard to get to spots.  You will save a bundle.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edged razor. I bought it as an experiment and it has exceeded my expectations. Very nice workmanship, and it gives a good shave, even for a DE novice such as myself. I also like the travel case, though I can&#x27;t imagine using the mirror to shave.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an easy to carry DE experience, I&#x27;d recommend this sturdy &amp; inexpensive razor from the Shaving Factory.  The case even comes with a small mirror inside.</li>
            <li> This razor is just what I wanted. It a perfect shave for a awesome price!! GET one,you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> the razors of today, I don&#x27;t care for. I used this type years ago. The blades are cheaper. So I bought one for me and one for my husband. We will be using these for a long time and saving money too. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying such high prices for modern cartridges so decided to return to the basic safety razor that I started on years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The first one I bought was very cheap bit difficult to load because I had to unscrew the handle and dismantle the head to change blades.&lt;br /&gt;With it&#x27;s butterfly design, this one is easy to change blades and gives a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived within 3 days of placing the order AND came with 10 free blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a heavier handle but for the price, this is great and very economical.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how good of a shave u get and with less pain the the other brand on the market  Never going back to a mulit Blade again</li>
            <li> I must confess that I did not purchase this product on Amazon.  I purchased it at a national beauty supply chain, and got this exact DE safety razor sans the fancy box.  As to the razor itself, I can simply say that it does what it&#x27;s designed to do, and does it well.  You could probably pay a lot more and get a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger, but this is the perfect product for the beginner who is wading into the welcoming waters of classic wet shaving.  I have been wet shaving for a bit and have mastered my technique on this beauty.  It looks good, does the job, and saves you some money!  I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Proud member of Badger and Blade!</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for about 6 months and thought that I would get this to keep in my travel bag. It works, but if you spend just a little more  money you can get a better product. I currently use the Merkur #180. It is a much better product and gives you a better shave. If you have never used a saftey razor before, I would highly recommend it if you have issues with razor bumps. I used to use the fusion. With the amount of money that I spent in one year on replacement cartridges for the fusion, I got a good shaving brush, the Murker razor, 100 shark blades (each blade easily lasts over a week), and several different types of shaving creams and soaps. You can get a lot of information about this type of shaving on forums such as badgerandblade.com or theshaveden.com. They have tutorials, which I highly recommend, as well as product reviews, and much more.</li>
            <li> I received this item exactly as described and on the first day of the expected delivery range, even with the previous day being a holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Gillette at home, so I am very familiar with shaving with these types of razors. It isn&#x27;t as heavy as the Gillette, so it may not last as long under heavy use, but it does seem to work very well. The case only can hold cardboard boxed razor blades so make sure you purchase the correct type to fit. I have noticed a few reviews saying they were cut by this razor when shaving; in response, make sure you buy a quality blade. They better and sharper the blade; the better the shave. I have only had it for a couple days now, so I will be updating as to how it holds up over time. I originally purchased this for travel purposes only, and it will definitely work for that. Until I have to use it for travel, I will use it at home to see how well it holds up under normal use. Would definitely purchase this product again, and will definitely be going through this seller for any shaving or hair cutting needs.</li>
            <li> not bad ,had to get use to it at first,. shaves close,</li>
            <li> It will shave your whiskers and you skin..I went back to my disposable to have skin left on my face! In emergency situation it will get the job done but it does not seem to follow the contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> The razor is sharp, and if you are careful enough, it is easy to use without injury. Also, it cuts well.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. Over several days of trying to keep from cutting my face, and scraping the skin off my face. It was time to return this shaver. Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Using the normal way of shaving and other ways the product did not shave me very well at all, I had to go back to my throw away razors which did the job.The extra blades were fine as well as the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has used a butterfly double edged razor similar to this one for many years due to it&#x27;s mechanical convenience and performance and simply because he can&#x27;t use anything else due to the coarseness of his beard. Well since my son was having trouble with all types of disposable razors, my boyfriend let him try his out and he loved it. So when I found the Shaving Factory double edge razor for such a reasonable price I had to buy one for my son and he loves it! I myself was very impressed with sturdiness of how this razor is made, because when you buy a product for such a low price you don&#x27;t expect much, but this razor surprised me! I feel that I got more than I paid for with this razor and the fact that it comes with 10 double edged blades as well is a very, very good deal. This is a really nice razor for the price and it allows the guys to take their time while shaving so as not to get razor burn and whatnot and it also allows for a smoother shave if used properly. My son loves his razor so much that now my boyfriend wants a new razor as well and that is what he will be getting for Christmas. I would recommend this razor to anyone due to the convenient mechanics, overall performance, and especially the price.  2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Great idea to bring the razor back,they save money for the customer</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this and it works very well. Just be very careful with a new blade. It will be very sharp.</li>
            <li> This razor works great.  It is a little slippery when wet so some deeper art work would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I apreciate to shave with it. It is a good shaving, but need a good  sharper. It is vintage. Ok?</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband last year when we went back to using a single blade. The new cartridges were getting too expensive and hard to find for some of the older systems. He loves using this old style and the best part?  It is still the most effective shaving system that only costs pennies that is delivered to your door!</li>
            <li> cheap but works just fine</li>
            <li> The razor is of good quality.  He loved it.  It was exactly what he was looking for.  They do not sell these razors in any store, so it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well on light hair</li>
            <li> this by far is the best razor ive had in a long long time,but u have to use shaving cream,, i tend to dry shave but with this ull tear the crap outta ur face if you dont use shaving cream,, its a nice product easy to use, has a twist nob on bottom to open &amp;#34;blade flaps?&amp;#34; comes in a nice plastic box with a mirror inside</li>
            <li> Old 1950&#x27;s style. Easy to change blades, and saves me a lot of money on replacement blades.  A Lot Of Money.</li>
            <li> This razor will cut your face so bad you&#x27;ll need a transfusion.</li>
            <li> very nice for the money</li>
            <li> I had this razor for about 3 months and had some very bad shaves with it.  The problem is it just seems really loose in it&#x27;s mechanism.  It has too much play in it.  For the price though, I guess that is to be expected.  It&#x27;s useable but just barely.  I would recommend spending around $30 and it will be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;Cons: bad quality</li>
            <li> This is a perfect starter razor for those moving to a safety blade. Just remember to not actually put pressure on the blade, and let its own weight do the work, and you will have a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I watched a couple of online demonstrations of how to use it, but still, if I&#x27;m in even a little hurry, pieces of kleenex don&#x27;t even touch the blood flow.</li>
            <li> I bought this because blades are so cheap. I was tired of paying 10$ for refills, replacement blades for this can be bought locally and it shaves just fine.</li>
    </ol>
