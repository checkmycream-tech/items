            <li> The cleanser is creamy and I only need to use a small amount, maybe the size of a nickel and that does the job and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little weary that this is not new</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years.</li>
            <li> and it feels very hard after I use this.</li>

Be careful though, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all and it foams up rather nicely. I use it with my facial brush and I have an amazing clean face afterwards.
