            <li>I have very long locs and these rods worked great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy so far with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>and it curled my extensions just fine:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work well for thicker hair, but I would not suggest for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can leave them in my hair all night and have fabulous curls or waves for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have longer hair than mine you could enjoy them better.</li>
            <li>Very happy, can&#x27;t wait to use them for my center pieces for my wedding reception.</li>
            <li>I use these for my natural hair and they are great, and I love that I can sleep comfortably in them.</li>
            <li>good quality product, thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re not the most comfortable to sleep on, but they&#x27;re infinitely more comfortable than something like Curlformers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Did my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair and they turned out perfect on the first try!</li>
            <li>I did these with NO experience other than a YouTube video and got great results every-time!!</li>
            <li>I got perfect wavy curls using the gray colored ones, I cant wait to experiment with the other sizes and see how those come out.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product for the price, and I would repurchase :)</li>
            <li>The packaging makes it so easy to keep up with them.</li>
            <li>great if you need different sizes, not if you need more of one size than another.</li>
            <li>The Flexi Rods are easy to use and come in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>That beign said, her hair does not curl easily.  </li>
            <li>it arrived very quick...</li>
            <li>These flex rods are great and the fact that they come in various sizes is evev better.</li>
            <li>This pack comes with it all and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It was easy from that point on to put them in and remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Easy to sleep in too.</li>
            <li>Easy to mold</li>
            <li>Perfect on natural or straight hair.</li>
            <li>You get a TON of different sizes which is great if you want more varied curls in your hair which I did..</li>
            <li>Play with the different sizes to create a beautiful head of curls or waves.</li>
            <li>All of the rods bend just fine.</li>
            <li>so it was fine 😄</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy shoulder-length hair, and wanted to add &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; volume, so my intention has always been to use all the rods, in all the sizes.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; easy to use for multiple curly styles.</li>
            <li>Will take a little getting used too, but these are awesome!  </li>
            <li>this item would work best for a little girls hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution for my 6 year old who wants to curl her hair like mommy but mommy to scared to use hot rod to curl her hair!</li>
            <li>Also these are a great deal, in that they come with a lot of flexi rods for cheap, but also their tiny.</li>
            <li>to find some really huge ones as I have waist length hair.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, they&#x27;re light, and they do curl my hair well.</li>
            <li>She slept on them hoping they would be comfortable, but they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy that.</li>
            <li>So comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>I ended up rolling my entire head because I was happy with the ease I had in rolling.</li>
            <li>The handle on the bag is the only thing that came apart but everything else is in great working order.</li>
            <li>these rods are the best I just put them in and get some nice bouncy curls in the morning, i use them on my human hair mix weave, the hair was already curly but not enough curls the twist-flex rods helped to give me the curls that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and it was somewhat comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li>And they do take some practice to secure those ends.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s free 2 day shipping with prime, it took 9 days for me to receive them</li>
            <li>I have yet to find any method aside from pin curling that allows me to comfortably sleep through the night</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for a friend because the price is great too.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a great deal all different shapes and sizes</li>
            <li>but they were such a great price, I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying them again</li>
            <li>sometimes however she wakes up with some mighty curls.  </li>
            <li>They curl great and bend properly.</li>
            <li>But overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They work good on natural hair and weave.</li>
            <li>Looks a lot like my own naturally curly hair :)</li>
            <li>Awesome hair rollers for the price the curls staying my hair all day long this item was shipped to me fast and easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not bad to sleep with</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to usr</li>
            <li>I seldom roll my hair but these are easy to use and goes in quickly...</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I may just need some practice with them, but I was hoping for quick and easy.</li>
            <li>my hair is super curly and they are easy to sleep with on your head</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>We did order another case because we needed more of some of the colors to keep the size consistent.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what this is made out of but it defintly doesn&#x27;t break my hair and it allows my hair to have the perfect curls.</li>
            <li>I works great for my long hair.</li>
            <li>They work great and hold and everything, even the purple and grey ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Omg it&#x27;s exactly as pictured :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>After excitedly opening my flex rod case, I proceeded to sort them by color and began preparing to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I laid on them and were super comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love this thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>I tried putting in rods for the first time in my hair with these rods, and my curls came out pretty messy, but I think the curls will come out more beautiful if I just practice!</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep in, but next time may try to position them to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Lots of curlers and if you should run out of large ones you can just put two or more of the skinny ones together and use them that way.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, and they are more than worth the money I paid for them.  </li>
            <li>it lasted a few hours which was pretty impressive considering the amount of time it was in for and that I did not have any product in my hair.</li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>too short but good quality n variety sizes</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>All of my rods were able to bend, fast shipping, no problems with my order at all.</li>
            <li>I put these in my hair before I went to sleep and when I took them out in the morning, I was left with gorgeous waves.</li>
            <li>It requires about 1/3 of the top and 1/3 of the bottom to hold rod in place, not leaving much room for which to create spiral curls.</li>
            <li>I love them and they came fast using tomorrow</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, it will fade with time anyhow.</li>
            <li>Not bad to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of using these though, and I can definitely see myself trying again in the future to achieve gorgeous, bouncy curls with these flex-rods!</li>
            <li>/&gt;#nice #easy #pretty</li>
            <li>so easy to use and curls turn out so pretty.</li>
            <li>They come in all sizes which is great because my hair is longer in some places and shorter in other places.</li>
            <li>Other then this product was great.</li>
            <li>I also love that there are so many different sizes to go with your style or hair length.</li>
            <li>Thanks they are fun to use. :)</li>
            <li>I love love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>quick shipping</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used something similar and are okay with it, then sure.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I did a quick Google search to see how to use them, and watched 2 YouTube tutorials.</li>
            <li>The price is great, quality decent, and the mix of sizes seems pretty thorough for that naturally curly look.</li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Was expecting something new and better.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It took me half the time to curl my hair and it looked great.</li>
            <li>as long as you know how to properly use these flexi rods, than these will be the best ever.</li>
            <li>Key things to note: bend the rod right over your end to best secure; this rod length will work for looooong hair; make sure your hair is at least damp before rolling to help control flyaways; it will take practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged.</li>
            <li>These rods work pretty well!  </li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how well they curled my hair the first time I used them!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>its exactly like you see it!</li>
            <li>Exactly as I had hoped!</li>
            <li>First set of flexi rods I ever owned!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product and once received I first used the gray and orange rods.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>Came to my house real fast.</li>
            <li>These worked great, though they are definitely not comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great for Natural curly hair to make bigger bouncy spirals.</li>
            <li>A lot of fun..</li>
            <li>As expected it, good deal</li>
            <li>The range of sizes is nice, too, although I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever use the tiny rods in my hair.</li>
            <li>But for the price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to try these out on my hair well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast service, at a hair store these would be much more expensive, love the carrying case and variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>But if these were more comfortable to sleep on I would definitely give these a five star rating.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and healthy for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Well after doing a couple of things around the house, I removed them and low and behold my hair was curled nicely.  </li>
            <li>They came right on time.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of each size.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I love all the different sizes, I&#x27;ve yet to use the full package on my hair.</li>
            <li>The different sizes worked well and are very easy to use</li>
            <li>They also are very soft and bend easily</li>
            <li>These worked fine, though I warn those new to flexi rods:</li>
            <li>Even though it isn&#x27;t worth returning the rods, I can&#x27;t give 4+ stars unless a product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>a small learning curve but great buy for price</li>
            <li>I actually like them a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>I used the grey, purple and orange, created big beautiful beach waves.</li>
            <li>The larger rollers allow my hair to have great body that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, super straight hair, medium thickness</li>
            <li>Long story short they are amazing for refreshing and setting curls.</li>
            <li>I normally need to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to get any kind of body in my hair at all, but these curlers gave me lots of body, fun little ringlets, super fun!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product came very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of twist-flex rods, so I have no basis for comparison, but I have been able to get good sets out of these with little difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the videos I&#x27;ve seen show people using unbent rods with their hair spiraled around them, but since I primarily &#x27;wet-set and sleep&#x27;, I bend the ends in to lock the hair down, and tie everything up at night.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to purchase these for so long, finally caught a great sale.  </li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and stays in place!</li>
            <li>It has more than enough flexi rods for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had different rollers before but this is the easiest and most convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes in this set..</li>
            <li>Durable and do EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>WHAT I WANTED AND EXACT</li>
            <li>but I am sure it shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li>After I put the rollers in, I dipped the wig in hot water for about 50 seconds.</li>
            <li>In the picture I used the largest size (purple) to curl my hair and brushed it out for a more wavy look.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>There are tons of youtube tutorials, I watched about a dozen and had no problems the first time using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many different styles for all types of lengths of hair!</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve received 5 stars if you got more than 8 of each size, but the company may sell a larger pack that does.</li>
            <li>they were more than enough!  </li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes of the flexi-rods.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and they work really well for whatever styling purposes I dream up!  </li>
            <li>every hot hair tool there is from dryers etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m just in love.  </li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time</li>
            <li>, I bought two packs since I needed more in specific colors.</li>
            <li>These were my first experience with flexrods.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so I ordered two packs to make sure I had enough rollers.</li>
            <li>I used the larger sizes most often, but am genuinely enjoying the short size and convenient carrier bag.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The curls are great and last long (1-2 weeks if you take care of the curly hair).</li>
            <li>The first time I used it  my curls didn&#x27;t last for more than an hours</li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>One was enough and I got so many complements on my flex rod set.</li>
            <li>( I poured boiling hot water over them and nothing happened to them).</li>
            <li>ships fast!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone who is interested in flexi rods.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that there are different gauges.</li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes thank u!!!!</li>
            <li>hair is very fine, long, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use hot rollers, a curling iron, or blow dryer on my hair since it&#x27;s fragile now, so this was a great alternative since it just had to air dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, layered and thick, so it&#x27;s really nice to have the variety and look so good</li>
            <li>fast shipping great long lasting curls #noheat</li>
            <li>Initially expected larger sizes but was happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, they are so easy to use, and I can use all different sizes for different parts of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice to have to put the curl back in your spiral curls, soft so you can sleep in them</li>
            <li>Good quality and different sizes that I can use for different styles.</li>
            <li>This makes my curley haor that I already have so pretty its easy to use and any nationality can use not only woman of color</li>
            <li>shipping fast, got exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>Oh my hair is long and mostly strait because of the length.</li>
            <li>The curls look good at first but don&#x27;t seem to last long for me.</li>
            <li>I truly do like how easily these flexi-rods work and the different sizes of 6 rods</li>
            <li>So easy to style my long very straight hair now.</li>
            <li>and I have thick curly hair makes my hair so much more full of life!</li>
            <li>The rod sizes are smaller also but it should be fine.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I have purchased several different sets over the years and these are made much better and stay in place!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much discomfort during sleep.</li>
            <li>Also, even though the rods are shorter (there are much longer rods out there), they work well with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Works well for me n fast.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>But I wanted something to curl my hair when it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS FAST</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Oml they really work</li>
            <li>I got really bouncy curls from this</li>
            <li>I expected them to be ok since i have shoulder length hair, but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the real reason for 1 star is because they smell like rubber.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get them to return to straight</li>
            <li>These keep curls really well</li>
            <li>Enjoy different sizes.</li>
            <li>Much variety in size.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>And has been worth it for me so far</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>+ Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Delivery  was fast and punctual...</li>
            <li>It curls my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>The material is very durable.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a roller that I could put in at night, that would be comfortable enough to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>thanks for putting out the product from the curly girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe and Andrea</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have that irritation of folding in the ends and thinking, &amp;#34;why is there so much</li>
            <li>Boom, ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t curl my hair very well, either.</li>
            <li>I will say that the curls were not very uniform, but that might have something to do with my skill level :).</li>
            <li>Package came right on time and these lil rods do there job better than applying harsh heat to your head</li>
            <li>Oh Wow,  my daughter used this right away</li>
            <li>Expected a faster shipping time but other than that great</li>
            <li>The problem I found with other brands was that they cracked or the ends popped off and I was always buying more.</li>
            <li>I get some nice curls in my hair that last all day long thanks to these rods.</li>
            <li>The curls are really soft and pretty and it gave my older wig life!</li>
            <li>The only issue I had that I feel is worth mentioning, is that they tend to smell like plastic when you first get them, though I&#x27;ve noticed the smell has faded over time.</li>
            <li>arrived on time, exactly as pictured and has just the right amount for different size curls</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good buy since 6 pcs usually cost about $3.00 in the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending purchase in a timely manner and new as desired.</li>
            <li>They are also comfortable enough to sleep on if I want to work on my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; early.</li>
            <li>but I think this is actually beneficial as you can use more in the same space.</li>
            <li>Rods are super short!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and my mom has short hair and the different sizes really come in handy and the curls hold really well!</li>
            <li>the more expensive ones would be better?  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with more big sizes as I prefer bigger curls</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with different sizes because I have like 3-4 different textures of hair on my head.</li>
            <li>I love that this set came with several different sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the smaller ones but it made me resemble Shirley Temple a bit more than I wanted so for big curls</li>
            <li>People with really long and thick like myself need longer rods to ensure the best results possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed because I&#x27;m black and usually use hot combs and flat irons</li>
            <li>I dont wear too many tight curls</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good 😉 only thing is that I have short hair so at first the curls where really tight</li>
            <li>Normally I try to avoid heatless products in my hair</li>
            <li>I got the 7 inch ones which are about 3 inches shorter than the normal ones.</li>
            <li>I wiped them with a damp cloth before putting in my hair, still smelled, but today after having them in my hair and airing them out they smell normal now.</li>
            <li>other than that, theyre fine.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other complaints I have read they smelled fine.  </li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>i love the rods they came the same day they were expected an</li>
            <li>Do a quick blow dry and take them off.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - makes tight curls</li>
            <li>I tried these for the first time last night after seeing how to do heatless curls or waves on youtube.</li>
            <li>The rollers are the perfect size and gave me the same look as my expensive digital perm.</li>
            <li>this is a great bargain for so many items, my only complaint the zipper was broken on the bag they came in</li>
            <li>This product came quickly and was as expected.</li>
            <li>so if you do don&#x27;t use a lot of them use the bigger ones and less is better 😉</li>
            <li>I was even able to sleep in these with my hair wet so it could dry overnight.  </li>
            <li>Spray hair spray lightly all over and brush down with my fingers and yay!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, and when I used them when my hair was dry, it wouldn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>These are really soft too</li>
            <li>They are soft and I can sleep in them.</li>
            <li>By the way shipping was fast only took 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>I use them to curl a synthetic wig that&#x27;s a tad old.</li>
            <li>and when I took the rollers out I was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out.</li>
            <li>The curls last all day and work as fast as 2 hrs for any event.</li>
            <li>- I have entirely too much hair - but I manage with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for twist outs and sets and really like the look that using different colored rods gives.</li>
            <li>and it only took 6 twists to curl my whole head.</li>
            <li>does wonders to our scalp hair  and restore your natural beauty of your hair buying flexrods with coconut oil olive oil</li>
            <li>Gift for my 11 year old daughter....</li>
            <li>I have no trouble sleeping in rollers, but have no idea how anyone does it in these rods.</li>
            <li>My natural curls wouldn&#x27;t curl anymore,</li>
            <li>but once I developed a technique and figured it out.</li>
            <li>She really likes all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I would have set my locs and sat under the dryer for at least an hour, the curls would have lasted longer.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and my 5 year old can sleep in these without them hurting her head.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get really fixed.</li>
            <li>I brought this set of flexi rods because I&#x27;ve been transitioning my hair now from relaxed to natural for over 8 months</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take a professional.</li>
            <li>I really like that there are different sizes.</li>
            <li>I sued these earlier this week and they worked really well.</li>
            <li>but once I take out these flexi rods my hair looks naturally curly :) Also these should work on any hair texture as long as you put them in correctly and leave them in long enough.</li>
            <li>Wet definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>I have a variety of these and honestly have been addicted to buying all shapes and sizes..</li>
            <li>Good gosh was it a bit uncomfortable to sleep in that night.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little worried that it would not be able to curl my tight kinky, coily curls, but to my believe it did</li>
            <li>My super thin ultra straight hair was curly all day (which NEVER happens with hot rollers or curling irons).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to say my curls lasted about a half day, but it was very hot outside, and my hair is cut straight.  </li>
            <li>These Twist-flex rods give me more of a loose curl but is less time consuming.</li>
            <li>cause i have to make the curls very tight for my hair to fit the roller  </li>
            <li>The rods come in different pretty colors as well as different sizes, so you can choose what size curls</li>
            <li>First it came a day earlier so it was only one day shipping,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them especially for those who don&#x27;t want to continuously use a curling iron or wand on their hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair down to a few inches above my waist and these work great on my hair to give it curls without the damage.</li>
            <li>I was really worried they&#x27;d take long to come but for 2$ they came in 2 days</li>
            <li>I ordered 2, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if 1 would be enough because I have REALLY thick natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li>Although I realize that I really don&#x27;t need the smaller sizes but that a personal problem.</li>
            <li>only needed 7 total for my whole head even though I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that at first they have a strange plastic smell.</li>
            <li>If you place them in the right spot sleeping on them is fine but other than that they are pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on other reviews, the first thing I did was to count and catalog all of the rods I received; everything was in order.</li>
            <li>I only left the flex rods in my hair for only 20 minutes or so and my hair was really curly!</li>
            <li>I placed the smaller rods at the front of my natural hair to yield tighter curls.</li>
            <li>I will give a complete update later.</li>
            <li>the foam rips so easily, and hard to bend in different ways to curl the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While otherwise pleased with this purchase, I can only give it 4 stars due to the missing rods.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat fine long hair down to middle of my back</li>
            <li>the first time i tried them i kept them in for about 2 and a half hours</li>
            <li>I would consider my hair long (about 6 inches past my shoulders) and the 7 inch ones worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are still working great and have been heavily used throughout the past few months.</li>
            <li>I am going to give the other one to a friend who wants to try it too.</li>
            <li>The curls come out tight, but once you open them up by pulling the curls apart, turning one tight curl into 3 or 4 separate ones, you&#x27;ll see more volume/fullness to your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed Natural Hair stylist and I&#x27;m always looking for different ways to roll my clients hair but the rods are extremely short..</li>
            <li>two smallest sizes are too small for me to use, but even so, this is worth it for the other 30 that are a reasonable size.</li>
            <li>It was all that I expected and would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The waves last me almost all day (6-10 hours, depending on the weather/what I&#x27;ve been doing) and the curls will last about 6 hours before dropping completely to waves, which will last me at least 18 hours from the original set (so, an additional 12 hours).</li>
            <li>Taking the rods out took 15 minutes and wasn&#x27;t hard, but it took another 15 in the morning to straighten them out enough so they&#x27;d fit back in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple times to use these, however my hair looks like a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>these rods are high quality and extremely durable</li>
            <li>I have super thick curly hair, which is a blessing.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve watched tutorials on using these, my hands are admittedly clumsy, so my first time result came out a lot less than stellar.</li>
            <li>I was sooo shocked how fast I received my item, but I love it and thank you.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure they work well for thicker hair, but I would not suggest for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can leave them in my hair all night and have fabulous curls or waves for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have longer hair than mine you could enjoy them better.</li>
            <li> Very happy, can&#x27;t wait to use them for my center pieces for my wedding reception.</li>

            <li> good quality product, thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re not the most comfortable to sleep on, but they&#x27;re infinitely more comfortable than something like Curlformers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Did my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair and they turned out perfect on the first try!</li>
            <li> I did these with NO experience other than a YouTube video and got great results every-time!!</li>
            <li> I got perfect wavy curls using the gray colored ones, I cant wait to experiment with the other sizes and see how those come out.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product for the price, and I would repurchase :)</li>
            <li> The packaging makes it so easy to keep up with them.</li>
            <li> great if you need different sizes, not if you need more of one size than another.</li>

            <li> it arrived very quick...</li>
            <li> These flex rods are great and the fact that they come in various sizes is evev better.</li>

            <li> All of the rods bend just fine.</li>
            <li> so it was fine 😄</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy shoulder-length hair, and wanted to add &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; volume, so my intention has always been to use all the rods, in all the sizes.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; easy to use for multiple curly styles.</li>
            <li> Will take a little getting used too, but these are awesome!  </li>

            <li> Perfect solution for my 6 year old who wants to curl her hair like mommy but mommy to scared to use hot rod to curl her hair!</li>
            <li> Also these are a great deal, in that they come with a lot of flexi rods for cheap, but also their tiny.</li>
            <li> to find some really huge ones as I have waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, they&#x27;re light, and they do curl my hair well.</li>
            <li> She slept on them hoping they would be comfortable, but they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy that.</li>
            <li> So comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> I ended up rolling my entire head because I was happy with the ease I had in rolling.</li>
            <li> The handle on the bag is the only thing that came apart but everything else is in great working order.</li>
            <li> these rods are the best I just put them in and get some nice bouncy curls in the morning, i use them on my human hair mix weave, the hair was already curly but not enough curls the twist-flex rods helped to give me the curls that I wanted.  </li>
            <li> and it was somewhat comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> And they do take some practice to secure those ends.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s free 2 day shipping with prime, it took 9 days for me to receive them</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any method aside from pin curling that allows me to comfortably sleep through the night</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for a friend because the price is great too.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a great deal all different shapes and sizes</li>
            <li> but they were such a great price, I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying them again</li>
            <li> sometimes however she wakes up with some mighty curls.  </li>
            <li> They curl great and bend properly.</li>
            <li> But overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They work good on natural hair and weave.</li>
            <li> Looks a lot like my own naturally curly hair :)</li>
            <li> Awesome hair rollers for the price the curls staying my hair all day long this item was shipped to me fast and easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not bad to sleep with</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to usr</li>
            <li> I seldom roll my hair but these are easy to use and goes in quickly...</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I may just need some practice with them, but I was hoping for quick and easy.</li>
            <li> my hair is super curly and they are easy to sleep with on your head</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> We did order another case because we needed more of some of the colors to keep the size consistent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this is made out of but it defintly doesn&#x27;t break my hair and it allows my hair to have the perfect curls.</li>
            <li> I works great for my long hair.</li>
            <li> They work great and hold and everything, even the purple and grey ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Omg it&#x27;s exactly as pictured :)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> After excitedly opening my flex rod case, I proceeded to sort them by color and began preparing to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I laid on them and were super comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> I tried putting in rods for the first time in my hair with these rods, and my curls came out pretty messy, but I think the curls will come out more beautiful if I just practice!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep in, but next time may try to position them to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Lots of curlers and if you should run out of large ones you can just put two or more of the skinny ones together and use them that way.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and they are more than worth the money I paid for them.  </li>
            <li> it lasted a few hours which was pretty impressive considering the amount of time it was in for and that I did not have any product in my hair.</li>
            <li> Cool product.</li>
            <li> too short but good quality n variety sizes</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> All of my rods were able to bend, fast shipping, no problems with my order at all.</li>
            <li> I put these in my hair before I went to sleep and when I took them out in the morning, I was left with gorgeous waves.</li>
            <li> It requires about 1/3 of the top and 1/3 of the bottom to hold rod in place, not leaving much room for which to create spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I love them and they came fast using tomorrow</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, it will fade with time anyhow.</li>
            <li> Not bad to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of using these though, and I can definitely see myself trying again in the future to achieve gorgeous, bouncy curls with these flex-rods!</li>
            <li> /&gt;#nice #easy #pretty</li>
            <li> so easy to use and curls turn out so pretty.</li>
            <li> They come in all sizes which is great because my hair is longer in some places and shorter in other places.</li>
            <li> Other then this product was great.</li>
            <li> I also love that there are so many different sizes to go with your style or hair length.</li>
            <li> Thanks they are fun to use. :)</li>
            <li> I love love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> quick shipping</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used something similar and are okay with it, then sure.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I did a quick Google search to see how to use them, and watched 2 YouTube tutorials.</li>
            <li> The price is great, quality decent, and the mix of sizes seems pretty thorough for that naturally curly look.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Was expecting something new and better.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It took me half the time to curl my hair and it looked great.</li>
            <li> as long as you know how to properly use these flexi rods, than these will be the best ever.</li>
            <li> Key things to note: bend the rod right over your end to best secure; this rod length will work for looooong hair; make sure your hair is at least damp before rolling to help control flyaways; it will take practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged.</li>
            <li> These rods work pretty well!  </li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how well they curled my hair the first time I used them!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> its exactly like you see it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as I had hoped!</li>
            <li> First set of flexi rods I ever owned!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and once received I first used the gray and orange rods.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> Came to my house real fast.</li>
            <li> These worked great, though they are definitely not comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great for Natural curly hair to make bigger bouncy spirals.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun..</li>
            <li> As expected it, good deal</li>
            <li> The range of sizes is nice, too, although I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever use the tiny rods in my hair.</li>
            <li> But for the price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try these out on my hair well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service, at a hair store these would be much more expensive, love the carrying case and variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> But if these were more comfortable to sleep on I would definitely give these a five star rating.</li>
            <li> These are so soft and healthy for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Well after doing a couple of things around the house, I removed them and low and behold my hair was curled nicely.  </li>
            <li> They came right on time.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of each size.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love all the different sizes, I&#x27;ve yet to use the full package on my hair.</li>
            <li> The different sizes worked well and are very easy to use</li>
            <li> They also are very soft and bend easily</li>
            <li> These worked fine, though I warn those new to flexi rods:</li>
            <li> Even though it isn&#x27;t worth returning the rods, I can&#x27;t give 4+ stars unless a product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> a small learning curve but great buy for price</li>
            <li> I actually like them a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> I used the grey, purple and orange, created big beautiful beach waves.</li>
            <li> The larger rollers allow my hair to have great body that last all day.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, super straight hair, medium thickness</li>
            <li> Long story short they are amazing for refreshing and setting curls.</li>
            <li> I normally need to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to get any kind of body in my hair at all, but these curlers gave me lots of body, fun little ringlets, super fun!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Product came very fast.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of twist-flex rods, so I have no basis for comparison, but I have been able to get good sets out of these with little difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the videos I&#x27;ve seen show people using unbent rods with their hair spiraled around them, but since I primarily &#x27;wet-set and sleep&#x27;, I bend the ends in to lock the hair down, and tie everything up at night.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase these for so long, finally caught a great sale.  </li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and stays in place!</li>
            <li> It has more than enough flexi rods for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different rollers before but this is the easiest and most convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes in this set..</li>
            <li> Durable and do EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> WHAT I WANTED AND EXACT</li>
            <li> but I am sure it shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li> After I put the rollers in, I dipped the wig in hot water for about 50 seconds.</li>
            <li> In the picture I used the largest size (purple) to curl my hair and brushed it out for a more wavy look.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> There are tons of youtube tutorials, I watched about a dozen and had no problems the first time using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many different styles for all types of lengths of hair!</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve received 5 stars if you got more than 8 of each size, but the company may sell a larger pack that does.</li>
            <li> they were more than enough!  </li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes of the flexi-rods.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and they work really well for whatever styling purposes I dream up!  </li>
            <li> every hot hair tool there is from dryers etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m just in love.  </li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time</li>
            <li> , I bought two packs since I needed more in specific colors.</li>
            <li> These were my first experience with flexrods.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so I ordered two packs to make sure I had enough rollers.</li>
            <li> I used the larger sizes most often, but am genuinely enjoying the short size and convenient carrier bag.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The curls are great and last long (1-2 weeks if you take care of the curly hair).</li>
            <li> The first time I used it  my curls didn&#x27;t last for more than an hours</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> One was enough and I got so many complements on my flex rod set.</li>
            <li> ( I poured boiling hot water over them and nothing happened to them).</li>
            <li> ships fast!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who is interested in flexi rods.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that there are different gauges.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes thank u!!!!</li>
            <li> hair is very fine, long, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use hot rollers, a curling iron, or blow dryer on my hair since it&#x27;s fragile now, so this was a great alternative since it just had to air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, layered and thick, so it&#x27;s really nice to have the variety and look so good</li>
            <li> fast shipping great long lasting curls #noheat</li>
            <li> Initially expected larger sizes but was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, they are so easy to use, and I can use all different sizes for different parts of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice to have to put the curl back in your spiral curls, soft so you can sleep in them</li>
            <li> Good quality and different sizes that I can use for different styles.</li>
            <li> This makes my curley haor that I already have so pretty its easy to use and any nationality can use not only woman of color</li>
            <li> shipping fast, got exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Oh my hair is long and mostly strait because of the length.</li>
            <li> The curls look good at first but don&#x27;t seem to last long for me.</li>
            <li> I truly do like how easily these flexi-rods work and the different sizes of 6 rods</li>
            <li> So easy to style my long very straight hair now.</li>
            <li> and I have thick curly hair makes my hair so much more full of life!</li>
            <li> The rod sizes are smaller also but it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have purchased several different sets over the years and these are made much better and stay in place!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much discomfort during sleep.</li>
            <li> Also, even though the rods are shorter (there are much longer rods out there), they work well with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Works well for me n fast.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> But I wanted something to curl my hair when it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS FAST</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> Oml they really work</li>
            <li> I got really bouncy curls from this</li>
            <li> I expected them to be ok since i have shoulder length hair, but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the real reason for 1 star is because they smell like rubber.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get them to return to straight</li>
            <li> These keep curls really well</li>
            <li> Enjoy different sizes.</li>
            <li> Much variety in size.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> And has been worth it for me so far</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> + Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Delivery  was fast and punctual...</li>
            <li> It curls my hair really fast.</li>
            <li> The material is very durable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a roller that I could put in at night, that would be comfortable enough to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> thanks for putting out the product from the curly girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe and Andrea</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have that irritation of folding in the ends and thinking, &amp;#34;why is there so much</li>
            <li> Boom, ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t curl my hair very well, either.</li>
            <li> I will say that the curls were not very uniform, but that might have something to do with my skill level :).</li>
            <li> Package came right on time and these lil rods do there job better than applying harsh heat to your head</li>
            <li> Oh Wow,  my daughter used this right away</li>
            <li> Expected a faster shipping time but other than that great</li>
            <li> The problem I found with other brands was that they cracked or the ends popped off and I was always buying more.</li>
            <li> I get some nice curls in my hair that last all day long thanks to these rods.</li>
            <li> The curls are really soft and pretty and it gave my older wig life!</li>
            <li> The only issue I had that I feel is worth mentioning, is that they tend to smell like plastic when you first get them, though I&#x27;ve noticed the smell has faded over time.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, exactly as pictured and has just the right amount for different size curls</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buy since 6 pcs usually cost about $3.00 in the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending purchase in a timely manner and new as desired.</li>
            <li> They are also comfortable enough to sleep on if I want to work on my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; early.</li>
            <li> but I think this is actually beneficial as you can use more in the same space.</li>
            <li> Rods are super short!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and my mom has short hair and the different sizes really come in handy and the curls hold really well!</li>
            <li> the more expensive ones would be better?  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with more big sizes as I prefer bigger curls</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with different sizes because I have like 3-4 different textures of hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I love that this set came with several different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the smaller ones but it made me resemble Shirley Temple a bit more than I wanted so for big curls</li>
            <li> People with really long and thick like myself need longer rods to ensure the best results possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed because I&#x27;m black and usually use hot combs and flat irons</li>
            <li> I dont wear too many tight curls</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good 😉 only thing is that I have short hair so at first the curls where really tight</li>
            <li> Normally I try to avoid heatless products in my hair</li>
            <li> I got the 7 inch ones which are about 3 inches shorter than the normal ones.</li>
            <li> I wiped them with a damp cloth before putting in my hair, still smelled, but today after having them in my hair and airing them out they smell normal now.</li>
            <li> other than that, theyre fine.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other complaints I have read they smelled fine.  </li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> i love the rods they came the same day they were expected an</li>
            <li> Do a quick blow dry and take them off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - makes tight curls</li>
            <li> I tried these for the first time last night after seeing how to do heatless curls or waves on youtube.</li>
            <li> The rollers are the perfect size and gave me the same look as my expensive digital perm.</li>
            <li> this is a great bargain for so many items, my only complaint the zipper was broken on the bag they came in</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and was as expected.</li>
            <li> so if you do don&#x27;t use a lot of them use the bigger ones and less is better 😉</li>
            <li> I was even able to sleep in these with my hair wet so it could dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> Spray hair spray lightly all over and brush down with my fingers and yay!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, and when I used them when my hair was dry, it wouldn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> These are really soft too</li>
            <li> They are soft and I can sleep in them.</li>
            <li> By the way shipping was fast only took 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> I use them to curl a synthetic wig that&#x27;s a tad old.</li>
            <li> and when I took the rollers out I was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out.</li>
            <li> The curls last all day and work as fast as 2 hrs for any event.</li>
            <li> - I have entirely too much hair - but I manage with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for twist outs and sets and really like the look that using different colored rods gives.</li>
            <li> and it only took 6 twists to curl my whole head.</li>

            <li> Gift for my 11 year old daughter....</li>
            <li> I have no trouble sleeping in rollers, but have no idea how anyone does it in these rods.</li>
            <li> My natural curls wouldn&#x27;t curl anymore,</li>
            <li> but once I developed a technique and figured it out.</li>
            <li> She really likes all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I would have set my locs and sat under the dryer for at least an hour, the curls would have lasted longer.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and my 5 year old can sleep in these without them hurting her head.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really fixed.</li>
            <li> I brought this set of flexi rods because I&#x27;ve been transitioning my hair now from relaxed to natural for over 8 months</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take a professional.</li>
            <li> I really like that there are different sizes.</li>
            <li> I sued these earlier this week and they worked really well.</li>
            <li> but once I take out these flexi rods my hair looks naturally curly :) Also these should work on any hair texture as long as you put them in correctly and leave them in long enough.</li>
            <li> Wet definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I have a variety of these and honestly have been addicted to buying all shapes and sizes..</li>
            <li> Good gosh was it a bit uncomfortable to sleep in that night.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried that it would not be able to curl my tight kinky, coily curls, but to my believe it did</li>
            <li> My super thin ultra straight hair was curly all day (which NEVER happens with hot rollers or curling irons).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to say my curls lasted about a half day, but it was very hot outside, and my hair is cut straight.  </li>
            <li> These Twist-flex rods give me more of a loose curl but is less time consuming.</li>
            <li> cause i have to make the curls very tight for my hair to fit the roller  </li>
            <li> The rods come in different pretty colors as well as different sizes, so you can choose what size curls</li>
            <li> First it came a day earlier so it was only one day shipping,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them especially for those who don&#x27;t want to continuously use a curling iron or wand on their hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to a few inches above my waist and these work great on my hair to give it curls without the damage.</li>
            <li> I was really worried they&#x27;d take long to come but for 2$ they came in 2 days</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if 1 would be enough because I have REALLY thick natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li> Although I realize that I really don&#x27;t need the smaller sizes but that a personal problem.</li>
            <li> only needed 7 total for my whole head even though I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that at first they have a strange plastic smell.</li>
            <li> If you place them in the right spot sleeping on them is fine but other than that they are pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other reviews, the first thing I did was to count and catalog all of the rods I received; everything was in order.</li>
            <li> I only left the flex rods in my hair for only 20 minutes or so and my hair was really curly!</li>
            <li> I placed the smaller rods at the front of my natural hair to yield tighter curls.</li>
            <li> I will give a complete update later.</li>
            <li> the foam rips so easily, and hard to bend in different ways to curl the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While otherwise pleased with this purchase, I can only give it 4 stars due to the missing rods.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat fine long hair down to middle of my back</li>
            <li> the first time i tried them i kept them in for about 2 and a half hours</li>
            <li> I would consider my hair long (about 6 inches past my shoulders) and the 7 inch ones worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are still working great and have been heavily used throughout the past few months.</li>
            <li> I am going to give the other one to a friend who wants to try it too.</li>
            <li> The curls come out tight, but once you open them up by pulling the curls apart, turning one tight curl into 3 or 4 separate ones, you&#x27;ll see more volume/fullness to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed Natural Hair stylist and I&#x27;m always looking for different ways to roll my clients hair but the rods are extremely short..</li>
            <li> two smallest sizes are too small for me to use, but even so, this is worth it for the other 30 that are a reasonable size.</li>
            <li> It was all that I expected and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The waves last me almost all day (6-10 hours, depending on the weather/what I&#x27;ve been doing) and the curls will last about 6 hours before dropping completely to waves, which will last me at least 18 hours from the original set (so, an additional 12 hours).</li>
            <li> Taking the rods out took 15 minutes and wasn&#x27;t hard, but it took another 15 in the morning to straighten them out enough so they&#x27;d fit back in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple times to use these, however my hair looks like a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> these rods are high quality and extremely durable</li>
            <li> I have super thick curly hair, which is a blessing.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve watched tutorials on using these, my hands are admittedly clumsy, so my first time result came out a lot less than stellar.</li>
            <li> I was sooo shocked how fast I received my item, but I love it and thank you.</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed that it was a lot more really skinny rods versus the thick rods (which ppl would want more of)</li>
            <li> They range from large, 1 inch rods to really small ones, maybe 1/4 of an inch or smaller.</li>
            <li> plus it seems more healthier after buying olive oil and coconut oil and coconut leave in conditioner and eliminating hair grease and stop shampooing my hair and started conditioning it instead after researching how bad these product are actually for black women and black men and black children  of color and how effective olive oil coconut oil and stop shampooing to only conditioning</li>
            <li> Based on the length of my hair and the style I prefer, I only use the larger rods (purple, blue, grey, and orange).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As described, needs to be sold in packets of medium, small and large separately</li>
            <li> The thinner rods twisted shut fine, but anything thicker was too short to close properly, and took some persistence.</li>
            <li> Last very long especially when I sleep with them overnight.</li>
            <li> works well, but won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> but I may use them in the back if I am having a long night so that it gives my hair time to fall.  </li>
            <li> purchased the 42 pack of 7-inch rods, and I really only use the three largest rods (purple, grey, and orange).</li>
            <li> but if you have really long hair I would say Purchase Larger Sized ones.</li>
            <li> My curls last all day long.</li>
            <li> curls can be achieved with the blue, grey and purple rods so I had to buy two sets given 18 out of each</li>
            <li> I have the 10 inch long rods, various sizes.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets because not only are my locs long, but I have ALOT of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the largest rollers, the purple and grey ones, in for 2 hours to see how the curls would turn out.</li>
            <li> I purchased these since I am growing my hair out and looking for styling alternatives to using my flat iron or curler.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Smaller in length than I expected, however I have short hair and it will be quite some time that my hair will out grow these.</li>
            <li> I finally caved and bought these after getting so tired of the same old twist-outs for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> and so it was messy the 1st time the 2nd time I used bigger ones for my short hair</li>
            <li> The rods have really strange odor.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair (it reaches my hips)</li>
            <li> The grey and purple rods can be used to add volume to flair ironed or blow-dried hair.</li>
            <li> They are about  5 to 6 inches long.</li>
            <li> cause over two hours is too long for me.</li>
            <li> Looking at the picture I thought that all the rods was long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping them but please inform your consumers that these are not the long flexi rods..</li>
            <li> These work nicely in my long hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have long hair because you will probably run out of the sizes you need before your done (my hair is cut shorter).</li>
            <li> but I ordered the long rods and received the 7 in rods..</li>
            <li> I used a curling serum and blow dried my hair completely before wrapping my hair around these flexi rods.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re so short, my hair is down my back</li>
            <li> I received mine today and put four of the orange ones in my hair to see how long before it would curl dry hair.  </li>
            <li> the small rods are useless, and i had to head to my local beauty supply to pick up more purple and grey ones</li>
            <li> The only other thing is I should have gotten the longer ones.</li>
            <li> The next time I tried the rods I left them a little lower and put a scarf on my head to keep it in place</li>
            <li> and I needed something to do with my hair for work every morning other than the basic bun.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> I let it dry overnight</li>
            <li> Dry or.</li>
            <li> I have wavy dry hair</li>
            <li> curl when hair is almost dry</li>
            <li> so I suggest using a dryer to dry your hair rather than sleeping on them and drying overnight.</li>
            <li> I put them on my hair while it&#x27;s damp, and let it dry over night.</li>
            <li> arrived only a few days later.</li>
            <li> but I had no trouble using them on my hair that is past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> , I took one loose just to see what my hair was doing</li>
            <li> My hair is down my back</li>
            <li> I usually use the Perm rods to curl my my middle back length locs.</li>
            <li> When I used them when my hair was wet, my hair didn&#x27;t dry, and turned out to be kinky and leave dents in the roots.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to people trying to achieve heat less curls.</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour and a half to do my entire head</li>
            <li> but these work just a little short</li>
            <li> I wore a stocking cap and it left my hair a little fuzzy in the a.m.</li>
            <li> Have to keep in for 2-3 days if put in wet hair</li>
            <li> Only a few were needed.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected in length.</li>
            <li> I have long, average hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works like expected.</li>
            <li> Plenty of room for medium/short length hair but not really sutible for anything else.</li>
            <li> made me eliminate the use of hot combs curling irons flat irons blow dryers perms or relaxers and my hair looks so thicker and less stripped uneven or unhealthy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if im using them wrong or what, i&#x27;ve searched high and low for youtube tutorials</li>
            <li> Also If you&#x27;re not wanting to sleep in them it took my hair about and hour and half to dry to hold the curl in these flex rods.</li>
            <li> I went from little tight curls to big wavy curls</li>
            <li> I usually do a braid out on my hair before bed and at the ends/ mid section I put the flexi rods (I don&#x27;t braid the ends where I put the flexi rods).</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and still have plenty of time to do other stuffs while curling my hair.</li>
            <li> so I usually use the larger ones.</li>
            <li> the turquoise, yellow and red rods are unusable (at least for me); they&#x27;re waaaay too narrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this 4 stars due to the fact that I think this works on people with longer hair</li>
            <li> I will never hot</li>
            <li> Be careful with your edges!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the plastic piece in the center on the ends, my hair will get stuck in it</li>
            <li> Its affordable and they are not uncomfortable sleeping in (of course they will feel weird sleeping on a foreign object but you can still sleep!).</li>
            <li> The curls are really tight to the scalp and usually take a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> not very comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I also learned that you don&#x27;t need to go all the way down the rod just to get the spiral effect..</li>
            <li> I have eight multi-sized rods in my hair and my head is not being weighed down by plastic rollers.</li>
            <li> Other than that they get the job done!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, my hair is not very long and the curls made my hair look short.</li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes my daughter&#x27;s hair had beautiful bouncing boring boring curls :)</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered rollers with the foam, and it kept breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was slightly damp when I put them in</li>
            <li> *side note: I put the rods in less then 30 mins ago</li>
            <li> Idk If it&#x27;s just me but the huge gray ones don&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> Therefore, I recommend anyone who has long, thick hair to order two sets.</li>
            <li> I have long (almost to my waist), thick hair</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d still recommend this little kit.</li>
            <li> Also the rods stay in her head a little longer than the rods can be.</li>
            <li> I was a little dismayed by the length of the rods.</li>
            <li> Came with a little bag to organize the rods.</li>
            <li> and even so, I only needed just the thick ones!  </li>
            <li> Went from black dyed hair to reddish blonde which left my hair crazy dry/damaged from all the bleaching/stripping that was done to it.</li>
            <li> only slight negative is that after several uses a few of the rods seem to have loose end pieces, as if something had broken, but nothing seems to actually be broken and</li>
            <li> Now I tried it when my hair was wet, thick and curly.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few rollers included</li>
            <li> I already owned quite a few of the flex rods.</li>
            <li> Nothing missing at all.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a few to see how they were.</li>
            <li> I put about 10 of these on my daughter&#x27;s almost dried hair and leave it in for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I went though a few to ensure they would bend/twist</li>
            <li> The plastic discs closing the ends are hard and sharp, and some of them kept digging into my scalp.</li>
            <li> So buy buy buy even for long thick hair !</li>
            <li> It was missing 1 blue rod (I hate have to return stuff and having to wait on the new one</li>
            <li> sure if I feel disappointed and robbed, or confused.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rods for my mother who has a little past shoulder length relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> It is too difficult for me to get the different lengths to roll up to mess with.</li>
            <li> Not real good on shorter wigs.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is thin and down to my waist, so when I took these babies out I ran my fingers through my hair, did a little adjusting</li>
            <li> Really small, but they did the job.</li>
            <li> I got the small size one</li>
            <li> so if I use the small rods (which make up the majority of the package)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shorter than the ones I usually get at the beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Hurts while I sleep. :/</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite short to the ones i have and can be a tad difficult if you wear 30 inch hair like i do,  </li>
            <li> I usually on use the purple ones.</li>
            <li> They are shorter than the ones I usually buy</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to go to sleep</li>
            <li> No more putting heat in my hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are hard and uncomfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that they are very uncomfortable to sleep in the tips of them are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use if you hair is over 2 ft long like mine!</li>
            <li> just hard to sleep with</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to repack them all well in its case.</li>
            <li> Hard for me to use .</li>
            <li> I am always looking for products that create at least the illusion of thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> these are all very very small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about these!</li>
            <li> so they just end up a curvy mess and difficult to use time and time again.</li>
            <li> The bulk of the rest meant I had to stay in one position if I didn&#x27;t want them starting to painfully pull.</li>
            <li> They did smell bad, like chemicals or something strange.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Previously got a different brand that smelled horrible.  </li>
            <li> (i have very thick hair).</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of roller for quite some time, as I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> flexi rods work well, but zipper was broken on the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> So when I would wake up for school in the morning which is around 5:30 am I feel exhausted.</li>
            <li> i oreded t wrong size wanted t 10 inch</li>
            <li> Not impressed,  they fell apart as soon as I started to use them.....</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look just wrong,</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re difficult to sleep on.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to get them to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rods did nt curl my hair, I have to return it because I used it twice</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes sleeping difficult</li>
            <li> they make your hair curly crazy.....</li>
            <li> These things smell... quite badly.</li>
            <li> Received this product but was shocked to find out that the rollers were a lot Allen than pictured.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t even use them :(</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong!!</li>
            <li> Product was used and in a very bad shape.</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Terrible to sleep on</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did wonders to my hair, arrived on time and I will buy them again in the future. It is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Normally I try to avoid heatless products in my hair so these were something I looked into. I love the fact that I can leave them in my hair all night and have fabulous curls or waves for the rest of the day. These are really soft too so I don&#x27;t have much discomfort during sleep. I also love that there are so many different sizes to go with your style or hair length. My hair is down my back so I need tons of these to get all my hair looking great! ;)</li>
            <li> These rods work pretty well!  I tried putting in rods for the first time in my hair with these rods, and my curls came out pretty messy, but I think the curls will come out more beautiful if I just practice! The rods come in different pretty colors as well as different sizes, so you can choose what size curls you can have all over your head which i LOVE! Overall, great product for the price, and I would repurchase :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Very fast shipping. All rods bend!</li>
            <li> All of the rods bend just fine. Compared to buying individual packs at the beauty supply, this assortment at this price is a steal. The smell is not bad, it will fade with time anyhow. Also, even though the rods are shorter (there are much longer rods out there), they work well with longer hair. Their being shorter helps with the bulkiness issue.&lt;br /&gt;So why three stars? Not all 42 were included in my pack. Even though it isn&#x27;t worth returning the rods, I can&#x27;t give 4+ stars unless a product is exactly as described. But I&#x27;d still recommend this little kit.</li>
            <li> i oreded t wrong size wanted t 10 inch but these work just a little short</li>
            <li> Totally awesome curlers. Love the variety of colors. Satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Expected a faster shipping time but other than that great I&#x27;ve already done some curls.</li>
            <li> I love them! They came right on time. I love that there are tons of different sizes &amp; not to mention the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> As described , very nice</li>
            <li> Love the finish  product. I have two sets and they are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love them they work great on my Hair</li>
            <li> Good buy or the price.  The rollers work as expected and this package offers a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase these for so long, finally caught a great sale.  I love them</li>
            <li> Cool product. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to use them but I finally did and I absolutely love them! They are very sturdy and stays in place! The curls come out so beautifully!</li>
            <li> After trying these flexi rods for the first time, I absolutely loved them! I got the 7 inch ones which are about 3 inches shorter than the normal ones. I would consider my hair long (about 6 inches past my shoulders) and the 7 inch ones worked perfectly fine. I actually prefer them over the 10 inch ones! I used the two largest size rods in the pack to achieve larger body waves. The body waves turned out beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works well for me n fast.</li>
            <li> nice to have to put the curl back in your spiral curls, soft so you can sleep in them</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buy since 6 pcs usually cost about $3.00 in the local beauty supply store. I usually use the Perm rods to curl my my middle back length locs. The curls are really tight to the scalp and usually take a long time to dry. These Twist-flex rods give me more of a loose curl but is less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for my 14-year-old niece. She absolutely loves them. Wraps them in her hair after washing and goes to sleep on them wakes up with beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> I use them every night and I love how my hair turns out. Easy to use and not bad to sleep with</li>
            <li> Bought these based on all the reviews I read. Was not disappointed! Did my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair and they turned out perfect on the first try! I would definitely recommend these to anyone. She slept in them and did not have a problem. We did order another case because we needed more of some of the colors to keep the size consistent. Going to try them on my hair next!</li>
            <li> case broke after one use and some of the rollers do not flex</li>
            <li> It has more than enough flexi rods for me and I love them! It has just the right amount of each size.</li>
            <li> The rods are OK, I just have to adjust the tension used when I use them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these rollers! They work quickly and make great spring curls. They are also comfortable enough to sleep on if I want to work on my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; early.</li>
            <li> I love these. They come in all sizes which is great because my hair is longer in some places and shorter in other places. They are soft and I can sleep in them.</li>
            <li> As described, needs to be sold in packets of medium, small and large separately</li>
            <li> Have not use yet , but sure they are ok</li>
            <li> I love these flexi rods they work great! There way better than the flexi rods I used by conair. I usually do a braid out on my hair before bed and at the ends/ mid section I put the flexi rods (I don&#x27;t braid the ends where I put the flexi rods). The length of these flexi rods are good for me and I have medium length hair. I am African American with relaxed hair but once I take out these flexi rods my hair looks naturally curly :) Also these should work on any hair texture as long as you put them in correctly and leave them in long enough. By the way shipping was fast only took 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes my daughter&#x27;s hair had beautiful bouncing boring boring curls :)</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair and needed to buy two packs for these to work for me. I love them! These are shorter in length than others I&#x27;ve used but I think this is actually beneficial as you can use more in the same space.</li>
            <li> I finally achieved the &amp;#34;Mariah Carey&amp;#34; curls with these things!</li>
            <li> They work okay. Not real good on shorter wigs.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and I love the kind of curls that these rollers give me!</li>
            <li> I had never used these before. I have a lot of hair and they work great! The packaging makes it so easy to keep up with them. I&#x27;m definitely glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s love them</li>
            <li> too short but good quality n variety sizes</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love the way my curls come out. Last very long especially when I sleep with them overnight.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> My favorite rollers are here! I&#x27;ve had different rollers before but this is the easiest and most convenient to use. I like how I can sleep on this one and not hurt my head or neck. The best way to achieve curls without heating.</li>
            <li> Good product ...........</li>
            <li> Really small, but they did the job.</li>
            <li> Idk If it&#x27;s just me but the huge gray ones don&#x27;t work :( back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Let it Curl!!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome. My curls came out so beautiful. I love the variety of sizes. My curls lasted for about 3- 4 days.</li>
            <li> Have to keep in for 2-3 days if put in wet hair</li>
            <li> WOW!! I put these in before going to bed and I was amazed at how well they curled my hair the first time I used them! Love all the different sizes in this set..sure beats standing there with the curling iron!</li>
            <li> great if you need different sizes, not if you need more of one size than another. Love the form rolls.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. My curls looks alot better with these.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I&#x27;m use to</li>
            <li> Thanks they are fun to use. :)</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully!  What a wonderful find for a fraction of the cost of the ones in the beauty supply store. I like having a case in which to store them, and although I was hesitant about having the shorter rods, the results were great.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of twist-flex rods, so I have no basis for comparison, but I have been able to get good sets out of these with little difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the videos I&#x27;ve seen show people using unbent rods with their hair spiraled around them, but since I primarily &#x27;wet-set and sleep&#x27;, I bend the ends in to lock the hair down, and tie everything up at night.  I have not have any comfort issues with sleeping in the rods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, the first thing I did was to count and catalog all of the rods I received; everything was in order. Based on the length of my hair and the style I prefer, I only use the larger rods (purple, blue, grey, and orange).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight negative is that after several uses a few of the rods seem to have loose end pieces, as if something had broken, but nothing seems to actually be broken and the function of the rod is not impaired.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this product. It was all that I expected and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love them! A lot of flexi rods for a very low price. Plus there is a variety of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> These work great for any hair texture. I use these for my natural hair and they are great, and I love that I can sleep comfortably in them.</li>
            <li> Love these. Quick and easy to usr and the results are salon quality. I recommend these</li>
            <li> I have super thick curly hair, which is a blessing. But I wanted something to curl my hair when it&#x27;s straight. The turn out made me happy it was really beautiful. Now I tried it when my hair was wet, thick and curly. I was disappointed to find that it wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be. Other then this product was great.</li>
            <li> Love this pack! Most affordable and diverse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied great deal &amp; excellent price.</li>
            <li> These work! They don&#x27;t smell to me either.</li>
            <li> I love these! They don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, they&#x27;re light, and they do curl my hair well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of roller for quite some time, as I have thin hair. I am always looking for products that create at least the illusion of thicker hair. The problem I found with other brands was that they cracked or the ends popped off and I was always buying more. These are great! Durable and do EXACTLY what I wanted. I am now a big fan. I will not have to replace them as the quality is very good. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome hair rollers for the price the curls staying my hair all day long this item was shipped to me fast and easy I will order from this seller again</li>
            <li> Was on time very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> The rods are very good thus far</li>
            <li> Works amazing!  I got the small size one but it is perfect of my mid-long hair.</li>
            <li> LOVED MY PURCHASE..EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND EXACT ITEM PICTURED. DELIVERY WAS FAST</li>
            <li> Love this product. I had previously ordered rollers with the foam, and it kept breaking my hair. I am not sure what this is made out of but it defintly doesn&#x27;t break my hair and it allows my hair to have the perfect curls. I love it. I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping in them yet but I am sure it shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li> Great product! I just wish you guys had a pack like this with only the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> didnt realize that these are the short flexi rods, but i made them work. great quality. fast delivery</li>
            <li> nice easy way to roll your hair.  I seldom roll my hair but these are easy to use and goes in quickly...</li>
            <li> I really love these things. They work good on natural hair and weave. I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting curly hair.</li>
            <li> The Flexi Rods are easy to use and come in a variety of sizes. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Came to my house real fast. This is very easy to use and very ideal to women who cannot afford to sit through the entire curling process. I use this every morning and still have plenty of time to do other stuffs while curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed,  they fell apart as soon as I started to use them..... the foam rips so easily, and hard to bend in different ways to curl the hair. My curling iron did a way better job.....and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers! I kept getting compliments on my hair which made me feel fantastic!!</li>
            <li> theyre too short. other than that, theyre fine. the small rods are useless, and i had to head to my local beauty supply to pick up more purple and grey ones</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Love them :)</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them to curl a synthetic wig that&#x27;s a tad old. After I put the rollers in, I dipped the wig in hot water for about 50 seconds. I let it dry overnight and when I took the rollers out I was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out. The curls are really soft and pretty and it gave my older wig life! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Hai so I got this just in time for graduation! Oml they really work I got really bouncy curls from this and it curled my extensions just fine:) I was really worried they&#x27;d take long to come but for 2$ they came in 2 days ☺️ recommend this and while typing this I got some in rn for tmr 😂 great product comes with 6(?) of each so there&#x27;s 42 and a cute bag for them. Lots of sizes for different curls so that&#x27;s good 😉 only thing is that I have short hair so at first the curls where really tight and so it was messy the 1st time the 2nd time I used bigger ones for my short hair so it was fine 😄 As you can tell I have really short hair so if you do don&#x27;t use a lot of them use the bigger ones and less is better 😉</li>
            <li> These did not work for me anyway I tried to use them. I have long, fine hair, and when I used them when my hair was dry, it wouldn&#x27;t hold. When I used them when my hair was wet, my hair didn&#x27;t dry, and turned out to be kinky and leave dents in the roots. I&#x27;m sure they work well for thicker hair, but I would not suggest for fine hair.</li>
            <li> great they did the job</li>
            <li> Love it not the sizes I thought the would be but satisfied</li>
            <li> Great curlers and great alternative to curly hair without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal---42 pieces for about $10, when a pack of 6 cost around $6-7....</li>
            <li> Package came right on time and these lil rods do there job better than applying harsh heat to your head</li>
            <li> These are great. However they did not serve the purpose I needed them for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - makes tight curls so I usually use the larger ones. Haven&#x27;t slept with them in yet.</li>
            <li> i love the rods they came the same day they were expected an they curl my hair really nice....wish they had more than 6 of.one size tho.</li>
            <li> its exactly like you see it!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality abs the length is perfect!</li>
            <li> My daughter used these the day we got them after she showered. She slept on them hoping they would be comfortable, but they weren&#x27;t. She hasn&#x27;t used them since.</li>
            <li> Loved them! They work even better than I expercted!  I would definately purchase these again &#x3D;) Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> works well, but won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I loved them.  Not bad to sleep in.  My super thin ultra straight hair was curly all day (which NEVER happens with hot rollers or curling irons).</li>
            <li> I have been trying not to apply any heat to my hair and these curlers are great! They curl my hair very nicely and I love it! In the picture I used the largest size (purple) to curl my hair and brushed it out for a more wavy look. My hair was slightly damp when I put them in and I did sleep on them. If you place them in the right spot sleeping on them is fine but other than that they are pretty uncomfortable. Also If you&#x27;re not wanting to sleep in them it took my hair about and hour and half to dry to hold the curl in these flex rods. These are great and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These do add curl to my hair, but most of them are too slim for me to use.  My hair is wavy (and likes to curl) so if I use the small rods (which make up the majority of the package) my hair tends to over curl.  There are six of the largest size rods and they are the ones that I use.</li>
            <li> They do their job and I enjoy that. just hard to sleep with but I&#x27;ve adapted</li>
            <li> flexi rods work well, but zipper was broken on the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> The problem with these flexi rods for me is that they are very short in length. I expected them to be ok since i have shoulder length hair, but they aren&#x27;t. Makes my hair look just wrong, cause i have to make the curls very tight for my hair to fit the roller  (i have very thick hair). I don&#x27;t know if im using them wrong or what, i&#x27;ve searched high and low for youtube tutorials but there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;d prefer to use these rather than my curling iron. Maybe if you have longer hair than mine you could enjoy them better. Guess I&#x27;ll just wait until i grow my hair back to try them out again..</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair so I bought two in order to have enough of the same size rods.</li>
            <li> Perfect for vacation. Only a few were needed. No need for a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Too time consuming to use.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> good quality product, thanks</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I want. Great for Natural curly hair to make bigger bouncy spirals.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to put in, but we haven&#x27;t seen great results in my daughter&#x27;s hair. That beign said, her hair does not curl easily.  They are very easy to use! I love that she can use them all by herself.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Very Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Would not recommend since it doesn&#x27;t even come with directions on how to use them.</li>
            <li> Excellent price amazing heartless curls you cannot go wrong!!</li>
            <li> These rods get the job done... it arrived very quick...order a set now..</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 but the zipper broke the 2nd time I opened the case</li>
            <li> I use them every night on my hair, I loove them!! The curls last all day and work as fast as 2 hrs for any event. Dry or. Wet definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love love all the different sizes. My hair is long, layered and thick, so it&#x27;s really nice to have the variety and look so good</li>
            <li> These flex rods are great and the fact that they come in various sizes is evev better.</li>
            <li> I wear weave in multiple lengths like 12, 14, &amp; 16inches.  These rods work on all lengths and the thinner the rod the tighter the curl.  I dont wear too many tight curls but I may use them in the back if I am having a long night so that it gives my hair time to fall.  I would order again for the price too!</li>
            <li> Rods are super short!!!!!</li>
            <li> This rods are a cinch to use, once you&#x27;ve played with them a bit. There are tons of youtube tutorials, I watched about a dozen and had no problems the first time using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not the most comfortable to sleep on, but they&#x27;re infinitely more comfortable than something like Curlformers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 42 pack of 7-inch rods, and I really only use the three largest rods (purple, grey, and orange). I think 10-inch rods would have been better for me - I have entirely too much hair - but I manage with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine, long, and I have a lot of it. I use this on barely-damp hair with mousse or diluted Lottabody, and use anywhere from six to eighteen of these at a time. Six gives me waves, eighteen gives me curls. The waves last me almost all day (6-10 hours, depending on the weather/what I&#x27;ve been doing) and the curls will last about 6 hours before dropping completely to waves, which will last me at least 18 hours from the original set (so, an additional 12 hours).</li>
            <li> A lot of fun..pretty good item..takes practice..quick shipping</li>
            <li> ive been trying to get these forever!!! I love everything about hair accessories !!! these work great and came at a great price not to mention fast shipping lol (amazon prime) lol. assorted sizes..... I love this thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and create great curls!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve saved money from just using these and doing my hair myself! So many different styles for all types of lengths of hair! I have long hair and my mom has short hair and the different sizes really come in handy and the curls hold really well! I would recommend these to anybody!!!!!</li>
            <li> This makes my curley haor that I already have so pretty its easy to use and any nationality can use not only woman of color</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. The curls look good at first but don&#x27;t seem to last long for me. Also, they&#x27;re difficult to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Smaller in length than I expected, however I have short hair and it will be quite some time that my hair will out grow these. I also learned that you don&#x27;t need to go all the way down the rod just to get the spiral effect.. you can double wrap and stretch the curls out as you go.. Seems to work for me (African American female, transitioning). I have a variety of these and honestly have been addicted to buying all shapes and sizes.. This pack comes with it all and easy to travel with. I recommend! No heat, no problem :)</li>
            <li> These did not work in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple times to use these, however my hair looks like a hot mess.  I have wavy dry hair so maybe that&#x27;s why. Aside from that, the real reason for 1 star is because they smell like rubber. They leave your hands and hair smelling like rubber.</li>
            <li> Worked great!  Although I realize that I really don&#x27;t need the smaller sizes but that a personal problem.I slept in the rollers and in the morning they created a perfect spiral. I just pulled them apart and had a curly style that lasted a couple days.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes really nice curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the flex rods... My curls come out so defined and they work great. I give them 3 stars because my pack only had 41 rods. It was missing 1 blue rod (I hate have to return stuff and having to wait on the new one so I&#x27;m just going to keep them). The rods have really strange odor. The only other thing is I should have gotten the longer ones. Other than that they get the job done!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes in this pack. It would&#x27;ve received 5 stars if you got more than 8 of each size, but the company may sell a larger pack that does.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the wires inside; flimsy.  Don&#x27;t know i the more expensive ones would be better?  Can&#x27;t get them to return to straight so they just end up a curvy mess and difficult to use time and time again.</li>
            <li> So easy-to-use  and  makes great curls.</li>
            <li> seller was lovely, my order arrived on time and they are of such good quality!!  sooo easy to use, they give the most beautiful curls and they last all day!!!!  I have extremely long hair (it reaches my hips) and even so, I only needed just the thick ones!  they were more than enough!  these rods are the best!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great rollers!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rods for my mother who has a little past shoulder length relaxed hair. She loves her rods. I style her hair with the red, yellow, blue and orange rods. The grey and purple rods can be used to add volume to flair ironed or blow-dried hair. When using these rods, keep in mind that rolling the rods creates curls, while wrapping the hair at the scalp around the rod will create waves. Play with the different sizes to create a beautiful head of curls or waves.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes of the flexi-rods. They range from large, 1 inch rods to really small ones, maybe 1/4 of an inch or smaller. The bend is also really good. I&#x27;ve been using these for twist outs and sets and really like the look that using different colored rods gives. I have armpit length relaxed hair and my results are perfect every time! Great value.</li>
            <li> I tried these for the first time last night after seeing how to do heatless curls or waves on youtube. They worked great! I have somewhat fine long hair down to middle of my back and it only took 6 twists to curl my whole head. I used the grey, purple and orange, created big beautiful beach waves. They weren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep in, but next time may try to position them to be more comfortable. I also wrapped a scarf around my head to keep them in place and from falling out while I slept. They did smell bad, like chemicals or something strange. I wiped them with a damp cloth before putting in my hair, still smelled, but today after having them in my hair and airing them out they smell normal now. I would recommend these for heatless curls or waves! Can&#x27;t wait to try the different size rods! ;)</li>
            <li> shipping fast, got exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> So comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> I wished the rods were longer</li>
            <li> I love this, it does what its made for, I bought this for my synthetic wigs and also my hair heat safe its perfect.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, Sturdy and Great Investment! I have Relaxed Hair, Short to Medium in Length and they work really well for whatever styling purposes I dream up!  The Flexi Rods come in Different sizes but if you have really long hair I would say Purchase Larger Sized ones. I Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to a few inches above my waist and these work great on my hair to give it curls without the damage. I am considering purchasing another package. Oh my hair is long and mostly strait because of the length.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shorter than the ones I usually get at the beauty supply store but I&#x27;ll give em a shot.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use if you hair is over 2 ft long like mine!</li>
            <li> These keep curls really well I even did my 7 and 9 year olds hair I&#x27;m really impressed because I&#x27;m black and usually use hot combs and flat irons every hot hair tool there is from dryers etc. but after getting this I noticed my hair stop breaking and growing more faster then b4 plus it seems more healthier after buying olive oil and coconut oil and coconut leave in conditioner and eliminating hair grease and stop shampooing my hair and started conditioning it instead after researching how bad these product are actually for black women and black men and black children  of color and how effective olive oil coconut oil and stop shampooing to only conditioning does wonders to our scalp hair  and restore your natural beauty of your hair buying flexrods with coconut oil olive oil made me eliminate the use of hot combs curling irons flat irons blow dryers perms or relaxers and my hair looks so thicker and less stripped uneven or unhealthy</li>
            <li> GREAT product&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for all women that desire heatless curls</li>
            <li> Love them! Finally curls that won&#x27;t heat damage my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this produce. Great price with a perfect carrying case.! I works great for my long hair. My curls last all day long. The larger rollers allow my hair to have great body that last all day.  I can brush or comb my hair without loosing the curls or body in my hair. I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> Product was used and in a very bad shape. Was expecting something new and better. Am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love,  love,  love!  This product came quickly and was as expected. I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m just in love.  I get so many compliments whenever I do my hair with them.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 11 year old daughter....&lt;br /&gt;She loved them....</li>
            <li> the turquoise, yellow and red rods are unusable (at least for me); they&#x27;re waaaay too narrow. Definitely not the look I&#x27;m going for. That&#x27;s 18 rods wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy curls can be achieved with the blue, grey and purple rods so I had to buy two sets given 18 out of each are useless.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, good quality and gave my 3b curls a gorgeous boost and bounce.</li>
            <li> This item came to me house two days after I purchased it online. I didn&#x27;t know it was 2-day shipping but I was happy. They work great and hold and everything, even the purple and grey ones. But they&#x27;re so short, my hair is down my back and I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d hold but they did. I love these things and they put beautiful bouncy curls in my hair. So buy buy buy even for long thick hair !</li>
            <li> These are great!  Previously got a different brand that smelled horrible.  These don&#x27;t.  I like the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I love all the different sizes, I&#x27;ve yet to use the full package on my hair. There are quite a few rollers included</li>
            <li> I went from little tight curls to big wavy curls I love my flexi rods and will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> great product. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> as long as you know how to properly use these flexi rods, than these will be the best ever. they are great, since the product is foam its pretty comfortable and i have had it for quite some time now and none of the rods are damaged. arrived on time, exactly as pictured and has just the right amount for different size curls</li>
            <li> Hurts while I sleep. :/</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy shoulder-length hair, and wanted to add &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; volume, so my intention has always been to use all the rods, in all the sizes. The thinner rods twisted shut fine, but anything thicker was too short to close properly, and took some persistence. Overall, it took me about 30 minutes to get them all in, so not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I went to sleep wearing them. Or rather, tried going to sleep. I have no trouble sleeping in rollers, but have no idea how anyone does it in these rods. The plastic discs closing the ends are hard and sharp, and some of them kept digging into my scalp. The bulk of the rest meant I had to stay in one position if I didn&#x27;t want them starting to painfully pull. After two hours of torture, I gave up. By then, there was no noticeable improvement in the curliness of my hair. Taking the rods out took 15 minutes and wasn&#x27;t hard, but it took another 15 in the morning to straighten them out enough so they&#x27;d fit back in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be using these again. If you&#x27;ve used something similar and are okay with it, then sure. The price is great, quality decent, and the mix of sizes seems pretty thorough for that naturally curly look.</li>
            <li> Love using the rods instead of the rollers for ,my niece hair.  Also the rods stay in her head a little longer than the rods can be.</li>
            <li> These flexi rods are awesome.  Excellent with a great price.</li>
            <li> Do not stay in hair. Curls do not hold. It was a nice concept but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I already owned quite a few of the flex rods. I love to use them to add curls to my hair. I am AA female with shoulder length relaxed hair. I have the 10 inch long rods, various sizes. When I initially opened my package I was a little dismayed by the length of the rods. They are about  5 to 6 inches long. I&#x27;m use to the 10 inch ones. I put one in my hair just to see if it would work as well as my longer rods...well...I actually like them a whole lot better! I ended up rolling my entire head because I was happy with the ease I had in rolling. I don&#x27;t have the excess rod on the end. I think these feel a lot better in my head. I now wish I had bought two sets. I&#x27;m glad I did not realize the size was shorter because I probably would not have bought. *side note: I put the rods in less then 30 mins ago, I took one loose just to see what my hair was doing and it&#x27;s already curly! I love these things! Do buy!!</li>
            <li> I truly do like how easily these flexi-rods work and the different sizes of 6 rods each is great. I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about these!</li>
            <li> Enjoy different sizes.</li>
            <li> Went from black dyed hair to reddish blonde which left my hair crazy dry/damaged from all the bleaching/stripping that was done to it. My natural curls wouldn&#x27;t curl anymore, so figured I&#x27;d try this; I love it! I can&#x27;t use hot rollers, a curling iron, or blow dryer on my hair since it&#x27;s fragile now, so this was a great alternative since it just had to air dry. I used all 42 flexi rods! The curls come out tight, but once you open them up by pulling the curls apart, turning one tight curl into 3 or 4 separate ones, you&#x27;ll see more volume/fullness to your hair. I&#x27;m happy with the results. Looks a lot like my own naturally curly hair :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this 4 stars due to the fact that I think this works on people with longer hair but my hair is shoulder length and I was unable to get them to stay in my hair. I will try them again as my hair gets longer, I have not given up on them yet. I recommend watching videos on YouTube if you haven&#x27;t used them before in order to get some tips on the easiest ways to put them in.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I had hoped!</li>
            <li> Good quality rods. They are a piece of plastic with a sheet of rubber over it. It is bendable and come in a variety of colors. I placed the smaller rods at the front of my natural hair to yield tighter curls. I had a problem fastening my hair to the end but once I developed a technique and figured it out. It was easy from that point on to put them in and remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;They are still working great and have been heavily used throughout the past few months. The handle on the bag is the only thing that came apart but everything else is in great working order.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. No issues with any if the rods not bending</li>
            <li> Much variety in size. These work great, prices is good. I love the color coding.</li>
            <li> these rods are the best I just put them in and get some nice bouncy curls in the morning, i use them on my human hair mix weave, the hair was already curly but not enough curls the twist-flex rods helped to give me the curls that I wanted.  I wrap my hair at night to keep the curls lasting for a week.  Then I use the rods again.  Good purchase, well worth the price love love love.</li>
            <li> Love them will buy more.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time&lt;br /&gt;And I am very pleased with them, the rods did well and shaped my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> As expected it, good deal</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she loves using it. She really likes all the different sizes. thank you</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! Its affordable and they are not uncomfortable sleeping in (of course they will feel weird sleeping on a foreign object but you can still sleep!).</li>
            <li> tried this once yet and its doing its job to curl my hair overnight. I wish it came with more big sizes as I prefer bigger curls</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull off my hair and is very easy to use. I definitely recommend this to girls who like styling their hair with no heating required. 100% safe and it will leave your hair looking great.</li>
            <li> First set of flexi rods I ever owned! Love them!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. All of my rods were able to bend, fast shipping, no problems with my order at all. Gives my hair very nice curls.</li>
            <li> First it came a day earlier so it was only one day shipping, how great that is! I had seen a tutorial on this on YouTube and decided to buy these, I bought two packs since I needed more in specific colors. They worked great! Took me a while to put them on, I&#x27;m hoping as time goes it&#x27;ll be quicker cause over two hours is too long for me. But I love it, my hair use to be curly now it&#x27;s wavy. This helped bring my curls back, even if only till my next wash.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with different sizes because I have like 3-4 different textures of hair on my head. It shipped quickly. And has been worth it for me so far, They take about 15-20 minutes to put it hair. I am okay with resting on them and placing a cap or scarf over them. Long story short they are amazing for refreshing and setting curls. Which if I sleep pineapple after taking them out wil last me for about a week.</li>
            <li> I really like these. These were my first experience with flexrods.I tried to order another but they&#x27;ve been out for a while. Will get more when they become avilable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;q</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use. Easy to sleep in too.</li>
            <li> Thought these were the longer ones.  They&#x27;re quite short to the ones i have and can be a tad difficult if you wear 30 inch hair like i do,  but they get the job done!  Me likey!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried that it would not be able to curl my tight kinky, coily curls, but to my believe it did and it was somewhat comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> Not what I expected in length.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so great! Easy to mold and they make beautiful curls every time! The best part is that no added heat is required! I&#x27;m really happy so far with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my daughter in law. She absolutely loves them. Curls are beautiful. Definitely works. Would recommend them to purchase.</li>
            <li> Came on time my daughter love her curls</li>
            <li> These rollers are awesome. As soon as I got them midday I decided to put them in just to practice. And they do take some practice to secure those ends. They made amazing waves in about two hours! Key things to note: bend the rod right over your end to best secure; this rod length will work for looooong hair; make sure your hair is at least damp before rolling to help control flyaways; it will take practice so don&#x27;t get discouraged. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair and I have thick curly hair makes my hair so much more full of life! I love that it lasts 3-4 days and I can do differ styles to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long locs and these rods worked great!  I used all the colors and my locs kept the curls for about three days.  I&#x27;m sure if I would have set my locs and sat under the dryer for at least an hour, the curls would have lasted longer.  Nonetheless, I am very happy with this product.  I ordered two sets because not only are my locs long, but I have ALOT of hair.  Therefore, I recommend anyone who has long, thick hair to order two sets.</li>
            <li> I finally caved and bought these after getting so tired of the same old twist-outs for my natural hair. Even though I&#x27;ve watched tutorials on using these, my hands are admittedly clumsy, so my first time result came out a lot less than stellar. I love the ease of using these though, and I can definitely see myself trying again in the future to achieve gorgeous, bouncy curls with these flex-rods!</li>
            <li> Ordered Saturday night and got it today in the mail! Omg it&#x27;s exactly as pictured :)</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Excellent packaging. All 42 Rods are in place! Nothing missing at all. The zipper was a bit sticky. But I sprayed a bit of oil on it. Don&#x27;t force the zipper though. Will buy again. Love the quantity &amp; quality.</li>
            <li> Great job at spiraling my hair. Item arrived on time in fact i think it was earlier,  just wish the ends of would bend better with these.</li>
            <li> Good variety and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very good choice I made. Great set, delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Package came on time works great and all of the rollers stay flexed.  Unlike some other complaints I have read they smelled fine.  I have really thick hair so I ordered two packs to make sure I had enough rollers.</li>
            <li> Work great and easy for my girls to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Initially expected larger sizes but was happy with this product. The results were great. Packaging is convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> Very happy will recommend the product is great</li>
            <li> Will take a little getting used too, but these are awesome!  The curls came out very clean and pretty, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and does the job!</li>
            <li> I love them!. The different sizes worked well and are very easy to use</li>
            <li> However did I make it without these!  I used the larger sizes most often, but am genuinely enjoying the short size and convenient carrier bag.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  Great for doing curls without damaging or burning your hair</li>
            <li> I love these rollers. They are soft and my 5 year old can sleep in these without them hurting her head.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them. + Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I was on my way out the door for work so I decided to try a few to see how they were. Lets just say I love them already! My hair had curls in 30 min. I wish they sold 42 pack in one size instead of a variety of sizes. I usually on use the purple ones. Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! All the rods bend and it looks great. It came when it was supposed to and I had no problems.</li>
            <li> These work perfect for adding some curls to my natural hair. I love that this set came with several different sizes. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Product came very fast. And I love them.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. They work!</li>
            <li> I use these for overnight curls since I don&#x27;t like to use many heat tools on my hair. Good variety of sizes and easy to use. They stay in place all night, even when I toss and turn.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many rods! They are shorter than the ones I usually buy but I had no trouble using them on my hair that is past my shoulders. These are a great way of adding curls without using heat.  Love these!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I just need more practice using them LOL. Although it&#x27;s free 2 day shipping with prime, it took 9 days for me to receive them but I guess it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in Hawaii. Anyway these are good flex rods and the price is great for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Just got the packet today and what can I say apart from the very fast shipping, great product, many sizes to choose from, super fun colors, great price 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these work great for some people, but if your hair is layered like mine.... not so good. It is too difficult for me to get the different lengths to roll up to mess with. I may just need some practice with them, but I was hoping for quick and easy. For me these rollers are neither.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really fixed. you cannot sleep while you have it on your hair.</li>
            <li> Love these! This is just the varity pack I was looking for. The quality seems good, love that the case can be used to store then.</li>
            <li> Love these! Highly recommend. Love the cute container it&#x27;s in. The size didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I love it love it love it the curls that these flexi rods gives you oh my god I will never hot curl my hair again</li>
            <li> Although  I thought  the rollers would be bigger,they are perfect. Delivery  was fast and punctual...I didn&#x27;t know they made Sunday deliveries. They are everything  you would expect. The seller is also amazing, they have everything  I need to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy, can&#x27;t wait to use them for my center pieces for my wedding reception.</li>
            <li> I put these in my hair before I went to sleep and when I took them out in the morning, I was left with gorgeous waves. They work wonderfully! The only issue I had that I feel is worth mentioning, is that they tend to smell like plastic when you first get them, though I&#x27;ve noticed the smell has faded over time. The range of sizes is nice, too, although I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever use the tiny rods in my hair. Overall, these are a great product!</li>
            <li> These worked great, though they are definitely not comfortable to sleep in. I have yet to find any method aside from pin curling that allows me to comfortably sleep through the night but I can&#x27;t complain about the results of this product. For such a low price, do yourself a favor and try it out! I have long, average hair and it worked great for me!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do. Gives you heartless curls. Wore them overnight and woke up with lots of curls. Unfortunately for me, my hair is not very long and the curls made my hair look short. Will continue to trial &amp; error until I find something that works for me. But for the price, this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it my hair is super curly and they are easy to sleep with on your head</li>
            <li> arrived only a few days later. Brand new. love the Rods! I even got my aunt to buy some as well!</li>
            <li> Looking at the picture I thought that all the rods was long. when they arrived and I took them out the box all of them was short. I&#x27;m a licensed Natural Hair stylist and I&#x27;m always looking for different ways to roll my clients hair but the rods are extremely short.. I&#x27;m keeping them but please inform your consumers that these are not the long flexi rods..</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and once received I first used the gray and orange rods. Good gosh was it a bit uncomfortable to sleep in that night. In the morning, I took them out and tadaaaaaaa curls. Now my hair is thin and down to my waist, so when I took these babies out I ran my fingers through my hair, did a little adjusting and  my hair looked fuller BUT shorter. Either way I received several compliments throughout the day (cheese). The next time I tried the rods I left them a little lower and put a scarf on my head to keep it in place and zzzzzzzzz I got a great nights sleep. I highly recommend them especially for those who don&#x27;t want to continuously use a curling iron or wand on their hair. I&#x27;ve also tried the smaller ones but it made me resemble Shirley Temple a bit more than I wanted so for big curls I recommend the gray/orange and the red/blue for smaller curls.</li>
            <li> They work well but once they&#x27;re bent it&#x27;s hard to repack them all well in its case. I ended up buying a zip bag to put them in.</li>
            <li> Hard for me to use . It might be me. Hands do not work well sometimes.</li>
            <li> just what I needed a variety of sizes</li>
            <li> Received this product but was shocked to find out that the rollers were a lot Allen than pictured. The good news is that it will fit for n my hair better (hopefully). The rod sizes are smaller also but it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. These are shorter than the regular Flexi rods, which I prefer. Probably won&#x27;t even use them :(</li>
            <li> Came on time and work great!</li>
            <li> Just like the picture. Came with a little bag to organize the rods. Good quality and different sizes that I can use for different styles.</li>
            <li> Expectations met and exceeded! Great product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rods did nt curl my hair, I have to return it because I used it twice bt it did not work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE, for the price and quantity these are perfect, my hair comes out perfect when I use these. I thought i wouldn&#x27;t like them because they were short but they were perfect.</li>
            <li> These are great! So easy to style my long very straight hair now. Lots of curlers and if you should run out of large ones you can just put two or more of the skinny ones together and use them that way.</li>
            <li> I was sooo shocked how fast I received my item, but I love it and thank you.</li>
            <li> Really good quality &amp; described correctly on the online description.  Very pleased about this product.</li>
            <li> What can I say good packaging and they are exactly like the photo very happy and pleased. I cannot wait to try these out on my hair well worth the money.</li>
            <li> a small learning curve but great buy for price</li>
            <li> wonderfulfor making spiral curls</li>
            <li> It works as described.  very good and does the job. IT COULD BE CHEAPER thats the only issue</li>
            <li> these are all very very small that&#x27;s why its so many in the pack!</li>
            <li> It curls my hair really fast. First time I tried it, put it on for 2hours and it really works great, got  great curls...</li>
            <li> I never was able to curl my hair with heat but theses flexi rods are so easy to use n give you great curls. LOVE IT !!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service, at a hair store these would be much more expensive, love the carrying case and variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee them wish I could show you how good they look .worrks great with virgin hair like Brazilian and so forth !</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do...they make your hair curly crazy.....even white hair.</li>
            <li> It came on time and made my hair curly i love this product</li>
            <li> curl when hair is almost dry</li>
            <li> Just as described! Great variety of flexi-rod sizes! Good quality! Good price! Enjoy that it comes in its own bag!</li>
            <li> Beyond satisfied. The rods varies in size which I&#x27;m happy about. The material is very durable. Soon as I opened the package I began to roll my hair. I have eight multi-sized rods in my hair and my head is not being weighed down by plastic rollers. I laid on them and were super comfortable. glade I purchased.</li>
            <li> The Twist-flex rods are an excellent product; easy to use with no mess or fuss, and I have already ordered another one!</li>
            <li> Works great! Does what they say they do. Night need to add products or heat to curl, it does everything on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Item is just as described.  Perfect on natural or straight hair. A great option for a curling iron alternative.  Really love these rods.</li>
            <li> Good price for lots of rods. Just wish they were longer. It requires about 1/3 of the top and 1/3 of the bottom to hold rod in place, not leaving much room for which to create spiral curls. Great alternative to irons and blow dryer, though.</li>
            <li> My curls came out beautiful. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good to do curls that won&#x27;t damage your hair leaves curls very beautiful,  has a variety of sizes. Only bad thing is that they are very uncomfortable to sleep in the tips of them are pretty hard.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a roller that I could put in at night, that would be comfortable enough to sleep in.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I have long (almost to my waist), thick hair and I get the prettiest spiral curls using them.  They are very simple to use, and the curls last all day.  Shipping was very fast, and they are more than worth the money I paid for them.  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I have been using these since i bough them. The curls are great and last long (1-2 weeks if you take care of the curly hair). I will totally recommend these to anyone. The only downside is the fact that you only have 6 rolls for each size. You have 4 or 5 different sizes so 30 rolls total of different sizes. I will be best to buy maybe 2 or 3 packs all at once so that you will always have enough of the size that you like.</li>
            <li> Makes nice curls and I sleep well with them in. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> My wife like&lt;br /&gt;Rely good</li>
            <li> It definitely works but idk if because of how my hair is or what. The first time I used it  my curls didn&#x27;t last for more than an hours I maybe I still don&#x27;t know how to use them... Still, I love them!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Awsome deal! I love my flexi rods.</li>
            <li> Love them! Perfect and such a great deal for this amount if flexible rods!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! The rods are great quality and the pack offers a very nice selection of sizes.  I would definitely recommend for a friend because the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Oh Wow,  my daughter used this right away and boy did shw love the look it created.  thanks for putting out the product from the curly girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe and Andrea</li>
            <li> These things are so simple! It took me half the time to curl my hair and it looked great. Love all the different sizes. The only complaint is the plastic piece in the center on the ends, my hair will get stuck in it</li>
            <li> Great product, good quality!</li>
            <li> very cute and durable</li>
            <li> Great buy.  They work and are comfy.</li>
            <li> Works great great price</li>
            <li> It was what I expected. Thank you. The price was right and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love these flex Rods!  I purchased them so I don&#x27;t have to put heat on my hair daily. All flex rods are NOT made the same. Trust me, I have purchased several different sets over the years and these are made much better and stay in place!</li>
            <li> I only left the flex rods in my hair for only 20 minutes or so and my hair was really curly! it lasted a few hours which was pretty impressive considering the amount of time it was in for and that I did not have any product in my hair. The shipping time was great too!</li>
            <li> smells like rubber. I think my hair smells like that as well. I wish there were more of each size as well</li>
            <li> Works like expected. Would definitely recommend to people trying to achieve heat less curls. I love these, a good assortment of sizes that get the job done. Terrible to sleep on so I suggest using a dryer to dry your hair rather than sleeping on them and drying overnight.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, because I wasn&#x27;t sure if 1 would be enough because I have REALLY thick natural 4C hair. One was enough and I got so many complements on my flex rod set. I am going to give the other one to a friend who wants to try it too.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it serves its purpose. I have 2 suggestions to help mAke the curling rods better  would be #1 stamp ends of rods with their size , ½ ⅔ ⅞ ⅜. #2 if the fexi rods were made longer. People with really long and thick like myself need longer rods to ensure the best results possible.</li>
            <li> Neatly Packed. Plenty of rollers of different sizes. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> As described thank you. These work nicely in my long hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for my 6 year old who wants to curl her hair like mommy but mommy to scared to use hot rod to curl her hair! I put about 10 of these on my daughter&#x27;s almost dried hair and leave it in for about 2 hours. Do a quick blow dry and take them off. Spray hair spray lightly all over and brush down with my fingers and yay! it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> These give you amazing curls with out heat and they last a couple days actually. I tend to use them before I go to bed. I put them in and sleep on them. The only thing is that they are hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. It usually takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to go to sleep but when I had these in it took me about an hour just to fall asleep but not only that but I would continue to wake up through out the night. So when I would wake up for school in the morning which is around 5:30 am I feel exhausted. But if these were more comfortable to sleep on I would definitely give these a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet because I just received them. I will give a complete update later. I went though a few to ensure they would bend/twist and they did however they are short.</li>
            <li> I love them and they came fast using tomorrow I can&#x27;t wait...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good deal but I was a little disappointed that it was a lot more really skinny rods versus the thick rods (which ppl would want more of) this item would work best for a little girls hair. Not adults.</li>
            <li> I brought this set of flexi rods because I&#x27;ve been transitioning my hair now from relaxed to natural for over 8 months and I needed something to do with my hair for work every morning other than the basic bun. This product has been my saving grace!! I put them on my hair while it&#x27;s damp, and let it dry over night. when I wake up I have perfectly curled hair, without heat. It takes about an hour and a half to do my entire head but it last for 3 days!! Loving these things!! And it doesn&#x27;t take a professional. I did these with NO experience other than a YouTube video and got great results every-time!!</li>
            <li> These are so soft and healthy for your hair.  I received mine today and put four of the orange ones in my hair to see how long before it would curl dry hair.  Well after doing a couple of things around the house, I removed them and low and behold my hair was curled nicely.  I&#x27;m back to order another tub of these.  You can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> I used these to curl my synthetic hair extensions with hot water and it worked so perfectly. I got perfect wavy curls using the gray colored ones, I cant wait to experiment with the other sizes and see how those come out. these rods are high quality and extremely durable( I poured boiling hot water over them and nothing happened to them). this is a great bargain for so many items, my only complaint the zipper was broken on the bag they came in but I just put them in another box.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; easy to use for multiple curly styles.</li>
            <li> They do its job.. Good to sleep on</li>
            <li> I like all the different sizes in one container that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg</li>
            <li> I never used flexi rods and didn&#x27;t know what size to get. This was a good purchase because I got a variety of sizes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have long hair because you will probably run out of the sizes you need before your done (my hair is cut shorter).</li>
            <li> works well for overnight non heat curls! comes with a lot of sizes. me and my daughters love them. good price. much better than the store</li>
            <li> I love them ! And it&#x27;s a great deal all different shapes and sizes</li>
            <li> :) best rods! I love my curls! ships fast!</li>
            <li> Work great but I ordered the long rods and received the 7 in rods..</li>
            <li> Apparently these are like 7 inches long, which is 3 inches shorter than the regular ones and it is a brilliant idea because I can fit more of them in my hair. Also, I don&#x27;t have that irritation of folding in the ends and thinking, &amp;#34;why is there so much extra rod?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two smallest sizes are too small for me to use, but even so, this is worth it for the other 30 that are a reasonable size.</li>
            <li> I so in love with my flex rods...i dont have no problems with them bending in any kind of way, they very easy to use and very comfortable to sleep in at night</li>
            <li> I got my  package this morning. It&#x27;s how it is in the picture. I would recommend this to someone who is interested in flexi rods. I would buy this again if needed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a really good prouduct and they are bendable; These flex rod make really good curls. Thanks for sending purchase in a timely manner and new as desired.</li>
            <li> These worked fine, though I warn those new to flexi rods: Be careful with your edges! Also these are a great deal, in that they come with a lot of flexi rods for cheap, but also their tiny. Plenty of room for medium/short length hair but not really sutible for anything else.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Leaves Hair with perfect curls&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the way they look as my alternative to twist outs. I really like that there are different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love these! I did a quick Google search to see how to use them, and watched 2 YouTube tutorials. Boom, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the largest rollers, the purple and grey ones, in for 2 hours to see how the curls would turn out. The results were great! The rollers are the perfect size and gave me the same look as my expensive digital perm. I&#x27;ve been getting digital perms for the last year to the tune of $200 every 3-4 months, so these rollers, at $12 a pack, are a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only needed 7 total for my whole head even though I have a lot of hair. Pictures attached.</li>
            <li> These things smell... quite badly. They don&#x27;t curl my hair very well, either. I will try them again, and report back.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all.  Very hard to use.  Curl does not hold as the sticks do not hold position.</li>
            <li> I love these, super easy to use and great results (lots of curls).  Perfect variety of sizes for various lengths of hair and amount of curl you want in your hair.  I was even able to sleep in these with my hair wet so it could dry overnight.  I had been wanting these for years but never found them in stores and didn&#x27;t know what they were called to search for them online.  One day I found a video online and finally figured it out and found them, of course, on Amazon!  What a great alternative to getting your hair permed.  I&#x27;ve only used them once so I don&#x27;t know if they hold up over time but they were such a great price, I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying them again if I needed to a year from now.  I have shoulder length, super straight hair, medium thickness and I&#x27;d have to say my curls lasted about a half day, but it was very hot outside, and my hair is cut straight.  I normally need to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to get any kind of body in my hair at all, but these curlers gave me lots of body, fun little ringlets, super fun!</li>
            <li> I love my flexi-rods Obrigado!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, they are so easy to use, and I can use all different sizes for different parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;#nice #easy #pretty</li>
            <li> Love them!!!&lt;br /&gt;Want to find some really huge ones as I have waist length hair.  These give great curl and bounce that last!&lt;br /&gt;I use an olive oil gel and thst it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I could find an awesome conditioner now!</li>
            <li> Great value and quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  My daughter has very long hair and we put these in her hair before she goes to bed.  It makes sleeping difficult sometimes however she wakes up with some mighty curls.  These are very easy to use.  Lots of different sizes to choose from.  I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> After excitedly opening my flex rod case, I proceeded to sort them by color and began preparing to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my dismay, I only counted 35 rods. I counted twice more. Still came up to 35 rods. On the package it says that it should contain 6 in each size, but my case only had 5 in each size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I feel disappointed and robbed, or confused. 35 rods alone is not enough to set my entire head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While otherwise pleased with this purchase, I can only give it 4 stars due to the missing rods.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I knew from the reviews that they were short-ish so I was not disappointed. I do love the fact that there are different gauges. That&#x27;s awesome because I don&#x27;t put a bucket over my head for a haircut so there are varying lengths. They are super soft and very comfortable. My hair does look a bit like a Christmas tree :)</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these all the time. They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Variety of rods in a nice travel kit.</li>
            <li> Makes the cutest curls</li>
            <li> They worked just as they said they would!  My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Love the assortment of sizes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these since I am growing my hair out and looking for styling alternatives to using my flat iron or curler. I sued these earlier this week and they worked really well. You get a TON of different sizes which is great if you want more varied curls in your hair which I did.. They also are very soft and bend easily so they don&#x27;t pull or tug at your hair. I think they are a great purchase for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I love using these in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughly so these weren&#x27;t what I was expecting. Boy am I happy about that these are even better than what I wanted and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so easy to use and curls turn out so pretty. not very comfortable to sleep on. the first time i tried them i kept them in for about 2 and a half hours and my curls lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Great price. Shipping came on time, very comfortable to wear while you sleep. Love it</li>
            <li> fast shipping great long lasting curls #noheat</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. I used a curling serum and blow dried my hair completely before wrapping my hair around these flexi rods. Woke up in the morning with curls! I will say that the curls were not very uniform, but that might have something to do with my skill level :). I would recommend to purchase a satin cap to wear over these when you sleep. I wore a stocking cap and it left my hair a little fuzzy in the a.m.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes thank u!!!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was as described. I can&#x27;t yet attest to quality as I haven&#x27;t used them enough.</li>
            <li> OMG these things are awesome! works great on curly textured and loc&#x27;d hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice and accurate, love them!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for a daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> They curl great and bend properly. The only thing is that at first they have a strange plastic smell. But overall happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, and has great variety!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with these! No more putting heat in my hair. I get some nice curls in my hair that last all day long thanks to these rods.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived just in time. I like having different sizes for smaller curls up front and bigger in the back</li>
            <li> Very accurate to description! Good quality</li>
