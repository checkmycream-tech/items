    <ol>
            <li>Best shave ever.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product....</li>
            <li>I think this is the best point</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by the product</li>
            <li>and here I am $34 in the hole and so happy I did so.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work great for me.  </li>
            <li>I think the cooling sensation is very nice.</li>
            <li>A good thing about being impulsive</li>
            <li>Not as good as Acqua Di Parma</li>
            <li>I can say that sake on my face, thought not quite as good as sake in my face, is good.</li>
            <li>Gives me a close shave and smells good.</li>
            <li>I therefore think the price is fair for its performance and duration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i got a good shave and no razor</li>
            <li>great product and ensures a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>When I got this product, I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The scent was very nice with the sake, and the pearly texture was interesting, but this product didn&#x27;t perform to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>A huge win for me.</li>
            <li>Really the best shave cream ever created for men&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>It IS noticeable though (and might not play nice with cologne) and does linger a bit.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I really liked Clinique but they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>Of all the shave creams I have tried I would say this rates as one of the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of boggled by all the 1 star reviews for this stuff... if you don&#x27;t like the scent, but the UNSCENTED VERSION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives a very refreshing cooling feeling and and the cream itself gives you a very clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All my shaving creams / gels have come from over the counter store brands and they were sufficient for the most part</li>
            <li>Using that to shave head and face, highly satisfied with quality of product and after shave feelings of smooth and calming skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a better lather by using my fingers like a brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get WITHOUT IRRITATION.  </li>
            <li>May be a bit better, but just by a whisker.</li>
            <li>Having shaved with brush and razor for years, I decided to see if this cream is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I love sake</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>I imagine with a safety razor it could be even better.</li>
            <li>in all a great product and one that I don&#x27;t see very often.</li>
            <li>That makes it appear all the more opulent.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of Sake Infused Shaving Cream and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>my husband likes that it lathers easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more effort to clean the razor.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong sensation though</li>
            <li>The cream also has a pleasant scent which, although isn&#x27;t essential, makes the process slightly more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Close, smooth shave with zero friction and no irritation after as well...  </li>
            <li>If you wait the 2 minutes after applying the shave cream then it is a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is stuff</li>
            <li>there is already full.  </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m finished my face feels hydrated and cool.</li>
            <li>There are some positives to it, like the pleasant scent and nice, cooling sensation on the skin, but my experience was largely negative.   </li>
            <li>The last quality is very important and has disqualified Billy Jealous and Harry&#x27;s shave creams: they both hold on to that razor for dear life making my shave routine all the more time consuming.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put value on results and I can definitely see why this creme made it, to so many top list for men&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>A much better option (for me) has been Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender Shaving Cream (available from amazon).</li>
            <li>If you like your face to feel cool and fresh when you are done shaving this is something you may want to try.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to try my hand at shaving with a double edged razor, and this was the first shaving cream that I got to try out, but wasn&#x27;t very impressed by its performance.  </li>
            <li>I have probably used every single shave gel or cream made in recent memory and this is hands-down the best stuff.  </li>
            <li>For a brushless cream I suppose it is decent, but it clogs my DE razor easily.</li>
            <li>As some others have noted, the thicker cream requires more frequent rinsing of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>is that my face feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>Taylor costs less, lasts much longer, lathers nicely, goes on with a brush, offers a great shave and is fine for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I love the scent which has a rich mineral and Asian influenced sake sort of aroma.</li>
            <li>This is a very great cream that seems to offer above average protection from razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless this is a small price to pay for an exceptionally close and comfortable</li>
            <li>After cleansing with shave cream and this scent however, I definitely feel a cooling and refreshing sensation for 30 mins or so which I think is good as a long~lasting effect compared with other products that claim to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like that it leaves his skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>you will see that it works wonders and the price is very reasonable for the number of shaves per tub.</li>
            <li>First time trying it</li>
            <li>Love this product, actually worked for my acne from shaving too often</li>
            <li>I put a shaving oil after laying a hot towel over my face or at the end of a shower than I put this on my face and let it sit for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t bother using a brush.</li>
            <li>This means when you come to shave, you may need to re~wet your face, and frequently rinse your blade, otherwise your razor becomes quite clogged quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like the Kyoku products.  </li>
            <li>(fast swirling of cream onto fast) than by using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I think the real test in any product is trying it yourself.  </li>
            <li>get a very close shave with this cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really dissapointed with tkhe amount and quality of foam of this product.</li>
            <li>This is a subjective and personal opinion however; the senstitive skin version is available if you do not take to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It softened my hair more than i expected</li>
            <li>I may be too used to using a lather, but this felt like painting on a thick paste that I had to scrape off, and didn&#x27;t find that it gave any noticeably good razor glide or slip.  </li>
            <li>you actually use this product right, by having a freshy showered wet and warm face, and don&#x27;t glob it on, and let it sit for 2 minutes, it does work really well.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty darn sensitive skin and the regular version of this product worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide an exceptionally close shave with minimal irritation, but it also washes out of the razor with almost no effort.  </li>
            <li>Too many nicked areas where other shaving creams delivered smoother, slicker shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly fond of how close of a shave</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Starting to realize when women spend so much money on higher end products...  </li>
            <li>I did not receive the Kyoku for men that I had ordered for normal skin..</li>
            <li>I pretty much use Acqua Di Parma and Kyoku products only these days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little plasticky at first, but afterwards not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The cream in the jar has a soft fresh smell, someting mixed between eucalyptus and sake (?).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands over the years because I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is cheap but not worth.</li>
            <li>the product itself is not noticeably better than some other comparable options such as Aqua Di Parma that would justify some of the drawbacks</li>
            <li>the application/delay is less a fit for my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did my homework and thought wow $34 for shave creme...  </li>
            <li>Eliminates razor burn and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>they sent me the Kuoku for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; cream that is applied directly to the face, with fingers.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I found mixing with a brush helps to spread it completely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to shave a lot for the military and this is the only product which really keeps &amp;#34;shave burn&amp;#34; down and keeps your skin smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>While this shaving cream definitely has a luxurious feel to it, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>The directions on the description page clearly say to apply with a brush or hand, but this is definitely a brushless cream.</li>
            <li>I use a decent amount each shave too, but a single container of this lasts me about 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it clings to the razor blade making it very hard to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just a question of price either - I don&#x27;t think I would use it if it cost half as much.   </li>
            <li>Aside from being thick, I love the fact that it comes in a jar, which means I will not make a mess trying to squeeze the last of it like when the ones that come in tubes.  </li>

            <li> I used to believe that a shave was just a shave.  all you needed was a razor and some soap.  All my shaving creams / gels have come from over the counter store brands and they were sufficient for the most part but thankfully my facial hair isn&#x27;t as thick as some other types.  Accidentally I saw a review about products men should be using and I did my homework and thought wow $34 for shave creme...  A good thing about being impulsive is you end up doing things you thought you never would and here I am $34 in the hole and so happy I did so.  Best shave ever.  Easy application.  Close, smooth shave with zero friction and no irritation after as well...  You can&#x27;t put value on results and I can definitely see why this creme made it, to so many top list for men&#x27;s products.  Starting to realize when women spend so much money on higher end products...  well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....my husband likes that it lathers easily and I like that it leaves his skin very soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
            <li> Really the best shave cream ever created for men&#x27;s skin. Using that to shave head and face, highly satisfied with quality of product and after shave feelings of smooth and calming skin! One jar is lasts about 2 months with everyday usage. I&#x27;m also using other products from same brand, recommend it for all.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try my hand at shaving with a double edged razor, and this was the first shaving cream that I got to try out, but wasn&#x27;t very impressed by its performance.  I may be too used to using a lather, but this felt like painting on a thick paste that I had to scrape off, and didn&#x27;t find that it gave any noticeably good razor glide or slip.  The scent was very nice with the sake, and the pearly texture was interesting, but this product didn&#x27;t perform to my expectations.  Too many nicked areas where other shaving creams delivered smoother, slicker shaves.</li>
            <li> First time trying it and I&#x27;m liking it</li>
            <li> Eliminates razor burn and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product, actually worked for my acne from shaving too often</li>
            <li> The directions on the description page clearly say to apply with a brush or hand, but this is definitely a brushless cream. Will not lather with a badger brush as I was expecting. For a brushless cream I suppose it is decent, but it clogs my DE razor easily.</li>
            <li> I really like the Kyoku products.  This is a very great cream that seems to offer above average protection from razor burn.  Aside from being thick, I love the fact that it comes in a jar, which means I will not make a mess trying to squeeze the last of it like when the ones that come in tubes.  I must admit that I am not too crazy for its scent.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the Kyoku for men that I had ordered for normal skin..they sent me the Kuoku for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> you rub it in with your fingers and let sit for about 2 minutes before shaving.  I put a shaving oil after laying a hot towel over my face or at the end of a shower than I put this on my face and let it sit for two minutes.  This seems to work great for me.  Not as good as Acqua Di Parma but I put it up there with the art of shaving shaving cream.  I pretty much use Acqua Di Parma and Kyoku products only these days.  I use this rather than the Acqua Di Parma when I am at the Gym before work so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a shaving brush my locker there is already full.  This does not lather up on your face though.  If that is what you like this is not a product for you.  If you like your face to feel cool and fresh when you are done shaving this is something you may want to try.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  I have to shave a lot for the military and this is the only product which really keeps &amp;#34;shave burn&amp;#34; down and keeps your skin smooth after use.  It also lasts a long time since only a small dab of the product is necessary to use.</li>
            <li> I have probably used every single shave gel or cream made in recent memory and this is hands-down the best stuff.  Not only does it provide an exceptionally close shave with minimal irritation, but it also washes out of the razor with almost no effort.  The last quality is very important and has disqualified Billy Jealous and Harry&#x27;s shave creams: they both hold on to that razor for dear life making my shave routine all the more time consuming.  The cream also has a pleasant scent which, although isn&#x27;t essential, makes the process slightly more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak highly enough of this stuff.  Try it: you will see that it works wonders and the price is very reasonable for the number of shaves per tub.</li>
            <li> I would not say this is a bad product. However, I think there are others out there that are easier to use. I think the following 5 points sum up my thought process every time I use it to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First, don&#x27;t bother using a brush. I&#x27;m able to get a better lather by using my fingers like a brush (fast swirling of cream onto fast) than by using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) As some others have noted, the thicker cream requires more frequent rinsing of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3) The smell is... different. It&#x27;s a little plasticky at first, but afterwards not bad at all. It IS noticeable though (and might not play nice with cologne) and does linger a bit.&lt;br /&gt;4) I think the cooling sensation is very nice. I think this is the best point is that my face feels fresh afterwards. It&#x27;s a strong sensation though so I can see how some others might not like it.&lt;br /&gt;5) It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I think the real test in any product is trying it yourself.  When I got this product, I was very satisfied.  I&#x27;m particularly fond of how close of a shave I&#x27;m able to get WITHOUT IRRITATION.  A huge win for me.</li>
            <li> Oh my god, this is almost like not having any cream on. May be a bit better, but just by a whisker. Tried this after having been on Hydroplane, and this is such a disappointment. I&#x27;m returning this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks save you money on this one.</li>
            <li> Having shaved with brush and razor for years, I decided to see if this cream is worthwhile. There are some positives to it, like the pleasant scent and nice, cooling sensation on the skin, but my experience was largely negative.   Here are some of my observations:   1. It&#x27;s obscenely expensive.   2. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; cream that is applied directly to the face, with fingers. It isn&#x27;t the type of cream one lathers up with a brush.   3. The 6 oz. container does not last long.   4. Once applied to the face, this cream is thick and gooey, which actually makes it more difficult to shave. It&#x27;s also more effort to clean the razor.   5. Because of No.4, it took some time to get used to shaving with it. I kept cutting myself, which I normally almost never do.   While this shaving cream definitely has a luxurious feel to it, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. It&#x27;s not just a question of price either - I don&#x27;t think I would use it if it cost half as much.   A much better option (for me) has been Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender Shaving Cream (available from amazon). Taylor costs less, lasts much longer, lathers nicely, goes on with a brush, offers a great shave and is fine for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this when he actually uses it.</li>
            <li> I love sake so when I found this product I had to try it. I can say that sake on my face, thought not quite as good as sake in my face, is good. It shaves well with my DE safety razor. Makes my skin feel feel really soft. It is a bit expensive but it doesn&#x27;t require much. A thin coat of the stuff left on for 2 minutes works very well. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it clings to the razor blade making it very hard to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken a star away. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is stuff has done unspeakable things to my sink drain.</li>
            <li> great product and ensures a very smooth finish. I&#x27;m impressed by the product</li>
            <li> Not too think but allows a close shave.</li>
            <li> Some people may say that this is a very expensive product. Well, it is in the Netherlands. Ik bought this on Amazon for $30 incl. shipping. In the Netherlands this sells for 35 euro, aprox. $45!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands over the years because I have a very sensitive skin. I really liked Clinique but they stopped selling it. I&#x27;ve tried Lab series, Biotherm, Zirh, Geo F Trumper and Anthony. This is my favorite. The cream in the jar has a soft fresh smell, someting mixed between eucalyptus and sake (?). I shave under the shower and when I put it on my face, the smell becomes a little stale. As it&#x27;s a cream, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. My last Trumper jar lasted about 6 months using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I get a very close shave with this cream and when I&#x27;m finished my face feels hydrated and cool. Afterwards I use the Kyoku razor repair balm (which also has a strange smell).&lt;br /&gt;No bumps and no red marks. Will definately buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ&lt;br /&gt;The Netherlands</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of Sake Infused Shaving Cream and was excited to try it out.  I&#x27;ll give them that it&#x27;s very different from other shave creams but for the price, definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed with tkhe amount and quality of foam of this product. It is cheap but not worth. No recommendable</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. I used to get ingrowns all the time, but this + a brush works wonders. I use a decent amount each shave too, but a single container of this lasts me about 1.5-2 months.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close shave and smells good. It doesn&#x27;t get me drunk like my last shave creme did. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Of all the shave creams I have tried I would say this rates as one of the absolute best. It gives a very refreshing cooling feeling and and the cream itself gives you a very clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor issue with the cream is that it does tend to dry out after a couple of minutes and you should leave it on your face for that long. This means when you come to shave, you may need to re~wet your face, and frequently rinse your blade, otherwise your razor becomes quite clogged quickly. Nevertheless this is a small price to pay for an exceptionally close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love the scent which has a rich mineral and Asian influenced sake sort of aroma. This is a subjective and personal opinion however; the senstitive skin version is available if you do not take to the fragrance. After cleansing with shave cream and this scent however, I definitely feel a cooling and refreshing sensation for 30 mins or so which I think is good as a long~lasting effect compared with other products that claim to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey however, used as suggested it still lasted me 5 months or so of daily shaving even with my thick beard growth. This is because it does not lather, and as such, you need only apply a thin even coat ~ u need not apply copious amounts. I therefore think the price is fair for its performance and duration.&lt;br /&gt;I applied with a brush, but you could just as well apply with your hands. I then proceeded to shave with a regular 2 blade razor. I imagine with a safety razor it could be even better. I found mixing with a brush helps to spread it completely and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product and one that I don&#x27;t see very often. That makes it appear all the more opulent.</li>
            <li> Need to apply with your fingers vs. a shaving brush that I used with my prior product. Also needs to be left on the skin for a couple of minutes prior to shaving. Unfortunately I usually shave in the mornings in a rush and the application/delay is less a fit for my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the product itself is not noticeably better than some other comparable options such as Aqua Di Parma that would justify some of the drawbacks</li>
            <li> Works very well. If you wait the 2 minutes after applying the shave cream then it is a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of boggled by all the 1 star reviews for this stuff... if you don&#x27;t like the scent, but the UNSCENTED VERSION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with a double edge 1960&#x27;s gillette with Feather blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have pretty darn sensitive skin and the regular version of this product worked fine for me.  I&#x27;ve used other cooling lotions like jack black beard lube and Zihr and they both burned my face and made it turn red and blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i could describe the scent i would say it smells like a mix of mint, green tea, and ivory soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you actually use this product right, by having a freshy showered wet and warm face, and don&#x27;t glob it on, and let it sit for 2 minutes, it does work really well.  It softened my hair more than i expected and i got a good shave and no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this gets a 4 instead of a 5 for me is A:because it is slightly overpriced. and B: it is slightly less slippery than i would prefer compared with others like Eshu shave gel.</li>
