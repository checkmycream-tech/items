            <li>I am amazed at the great price for this soap and believe me it makes an excellent gift.  </li>

            <li>It lathers well, and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And a very nice soap, at that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And a very nice soap, at that.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful soap with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>love the gorgeous box which would make this soap perfect for Christmas, birthday and giving for Teacher Appreciation gifts!</li>
            <li>The packaging is beautiful and this would make a nice gift item.  </li>
            <li>It lathers beautifully, smells like a spring bouquet, and soaps you up nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The de Provence Soap makes a nice dense lather that works great for shaving your legs and it isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li>Comes in a gorgeous box with a flowery design with French-inspired pattern over all in gold.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s probably a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was impressed with the packaging and thought that it could easily be given as a gift as the bar of soap is shipped in a nice box with shredded paper as its nest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a lovely decorative box, which makes it great to give as a gift to someone or to include in a bath-themed gift basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the packaging is impressive.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was pleasant but not overpowering and stayed with me most of the day.  </li>
            <li>The soap is large and impressive ( fat kidney bean shape palm sized )</li>
            <li>But if that is to your liking you will indeed find this luxury soap amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and relaxing for the tub though.</li>
            <li>I like the Shea Butter because it&#x27;s nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Presented in a nice gift box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice box with straw, so if you give it as a housewarming gift it looks nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Then your nail will smell nice, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent of this soap is very nice -- not too flowery, not too musky, but a genuine spice and floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and silky, feels wonderful in your hands and has a mild floral scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling, mildly scented soap.</li>
            <li>However, as a gift (it comes in a  gorgeous box) or simply to keep in your bathroom for the fragrance, it&#x27;s a delightful soap.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves my skin feeling SO soft and smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This smells lovely and comes in a nice gift box.  </li>
            <li>With this comes a hefty price tag however and the bar&#x27;s size really makes it more ideal for bathing and not showering.  </li>
            <li>The large bar is packaged beautifully and the bar provides ultra lathering and moisturizing with three butters.  </li>
            <li>and the bathroom still is smelling strongly of its perfume (rose, maybe).</li>
            <li>All in all, I am enjoying this soap</li>
            <li>we LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li>but on Saturdays I love to take a long,hot,relaxing bath...</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overly flowery or cloying, but is more like a unisex &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes me want to wash my hands more often.</li>
            <li>The box is lovely as well, and seconds as a decoration in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>The bar of soap is huge and grasping it gives the fingers a nice stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly, wonderful, not masculine at all.</li>
            <li>I find the scent to be refreshing and clean smelling. . .</li>
            <li>easily provide</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strongly scented soaps this product won&#x27;t be for you.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend this beautiful product.</li>
            <li>Nice lather, pleasant smell, and left my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is overwhelming when first opening the box!</li>
            <li>Shaped to stay in your hand, despite the huge size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell from the soap is verystrong straight out of the box, but it leaves a really nice light scent on my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is very feminine, floral, and nice.</li>
            <li>soap lathers easily and fully, and seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li>Add to the list of great French things...</li>
            <li>All around a very nice bit of luxury in your daily</li>
            <li>Loaded with rich butters.  </li>
            <li>The box that this comes in is so pretty too, and the bar smells lovely through the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would make a nice gift for someone you want to allow to treat themselves :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge luxurious bar that comes nestled in a very pretty box.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a large bar.</li>
            <li>but it makes it look special (my wife commented).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a Lovely scented, luxurious large bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to me to have products I like using and enjoy the smell of in the shower, soap and face wash being the most crucial.  </li>
            <li>It makes a nice gift certainly, with the pretty box and perfumed scent.</li>
            <li>Any true soap lover would be in heaven.</li>
            <li>Like many people, the shower is my way to relax in the morning and get ready to face the work day.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit much for routine use, though, unless you truly love the smell.</li>
            <li>My daughter is already saying she wants to buy more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>Give the cool excelsior in your box to the birds for nesting material.  </li>
            <li>We use natural and French milled soaps, for us the scent, which IS very strong was wonderful and very similar to soaps we already have.</li>
            <li>Pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance that lasts the better part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>Finally it&#x27;s presented in a really nice gift quality box that makes you excited to start using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a large bar of soap that&#x27;s shaped like a huge bean.</li>
            <li>The bar is twice the size of the giant bars of soap my own company sells.</li>
            <li>I love how natural it smells.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, but after a few days in the shower, it&#x27;s becoming more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of now, her only dislike is the scent which to her is very strong.</li>
            <li>However there is a major drawback; this soap is HUGE!</li>
            <li>Extra large soap size is perfect for baths but not exactly practical for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a very fine product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to a woman who likes more outdoorsey, masculine scents and wants a creamy luxurious soap.</li>
            <li>According to my mother (whose word was not to be doubted under any circumstances), this gives the soap a chance to dry out, giving it a longer life, and scents the drawer nicely.  </li>
            <li>The multiple butters in the soap REALLY give your skin a silk smooth feel, while still leaving it clean feeling!</li>
            <li>But for adults, it is perfectly fine, and so far it has lasted</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin ultra soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>bar of soap itself is about the size of a sweet potato - it won&#x27;t fit in our soap dish (but how do you complain about it being too big?).</li>
            <li>At first I thought roses, but they don&#x27;t predominate.</li>
            <li>It lathers richly and rinses clean with only the scent remaining.</li>
            <li>It is rich smelling, leaves you feeling clean and is massive!  </li>
            <li>This makes for a very big and a very fancy bar of soap, with a fairly strong smell, though the smell is sweet.</li>
            <li>As someone mentioned in another review, you could, seriously, use it as a weapon - lol.  </li>
            <li>I would have much preferred  more raffia as the only cushion for the soap.</li>
            <li>It strikes me as the sort of thing that would make a good small gift to a host since it does have a fancy feel to it</li>
            <li>There are plenty of soaps that work well, smell nice, and cost much less.</li>
            <li>The shape makes it easy to hold such a large bar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large in the hand to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am a soap junkie; I love to try new and different ones from hand-made to foreign-made.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a lovely fresh clean scent that is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A noteworthy gift for someone who appreciates a finely crafted product, or loves all things French.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bar of soap, almost too big to hold in your hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But calling it a &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct.</li>
            <li>I guarantee said magician will come up with some nifty effect that absolutely needs that box.  </li>
            <li>, no one note overwhelming the other, all coming together in a harmonious whole that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance and unlike some premium soaps isn&#x27;t soft enough to go down the drain with your shower water.  </li>
            <li>Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box is a lovely little box of pampering.  </li>
            <li>It also kicks the soap&#x27;s scent down a notch since the smell is a bit strong straight out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>This is no ordinary bar of soap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long this bar of soap actually lasts, given its cost; to compare how long it lasts with how many normal bars of soap I would have used in the same time period.  </li>
            <li>The bar itself is about three times the normal size and</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t dry out compared to when you use most commercial soaps.  </li>
            <li>The scent is just strong enough, it actually fills the bathroom with its scent, but doesn&#x27;t overpower you when you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very large rounded bar of soap, I&#x27;d say about 2.5x larger.</li>
            <li>This Pre de Provence Soap bar is huge, probably comparable to two regular bars of commercial soap.  </li>
            <li>In her opinion, she enjoys the bar very much and has said that it lathers very quickly and has a thick, creamy</li>
            <li>The first thing to know about this soap is that it is a French fragrance infused soap.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands and the larger shape</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a large, solid bar.</li>
            <li>Then you go clean the cat box, unclog the disposal, sort the recycling, and hunt down the funky smell in the refrigerator, still bathed in its aura.  </li>
            <li>Large sized bar lasted me nearly 2 weeks of daily shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is of the quality that you would expect to find in a 5 star French hotel or a quality bed and breakfast.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The bar is enriched with shea, and does leave your skin soft without feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s the real deal and not the paper substitute where the colors run and suddenly the birds are bathing in purple water.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ones who can&#x27;t pass a Lush store without going in &amp;#34;just to see what&#x27;s new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Want to try the other Luxe soap fragrance but not much info is available on these!</li>
            <li>So you are getting your money&#x27;s worth due to its increased size, if you&#x27;re used to paying hand-made soap prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not too heavy, but certainly present enough to give my bathroom a fresh, mildly perfumed scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend quite a bit extra for a bar of luxury soap that I&#x27;d definitely say give the Pre de Provence brand a try.</li>
            <li>Failing that, it&#x27;s a cool sturdy little box for your collection of push pins, safety pins, buttons, paperclips, coupons...</li>
            <li>..and it does get you clean, rinses away clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very large -- nearly three times the size of an average bar of soap!</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s a little big, but it should last a long time and it&#x27;s got extra moisturizing ingredients and a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Triple milled soaps like this are a real treat, lather well, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>and if you like the musky tones of an expensive perfume or even a nice cologne, this is going to hit your spot.</li>
            <li>Drive nails with less risk of splitting the wood by first rubbing some of the soap on the nail shank.  </li>
            <li>Inside the decorative box (which she found worthy of display), it is packaged in some sort of shaved paper resembling hay - a small touch</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very large, so expect to drop it a few times) and the price.</li>
            <li>For seventeen bucks, you can get two or three 8-packs of brand name soap, enough to last far longer than this solitary bar, despite its size.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and silky, feels wonderful in your hands and has a mild floral scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling, mildly scented soap.</li>
            <li> However, as a gift (it comes in a  gorgeous box) or simply to keep in your bathroom for the fragrance, it&#x27;s a delightful soap.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin feeling SO soft and smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This smells lovely and comes in a nice gift box.  </li>
            <li> With this comes a hefty price tag however and the bar&#x27;s size really makes it more ideal for bathing and not showering.  </li>
            <li> The large bar is packaged beautifully and the bar provides ultra lathering and moisturizing with three butters.  </li>
            <li> and the bathroom still is smelling strongly of its perfume (rose, maybe).</li>
            <li> All in all, I am enjoying this soap</li>
            <li> we LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li> but on Saturdays I love to take a long,hot,relaxing bath...</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overly flowery or cloying, but is more like a unisex &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> It makes me want to wash my hands more often.</li>
            <li> The box is lovely as well, and seconds as a decoration in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> The bar of soap is huge and grasping it gives the fingers a nice stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly, wonderful, not masculine at all.</li>
            <li> I find the scent to be refreshing and clean smelling. . .</li>
            <li> easily provide</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like strongly scented soaps this product won&#x27;t be for you.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I recommend this beautiful product.</li>
            <li> Nice lather, pleasant smell, and left my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is overwhelming when first opening the box!</li>
            <li> Shaped to stay in your hand, despite the huge size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell from the soap is verystrong straight out of the box, but it leaves a really nice light scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is very feminine, floral, and nice.</li>
            <li> soap lathers easily and fully, and seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li> Add to the list of great French things...</li>
            <li> All around a very nice bit of luxury in your daily</li>
            <li> Loaded with rich butters.  </li>
            <li> The box that this comes in is so pretty too, and the bar smells lovely through the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would make a nice gift for someone you want to allow to treat themselves :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge luxurious bar that comes nestled in a very pretty box.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a large bar.</li>
            <li> but it makes it look special (my wife commented).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a Lovely scented, luxurious large bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to me to have products I like using and enjoy the smell of in the shower, soap and face wash being the most crucial.  </li>
            <li> It makes a nice gift certainly, with the pretty box and perfumed scent.</li>
            <li> Any true soap lover would be in heaven.</li>
            <li> Like many people, the shower is my way to relax in the morning and get ready to face the work day.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit much for routine use, though, unless you truly love the smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter is already saying she wants to buy more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> Give the cool excelsior in your box to the birds for nesting material.  </li>
            <li> We use natural and French milled soaps, for us the scent, which IS very strong was wonderful and very similar to soaps we already have.</li>
            <li> Pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance that lasts the better part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Finally it&#x27;s presented in a really nice gift quality box that makes you excited to start using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a large bar of soap that&#x27;s shaped like a huge bean.</li>
            <li> The bar is twice the size of the giant bars of soap my own company sells.</li>
            <li> I love how natural it smells.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, but after a few days in the shower, it&#x27;s becoming more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of now, her only dislike is the scent which to her is very strong.</li>
            <li> However there is a major drawback; this soap is HUGE!</li>
            <li> Extra large soap size is perfect for baths but not exactly practical for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a very fine product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a woman who likes more outdoorsey, masculine scents and wants a creamy luxurious soap.</li>
            <li> According to my mother (whose word was not to be doubted under any circumstances), this gives the soap a chance to dry out, giving it a longer life, and scents the drawer nicely.  </li>
            <li> The multiple butters in the soap REALLY give your skin a silk smooth feel, while still leaving it clean feeling!</li>
            <li> But for adults, it is perfectly fine, and so far it has lasted</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin ultra soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> bar of soap itself is about the size of a sweet potato - it won&#x27;t fit in our soap dish (but how do you complain about it being too big?).</li>
            <li> At first I thought roses, but they don&#x27;t predominate.</li>
            <li> It lathers richly and rinses clean with only the scent remaining.</li>
            <li> It is rich smelling, leaves you feeling clean and is massive!  </li>
            <li> This makes for a very big and a very fancy bar of soap, with a fairly strong smell, though the smell is sweet.</li>
            <li> As someone mentioned in another review, you could, seriously, use it as a weapon - lol.  </li>
            <li> I would have much preferred  more raffia as the only cushion for the soap.</li>
            <li> It strikes me as the sort of thing that would make a good small gift to a host since it does have a fancy feel to it</li>
            <li> There are plenty of soaps that work well, smell nice, and cost much less.</li>
            <li> The shape makes it easy to hold such a large bar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large in the hand to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am a soap junkie; I love to try new and different ones from hand-made to foreign-made.  </li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely fresh clean scent that is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A noteworthy gift for someone who appreciates a finely crafted product, or loves all things French.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bar of soap, almost too big to hold in your hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But calling it a &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct.</li>
            <li> I guarantee said magician will come up with some nifty effect that absolutely needs that box.  </li>
            <li> , no one note overwhelming the other, all coming together in a harmonious whole that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and unlike some premium soaps isn&#x27;t soft enough to go down the drain with your shower water.  </li>
            <li> Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box is a lovely little box of pampering.  </li>
            <li> It also kicks the soap&#x27;s scent down a notch since the smell is a bit strong straight out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> This is no ordinary bar of soap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long this bar of soap actually lasts, given its cost; to compare how long it lasts with how many normal bars of soap I would have used in the same time period.  </li>
            <li> The bar itself is about three times the normal size and</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t dry out compared to when you use most commercial soaps.  </li>
            <li> The scent is just strong enough, it actually fills the bathroom with its scent, but doesn&#x27;t overpower you when you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very large rounded bar of soap, I&#x27;d say about 2.5x larger.</li>
            <li> This Pre de Provence Soap bar is huge, probably comparable to two regular bars of commercial soap.  </li>
            <li> In her opinion, she enjoys the bar very much and has said that it lathers very quickly and has a thick, creamy</li>
            <li> The first thing to know about this soap is that it is a French fragrance infused soap.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands and the larger shape</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a large, solid bar.</li>
            <li> Then you go clean the cat box, unclog the disposal, sort the recycling, and hunt down the funky smell in the refrigerator, still bathed in its aura.  </li>
            <li> Large sized bar lasted me nearly 2 weeks of daily shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is of the quality that you would expect to find in a 5 star French hotel or a quality bed and breakfast.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The bar is enriched with shea, and does leave your skin soft without feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s the real deal and not the paper substitute where the colors run and suddenly the birds are bathing in purple water.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones who can&#x27;t pass a Lush store without going in &amp;#34;just to see what&#x27;s new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Want to try the other Luxe soap fragrance but not much info is available on these!</li>
            <li> So you are getting your money&#x27;s worth due to its increased size, if you&#x27;re used to paying hand-made soap prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not too heavy, but certainly present enough to give my bathroom a fresh, mildly perfumed scent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend quite a bit extra for a bar of luxury soap that I&#x27;d definitely say give the Pre de Provence brand a try.</li>
            <li> Failing that, it&#x27;s a cool sturdy little box for your collection of push pins, safety pins, buttons, paperclips, coupons...</li>
            <li> ..and it does get you clean, rinses away clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very large -- nearly three times the size of an average bar of soap!</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s a little big, but it should last a long time and it&#x27;s got extra moisturizing ingredients and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Triple milled soaps like this are a real treat, lather well, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> and if you like the musky tones of an expensive perfume or even a nice cologne, this is going to hit your spot.</li>
            <li> Drive nails with less risk of splitting the wood by first rubbing some of the soap on the nail shank.  </li>
            <li> Inside the decorative box (which she found worthy of display), it is packaged in some sort of shaved paper resembling hay - a small touch</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very large, so expect to drop it a few times) and the price.</li>
            <li> For seventeen bucks, you can get two or three 8-packs of brand name soap, enough to last far longer than this solitary bar, despite its size.</li>
            <li> Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beafutiful Gift</li>
            <li> Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beafutiful Gift</li>
            <li> My only, only complaint about the soap is how large the bar is!</li>
            <li> to butters, the soap is not as hard and will not last as long as the other pre de provence bars - fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bar, twice as big as a normally big bath bar, and even though it lathers well and feels creamy, it lasts a long time, so in that sense you&#x27;re getting value for price.</li>
            <li> The soap is big and long lasting</li>
            <li> This particular bar (Pierrevert) has a powdery soap scent-I don&#x27;t find it too overwhelming-a little headachy if you smell it too long.</li>
            <li> I only have one minor quibble.</li>
            <li> the bar is rather LARGE and it is hard for younger kids to hold.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and slightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a thick, creamy, rather sensual lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s triple milled, and therefore very dense and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry it out thoroughly or it will not last long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and using this soap for over 8 days didn&#x27;t cause my skin to itch or feel tight even once.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of it - a little green, a little spice, a little floral</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This bar of soap has lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> A little soap goes a long way so this bar will last quit a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is milled such that it doesn&#x27;t just disappear like typical bar soap.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to use it in the shower like I did, you&#x27;ll need to be careful not to drop it on your toes because it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> But I had forgotten the sensual feeling of picking up a bar of soap, running my wet hands over it, and lathering up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month, and other than some flatness on the bottom where it sits in between uses, it looks almost like it hasn&#x27;t been used at all.</li>
            <li> Anyway, big bar of perfumed soap that seems to take care of the dirt &amp; grime of a day&#x27;s hard retired lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a few lonely brands of bar soap amongst the bottles of liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I think I have bought this brand of soap at World Market as a little gift.</li>
            <li> Just a little too perfumey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to hold while in the shower, but on the flip side, I imagine this bar is going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> One side is bigger than the other too, weird.</li>
            <li> fact, this is just the sort of a splurge that I like, expensive compared to what I usually buy, but for a once in a while treat, not likely to break the bank.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the fragrance - but like a quality perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to define the smell, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Rather, it&#x27;s a fusion of floral with a touch of citrus, perhaps, and something woody or grassy creating a delicate, balanced blend.</li>
            <li> Waking up for me is a slow and gradual process.  </li>
            <li> Makes an ordinary bathing experience at home seem like a trip to a luxury hotel!</li>
            <li> Seriously, its like bean shaped baseball.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to roll around in my small hands.</li>
            <li> Quite expensive for just one bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a bit afraid of dropping it on a toe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great smelling, mildly scented soap. I love the fact that it is a large bar. I have large hands and the larger shape will suit me longer in the shower. Overall a very fine product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bar of soap. Loaded with rich butters.  It has a great fragrance and unlike some premium soaps isn&#x27;t soft enough to go down the drain with your shower water.  The bar is twice the size of the giant bars of soap my own company sells.</li>
            <li> This is a large bar of soap that&#x27;s shaped like a huge bean. It is definitely great for the bath because in the shower with my smallish hands I am a bit afraid of dropping it on a toe. This particular bar (Pierrevert) has a powdery soap scent-I don&#x27;t find it too overwhelming-a little headachy if you smell it too long. It&#x27;s nice and relaxing for the tub though. The de Provence Soap makes a nice dense lather that works great for shaving your legs and it isn&#x27;t drying. A little soap goes a long way so this bar will last quit a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great gift-giving soap. It&#x27;s a huge luxurious bar that comes nestled in a very pretty box. I think I have bought this brand of soap at World Market as a little gift. I like the Shea Butter because it&#x27;s nice and moisturizing. All in all, I am enjoying this soap-it&#x27;s a little big, but it should last a long time and it&#x27;s got extra moisturizing ingredients and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The first thing to know about this soap is that it is a French fragrance infused soap.  If you don&#x27;t like strongly scented soaps this product won&#x27;t be for you.  But if that is to your liking you will indeed find this luxury soap amazing.  The beautiful fragrance emanates from the box even before opening.  The large bar is packaged beautifully and the bar provides ultra lathering and moisturizing with three butters.  This is the best quality fragranced moisturizing soap I have yet to find.  It leaves your skin ultra soft and smooth.  It really is of the quality that you would expect to find in a 5 star French hotel or a quality bed and breakfast.  I am amazed at the great price for this soap and believe me it makes an excellent gift.  Any true soap lover would be in heaven.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap. First, the packaging is impressive. Inside the decorative box (which she found worthy of display), it is packaged in some sort of shaved paper resembling hay - a small touch but it makes it look special (my wife commented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap itself is about the size of a sweet potato - it won&#x27;t fit in our soap dish (but how do you complain about it being too big?). The scent is very feminine, floral, and nice. It is milled such that it doesn&#x27;t just disappear like typical bar soap. It lathers well, and she loves the way it makes her skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift.</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s a mere bar of soap, this is truly a lovely item. The smell is not too heavy, but certainly present enough to give my bathroom a fresh, mildly perfumed scent. It lathers richly and rinses clean with only the scent remaining. The only issues are the size (it&#x27;s very large, so expect to drop it a few times) and the price. For seventeen bucks, you can get two or three 8-packs of brand name soap, enough to last far longer than this solitary bar, despite its size. However, as a gift (it comes in a  gorgeous box) or simply to keep in your bathroom for the fragrance, it&#x27;s a delightful soap.</li>
            <li> This is a Lovely scented, luxurious large bar of soap. The shape makes it easy to hold such a large bar. I find the scent to be refreshing and clean smelling. . . not too flowery nor overly herbal. Triple milled soaps like this are a real treat, lather well, and last a long time. Makes an ordinary bathing experience at home seem like a trip to a luxury hotel! Delightful!</li>
            <li> we LOVE this soap. We use natural and French milled soaps, for us the scent, which IS very strong was wonderful and very similar to soaps we already have. The multiple butters in the soap REALLY give your skin a silk smooth feel, while still leaving it clean feeling! the bar is rather LARGE and it is hard for younger kids to hold. But for adults, it is perfectly fine, and so far it has lasted really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the gorgeous box which would make this soap perfect for Christmas, birthday and giving for Teacher Appreciation gifts!</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy to give this a try.  In her opinion, she enjoys the bar very much and has said that it lathers very quickly and has a thick, creamy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was impressed with the packaging and thought that it could easily be given as a gift as the bar of soap is shipped in a nice box with shredded paper as its nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, her only dislike is the scent which to her is very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a morning person.  Waking up for me is a slow and gradual process.  Like many people, the shower is my way to relax in the morning and get ready to face the work day.  It&#x27;s very important to me to have products I like using and enjoy the smell of in the shower, soap and face wash being the most crucial.  Having said that, a proper daily soap is essential to my morning routine.  Enter Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beafutiful Gift Box- Pierrevert.  Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance that lasts the better part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Large sized bar lasted me nearly 2 weeks of daily shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Presented in a nice gift box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quite expensive for just one bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Extra large soap size is perfect for baths but not exactly practical for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beafutiful Gift Box- Pierrevert was a great addition to my morning shower regiment.  The fragrance was pleasant but not overpowering and stayed with me most of the day.  My skin didn&#x27;t dry out compared to when you use most commercial soaps.  Finally it&#x27;s presented in a really nice gift quality box that makes you excited to start using it.  With this comes a hefty price tag however and the bar&#x27;s size really makes it more ideal for bathing and not showering.  If you do decide to use it in the shower like I did, you&#x27;ll need to be careful not to drop it on your toes because it will hurt.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend quite a bit extra for a bar of luxury soap that I&#x27;d definitely say give the Pre de Provence brand a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a woman who likes more outdoorsey, masculine scents and wants a creamy luxurious soap. It&#x27;s hard to describe the fragrance - but like a quality perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to butters, the soap is not as hard and will not last as long as the other pre de provence bars - fine. It&#x27;s large in the hand to begin with. Dry it out thoroughly or it will not last long. Want to try the other Luxe soap fragrance but not much info is available on these!</li>
            <li> The scent is just strong enough, it actually fills the bathroom with its scent, but doesn&#x27;t overpower you when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very large rounded bar of soap, I&#x27;d say about 2.5x larger. It comes in a nice box with straw, so if you give it as a housewarming gift it looks nice. All around a very nice bit of luxury in your daily life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh..and it does get you clean, rinses away clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind! So it does its jobs as a very good cleaning soap as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> This soap smells wonderful. I received the Pierrevert scent. The scent is just wonderful. The soap is large and impressive ( fat kidney bean shape palm sized ) It lathers beautifully. It leaves your skin soft and slightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower daily but on Saturdays I love to take a long,hot,relaxing bath...This soap makes it a heavenly experience !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives beautifully boxed. It would make a wonderful,thoughtful gift. I only have one minor quibble. In the box there is a piece of protective foam. I would have much preferred  more raffia as the only cushion for the soap. The piece of foam cheapens the presentation slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the type of soap you dream about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to define the smell, but I like it. At first I thought roses, but they don&#x27;t predominate. Rather, it&#x27;s a fusion of floral with a touch of citrus, perhaps, and something woody or grassy creating a delicate, balanced blend. I find this fragrance somewhat comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very large -- nearly three times the size of an average bar of soap! Shaped to stay in your hand, despite the huge size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the butters (Shea, Cocoa and Mango) as well as Argon oil, easily provide a thick, creamy, rather sensual lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s triple milled, and therefore very dense and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A noteworthy gift for someone who appreciates a finely crafted product, or loves all things French. Comes in a gorgeous box with a flowery design with French-inspired pattern over all in gold.</li>
            <li> I am a soap junkie; I love to try new and different ones from hand-made to foreign-made.  This Pre de Provence Soap bar is huge, probably comparable to two regular bars of commercial soap.  As someone mentioned in another review, you could, seriously, use it as a weapon - lol.  So you are getting your money&#x27;s worth due to its increased size, if you&#x27;re used to paying hand-made soap prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers easily and fully, and seems to clean well.  I love the scent of it - a little green, a little spice, a little floral, no one note overwhelming the other, all coming together in a harmonious whole that is not overpowering.  It&#x27;s a unisex scent, so anyone in the family can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a lovely decorative box, which makes it great to give as a gift to someone or to include in a bath-themed gift basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long this bar of soap actually lasts, given its cost; to compare how long it lasts with how many normal bars of soap I would have used in the same time period.  Its price would be the only thing stopping me from buying it on a regular basis, but as an occasional treat for myself? Sure.</li>
            <li> This soap goes under the heading of a splurge. There are plenty of soaps that work well, smell nice, and cost much less. So why Pre de Provence? It makes a nice gift certainly, with the pretty box and perfumed scent. Who doesn&#x27;t like to pamper herself (or himself)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bar, twice as big as a normally big bath bar, and even though it lathers well and feels creamy, it lasts a long time, so in that sense you&#x27;re getting value for price. So the scent is the big draw and if you like the musky tones of an expensive perfume or even a nice cologne, this is going to hit your spot. It&#x27;s a bit strong at first, but after a few days in the shower, it&#x27;s becoming more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this is just the sort of a splurge that I like, expensive compared to what I usually buy, but for a once in a while treat, not likely to break the bank.</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLE!  I will be buying this as gifts for everyone this year.  It is rich smelling, leaves you feeling clean and is massive!  Great for gifts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful soap with a lovely scent. This is no ordinary bar of soap! The bar itself is about three times the normal size and the scent stays with you for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bar of soap, almost too big to hold in your hand in the shower.  The packaging is beautiful and this would make a nice gift item.  Great lather, but the scent is just a bit off for me.  Just a little too perfumey.  The shea butter leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This makes for a very big and a very fancy bar of soap, with a fairly strong smell, though the smell is sweet. It strikes me as the sort of thing that would make a good small gift to a host since it does have a fancy feel to it and it&#x27;s nicely packaged. It seems a bit much for routine use, though, unless you truly love the smell.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin feeling SO soft and smelling wonderful.  The scent isn&#x27;t overly flowery or cloying, but is more like a unisex &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.  I love how natural it smells.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and using this soap for over 8 days didn&#x27;t cause my skin to itch or feel tight even once.  The box that this comes in is so pretty too, and the bar smells lovely through the packaging.  Definitely would make a nice gift for someone you want to allow to treat themselves :)</li>
            <li> Add to the list of great French things... French Fries, French Braids, French Toast, French Horn, French Bread... and now French Soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world has gone to liquid soap. Yes, it&#x27;s convenient. Just squirt and wash. But I had forgotten the sensual feeling of picking up a bar of soap, running my wet hands over it, and lathering up. This soap has made me consider switching back to bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large, solid bar. But calling it a &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really correct. It&#x27;s shaped like a giant bean. It&#x27;s smooth and silky, feels wonderful in your hands and has a mild floral scent. It makes me want to wash my hands more often. And that&#x27;s probably a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product was finding a soap dish! We haven&#x27;t had one in the house for years, and when I went to the store and looked in the soap section, they didn&#x27;t have any. Just a few lonely brands of bar soap amongst the bottles of liquid soap. So I&#x27;m using a cup saucer until I find the ideal soap dish for my Pre de Provence here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice lather, pleasant smell, and left my skin nice and soft.  However there is a major drawback; this soap is HUGE! It is difficult to roll around in my small hands. Seriously, its like bean shaped baseball. Oddly enough its not evenly shaped. One side is bigger than the other too, weird.</li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely fresh clean scent that is subtle and not overpowering.  Looks great in my soap dish.  The box is lovely as well, and seconds as a decoration in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic! It lathers well, and feels great on my skin. The smell from the soap is verystrong straight out of the box, but it leaves a really nice light scent on my skin. The package is beautiful and would be great as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This bar of soap has lasted a really long time! It&#x27;s been a month, and other than some flatness on the bottom where it sits in between uses, it looks almost like it hasn&#x27;t been used at all. My daughter is already saying she wants to buy more when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The smell is heavenly, wonderful, not masculine at all. The soap is big and long lasting</li>
            <li> What a beautiful bar of soap! Luxurious is the word that comes instantly to mind when I opened up the box of Pre de Provence Soap. The scent of this soap is very nice -- not too flowery, not too musky, but a genuine spice and floral scent that is not overpowering. My only, only complaint about the soap is how large the bar is! It&#x27;s difficult to hold while in the shower, but on the flip side, I imagine this bar is going to last a very long time. The bar is enriched with shea, and does leave your skin soft without feeling greasy or oily. Overall, I recommend this beautiful product.</li>
            <li> The perfume is overwhelming when first opening the box! On the plus side, I put the box in the smelly non-recycle garbage can and it took care of that problem immediately. Been using it for a week or so and the bathroom still is smelling strongly of its perfume (rose, maybe). Anyway, big bar of perfumed soap that seems to take care of the dirt &amp; grime of a day&#x27;s hard retired lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it cleans, but it is a bit too big for her.</li>
            <li> This smells lovely and comes in a nice gift box.  The only negative is that it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box is a lovely little box of pampering.  You can shower with it and step out feeling like a goddess or god. Then you go clean the cat box, unclog the disposal, sort the recycling, and hunt down the funky smell in the refrigerator, still bathed in its aura.  It lathers beautifully, smells like a spring bouquet, and soaps you up nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait!  There&#x27;s more!  Here are 101 Things You can do with your Pre de Provence Soap Shea Enriched Everyday 300 Gram Extra Large French Soap Bar in Beautiful Gift Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Give the cool excelsior in your box to the birds for nesting material.  (It&#x27;s the real deal and not the paper substitute where the colors run and suddenly the birds are bathing in purple water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Give the box to the magician in your family.  I guarantee said magician will come up with some nifty effect that absolutely needs that box.  Failing that, it&#x27;s a cool sturdy little box for your collection of push pins, safety pins, buttons, paperclips, coupons... You get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Store the soap in a drawer with your undergarments.  According to my mother (whose word was not to be doubted under any circumstances), this gives the soap a chance to dry out, giving it a longer life, and scents the drawer nicely.  It also kicks the soap&#x27;s scent down a notch since the smell is a bit strong straight out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  It&#x27;s the perfect gift for the soap-o-philes on your list.  You know who they are. The ones who can&#x27;t pass a Lush store without going in &amp;#34;just to see what&#x27;s new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Drive nails with less risk of splitting the wood by first rubbing some of the soap on the nail shank.  Then your nail will smell nice, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Stretch those arthritic fingers.  The bar of soap is huge and grasping it gives the fingers a nice stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Let your skin suck up that shea butter.  Shea butter is an excellent moisturizer and it has healing properties for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a shower with the soap.  Or a bath.  Or wash your hands.  It&#x27;s soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a very nice soap, at that.Shea butter is an excellent moisturizer and it has healing properties for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a shower with the soap.  Or a bath.  Or wash your hands.  It&#x27;s soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a very nice soap, at that.</li>
