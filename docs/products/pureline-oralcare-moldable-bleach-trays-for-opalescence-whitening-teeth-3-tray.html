    <ol>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>works great !</li>
            <li>and voila you have a great mold for bleaching your teeth!</li>
            <li>Excellent seller.  </li>
            <li>These bleach trays are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Product ...</li>
            <li>Perfect supplement for the Watts teeth whitening I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Very good product!!</li>
            <li>very good pricing as well</li>
            <li>Good instructions included!</li>
            <li>But the good thing is these trays need not be perfectly shaped against the tooth at molding time to function with the Tooth-whitening product.  </li>
            <li>In the end they work great for the price.</li>
            <li>These are a great value.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>LOL...</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until you&#x27;re happy.  </li>
            <li>This time I kept it in water until the tray started to sag, and I tried to mold it, but it would not form a good mold.</li>
            <li>but once you figure it out they are good.  </li>
            <li>, the trays are what they say, and for the price, they&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good that you get 3 trays.</li>
            <li>Still, good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>We followed directions perfectly and the trays shriveled up to about 1/3 of its original size.</li>
            <li>GREAT price, great product, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product easy to mold!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re happy with them heat them up one more time, suck all of the air out and hold it in until it hardens,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this kind before.</li>
            <li>honestly it&#x27;s like a sports mouth guard.</li>
            <li>These are the thing ones that I bought that I liked.</li>
            <li>For ~$1 each, I think these are pretty incredible.  </li>
            <li>Super happy.</li>
            <li>works for my gel , but didnt do the best molding , but is good enough for the price i paid ....</li>
            <li>Works well and very easy to form.</li>
            <li>once I figured this out, they were very easy to form.</li>
            <li>I thought they were very easy to mold.  </li>
            <li>I love these, and I am now whitening my own teeth with a home-made, DIY solution.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got strong allergy reaction after using this product!</li>
            <li>Pay a bit more and buy something good or try the strips instead of the cream, much more clean</li>
            <li>I believe my whitening results could not be better if I went to the dentist and paid a couple hundred dollars for a treatment.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with my entire transaction!</li>
            <li>but I will try to heat it more than once and see if it will work</li>
            <li>Keeps more of the bleach from spreading around in your mouth and is softer and squishier.</li>
            <li>And they fit my needs!</li>
            <li>e works even better</li>
            <li>u cant beat this deal :)</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I know these were cheap, and now I understand why!</li>
            <li>I ordered these teeth trays expecting it to be a fluke like most of these reviewers are ranting about.</li>
            <li>I bought these trays after reading many of the reviews and  decided that for the price I would try them.  </li>
            <li>They did keep the bleach on my teeth, and 1 tray(the top one) molded well, but the bottom 1 wouldn&#x27;t mold for some reason.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re pleased with the cost of trays.</li>
            <li>to send me more trays so I can try it with MY instructions?</li>
            <li>Save yourself the headache and the bleached gums and pay more and get proper-fitting trays.</li>
            <li>Not even close to fitting</li>
            <li>I am ordering more for friends and family.</li>
            <li>It works better than forking out $300 for molds.</li>
            <li>I did this to get the final perfect fit.</li>
            <li>These are very inexpensive, but for really good results, have your dentist make trays.  </li>
            <li>However these trays don&#x27;t really \\&quot;mold\\&quot; to your teeth, or leave good teeth impressions.</li>
            <li>Purchased for family member and found it easy to form and got a pretty good fit.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Even a plastic bag would have looked better, as if some attempt was made to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to mold and use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but if that&#x27;s the case, must not be as easy to use as advertised.</li>
            <li>They softened easily and molded to my teeth just fine.  </li>
            <li>but my daughter said it was easy for her to mold and fits fine with no problem or issues.</li>
            <li>Read the full detailed directions and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li>i will use them again soon..very cheap and easy</li>
            <li>These trays work just fine.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine without spending hundreds.</li>
            <li>they work very well, just dont boil them for more than the time they say on the instructions!</li>
            <li>My teeth look fantastic too.</li>
            <li>Trays can be re-softened and re-molded in order to get them to fit.</li>
            <li>Fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit on my teeth</li>
            <li>FIT IS ESTABLISHED.&lt;br /&gt;REPEAT</li>
            <li>Yes, they are cheap but they are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>there is no in between, atleast it was cheap.</li>
            <li>They are trim to fit moldable trays.</li>
            <li>why so many people can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, you just need to work quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a quick, easy solution.  </li>
            <li>These trays were thicker than the ones i originally received with my whitening solution.</li>
            <li>first off, the seller&#x27;s communication is top rate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there are 3 of them because I ruined the first one I molded.  </li>
            <li>In a certain way, I like it better than the bleaching tray that I already have.</li>
            <li>Might be good for some with a larger mouth</li>
            <li>The trays are very bulky and have not been able to use them at all.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others and this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>If you just try to mold w/ the fingers, it will cool off too quickly.</li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly and it was easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mold and use and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I pretty much ruined the first one but the second one I made was perfect.  </li>
            <li>quick shipment .</li>
            <li>Would spend more money for better quality next time.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually say spring for more since they are quite cheap and getting the right fit is important.</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and ready to use..came with easy to do instructions..</li>
            <li>These trays are easy to boil and come with straight forward instructions.</li>
            <li>Trays will shrink if left in just boiled water more than 8-10 seconds - oops!  </li>
            <li>It is kind of big for my mouth i tried to heat and shape it</li>
            <li>does that sounds like fun?  </li>
            <li>, I figured it&#x27;s worth my time and money.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty good for something you can do yourself at home, however, it is pretty thick &amp; is kind of like a mouth gaurd.</li>
            <li>Received these super fast!</li>
            <li>Instead of bathing everything -- teeth and gums -- in the chemical, a dentist-made tray will keep the gel right where you want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have to get them to just the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>I just read it on the caption to the right of the screen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start by saying I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product in the first place, but being so cheap</li>
            <li>After the initial order was lost by USPS, Easy Smile&#x27;s representative was swift and attentive in getting a replacement order to me.</li>
            <li>I only use about 1/2 syringe at a time, and found the syringe very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for doing it here first!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use again when needed. :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very inexpensive also!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It says to heat the tray in hot water until it starts to sag.</li>
            <li>Pretty fool proof if you read the directions.</li>
            <li>First off mine took almost a month to get here.</li>
            <li>I will most likely throw them away.</li>
            <li>too hot and floppy</li>
            <li>I messed the first two up and did okay on the third.</li>
            <li>I had to keep dipping them in the hot water over and over to get it to mold to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The dentist would charge 300 for some permanent trays that never lose their shape, but I&#x27;d rather buy these since I doubt i&#x27;ll be able to go through 60 regimens without losing the initial 300$ trays anyway.</li>
            <li>The water needs to be really hot when molding, and one needs to take it out as soon as it begins to shrivel.</li>
            <li>I ordered them and followed the directions EXACTLY as they were given.  </li>
            <li>However, the first tray didn&#x27;t even mold.  </li>
            <li>and I bought two sets incase of scortching them with hot water.</li>
            <li>Glad we ordered extra.</li>
            <li>We tried to stretch them out (they were really hot and that hurt) and put them in to mold</li>
            <li>works exactly as stated</li>
            <li>and she had a hard time to get something very far from ideal</li>
            <li>Others talked about cutting them to get the perfect fit, but mine feel perfect without any cutting.  </li>
            <li>So they require a little work to get them fitting comfortably.</li>
            <li>We received the trays earlier than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li>This might sound dumb, but directions would have been nice, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to boil them.</li>
            <li>They felt rather large in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It worked way more than I expected it, mainly because I have crooked top and bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li>I suggest Crest Optic white toothpaste for between-whitening sessions; it tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>I messed up on one tray by putting it in the water too long but the other two worked great.</li>
            <li>Hard to get a good mold with these.</li>
            <li>after trying to mold the trays, i found they were hard to mold and really weren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>These trays work very well...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a bleaching tray!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t form much around my teeth.</li>
            <li>even then, the molds aren&#x27;t very pliable and don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much, I still would not recommend wasting time or effort on these trays.</li>
            <li>They serve the purpose and you can&#x27;t beat the price, but they are very tricky to use.</li>
            <li>Works very well with Opalescence</li>
            <li>I went through a whole tooth whitening regimen with them and got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t really expect too much at that price.  </li>
            <li>I guess I could work them out with the heat gun if i really tried.</li>
            <li>Product is what I expected, perhaps a bit smaller, but good. . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>&amp; once u get ur trays molded, u just clean them &amp; store away for future use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sturdy and less chance of shrinking when heated.</li>
            <li>They come too high on the gum and the bleach burns.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get some quality trays.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really conform to the teeth like a professional tray</li>
            <li>and these mouthguards are not comfortable at all to use on top and bottom together.</li>
            <li>These trays need to be much more narrow to mold</li>
            <li>ALLOW TO DRY AND COOL.  </li>
            <li>although they were extremely cheap and they came before the date i was actually expecting them, they were waaaaaay too big for ANYONE&#x27;S teeth.</li>
            <li>I ended up calling around to local dentists to see how much their trays would cost, or how much the impressions would cost.  </li>
            <li>Ive used much better ones in the past</li>
            <li>I can see why they give you 3 of them, inevitably you will over boil the first one and it will turn into a pile of sticky goo.</li>
            <li>pretty basic nothing to go on about</li>
            <li>Finally, you have to strike a balance between hot enough to mold and too hot for your gums/tongue.  </li>
            <li>either melted or didnt get hot enough to form.</li>
            <li>so they were loose fit or crooked.</li>
            <li>I understand professional trays can cost around $200-$300 at dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>It deforms completely when heated up and does not mold at all in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I found that it would cost me about $30 to have the impressions done professionally, at a dentist office.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had professionally made trays but from what I understand it is around a $150 service.  </li>
            <li>They work better than just a non-custom tray, and they do stay in place while whitening, but they are thick and bulky in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Recommend getting at least the 3 b/c there is a little learning curve with the first to get it to fit right.</li>
            <li>Fear not - there need not be high precision in molding the trays for whitening the teeth properly.</li>
            <li>overall, the seller was amazing about shipping but the product SUCKS!</li>
            <li>After ruining in the first two I basically dipped the last one I had in a for several seconds and tried to form it with little success as it still lost its form in one spot...</li>
            <li>Maybe you need a few more trays and a few more tries in order to get the molds formed properly, but three of them were not enough and did not perform well at all.</li>
            <li>Cheap and hard to use</li>
            <li>The trays are cheap and a bit hard to mold.</li>
            <li>I just put water only through my coffee pot, and held the lil tray by the handle and within moments it started to get soft for molding.  </li>
            <li>If you heat just until it sags, it won&#x27;t be soft enough to truly mold to the teeth.</li>
            <li>I have stained teeth (cigarette use, several soft drinks per day)</li>
            <li>It took several iterations to get a reasonable seal, but it finally formed a close-fitting enough shape.  </li>
            <li>sorry, i&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li>product was way too thick and bulky to fit into your mouth for the required amount of time it takes to bleach your teeth.</li>
            <li>The trays are kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>After several attempts, I finally got the trays to the point where i could live with them.</li>
            <li>I boiled some water on the stove and dipped them for about 5-10 seconds, put in mouth (be careful they may be really hot!), bite down softly, use tongue and fingers to shape to teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I tried a hair dryer first and it would not get hot enough (or I ran out of patience - an all too common occurence, just ask my spouse!).  </li>
            <li>I did dip it in hot water and after a few seconds the tray started to shrink.</li>
            <li>After submerging the first one in into the water on the stove for 15 seconds and pulling it out it melted together in a few places.  </li>
            <li>We read some reviews that said these were not easy to mold, but if you follow the directions it&#x27;s pretty basic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good instructions included!</li>
            <li> But the good thing is these trays need not be perfectly shaped against the tooth at molding time to function with the Tooth-whitening product.  </li>

            <li> These are a great value.  </li>

            <li> I thought they were very easy to mold.  </li>
            <li> I love these, and I am now whitening my own teeth with a home-made, DIY solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got strong allergy reaction after using this product!</li>
            <li> Pay a bit more and buy something good or try the strips instead of the cream, much more clean</li>
            <li> I believe my whitening results could not be better if I went to the dentist and paid a couple hundred dollars for a treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with my entire transaction!</li>
            <li> but I will try to heat it more than once and see if it will work</li>
            <li> Keeps more of the bleach from spreading around in your mouth and is softer and squishier.</li>
            <li> And they fit my needs!</li>
            <li> e works even better</li>
            <li> u cant beat this deal :)</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I know these were cheap, and now I understand why!</li>
            <li> I ordered these teeth trays expecting it to be a fluke like most of these reviewers are ranting about.</li>
            <li> I bought these trays after reading many of the reviews and  decided that for the price I would try them.  </li>
            <li> They did keep the bleach on my teeth, and 1 tray(the top one) molded well, but the bottom 1 wouldn&#x27;t mold for some reason.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re pleased with the cost of trays.</li>
            <li> to send me more trays so I can try it with MY instructions?</li>
            <li> Save yourself the headache and the bleached gums and pay more and get proper-fitting trays.</li>
            <li> Not even close to fitting</li>
            <li> I am ordering more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> It works better than forking out $300 for molds.</li>
            <li> I did this to get the final perfect fit.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive, but for really good results, have your dentist make trays.  </li>
            <li> However these trays don&#x27;t really \\&quot;mold\\&quot; to your teeth, or leave good teeth impressions.</li>
            <li> Purchased for family member and found it easy to form and got a pretty good fit.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Even a plastic bag would have looked better, as if some attempt was made to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to mold and use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but if that&#x27;s the case, must not be as easy to use as advertised.</li>
            <li> They softened easily and molded to my teeth just fine.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter said it was easy for her to mold and fits fine with no problem or issues.</li>
            <li> Read the full detailed directions and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> i will use them again soon..very cheap and easy</li>
            <li> These trays work just fine.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine without spending hundreds.</li>
            <li> they work very well, just dont boil them for more than the time they say on the instructions!</li>
            <li> My teeth look fantastic too.</li>
            <li> Trays can be re-softened and re-molded in order to get them to fit.</li>
            <li> Fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit on my teeth</li>
            <li> FIT IS ESTABLISHED.&lt;br /&gt;REPEAT</li>
            <li> Yes, they are cheap but they are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> there is no in between, atleast it was cheap.</li>
            <li> They are trim to fit moldable trays.</li>
            <li> why so many people can&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, you just need to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a quick, easy solution.  </li>
            <li> These trays were thicker than the ones i originally received with my whitening solution.</li>
            <li> first off, the seller&#x27;s communication is top rate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad there are 3 of them because I ruined the first one I molded.  </li>
            <li> In a certain way, I like it better than the bleaching tray that I already have.</li>
            <li> Might be good for some with a larger mouth</li>
            <li> The trays are very bulky and have not been able to use them at all.</li>
            <li> Have tried many others and this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> If you just try to mold w/ the fingers, it will cool off too quickly.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions exactly and it was easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Easy to mold and use and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I pretty much ruined the first one but the second one I made was perfect.  </li>
            <li> quick shipment .</li>
            <li> Would spend more money for better quality next time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually say spring for more since they are quite cheap and getting the right fit is important.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and ready to use..came with easy to do instructions..</li>
            <li> These trays are easy to boil and come with straight forward instructions.</li>
            <li> Trays will shrink if left in just boiled water more than 8-10 seconds - oops!  </li>
            <li> It is kind of big for my mouth i tried to heat and shape it</li>
            <li> does that sounds like fun?  </li>
            <li> , I figured it&#x27;s worth my time and money.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty good for something you can do yourself at home, however, it is pretty thick &amp; is kind of like a mouth gaurd.</li>
            <li> Received these super fast!</li>
            <li> Instead of bathing everything -- teeth and gums -- in the chemical, a dentist-made tray will keep the gel right where you want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to get them to just the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> I just read it on the caption to the right of the screen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start by saying I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product in the first place, but being so cheap</li>
            <li> After the initial order was lost by USPS, Easy Smile&#x27;s representative was swift and attentive in getting a replacement order to me.</li>
            <li> I only use about 1/2 syringe at a time, and found the syringe very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for doing it here first!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use again when needed. :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very inexpensive also!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It says to heat the tray in hot water until it starts to sag.</li>
            <li> Pretty fool proof if you read the directions.</li>
            <li> First off mine took almost a month to get here.</li>
            <li> I will most likely throw them away.</li>
            <li> too hot and floppy</li>
            <li> I messed the first two up and did okay on the third.</li>
            <li> I had to keep dipping them in the hot water over and over to get it to mold to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The dentist would charge 300 for some permanent trays that never lose their shape, but I&#x27;d rather buy these since I doubt i&#x27;ll be able to go through 60 regimens without losing the initial 300$ trays anyway.</li>
            <li> The water needs to be really hot when molding, and one needs to take it out as soon as it begins to shrivel.</li>
            <li> I ordered them and followed the directions EXACTLY as they were given.  </li>
            <li> However, the first tray didn&#x27;t even mold.  </li>
            <li> and I bought two sets incase of scortching them with hot water.</li>
            <li> Glad we ordered extra.</li>
            <li> We tried to stretch them out (they were really hot and that hurt) and put them in to mold</li>
            <li> works exactly as stated</li>
            <li> and she had a hard time to get something very far from ideal</li>
            <li> Others talked about cutting them to get the perfect fit, but mine feel perfect without any cutting.  </li>
            <li> So they require a little work to get them fitting comfortably.</li>
            <li> We received the trays earlier than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li> This might sound dumb, but directions would have been nice, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to boil them.</li>
            <li> They felt rather large in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It worked way more than I expected it, mainly because I have crooked top and bottom front teeth.</li>
            <li> I suggest Crest Optic white toothpaste for between-whitening sessions; it tastes fine.  </li>
            <li> I messed up on one tray by putting it in the water too long but the other two worked great.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a good mold with these.</li>
            <li> after trying to mold the trays, i found they were hard to mold and really weren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> These trays work very well...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a bleaching tray!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t form much around my teeth.</li>
            <li> even then, the molds aren&#x27;t very pliable and don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much, I still would not recommend wasting time or effort on these trays.</li>
            <li> They serve the purpose and you can&#x27;t beat the price, but they are very tricky to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well with Opalescence</li>
            <li> I went through a whole tooth whitening regimen with them and got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t really expect too much at that price.  </li>
            <li> I guess I could work them out with the heat gun if i really tried.</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected, perhaps a bit smaller, but good. . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> &amp; once u get ur trays molded, u just clean them &amp; store away for future use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more sturdy and less chance of shrinking when heated.</li>
            <li> They come too high on the gum and the bleach burns.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more to get some quality trays.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really conform to the teeth like a professional tray</li>
            <li> and these mouthguards are not comfortable at all to use on top and bottom together.</li>
            <li> These trays need to be much more narrow to mold</li>
            <li> ALLOW TO DRY AND COOL.  </li>
            <li> although they were extremely cheap and they came before the date i was actually expecting them, they were waaaaaay too big for ANYONE&#x27;S teeth.</li>
            <li> I ended up calling around to local dentists to see how much their trays would cost, or how much the impressions would cost.  </li>
            <li> Ive used much better ones in the past</li>
            <li> I can see why they give you 3 of them, inevitably you will over boil the first one and it will turn into a pile of sticky goo.</li>
            <li> pretty basic nothing to go on about</li>
            <li> Finally, you have to strike a balance between hot enough to mold and too hot for your gums/tongue.  </li>
            <li> either melted or didnt get hot enough to form.</li>
            <li> so they were loose fit or crooked.</li>
            <li> I understand professional trays can cost around $200-$300 at dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It deforms completely when heated up and does not mold at all in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I found that it would cost me about $30 to have the impressions done professionally, at a dentist office.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had professionally made trays but from what I understand it is around a $150 service.  </li>
            <li> They work better than just a non-custom tray, and they do stay in place while whitening, but they are thick and bulky in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Recommend getting at least the 3 b/c there is a little learning curve with the first to get it to fit right.</li>
            <li> Fear not - there need not be high precision in molding the trays for whitening the teeth properly.</li>
            <li> overall, the seller was amazing about shipping but the product SUCKS!</li>
            <li> After ruining in the first two I basically dipped the last one I had in a for several seconds and tried to form it with little success as it still lost its form in one spot...</li>
            <li> Maybe you need a few more trays and a few more tries in order to get the molds formed properly, but three of them were not enough and did not perform well at all.</li>
            <li> Cheap and hard to use</li>
            <li> The trays are cheap and a bit hard to mold.</li>
            <li> I just put water only through my coffee pot, and held the lil tray by the handle and within moments it started to get soft for molding.  </li>
            <li> If you heat just until it sags, it won&#x27;t be soft enough to truly mold to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have stained teeth (cigarette use, several soft drinks per day)</li>
            <li> It took several iterations to get a reasonable seal, but it finally formed a close-fitting enough shape.  </li>
            <li> sorry, i&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li> product was way too thick and bulky to fit into your mouth for the required amount of time it takes to bleach your teeth.</li>
            <li> The trays are kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> After several attempts, I finally got the trays to the point where i could live with them.</li>
            <li> I boiled some water on the stove and dipped them for about 5-10 seconds, put in mouth (be careful they may be really hot!), bite down softly, use tongue and fingers to shape to teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I tried a hair dryer first and it would not get hot enough (or I ran out of patience - an all too common occurence, just ask my spouse!).  </li>
            <li> I did dip it in hot water and after a few seconds the tray started to shrink.</li>
            <li> After submerging the first one in into the water on the stove for 15 seconds and pulling it out it melted together in a few places.  </li>
            <li> We read some reviews that said these were not easy to mold, but if you follow the directions it&#x27;s pretty basic.</li>
            <li> Boiled up water until it was bubbling, placed the tray in for about 5 normal Mississippi seconds, and took them out and bit tight and sucked(-_-) for about 20 seconds and kept sucking(-_-).</li>
            <li> Bad, bulky, mold only temporarily, then revert back to original and fall off, that is if they hold in the first place.</li>
            <li> The trays need to be heated long enough until the tray appears to shrink, then there is enough residual heat to truly mold.</li>
            <li> They did not mold to my teeth, and they were extremely hard even when they were placed in hot water.</li>
            <li> The first one he bit too hard when he was trying to mold the bottom and the side caved in.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t put in the water long enough, they wouldn&#x27;t mold to teeth.</li>
            <li> Instructions include boiling the molds, then sticking directly in your mouth to bite down on them.</li>
            <li> The silicone in these is way too soft and doesn&#x27;t hold a shape, they wont conform around your teeth nearly as tightly as you want them to for bleaching.</li>
            <li> Really does not form to the teeth hardly at all.</li>
            <li> They are very thin, dipping in the hot water for 3 seconds too long ends up just shriveling and shrinking, not soaking long enough left them not soft enough and they would not conform close enough to my teeth</li>
            <li> If you put them in the water too long they would shrink.</li>
            <li> The shipping did take a bit long coming from China...</li>
            <li> but it was clearly not going to work.</li>
            <li> Caution: don&#x27;t let them sit in the boilling water long, they will shrink!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll collapse on themselves and stick together (I lost one like that), not hot enough and they won&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> and they were thrown loose in a padded envelope.</li>
            <li> I only wore the top tray, wearing both might be a little uncomfortable if you plan on wearing it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> TRAY ON UPPER TEETH AND BITE DOWN UNTIL</li>
            <li> By pressing hard on the front side I was even able to form some faint depressions of my teeth into the tray wall.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> The teeth whitn kit arrived a few days later.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $5</li>
            <li> well - not 1/2&#x27; wide.</li>
            <li> just immerse it in boiling water for a few seconds and then insert in your mouth and bite down for a very short time while it&#x27;s cooling, it&#x27;s molding to the shape of your teeth</li>
            <li> total waste!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions with much anticipation, and my initial try was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not worth even the 5$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent product but is a little difficult to mold to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I had little trouble shaping them, however, they were too bulky to keep in my mouth for the required time needed to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Plus the  Opalescence PF 15% Teeth Whitening says you have to leave their product on for 6 hours and these trays were not comfortable to have in my mouth for even an hour.</li>
            <li> so we wasted all pieces.</li>
            <li> but these directions were enough for me to get the job done, I&#x27;m just confused</li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;m left with a chemical burn on my gums that is so much worse than this picture shows.  </li>
            <li> My trays melted into a shapeless mass in 3 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dont waste your time though</li>
            <li> and would not easily mold - kept folding over.  </li>
            <li> I bought other ones later from someone else that were awful, super thick and hard to melt, mold, and use.</li>
            <li> but I bought a small nail clipper to clip away the excess material.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive them.</li>
            <li> the window of time is about 5 seconds difference between too floppy and too firm, so you have to pay attention!</li>
            <li> It literally didn&#x27;t take shape :/</li>
            <li> FOR NO MORE THAN ONE SECOND.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a few seconds is all you need!</li>
            <li> and I did for Soooo much less!!</li>
            <li> also, the material of the trays made them really hard to mold to the teeth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just hard to tell the quality of the product from the picture.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard and stinky...  </li>
            <li> Hard to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> Too hard to use.</li>
            <li> The whitening product is not effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> I would suggest at least trying them before going to a dentist.</li>
            <li> i mean, the product came as described</li>
            <li> Very thick which makes them uncomfortable in the mouth for too long.  </li>
            <li> seriously, who designed these and what were they designed for?  </li>
            <li> Very hard and do not mold like I would expect.</li>
            <li> Tough to form.</li>
            <li> These do the job, but they are very thick and you just can&#x27;t beat molds made by the dentist.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Unnecessary to buy those ones.     </li>
            <li> These are utter crap.</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with these!!!!</li>
            <li> Trimming it is difficult</li>
            <li> I tried to mold it to my teeth, but it was useless.</li>
            <li> These are not perfect because you have to do a trial and error thing</li>
            <li> I probably did it wrong</li>
            <li> Maybe they sent the wrong item?</li>
            <li> And I find the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; edges a bit uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> They are tricky to mold and can go wrong.</li>
            <li> Does a very poor job of molding to the teeth and therefore does not seal the whitening gel again  the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use them because they almost smell poisonish.</li>
            <li> tried all 3 and all 3 came out bad.</li>
            <li> and it smells really bad causes warrant for concern.</li>
            <li> It allows bleach to get all over your gums which can be painful.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because these trays were bulky (I guess would be the word to describe the trays).</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> kinda :(</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap melted in 5 seconds of being in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Bad product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Remembrandt whitening toothpaste and the Listerine whitening mouthwash product taste terrible!</li>
            <li> I had to use all three molds to make a lower one and they are horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible molding don&#x27;t suggest to buy.</li>
            <li> these were probably the worst buy ive ever made from amazon.</li>

            <li> These trays were thicker than the ones i originally received with my whitening solution. Even after submerging them in boiling water for about 30 seconds, the tray still wouldn&#x27;t form to my teeth properly leaving gaps for the solution to leak out. After several attempts, I finally got the trays to the point where i could live with them. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> from the picture I thought it was moldable foil. I&#x27;ve used this kind before. They come too high on the gum and the bleach burns.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.  Super happy.</li>
            <li> after trying to mold the trays, i found they were hard to mold and really weren&#x27;t any good. tried all 3 and all 3 came out bad. sorry, i&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive, but for really good results, have your dentist make trays.  One advantage with dentist-made trays is you can keep the gel against the front part of the tooth only, not the back of the tooth.  Instead of bathing everything -- teeth and gums -- in the chemical, a dentist-made tray will keep the gel right where you want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem with the Obalescence whitening agent -- I use their 20% solution, and no problems with sensitivity or irritation.  They have a 35% solution as well.  Amazon sells both.  I only use about 1/2 syringe at a time, and found the syringe very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beats a dental chair whitening treatment!!  Try it and see what you think!  I suggest Crest Optic white toothpaste for between-whitening sessions; it tastes fine.  Remembrandt whitening toothpaste and the Listerine whitening mouthwash product taste terrible!</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised. They would not mold or leave impression of teeth. would not buy them again. Very disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> After the initial order was lost by USPS, Easy Smile&#x27;s representative was swift and attentive in getting a replacement order to me. Product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Tough to form. Made it work but it wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. They softened easily and molded to my teeth just fine.  I did not trim off anything.   I believe my whitening results could not be better if I went to the dentist and paid a couple hundred dollars for a treatment.  But my teeth are not severely discolored either. I think for them to make trays would be another couple hundred.  Unnecessary to buy those ones.     Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> works great ! quick shipment .</li>
            <li> GREAT price, great product, and easy to use.  I just put water only through my coffee pot, and held the lil tray by the handle and within moments it started to get soft for molding.  I will definitely use again when needed. :)</li>
            <li> I had to use all three molds to make a lower one and they are horrible. I&#x27;ll probably have to pay alot of money to have the dentist make me one. Bad product!</li>
            <li> Once I tried to mold them, they shrunk and lost shape. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite get the hang of these.  Might be good for some with a larger mouth but they were too big for me and I couldn&#x27;t get them to mold properly.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with no packaging. I ordered six and they were thrown loose in a padded envelope. Even a plastic bag would have looked better, as if some attempt was made to keep them clean. No packing slip, no instructions. I had to read the reviews to try and figure out what to do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not yet tried them so, although they may be wonderful, the way they were presented was awful. If I need them again, I&#x27;ll try to find a different seller and hope for some improvement.</li>
            <li> So I came to Amazon hoping yo find it here and I did for Soooo much less!! The teeth whitn kit arrived a few days later. My teeth look fantastic too. I was very happy with my entire transaction!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, would recommend to anyone. Trays can be re-softened and re-molded in order to get them to fit. Had to trim some. Would reorder again.</li>
            <li> These trays work very well...just immerse it in boiling water for a few seconds and then insert in your mouth and bite down for a very short time while it&#x27;s cooling, it&#x27;s molding to the shape of your teeth and voila you have a great mold for bleaching your teeth! They&#x27;re very inexpensive also! I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a bleaching tray!</li>
            <li> Horrible molding don&#x27;t suggest to buy. This product shouldn&#x27;t be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I messed up on one tray by putting it in the water too long but the other two worked great. Doesn&#x27;t really conform to the teeth like a professional tray but it saves you hundreds of dollars. In the end they work great for the price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cheap and hard to use</li>
            <li> It is kind of big for my mouth i tried to heat and shape it but no luck with that but I will try to heat it more than once and see if it will work</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and ready to use..came with easy to do instructions..i will use them again soon..very cheap and easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use, you just need to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing. what a waste of money!!! It didn&#x27;t form much around my teeth. honestly it&#x27;s like a sports mouth guard. total waste!</li>
            <li> Hard to get a good mold with these. Ive used much better ones in the past</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again .</li>
            <li> This is a decent product but is a little difficult to mold to the teeth. It says to heat the tray in hot water until it starts to sag. If you heat just until it sags, it won&#x27;t be soft enough to truly mold to the teeth. It took several attempts (just reheat in the water) for me to properly mold them. The trays need to be heated long enough until the tray appears to shrink, then there is enough residual heat to truly mold. Then you have to suck the air out of the trays. If you just try to mold w/ the fingers, it will cool off too quickly. The material is different from my dental office made bleaching trays. They are thicker. In a certain way, I like it better than the bleaching tray that I already have. Keeps more of the bleach from spreading around in your mouth and is softer and squishier. I only wore the top tray, wearing both might be a little uncomfortable if you plan on wearing it for a few hours. Trimming it is difficult but I bought a small nail clipper to clip away the excess material.</li>
            <li> I love these, and I am now whitening my own teeth with a home-made, DIY solution.  The thing is, they now sell these at the dollar store.  So there would be no need to buy them online anymore.  Thanks for doing it here first!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> These trays are easy to boil and come with straight forward instructions. However these trays don&#x27;t really \\&quot;mold\\&quot; to your teeth, or leave good teeth impressions. They work better than just a non-custom tray, and they do stay in place while whitening, but they are thick and bulky in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to go with the Opalescence PF 15% Teeth Whitening 8pk of Mint flavor syringes I also ordered on Amazon. I was disappointed because these trays were bulky (I guess would be the word to describe the trays). They felt rather large in the mouth. I feel like I followed the directions on how to mold the product to your teeth. Plus the  Opalescence PF 15% Teeth Whitening says you have to leave their product on for 6 hours and these trays were not comfortable to have in my mouth for even an hour. However, these trays may work for someone else who doesn&#x27;t mind their bulkiness.</li>
            <li> Instructions include boiling the molds, then sticking directly in your mouth to bite down on them. does that sounds like fun?  even then, the molds aren&#x27;t very pliable and don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive them. And they fit my needs!</li>
            <li> Works well and very easy to form. Pretty fool proof if you read the directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start by saying I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product in the first place, but being so cheap, I figured it&#x27;s worth my time and money. Well, it wasn&#x27;t. I understand professional trays can cost around $200-$300 at dentist&#x27;s office. So my rating specifically applies to the quality of the product itself. I followed the instructions with much anticipation, and my initial try was a disappointment. I did dip it in hot water and after a few seconds the tray started to shrink. I tried to mold it to my teeth, but it was useless. So I figured second try. This time I kept it in water until the tray started to sag, and I tried to mold it, but it would not form a good mold. And the third tray.... and so on. Well you get the idea. Maybe you need a few more trays and a few more tries in order to get the molds formed properly, but three of them were not enough and did not perform well at all. Even though it doesn&#x27;t cost much, I still would not recommend wasting time or effort on these trays.</li>
            <li> these were probably the worst buy ive ever made from amazon. although they were extremely cheap and they came before the date i was actually expecting them, they were waaaaaay too big for ANYONE&#x27;S teeth. also, the material of the trays made them really hard to mold to the teeth. i mean, the product came as described, it&#x27;s just hard to tell the quality of the product from the picture. overall, the seller was amazing about shipping but the product SUCKS! you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> What a joke!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any one. First off mine took almost a month to get here. Then I receive the package and there&#x27;s no instructions what so ever. Don&#x27;t know what to do with them. I&#x27;m afraid to use them because they almost smell poisonish. Anything from china with no information on it and it smells really bad causes warrant for concern. I will most likely throw them away. Extremely disappointed. Seller should stop selling this junk.</li>
            <li> They did not mold to my teeth, and they were extremely hard even when they were placed in hot water. Instructions were followed properly too.</li>
            <li> It deforms completely when heated up and does not mold at all in your mouth. I did it with a dentist and she had a hard time to get something very far from ideal so we wasted all pieces. Pay a bit more and buy something good or try the strips instead of the cream, much more clean e works even better</li>
            <li> The mold fits †o the teeth as advertised and if following directions.  The whitening product is not effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are a great value.  They&#x27;re easy to mold and use. Fit comfortably. We read some reviews that said these were not easy to mold, but if you follow the directions it&#x27;s pretty basic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got strong allergy reaction after using this product! Came in manila envelope from China, no security packaging, no wrap...&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is &amp;#34;moldable&amp;#34; but this silicon or latex - must be one of this, since I end up at ER with allergy reaction- This product is so hard and stinky...  Total waste of $5</li>
            <li> I ended up ruining or throwing all of these away. They are very thin, dipping in the hot water for 3 seconds too long ends up just shriveling and shrinking, not soaking long enough left them not soft enough and they would not conform close enough to my teeth so they were loose fit or crooked. I ended up buying a $20 one from the local pharmacy for teeth grinding. It&#x27;s more sturdy and less chance of shrinking when heated. I already had an upper from the dentist.</li>
            <li> These bleach trays are perfect.  They are alittle tricky making them molded to your teeth but once you figure it out they are good.  Caution: don&#x27;t let them sit in the boilling water long, they will shrink!</li>
            <li> first off, the seller&#x27;s communication is top rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;secondly, the trays are what they say, and for the price, they&#x27;re good.  you have to get them to just the right temperature.  too hot and floppy and they&#x27;ll collapse on themselves and stick together (I lost one like that), not hot enough and they won&#x27;t do anything.  the window of time is about 5 seconds difference between too floppy and too firm, so you have to pay attention!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone wanting to save tons of money to whiten their teeth at home. it&#x27;s so easy so why not save ur money doing it this way. &amp; once u get ur trays molded, u just clean them &amp; store away for future use. u cant beat this deal :)</li>
            <li> only boil for 3-5 seconds.  I can see why they give you 3 of them, inevitably you will over boil the first one and it will turn into a pile of sticky goo. once I figured this out, they were very easy to form.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Recommend getting at least the 3 b/c there is a little learning curve with the first to get it to fit right. I&#x27;d actually say spring for more since they are quite cheap and getting the right fit is important.</li>
            <li> These are the thing ones that I bought that I liked. I bought other ones later from someone else that were awful, super thick and hard to melt, mold, and use.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted to charge me $175 dollars to make one upper tray. These are not perfect because you have to do a trial and error thing so it&#x27;s good that you get 3 trays. By the time your molding the third one you get the hang of it. But hey, they get the job done for a fraction of the price. Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.  Instructions were not included to tell me if the they were moldable or not.  I just read it on the caption to the right of the screen.  The trays are very bulky and have not been able to use them at all.</li>
            <li> works for my gel , but didnt do the best molding , but is good enough for the price i paid ....</li>
            <li> Pad And danger products</li>
            <li> This product is great. Will be ordering more. Have tried many others and this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend. I used the Opalescence for about three days in a row and saw results. I drink a lot of tea and coffee which stained my teeth but this product helped to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Bad, bulky, mold only temporarily, then revert back to original and fall off, that is if they hold in the first place. Not worth even the 5$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from California Dental.</li>
            <li> Received these super fast! They serve the purpose and you can&#x27;t beat the price, but they are very tricky to use. I messed the first two up and did okay on the third. Still, good for the price.</li>
            <li> I know these were cheap, and now I understand why! They don&#x27;t fit on my teeth what-so-ever, and do not hold the bleach either. I tried them once and threw them away.</li>
            <li> I ordered these teeth trays expecting it to be a fluke like most of these reviewers are ranting about. They came in about a week which was pleasing. Read the full detailed directions and it worked wonders! It worked way more than I expected it, mainly because I have crooked top and bottom front teeth. I&#x27;m no genius but these directions were enough for me to get the job done, I&#x27;m just confused why so many people can&#x27;t get it right. Boiled up water until it was bubbling, placed the tray in for about 5 normal Mississippi seconds, and took them out and bit tight and sucked(-_-) for about 20 seconds and kept sucking(-_-).</li>
            <li> I bought these trays after reading many of the reviews and  decided that for the price I would try them.  Following some of the reviewers advice I had little trouble shaping them, however, they were too bulky to keep in my mouth for the required time needed to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Worked well for molding at home</li>
            <li> These are sports mouth guards and not bleaching trays. Opelesence is a multi-hour use product (or overnight) and these mouthguards are not comfortable at all to use on top and bottom together. They are, however, an inexpensive way to try and get the results from bleaching. I recommend visiting your dentist for a product that is made to work with teeth bleach.</li>
            <li> These do the job, but they are very thick and you just can&#x27;t beat molds made by the dentist. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product ... We guarantee 100%&lt;br /&gt;I have had no fault with the product purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards&lt;br /&gt;J D</li>
            <li> They did keep the bleach on my teeth, and 1 tray(the top one) molded well, but the bottom 1 wouldn&#x27;t mold for some reason. It literally didn&#x27;t take shape :/ still worked though.</li>
            <li> I have stained teeth (cigarette use, several soft drinks per day) and I thought this would work.  Instead I&#x27;m left with a chemical burn on my gums that is so much worse than this picture shows.  My teeth are throbbing and my gums are hurting severely.  I will definitely go to the dentist if I want my teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> I probably did it wrong but if that&#x27;s the case, must not be as easy to use as advertised.</li>
            <li> they work very well, just dont boil them for more than the time they say on the instructions! very good pricing as well</li>
            <li> Purchased for family member and found it easy to form and got a pretty good fit.  Works very well with Opalescence and we&#x27;re pleased with the cost of trays.</li>
            <li> Hard to manipulate.  Very thick which makes them uncomfortable in the mouth for too long.  Would spend more money for better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I had to keep dipping them in the hot water over and over to get it to mold to my teeth.  It seems pretty good for something you can do yourself at home, however, it is pretty thick &amp; is kind of like a mouth gaurd.</li>
            <li> I ruined my trays because of incorrect instructions.  My trays melted into a shapeless mass in 3 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I would give these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLD TRAY BY HANDLE AND DIP INTO BOILING WATER FOR NO MORE THAN ONE SECOND.&lt;br /&gt;PLACE TRAY ON UPPER TEETH AND BITE DOWN UNTIL FIT IS ESTABLISHED.&lt;br /&gt;REPEAT FOR LOWER TEETH.  ALLOW TO DRY AND COOL.  STORE IN CONTAINER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare my instructions to yours and you&#x27;ll see why I ruined mine.&lt;br /&gt;Want to send me more trays so I can try it with MY instructions?</li>
            <li> The silicone in these is way too soft and doesn&#x27;t hold a shape, they wont conform around your teeth nearly as tightly as you want them to for bleaching.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are big. Yes, they are clunky. Yes, they lose their shape. But they are 5 dollars! I went through a whole tooth whitening regimen with them and got the results I wanted. If I need trays again, I&#x27;ll just buy them again! The dentist would charge 300 for some permanent trays that never lose their shape, but I&#x27;d rather buy these since I doubt i&#x27;ll be able to go through 60 regimens without losing the initial 300$ trays anyway.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for some whitening gel that I use and she wanted to try. I&#x27;ve had my mouth piece for years don&#x27;t remember where I got it could be the same one but my daughter said it was easy for her to mold and fits fine with no problem or issues. I gave it 4 stars just because, no negativity intended</li>
            <li> pretty basic nothing to go on about</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true you get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was way too thick and bulky to fit into your mouth for the required amount of time it takes to bleach your teeth. If you only have to use the trays once then maybe they could work but if you have to use the trays nightly like my bleaching kit required than you should look elsewhere. Even after molding (it come with no instructions by the way) the trays are just too big. It allows bleach to get all over your gums which can be painful. Yes, they are cheap but they are cheap for a reason. Save yourself the headache and the bleached gums and pay more and get proper-fitting trays.</li>
            <li> These trays work just fine. I&#x27;m glad there are 3 of them because I ruined the first one I molded.  The water needs to be really hot when molding, and one needs to take it out as soon as it begins to shrivel.</li>
            <li> Trays will shrink if left in just boiled water more than 8-10 seconds - oops!  But the good thing is these trays need not be perfectly shaped against the tooth at molding time to function with the Tooth-whitening product.  Fear not - there need not be high precision in molding the trays for whitening the teeth properly.</li>
            <li> This was the second set I purchased. Too hard to use. If you put them in the water too long they would shrink. If you didn&#x27;t put in the water long enough, they wouldn&#x27;t mold to teeth. Out of the 6 molds, I only got one to work...kinda :(</li>
            <li> These are utter crap. Spend a little more to get some quality trays.</li>
            <li> I followed directions that came with the trays.  After submerging the first one in into the water on the stove for 15 seconds and pulling it out it melted together in a few places.  Adjust temperature and time for second one and the same thing happened.  After ruining in the first two I basically dipped the last one I had in a for several seconds and tried to form it with little success as it still lost its form in one spot...</li>
            <li> This piece of crap melted in 5 seconds of being in the microwave. LOL...I will order a more expensive one</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I had lost the trays my dentist had given me and didn&#x27;t want the hassle or cost of going to the dentist.  I thought this would be a quick, easy solution.  I ordered them and followed the directions EXACTLY as they were given.  However, the first tray didn&#x27;t even mold.  NOTHING happened.  I tried a second one and it shrunk and shriveled up.  Then I tried the third and NOTHING happened.  I ended up calling around to local dentists to see how much their trays would cost, or how much the impressions would cost.  I found that it would cost me about $30 to have the impressions done professionally, at a dentist office.  So save yourself a bit of money, as well as a whole lot of trouble, and don&#x27;t even bother with these moldable trays.</li>
            <li> Not even close to fitting and there is no way for them to stay in.... seriously, who designed these and what were they designed for?  Maybe they sent the wrong item?</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected, perhaps a bit smaller, but good. . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t really expect too much at that price.  How I got around the molding challenges was by using my heat gun from my garage (the one I use to shrink plastiv insulation over wire joints, etc.  I heated sections until the started to sag and then put it on my teeth and molded it tighter with my fingers.  It took several iterations to get a reasonable seal, but it finally formed a close-fitting enough shape.  By pressing hard on the front side I was even able to form some faint depressions of my teeth into the tray wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:  I tried a hair dryer first and it would not get hot enough (or I ran out of patience - an all too common occurence, just ask my spouse!).  Also, you want to leave the tab on until you have finished with molding.  Finally, you have to strike a balance between hot enough to mold and too hot for your gums/tongue.  And I find the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; edges a bit uncomfortable.  I guess I could work them out with the heat gun if i really tried.</li>
            <li> The trays are cheap and a bit hard to mold. I read several reviews and I bought two sets incase of scortching them with hot water. They were for my husband... The first one he bit too hard when he was trying to mold the bottom and the side caved in. Glad we ordered extra. The shipping did take a bit long coming from China... Overall, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> We received the trays earlier than expected, which was great. Hence the one star. We followed directions perfectly and the trays shriveled up to about 1/3 of its original size. We tried to stretch them out (they were really hot and that hurt) and put them in to mold them- but it was clearly not going to work. This is a rip. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect supplement for the Watts teeth whitening I purchased.  I&#x27;m not paying a couple hundred for a dentist to do it for me.</li>
            <li> either melted or didnt get hot enough to form. there is no in between, atleast it was cheap. dont waste your time though</li>
            <li> and would not easily mold - kept folding over.  These trays need to be much more narrow to mold well - not 1/2&#x27; wide.</li>
            <li> Very good product!! works exactly as stated</li>
            <li> It didnt come with instructions or anything.</li>
            <li> Really does not form to the teeth hardly at all. Does a very poor job of molding to the teeth and therefore does not seal the whitening gel again  the teeth.</li>
            <li> Looking for alternative. Very hard and do not mold like I would expect. Gel I used in them came out because of the design.</li>
            <li> This is a great product easy to mold! I am ordering more for friends and family. The product arrived quickly. Good instructions included!</li>
            <li> They are trim to fit moldable trays. So they require a little work to get them fitting comfortably. This might sound dumb, but directions would have been nice, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to boil them. Just a few seconds is all you need!</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with these!!!! It works better than forking out $300 for molds. They are tricky to mold and can go wrong. But redo them!</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference. The trays are kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> We purchased this grouped with whitening gel and ended up going and having trays made.  The gel does not stay put and leaks out and burns your gums with these trays.</li>
            <li> These worked well for my teenage daughter.  We followed the directions exactly and it was easy to do.  Seems to work fine without spending hundreds.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold and use and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> For ~$1 each, I think these are pretty incredible.  I&#x27;ve never had professionally made trays but from what I understand it is around a $150 service.  I get 3 of these for ~$3 and ~10 minutes of work?  Winner.  I thought they were very easy to mold.  I boiled some water on the stove and dipped them for about 5-10 seconds, put in mouth (be careful they may be really hot!), bite down softly, use tongue and fingers to shape to teeth and gums.  Repeat this process until you&#x27;re happy.  When you&#x27;re happy with them heat them up one more time, suck all of the air out and hold it in until it hardens,  I did this to get the final perfect fit. I pretty much ruined the first one but the second one I made was perfect.  Others talked about cutting them to get the perfect fit, but mine feel perfect without any cutting.  I would suggest at least trying them before going to a dentist.</li>
