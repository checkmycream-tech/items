    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but this one is the best by the review of GoodHouseKeeping.com,</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>is the best choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Best Price and service around.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Great Service, too!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Perfect to apply before bed and let skin absorb it in over night.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizer, so I decided to try this night cream again, because I had a coupon for it, and the results have been great!</li>
            <li>and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li>Still is a very good product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and great buy!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good night moisturizer and since this one had excellent reviews i purchased it.  </li>
            <li>If you have dehydrated skin this product is wonderful to soften skin and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on a Good Housekeeping study -- it is a very good night lotion.  </li>
            <li>Feels great going on, but as the day progressed, I realized that it was flaking off and showering debris onto my eyebrows and clothing.  </li>
            <li>On December 13, 2014 I purchased this product on Amazon because the photos featured pictures of the attractive box it came in, as you would buy off the shelf in a cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>Great overnight cream:  </li>
            <li>This one is great.  </li>
            <li>I saw the RevitaLift products and had read great reviews.</li>
            <li>people have stated that after using this product, they experienced break outs.</li>
            <li>Happy?</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels great, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>They claimed it was a great buy for the money</li>
            <li>as I could LOL.</li>
            <li>I use it as my night cream for my face and its great.</li>
            <li>Based on using this product, I also bought the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift day product with sunscreen and have been happy with it as well.  </li>
            <li>This smells and works great.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the price is great!!</li>
            <li>Very suitable for women over the age of forty.</li>
            <li>It felt good on my skin and had a fragrance, which is probably what broke me out.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a year and do see my face looking good.</li>
            <li>but I probably have in my head that will work as good as Botox.</li>
            <li>This product did have good reviews in women&#x27;s magazine</li>
            <li>Have just begun using it, but I have already noticed a good change in my face.</li>
            <li>I got the recommendation from Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li>This stuff works as a good moisterizer but does nothing for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This moisterizer is really good.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>I took pictures of before and after, and almost nothing good has happened.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but like plastic.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice, I love the creaminess to it.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>(not that I have that many yet, but still!)</li>
            <li>Nice cream, no greasy.</li>
            <li>Works Good, and the price is better than the store</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help in the wrinkle battle.  </li>
            <li>The Oil of Olay product had already given visible results  and the naso-labial folds were significantly reduced, with which I was happy.</li>
            <li>The packaging is good but the pump itself look kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>recommend this to any lady who is wanting a good moisturizing, fine line, wrinkle reducing face lotion.</li>
            <li>I loved every thing about it form the light feel to the noticeable results.</li>
            <li>They are very fine, but I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
            <li>The creme is filled with moisture and feels great when you smooth it on.</li>
            <li>It is readily absorbed into the skin and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>my kittens love.  </li>
            <li>You have lost a customer and hopefully many more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with the value as well.</li>
            <li>Overall its wonderful, by the way I&#x27;m just using this product to prevent wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have it yet.</li>
            <li>It may be my imagination, but some skin products do seem to help me look better, and others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is okay, but does nothing close to lifting anything.</li>
            <li>The prospect of something being better than what I was already using sold me.</li>
            <li>Touching my face a time after applying it feels as if someone has put wax on my face.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this product cause you can feel and see the differance.  </li>
            <li>Too greasy!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement while using it just itching and burning feeling Better pick something else for wrinkles</li>
            <li>and I already love this creme.  </li>
            <li>Just as I said It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Bought this cream for my mom at a better price then retail store price.</li>
            <li>Two pumps each night before bed have been wonderful on my skin - especially beneficial in the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think this product does better than the day creme......</li>
            <li>Will use this product again for sure.  </li>
            <li>Love L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Need to order more for day use.</li>
            <li>This is used as a foundation on your skin and you have to put moisturizer on top of it (per directions).  </li>
            <li>I had perfect skin up til my mid twenties, but for some reason started breaking out with acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, much more moisturized, the cream does not irritate my skin</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use several l&#x27;oreal products, I&#x27;ve found they work great, and smell good</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I have been using a much higher priced department store moisterizer and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Use nightly &amp; you&#x27;ll smile in the morning!!</li>
            <li>Now in my mid-40s, my formerly \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; are becoming more and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It might be a great product but not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy or smelly, lasts a good while and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I think most everyone that see&#x27;s these products as very useful are people that just see what they want to see.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;ve used other night creams: but this is the best.</li>
            <li>The creme goes all so easy.</li>
            <li>It easily keeps my skin hydrated all night and it does not rub off on my pillowcase.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very good, and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Going on it feels fine.</li>
            <li>Firms my skin, smooths and reduces the appearance of fine lines AND deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes disappear, my skin feels softer, I like the way it goes as well as the smell.</li>
            <li>I also use Loreal&#x27;s eye cream in the morning &amp; night and it has almost erased the fine lines around my eyes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s helping to smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have huge expectations of any cream.</li>
            <li>I dot the lotion along my &#x27;E&#x27; and use my fingertips to smooth upward and across.</li>
            <li>However, it was shipped free along with my order, so it was convenient to add it to my order.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast and how nicely the cream was mailed and  arrived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is so light as to be unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>Goes on light and keeps my skin refreshed</li>
            <li>I enjoy using these products and the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m close to 50 years old and wanted a good face lotion for night time.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good with this face lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 51 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but began to notice very fine wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001SZO890 L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Deep-Set Wrinkle Repair Night Lotion, 1.7 Ounce]]This product was not in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t believe they are any better than others available.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a special treat for them</li>
            <li>For the price however I think it does quite a good job of improving the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that makes my face skin feel good from the inside.  </li>
            <li>You will not look 15 years younger after 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I am a true skeptic when it comes to skin products.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or breakout.</li>
            <li>product?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;I think it is good, definitely not</li>
            <li>I love that it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, as skin seems to aborb it quickly.</li>
            <li>The tone and smoothness of my skin has improved tremendously</li>
            <li>Notice a difference rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you really look and keep track of the progress, you&#x27;ll see almost nothing good happens except if your 14 years old of course and then at those ages...</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and my 52 year-old skin really likes it!</li>
            <li>After reading an article from Good Housekeeping mag about how they tested several products in their own lab I was sold &amp; so far I have noticed the quality of my skin has improved considerably!!!</li>
            <li>This product apply to the skin very evenly and the smell is not too strong.</li>
            <li>My recommendation would be to make sure you softly rub it into your skin for quick absorption.  </li>
            <li>This is a light lotion that really works on some of the lines of my face and moisturizes without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good as the lady&#x27;s that drive the pink cadillac&#x27;s and the model.  </li>
            <li>After applying this in the morning (I rarely wear makeup), by afternoon and evening I could signal planes to land from the reflection on my face.</li>
            <li>Looking in the mirror 30 minutes after application, again I see skin that looks more like a Mardi Gras Mask than soft, supple skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I think it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I try last year over my friend home and since than i always buy it because it makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of products or if it&#x27;s this product, but I&#x27;m on the right track for me.</li>
            <li>I did my research first.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more hydrated and younger when I use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used this and the daytime formula on my forehead exactly as the directions specify . . .</li>
            <li>I think they have discontinued it in my local stores so I will have to keep ordering it until I find a better replacement.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because Goodhousekeeping tested it and wrote it up in their most recent beauty book.  </li>
            <li>It really got rid of wrinkles between my brows after 3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li>Sure would appreciate my money back</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and use them daily.  </li>
            <li>I could have sworn I saw fewer wrinkles the first time I used it... but who knows....</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any significant change in my skin as compared to Mary Kay products which are far superior, but more expensive.</li>
            <li>The only true product I&#x27;ve found that truely works for getting rid of wrinkles is botox or juvederm.</li>
            <li>If your simply looking for plumper, softer skin then go use ANY MOISTURIZER, because they all do a tiny bit of good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and only takes about a dime&#x27;s worth to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\\&quot; and GoodHouseKeeping recommended this,trying to hold off on aging as long</li>
            <li>I try some new super high priced  wrinkle cream and regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li>LOVE the product, and when I use it on a regular basis, I get compliments on &#x27;how young I look&#x27;, which at 65 and a previous smoker is quite a nice thing to hear.  </li>
            <li>I really like the hydrating, silky feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>The night creme is very silky feeling to the face and neck.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles, but then nothing really does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real improvement in the couple of wrinkles</li>
            <li>this was not the real L&#x27;oreal .</li>
            <li>This had too much perfume for me and gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my mother，she said very good！</li>
            <li>Works very well as a night tie moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great thin sheen that covers your face at nighttime.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed them together so that anyone who may want one of the other will  be able to see my option of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that this is any better than any other supermarket store brand of night cream.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that I have tried that makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t produce a rash or small breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It was applied to clean skin as instructed, faithfully *every* day, but my forehead lines look just the same.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer this container, which is the main reason I keep buying it.</li>
            <li>As we age, that area (above our breasts) tends to get crepe-like, but this product really helps to smooth it and keep it soft.  </li>
            <li>I started using this night creme a couple of years ago to replace a much more expensive cream and have been highly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>make billions of dollars selling junk that does nothing, but surround the product with high expectations.</li>
            <li>at 55, unless you&#x27;ve managed not to smile or frown your entire life, you&#x27;re going to have some!    </li>
            <li>My skin also feels more firm.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice thick - not goopy - consistency.  </li>
            <li>It is probably ok for less sensitive people.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t know how much &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; actually happens, I will say that the cream keeps my skin well hydrated and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>Wrinkle repair &amp; makes my skin feel very soft....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried a number of products.  </li>
            <li>I really like the RevitaLife products in general.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on good reviews such as &amp;#34;better than average for a reasonably priced night cream&amp;#34;, but I disagree and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to tell about wrinkles though.  </li>
            <li>been using it for 15 years &amp; recently found it much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The lines around my eyes have diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li>I had watched Dr. Oz&#x27;s show about repair creams that cost under $20.00 and decided to try it on my seventy-seven year old face.  </li>
            <li>Helped my skin improve--not just wrinkles but adult acne</li>
            <li>I was looking for a complete package: day, night and cleansing.</li>
            <li>It is soft but feels nothing like soft &#x27;skin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>(think of those soft rubber grippers).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a natural born cheapskate but this product has convinced me that I can afford to toss 30 bucks between this day and night lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any effect,but I still believe that the product,and continue to use it.</li>
            <li>All this stuff makes you feel soft but it doesn&#x27;t really roll back the clock when you are an old chick.</li>
            <li>so remember to use it.&lt;br /&gt;so far (2 weeks)</li>
            <li>Still look like an old mans ass</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that can break out or otherwise reject some products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile &amp; while I don&#x27;t look twenty years younger, I really don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see much difference.</li>
            <li>Been looking good the next day  - no fine lines, less sagging, etc.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I bought it and the daytime formula in a BOGO offer, so I was only out half the price of the pair.</li>
            <li>This product was no better than my cheap Trader Joes lotion.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s doing much besides take the edge off of my dry skin at the end of the day after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>What I received was a LOOSE TUBE of lotion rolling around, one that could very well be used for all I know.</li>
            <li>So here I am after only 3 weeks after my last attempt at trying a different one, right back ordering 2 Deep Set Wrinkle Creams.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that my skin is smoother, clearer and that wrinkles are less evident.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am 32 with dry, very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It seemed I had to push down more times than usual like it had been used</li>
            <li>Every time I use this, a dried clump comes out first.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, less fine lines and doesn&#x27;t feel tight.</li>
            <li>, it was gentle enough and didnt make my face feel tight, but I was still having breakouts.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best Price and service around.</li>
            <li> Excellent.</li>
            <li> Great Service, too!</li>
            <li> Awesome!</li>
            <li> Perfect to apply before bed and let skin absorb it in over night.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer, so I decided to try this night cream again, because I had a coupon for it, and the results have been great!</li>
            <li> and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li> Still is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and great buy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good night moisturizer and since this one had excellent reviews i purchased it.  </li>
            <li> If you have dehydrated skin this product is wonderful to soften skin and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a Good Housekeeping study -- it is a very good night lotion.  </li>
            <li> Feels great going on, but as the day progressed, I realized that it was flaking off and showering debris onto my eyebrows and clothing.  </li>
            <li> On December 13, 2014 I purchased this product on Amazon because the photos featured pictures of the attractive box it came in, as you would buy off the shelf in a cosmetic store.</li>
            <li> Great overnight cream:  </li>
            <li> This one is great.  </li>
            <li> I saw the RevitaLift products and had read great reviews.</li>
            <li> people have stated that after using this product, they experienced break outs.</li>
            <li> Happy?</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> They claimed it was a great buy for the money</li>
            <li> as I could LOL.</li>
            <li> I use it as my night cream for my face and its great.</li>
            <li> Based on using this product, I also bought the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift day product with sunscreen and have been happy with it as well.  </li>
            <li> This smells and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price is great!!</li>
            <li> Very suitable for women over the age of forty.</li>
            <li> It felt good on my skin and had a fragrance, which is probably what broke me out.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year and do see my face looking good.</li>
            <li> but I probably have in my head that will work as good as Botox.</li>
            <li> This product did have good reviews in women&#x27;s magazine</li>
            <li> Have just begun using it, but I have already noticed a good change in my face.</li>
            <li> I got the recommendation from Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as a good moisterizer but does nothing for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This moisterizer is really good.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I took pictures of before and after, and almost nothing good has happened.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but like plastic.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, I love the creaminess to it.</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> (not that I have that many yet, but still!)</li>
            <li> Nice cream, no greasy.</li>
            <li> Works Good, and the price is better than the store</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help in the wrinkle battle.  </li>
            <li> The Oil of Olay product had already given visible results  and the naso-labial folds were significantly reduced, with which I was happy.</li>
            <li> The packaging is good but the pump itself look kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> recommend this to any lady who is wanting a good moisturizing, fine line, wrinkle reducing face lotion.</li>
            <li> I loved every thing about it form the light feel to the noticeable results.</li>
            <li> They are very fine, but I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
            <li> The creme is filled with moisture and feels great when you smooth it on.</li>
            <li> It is readily absorbed into the skin and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> my kittens love.  </li>
            <li> You have lost a customer and hopefully many more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased with the value as well.</li>
            <li> Overall its wonderful, by the way I&#x27;m just using this product to prevent wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have it yet.</li>
            <li> It may be my imagination, but some skin products do seem to help me look better, and others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is okay, but does nothing close to lifting anything.</li>
            <li> The prospect of something being better than what I was already using sold me.</li>
            <li> Touching my face a time after applying it feels as if someone has put wax on my face.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love this product cause you can feel and see the differance.  </li>
            <li> Too greasy!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement while using it just itching and burning feeling Better pick something else for wrinkles</li>
            <li> and I already love this creme.  </li>
            <li> Just as I said It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> Bought this cream for my mom at a better price then retail store price.</li>
            <li> Two pumps each night before bed have been wonderful on my skin - especially beneficial in the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think this product does better than the day creme......</li>
            <li> Will use this product again for sure.  </li>
            <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Need to order more for day use.</li>
            <li> This is used as a foundation on your skin and you have to put moisturizer on top of it (per directions).  </li>
            <li> I had perfect skin up til my mid twenties, but for some reason started breaking out with acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, much more moisturized, the cream does not irritate my skin</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use several l&#x27;oreal products, I&#x27;ve found they work great, and smell good</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using a much higher priced department store moisterizer and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Use nightly &amp; you&#x27;ll smile in the morning!!</li>
            <li> Now in my mid-40s, my formerly \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; are becoming more and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> It might be a great product but not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy or smelly, lasts a good while and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I think most everyone that see&#x27;s these products as very useful are people that just see what they want to see.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve used other night creams: but this is the best.</li>
            <li> The creme goes all so easy.</li>
            <li> It easily keeps my skin hydrated all night and it does not rub off on my pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very good, and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Going on it feels fine.</li>
            <li> Firms my skin, smooths and reduces the appearance of fine lines AND deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes disappear, my skin feels softer, I like the way it goes as well as the smell.</li>
            <li> I also use Loreal&#x27;s eye cream in the morning &amp; night and it has almost erased the fine lines around my eyes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s helping to smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have huge expectations of any cream.</li>
            <li> I dot the lotion along my &#x27;E&#x27; and use my fingertips to smooth upward and across.</li>
            <li> However, it was shipped free along with my order, so it was convenient to add it to my order.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast and how nicely the cream was mailed and  arrived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is so light as to be unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> Goes on light and keeps my skin refreshed</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these products and the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m close to 50 years old and wanted a good face lotion for night time.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good with this face lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 51 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but began to notice very fine wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001SZO890 L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Deep-Set Wrinkle Repair Night Lotion, 1.7 Ounce]]This product was not in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t believe they are any better than others available.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a special treat for them</li>
            <li> For the price however I think it does quite a good job of improving the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that makes my face skin feel good from the inside.  </li>
            <li> You will not look 15 years younger after 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I am a true skeptic when it comes to skin products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or breakout.</li>
            <li> product?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;I think it is good, definitely not</li>
            <li> I love that it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, as skin seems to aborb it quickly.</li>
            <li> The tone and smoothness of my skin has improved tremendously</li>
            <li> Notice a difference rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you really look and keep track of the progress, you&#x27;ll see almost nothing good happens except if your 14 years old of course and then at those ages...</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and my 52 year-old skin really likes it!</li>
            <li> After reading an article from Good Housekeeping mag about how they tested several products in their own lab I was sold &amp; so far I have noticed the quality of my skin has improved considerably!!!</li>
            <li> This product apply to the skin very evenly and the smell is not too strong.</li>
            <li> My recommendation would be to make sure you softly rub it into your skin for quick absorption.  </li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that really works on some of the lines of my face and moisturizes without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good as the lady&#x27;s that drive the pink cadillac&#x27;s and the model.  </li>
            <li> After applying this in the morning (I rarely wear makeup), by afternoon and evening I could signal planes to land from the reflection on my face.</li>
            <li> Looking in the mirror 30 minutes after application, again I see skin that looks more like a Mardi Gras Mask than soft, supple skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I think it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I try last year over my friend home and since than i always buy it because it makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of products or if it&#x27;s this product, but I&#x27;m on the right track for me.</li>
            <li> I did my research first.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more hydrated and younger when I use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used this and the daytime formula on my forehead exactly as the directions specify . . .</li>
            <li> I think they have discontinued it in my local stores so I will have to keep ordering it until I find a better replacement.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because Goodhousekeeping tested it and wrote it up in their most recent beauty book.  </li>
            <li> It really got rid of wrinkles between my brows after 3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> Sure would appreciate my money back</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and use them daily.  </li>
            <li> I could have sworn I saw fewer wrinkles the first time I used it... but who knows....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any significant change in my skin as compared to Mary Kay products which are far superior, but more expensive.</li>
            <li> The only true product I&#x27;ve found that truely works for getting rid of wrinkles is botox or juvederm.</li>
            <li> If your simply looking for plumper, softer skin then go use ANY MOISTURIZER, because they all do a tiny bit of good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and only takes about a dime&#x27;s worth to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\\&quot; and GoodHouseKeeping recommended this,trying to hold off on aging as long</li>
            <li> I try some new super high priced  wrinkle cream and regret wasting my money.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product, and when I use it on a regular basis, I get compliments on &#x27;how young I look&#x27;, which at 65 and a previous smoker is quite a nice thing to hear.  </li>
            <li> I really like the hydrating, silky feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> The night creme is very silky feeling to the face and neck.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles, but then nothing really does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real improvement in the couple of wrinkles</li>
            <li> this was not the real L&#x27;oreal .</li>
            <li> This had too much perfume for me and gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother，she said very good！</li>
            <li> Works very well as a night tie moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great thin sheen that covers your face at nighttime.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed them together so that anyone who may want one of the other will  be able to see my option of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this is any better than any other supermarket store brand of night cream.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that I have tried that makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t produce a rash or small breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It was applied to clean skin as instructed, faithfully *every* day, but my forehead lines look just the same.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer this container, which is the main reason I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> As we age, that area (above our breasts) tends to get crepe-like, but this product really helps to smooth it and keep it soft.  </li>
            <li> I started using this night creme a couple of years ago to replace a much more expensive cream and have been highly satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> make billions of dollars selling junk that does nothing, but surround the product with high expectations.</li>
            <li> at 55, unless you&#x27;ve managed not to smile or frown your entire life, you&#x27;re going to have some!    </li>
            <li> My skin also feels more firm.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice thick - not goopy - consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is probably ok for less sensitive people.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know how much &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; actually happens, I will say that the cream keeps my skin well hydrated and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle repair &amp; makes my skin feel very soft....</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried a number of products.  </li>
            <li> I really like the RevitaLife products in general.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on good reviews such as &amp;#34;better than average for a reasonably priced night cream&amp;#34;, but I disagree and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to tell about wrinkles though.  </li>
            <li> been using it for 15 years &amp; recently found it much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes have diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li> I had watched Dr. Oz&#x27;s show about repair creams that cost under $20.00 and decided to try it on my seventy-seven year old face.  </li>
            <li> Helped my skin improve--not just wrinkles but adult acne</li>
            <li> I was looking for a complete package: day, night and cleansing.</li>
            <li> It is soft but feels nothing like soft &#x27;skin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> (think of those soft rubber grippers).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a natural born cheapskate but this product has convinced me that I can afford to toss 30 bucks between this day and night lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any effect,but I still believe that the product,and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> All this stuff makes you feel soft but it doesn&#x27;t really roll back the clock when you are an old chick.</li>
            <li> so remember to use it.&lt;br /&gt;so far (2 weeks)</li>
            <li> Still look like an old mans ass</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that can break out or otherwise reject some products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile &amp; while I don&#x27;t look twenty years younger, I really don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see much difference.</li>
            <li> Been looking good the next day  - no fine lines, less sagging, etc.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I bought it and the daytime formula in a BOGO offer, so I was only out half the price of the pair.</li>
            <li> This product was no better than my cheap Trader Joes lotion.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing much besides take the edge off of my dry skin at the end of the day after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li> What I received was a LOOSE TUBE of lotion rolling around, one that could very well be used for all I know.</li>
            <li> So here I am after only 3 weeks after my last attempt at trying a different one, right back ordering 2 Deep Set Wrinkle Creams.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that my skin is smoother, clearer and that wrinkles are less evident.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 32 with dry, very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It seemed I had to push down more times than usual like it had been used</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, a dried clump comes out first.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, less fine lines and doesn&#x27;t feel tight.</li>
            <li> , it was gentle enough and didnt make my face feel tight, but I was still having breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in a dry area.  </li>
            <li> A dab the size of a dime is enough, so this will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The writing on the product was only in English instead of English &amp; French as mine &amp; other local store products.</li>
            <li> Am disabled and live on $700 a month-bought this product 3 times over the last 3 months-went without eating</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough to see if the deep-set wrinkles have been repaired \\&quot;less deep\\&quot;, but it makes my skin feel very soft and \\&quot;moisture-ized\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> While they all work pretty well, this one did the least and made my face and neck break out, so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> The oil cleared up my acne over a few weeks, but my skin was still dry and the wrinkles (although small) really bothered me and every face cream (even natural moisturizers)</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it is so highly rated.</li>
            <li> Not only are they not improving further, this product is not even maintaining the previous progress.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have this problem with the other similar products.</li>
            <li> Thinking I could open the container and get the last bit out out I discovered that the container inside the 4\\&quot; long cylinder was actually less than 1/2\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but I do like the scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and only have a few lines at the outside corners of my eyes</li>
            <li> So, I naively assumed it would be BRAND NEW IN BOX.</li>
            <li> The pump nozzle stopped working a month after use, with a half bottle of product left.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent is a little too strong and lingering for my tastes.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no big difference or even little difference after using these products both day and night for weeks and also taking baths and showers every single day, twice a day to keep everything well moisturized and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this stuff everyday for the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to my routine of washing with Purpose Bar, applying a dime sized amount of Grapeseed Oil, a few pumps of Loreal Revitalift Deep-set wrinkle repair for night (I use it in the morning as well)</li>
            <li> Half of the product was still in this little, bitty tub that took up only 1/8th of the product packaging.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other night creams out there</li>
            <li> I also use other L&#x27;Oreal face lotions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brand face lotions but comparatively speaking for the money and results L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> For comparison information, I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, fair-skinned with very minimal sun damage (a dermatologist commented on that fact when I consulted him for another issue).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and after about 3 weeks I did notice the lines around my eyes were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> more corporate scams that take all our money, and give almost nothing back but pipe dreams and false advertising while they get filthy</li>
            <li> After using this product along with a cleanser and day moisturizer, my skin feels noticeably smoother, and the few smaller wrinkles are less noticeable after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different wrinkle reducing products over the past few months.</li>
            <li> i slowly noticed a difference in how my skin looked without deep set</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and have noticed a slight improvement in lessening my crows feet</li>
            <li> I seem to have less wrinkles and no one would guess I&#x27;m 65.</li>
            <li> Age spots seem to be getting a little lighter.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the lotion dries up with each use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use but just a little, so apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> However, I stuck to to it every day for 30 days ...saw little if no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than what I am used to</li>
            <li> I have been using a few weeks and my skin feels softer.  </li>
            <li> My facial wrinkles definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> I am 62, and outdoors almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I was not comfortable with it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
            <li> and it was too harsh for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first until I started getting these tiny little painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;The night &#x27;lotion&#x27; is not much better.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment given the price tag.</li>
            <li> Probably at least once a year</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have used it approximately 15 times.</li>
            <li> It is thick.</li>
            <li> It is no good at all.  </li>
            <li> So when I had to wait 8 weeks to see a difference that was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone because I have had a terrible time with myskin over the last few years.</li>
            <li> Not Great Nothing to write home about</li>
            <li> I hate that you can&#x27;t see how much is left in the bottle though.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried irritated my skin, it would burn, cause breakouts and dry my skin out very badly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle and settled for mediocre.</li>
            <li> I can not afford to purchase the expensive brands</li>
            <li> I hate plunging my hand into tubs of night cream (seriously, why are they all in tubs?).</li>
            <li> so disappointed in this product - am afraid to order another beauty product</li>
            <li> This was not as advertised and I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLY DECEITFUL!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my kittens love.  it&#x27;s a special treat for them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but I do like the scent and it seems like my skin feels softer than before.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve used other night creams: but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good night moisturizer and since this one had excellent reviews i purchased it.  It might be a great product but not for sensitive skin.  I started developing pimples on my face.  It felt good on my skin and had a fragrance, which is probably what broke me out.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, no greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have used it approximately 15 times. I did not over-indulge given the price tag. Tonight when I went to put it on I ran out. Thinking I could open the container and get the last bit out out I discovered that the container inside the 4\\&quot; long cylinder was actually less than 1/2\\&quot;! Half of the product was still in this little, bitty tub that took up only 1/8th of the product packaging. HORRIBLY DECEITFUL! I don&#x27;t know if this product works because I don&#x27;t have enough money to buy 8 tubes of nothing! Shame on you L&#x27;Oreal. You have lost a customer and hopefully many more.</li>
            <li> I really like the hydrating, silky feel of this lotion. I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and have noticed a slight improvement in lessening my crows feet and it makes my skin feel refreshed at night.</li>
            <li> This product used to come as a night creme....Has been reformulated as a lotion.....Still is a very good product.Wrinkle repair &amp; makes my skin feel very soft....Use nightly &amp; you&#x27;ll smile in the morning!!</li>
            <li> After reading an article from Good Housekeeping mag about how they tested several products in their own lab I was sold &amp; so far I have noticed the quality of my skin has improved considerably!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. It moisturizes my face and neck and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I seem to have less wrinkles and no one would guess I&#x27;m 65. The bottle also lasts a couple of months so I&#x27;m pleased with the value as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few weeks and my skin feels softer.  I think it is too early to tell about wrinkles though.  Would prefer no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Feels great going on, but as the day progressed, I realized that it was flaking off and showering debris onto my eyebrows and clothing.  Big disappointment given the price tag.</li>
            <li> On December 13, 2014 I purchased this product on Amazon because the photos featured pictures of the attractive box it came in, as you would buy off the shelf in a cosmetic store. So, I naively assumed it would be BRAND NEW IN BOX. What I received was a LOOSE TUBE of lotion rolling around, one that could very well be used for all I know. NO BOX!!! This was not as advertised and I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, I love the creaminess to it. I haven&#x27;t tried other night creams out there but this one is the best by the review of GoodHouseKeeping.com, yeah I did my research first. This product apply to the skin very evenly and the smell is not too strong. The packaging is good but the pump itself look kind of cheap. Overall its wonderful, by the way I&#x27;m just using this product to prevent wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have it yet.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on TV and decided to try it. I have been using it for over a year and do see my face looking good. I would advise trying it.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  I use it twice per day.</li>
            <li> It seemed I had to push down more times than usual like it had been used but otherwise I like it.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the lady&#x27;s that drive the pink cadillac&#x27;s and the model.  I have used them both for years.  This works the same.</li>
            <li> Works Good, and the price is better than the store</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried a number of products.  This is the only one that I have tried that makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t produce a rash or small breakouts.  My skin looks more hydrated and younger when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year on a daily basis. It&#x27;s not a miracle potion but I have noticed that my skin is smoother, clearer and that wrinkles are less evident. It does nothing though for deep wrinkles and for that reason I feel the claims are a bit deceptive as a \\&quot;deep set wrinkle repair cream\\&quot;. For the price however I think it does quite a good job of improving the overall appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m 63 so I don&#x27;t have huge expectations of any cream.</li>
            <li> It may be my imagination, but some skin products do seem to help me look better, and others don&#x27;t. This does. I put it on @ night on my eyes and around the eye/forehead area and go to bed. Been looking good the next day  - no fine lines, less sagging, etc.</li>
            <li> Great overnight cream:  been using it for 15 years &amp; recently found it much cheaper on Amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used several of the Loreal repair lotions. While they all work pretty well, this one did the least and made my face and neck break out, so I threw it away. I did not have this problem with the other similar products.</li>
            <li> I started using this night creme a couple of years ago to replace a much more expensive cream and have been highly satisfied with the results.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and stays on the skin despite tossing and turning throughout the night.  While I don&#x27;t know how much &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; actually happens, I will say that the cream keeps my skin well hydrated and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle and settled for mediocre. The eye cream is okay, but does nothing close to lifting anything.</li>
            <li> I used this and the daytime formula on my forehead exactly as the directions specify . . . no change whatsoever after 12 weeks.  It was applied to clean skin as instructed, faithfully *every* day, but my forehead lines look just the same.  For comparison information, I&#x27;m in my mid-50s, fair-skinned with very minimal sun damage (a dermatologist commented on that fact when I consulted him for another issue).  I get plenty of sleep, stay well-hydrated, avoid sun exposure, etc.--all the things one should do to protect her complexion.  I also don&#x27;t have excessively-deep forehead lines, but, hey . . . at 55, unless you&#x27;ve managed not to smile or frown your entire life, you&#x27;re going to have some!    All in all, I found this cream to have no value.  Fortunately, I bought it and the daytime formula in a BOGO offer, so I was only out half the price of the pair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as well as the day creme for about a week. My skin feels smoother and my makeup goes on easier. Age spots seem to be getting a little lighter. The night creme is very silky feeling to the face and neck. It is readily absorbed into the skin and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m close to 50 years old and wanted a good face lotion for night time.  This one is great.  I noticed a difference in my skin pretty quickly. My skin feels softer and looks healthier.  The lines around my eyes have diminished considerably.  I also use other L&#x27;Oreal face lotions.  I&#x27;ve tried other brand face lotions but comparatively speaking for the money and results L&#x27;Oreal is the best choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to any lady who is wanting a good moisturizing, fine line, wrinkle reducing face lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results yet but I probably have in my head that will work as good as Botox. I like the feeling of the lotion but I don&#x27;t see my skin appearing any different. This product did have good reviews in women&#x27;s magazine however I think I will be trying No7 next</li>
            <li> A little bit of the lotion dries up with each use. Every time I use this, a dried clump comes out first.</li>
            <li> I had watched Dr. Oz&#x27;s show about repair creams that cost under $20.00 and decided to try it on my seventy-seven year old face.  It has not been long enough to see if the deep-set wrinkles have been repaired \\&quot;less deep\\&quot;, but it makes my skin feel very soft and \\&quot;moisture-ized\\&quot;.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great! Helped my skin improve--not just wrinkles but adult acne</li>
            <li> The following is a repeat of my review found on the day lotion. I reviewed them together so that anyone who may want one of the other will  be able to see my option of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that prior to purchasing this product I had been using the Oil of Olay Regenerist line. I loved every thing about it form the light feel to the noticeable results. I was looking for a complete package: day, night and cleansing. I saw the RevitaLift products and had read great reviews. The prospect of something being better than what I was already using sold me. This WAS NOT it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 51 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but began to notice very fine wrinkles on my forehead. Also the nasal-labial fold that make you look like a puppet. The Oil of Olay product had already given visible results  and the naso-labial folds were significantly reduced, with which I was happy. Since using the Loreal Day and Night &#x27;Lotions;, the folds have begun to reappear. Not only are they not improving further, this product is not even maintaining the previous progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the word &#x27;lotion&#x27;. When I hear the word lotion, I visualize something that will absorb into the skin. After applying this in the morning (I rarely wear makeup), by afternoon and evening I could signal planes to land from the reflection on my face. It does not feel greasy and the look is almost that of a glossy plastic overlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night &#x27;lotion&#x27; is not much better. I dot the lotion along my &#x27;E&#x27; and use my fingertips to smooth upward and across. Going on it feels fine. Touching my face a time after applying it feels as if someone has put wax on my face. It is thick. It is soft but feels nothing like soft &#x27;skin&#x27;. (think of those soft rubber grippers). Looking in the mirror 30 minutes after application, again I see skin that looks more like a Mardi Gras Mask than soft, supple skin. The youthful glow does not reflect sunlight people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have stated that after using this product, they experienced break outs. I was a little skeptical at first until I started getting these tiny little painful what I hope are pimples on my cheeks.  This is definitely not non-comedogenic. I apply this after washing, exfoliating and using toner but it still manages to clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural born cheapskate but this product has convinced me that I can afford to toss 30 bucks between this day and night lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Olay! Take me back! Please!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any effect,but I still believe that the product,and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It really works. Try it! Best Price and service around. I love AMAZON!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I have said enough. Why do they require words that I don&#x27;t want to add.&lt;br /&gt;There, there&#x27;s your words! Happy?</li>
            <li> I love this product cause you can feel and see the differance.  I think they have discontinued it in my local stores so I will have to keep ordering it until I find a better replacement.  For night.</li>
            <li> Very suitable for women over the age of forty. My facial wrinkles definitely decreased. My skin is soft and smooth.I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I like this product and think that it is a helpful cream to wear overnight.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles, but then nothing really does.</li>
            <li> Too greasy!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement while using it just itching and burning feeling Better pick something else for wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Worst creme ever</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the No.7 Anti-Aging cream and I will be purchasing the both of them again when I&#x27;m close to running out. Very Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started my second bottle and I already love this creme.  I&#x27;m 60 and only have a few lines at the outside corners of my eyes so I wanted to get a head start on them and in only one bottle, I can see an improvement.  I talked my mom, who is 79 into trying it as well and she is sold as well.  Well worth the money and we both will continue to use</li>
            <li> Smooths out wrinkles and softens skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real improvement in the couple of wrinkles it&#x27;s being used on. On the other hand, it isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> All this stuff makes you feel soft but it doesn&#x27;t really roll back the clock when you are an old chick.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change from this product.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to work well.  Unfortunately the scent is a little too strong and lingering for my tastes.</li>
            <li> i slowly noticed a difference in how my skin looked without deep set and soon i realized what a difference it made l will always use it from now on</li>
            <li> The lotion is very good, and have used it for a long time.  The price was comparable even though I did find it a dollar cheaper at Target.  However, it was shipped free along with my order, so it was convenient to add it to my order.</li>
            <li> feel disappoint of the cream. I bought for my aunt and she review this was not the real L&#x27;oreal .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this is any better than any other supermarket store brand of night cream. I&#x27;m 65 and have dry skin. I bought it based on good reviews such as &amp;#34;better than average for a reasonably priced night cream&amp;#34;, but I disagree and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li> After using this product along with a cleanser and day moisturizer, my skin feels noticeably smoother, and the few smaller wrinkles are less noticeable after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this stuff everyday for the last 5 years.  I have very dry skin and live in a dry area.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that makes my face skin feel good from the inside.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is what works for me.</li>
            <li> I am 62, and outdoors almost everyday. I love this product and the price is great!! Have just begun using it, but I have already noticed a good change in my face. Don&#x27;t have to use but just a little, so apply sparingly. Not greasy, as skin seems to aborb it quickly. Leaves skin smooth. Great Service, too! A+</li>
            <li> The creme goes all so easy. The creme is filled with moisture and feels great when you smooth it on.</li>
            <li> I hate plunging my hand into tubs of night cream (seriously, why are they all in tubs?). I much prefer this container, which is the main reason I keep buying it. It seems like a lot of reviewers are expecting Botox in a bottle. You will not look 15 years younger after 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help in the wrinkle battle.  Light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just as I said It&#x27;s ok...Not Great Nothing to write home about I see no difference in my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I like instant gratification just like anyone else. So when I had to wait 8 weeks to see a difference that was a little disappointing. However, I stuck to to it every day for 30 days ...saw little if no results. Smells great, feels great, but that&#x27;s it. Moving on....</li>
            <li> Bought this cream for my mom at a better price then retail store price. Awesome!</li>
            <li> put beside bed so remember to use it.&lt;br /&gt;so far (2 weeks) I&#x27;ve received  2 compliments on skin.....never had any before  (in my 60&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different wrinkle reducing products over the past few months. Now in my mid-40s, my formerly \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; are becoming more and more noticeable. OUCH! For me, this product has made an immediate and noticeable difference in the look and feel of my skin. Believe me, I am a true skeptic when it comes to skin products. I can not afford to purchase the expensive brands and I really don&#x27;t believe they are any better than others available. I started out using the Loreal Wrinkle Revolution daily moisturizer, which I didn&#x27;t think made any difference but it&#x27;s a good daily moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or breakout. I use their eye cream as well. But THIS product made THE difference. Firms my skin, smooths and reduces the appearance of fine lines AND deeper wrinkles. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of products or if it&#x27;s this product, but I&#x27;m on the right track for me. I have normal to dry skin. I tend to get a bit oily at the end of the day in the T-zone. Prone to breakouts along my jaw line (hormones). If you&#x27;re like me, this might just improve your skin, too.</li>
            <li> This had too much perfume for me and gave me a headache.  It is probably ok for less sensitive people.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approx 8 years and saw noticeable results within weeks.  Probably at least once a year I try some new super high priced  wrinkle cream and regret wasting my money. I always come back to this Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Repair.  The fine lines around my eyes disappear, my skin feels softer, I like the way it goes as well as the smell. It agrees with my skin -- no irritation, no breakouts, no problems.  So here I am after only 3 weeks after my last attempt at trying a different one, right back ordering 2 Deep Set Wrinkle Creams.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> Still look like an old mans ass</li>
            <li> i could not get any cream out of this container...........it was stuck and it would not even open....so disappointed in this product - am afraid to order another beauty product</li>
            <li> I tried this product because Goodhousekeeping tested it and wrote it up in their most recent beauty book.  They claimed it was a great buy for the money and I agree!  It has a nice thick - not goopy - consistency.  Two pumps each night before bed have been wonderful on my skin - especially beneficial in the lines around my eyes.  They are very fine, but I can tell a difference.  This is a great product and great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 yrs. old and I don&#x27;t have any noticeable wrinkles yet, so I can&#x27;t say that its working. But I bought this as a prevention \\&quot;PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\\&quot; and GoodHouseKeeping recommended this,trying to hold off on aging as long as I could LOL. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it as my night cream for my face and its great. I got the recommendation from Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as a good moisterizer but does nothing for wrinkles. If you have dehydrated skin this product is wonderful to soften skin and it smells good. Using it for wrinkles does nothing. The only true product I&#x27;ve found that truely works for getting rid of wrinkles is botox or juvederm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months and I love it!  It easily keeps my skin hydrated all night and it does not rub off on my pillowcase.  The tone and smoothness of my skin has improved tremendously (I noticed the difference in a photo from one year ago), but I especially like the effect it has on my neck and high-chest area.  As we age, that area (above our breasts) tends to get crepe-like, but this product really helps to smooth it and keep it soft.  My recommendation would be to make sure you softly rub it into your skin for quick absorption.  My only suggestion to the L&#x27;Oreal folks would be to make this product in a squeezable tube.  I always feel like I&#x27;m not getting all of the product out when it&#x27;s in a pump container.</li>
            <li> This product was no better than my cheap Trader Joes lotion. I am not sure why it is so highly rated.</li>
            <li> Why all the buzz about this product?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;I think it is good, definitely not great.&lt;br /&gt;The claims are overrated as I didn&#x27;t see any wrinkles reduced.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that really works on some of the lines of my face and moisturizes without being greasy.  I love that it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see much difference. I was amazed at how fast and how nicely the cream was mailed and  arrived.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I hate that you can&#x27;t see how much is left in the bottle though. It really got rid of wrinkles between my brows after 3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> Notice a difference rather quickly.  Leaves skin feeling very hydrated.  Perfect to apply before bed and let skin absorb it in over night.</li>
            <li> This moisterizer is really good. I think it was well worth the price. I have been using a much higher priced department store moisterizer and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> I think this product does better than the day creme......Will use this product again for sure.  It is lightweight and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used to buy both the day cream and the night cream but after reading that Reese Witherspoon uses the night cream only daily I decided to try that and save money. I have seen a difference! My skin is smoother, less fine lines and doesn&#x27;t feel tight. I also don&#x27;t feel like I have cream \\&quot;sitting\\&quot; on my face. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> LOVE the product, and when I use it on a regular basis, I get compliments on &#x27;how young I look&#x27;, which at 65 and a previous smoker is quite a nice thing to hear.  I really like the RevitaLife products in general.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing but cream in a bottle.  Am disabled and live on $700 a month-bought this product 3 times over the last 3 months-went without eating so I could have it.  It is no good at all.  Sure would appreciate my money back so I could buy some bread and milk and hamburger.  Bought from Walmart in Reidsville, NC.  You need to take it off shelf and refund peoples money!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Dee Thacker</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this face lotion. I do think it&#x27;s helping to smooth fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s a little heavier than what I am used to so I only use it once or twice a week for now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a Good Housekeeping study -- it is a very good night lotion.  It&#x27;s not too greasy or smelly, lasts a good while and is reasonably priced.  Based on using this product, I also bought the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift day product with sunscreen and have been happy with it as well.  I have sensitive skin that can break out or otherwise reject some products.  I&#x27;ve used this one for a couple of years now with no difficulties.</li>
            <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal. Need to order more for day use.</li>
            <li> I am 22 and I feel like this is already helping me!  It has only been about 2 weeks but I feel my skin is firmer and I think some wrinkles have subsided.  (not that I have that many yet, but still!)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001SZO890 L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Deep-Set Wrinkle Repair Night Lotion, 1.7 Ounce]]This product was not in it&#x27;s original package. The writing on the product was only in English instead of English &amp; French as mine &amp; other local store products. I was not comfortable with it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
            <li> At 70 and with a smoking history, I don&#x27;t expect miracles from a skin care product.  But I&#x27;m seeing improvement, even in deep lines.  Not face-lift improvement, mind you, but improvement.  My skin also feels more firm.  I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve used it in the morning and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34;, you know, when a product has been on your face for several hours and you rub your face and stuff comes off.  It absorbs without leaving any shine or residue.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation makeup so if I like a cream that&#x27;s advertised as a &amp;#34;night cream&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll use it in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so light as to be unnoticeable.  A dab the size of a dime is enough, so this will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, without reservation.</li>
            <li> This smells and works great. Goes on light and keeps my skin refreshed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile &amp; while I don&#x27;t look twenty years younger, I really don&#x27;t look my age. The only problem I have is that I can&#x27;t open it to get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I try last year over my friend home and since than i always buy it because it makes my skin nice.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and use them daily.  This is used as a foundation on your skin and you have to put moisturizer on top of it (per directions).  I&#x27;ve been using this about two weeks and I don&#x27;t see any significant change in my skin as compared to Mary Kay products which are far superior, but more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am 32 with dry, very sensitive, acne prone skin. I had perfect skin up til my mid twenties, but for some reason started breaking out with acne. I started tanning and started developing wrinkles in addition to breakouts. I have tried hundreds of products over the years and nothing worked for me. Everything I tried irritated my skin, it would burn, cause breakouts and dry my skin out very badly. I even used this Loreal lotion, but it didn&#x27;t work for me and I believe it was because I used it along with the Loreal facial cleanser and it was too harsh for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I started using Purpose bar soap for my face and it cleaned my face well, it was gentle enough and didnt make my face feel tight, but I was still having breakouts. So I searched for a solution and somehow came across grapeseed oil. The oil cleared up my acne over a few weeks, but my skin was still dry and the wrinkles (although small) really bothered me and every face cream (even natural moisturizers) I tried burned my skin to the point that my skin was flaking and even scabbing, so I stopped using moisturizer and just used grapeseed oil. I needed a moisturizer, so I decided to try this night cream again, because I had a coupon for it, and the results have been great! My skin is softer, much more moisturized, the cream does not irritate my skin and I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles. I also use Loreal&#x27;s eye cream in the morning &amp; night and it has almost erased the fine lines around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did notice, I went out of town for a weekend and only took the Loreal night cream. I did not use the grapeseed oil and had a breakout. I have gone back to my routine of washing with Purpose Bar, applying a dime sized amount of Grapeseed Oil, a few pumps of Loreal Revitalift Deep-set wrinkle repair for night (I use it in the morning as well) and then a dab of Loreal&#x27;s eye cream and my skin is looking great! I hope this helps someone because I have had a terrible time with myskin over the last few years. This combination is the only thing that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using for about 3 weeks and already seeing some results on this 58 year olds skin.</li>
            <li> I use several l&#x27;oreal products, I&#x27;ve found they work great, and smell good</li>
            <li> Works well. I could have sworn I saw fewer wrinkles the first time I used it... but who knows....</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother，she said very good！</li>
            <li> Still working with it and skin is smoothing out. I am liking the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I think most everyone that see&#x27;s these products as very useful are people that just see what they want to see. I took pictures of before and after, and almost nothing good has happened. If your simply looking for plumper, softer skin then go use ANY MOISTURIZER, because they all do a tiny bit of good. There is absolutely no big difference or even little difference after using these products both day and night for weeks and also taking baths and showers every single day, twice a day to keep everything well moisturized and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just more corporate scams that take all our money, and give almost nothing back but pipe dreams and false advertising while they get filthy rich.&lt;br /&gt;They make billions of dollars selling junk that does nothing, but surround the product with high expectations. If you really look and keep track of the progress, you&#x27;ll see almost nothing good happens except if your 14 years old of course and then at those ages...anything works doesn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money...........</li>
            <li> Purchased for lines in forehead. Used for 3 weeks, have not seen any improvement</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing much besides take the edge off of my dry skin at the end of the day after I clean my face.  But it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but like plastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these products and the way my skin feels. I also appreciate the service products arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these products to everyone Also your service.</li>
            <li> Works very well as a night tie moisturizer.</li>
            <li> another loreal product that my wife dearly loves to use. she is a regular user and will be recurring purchaser.</li>
            <li> The pump nozzle stopped working a month after use, with a half bottle of product left.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  A little goes a long way and after about 3 weeks I did notice the lines around my eyes were less noticeable. It has a light scent and my 52 year-old skin really likes it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I can really tell a difference in my skin.  The lotion isn&#x27;t sticky or too oily.  It&#x27;s a great thin sheen that covers your face at nighttime.  It&#x27;s light and only takes about a dime&#x27;s worth to cover your face.  Suggest giving it a try and see how it works for you.  L&#x27;Oreal is a name you can trust.</li>
