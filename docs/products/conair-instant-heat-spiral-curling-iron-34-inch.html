            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>They are great when my hair will curl inbetween them, but sometimes it just won&#x27;t go in between the spirals.</li>

            <li>this curler is great</li>
            <li>have been searching for a spiral curling iron for a while and am so happy I made a great decision with both the price, product and seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>

            <li>it heats up really good.</li>
            <li>The price was also really good, which was what made me buy it.</li>
            <li>spend the money on a good curler, unless you want to risk that it will just stop working all together.</li>

            <li>We saw a hairstyle on a cute girls hairstyles website.</li>

            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and was packaged good.</li>
            <li>works perfect on my long hair to!</li>
            <li>After some Great customer service, I recieved a new one.</li>
            <li>lol have to buy me a new one</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li>ITS SO EASY TO USE AND WORKS WONDERS&lt;</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery</li>
            <li>I assumed my hair would swirl through this, but you just wrap your hair around it, I just don&#x27;t find it easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and takes around 3 seconds to curl a piece of your hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls, that are smooth and bouncy, AND lasting!!!!</li>
            <li>you have to use little pieces of hair and get the best curls.</li>
            <li>it is hot,very very hot!</li>
            <li>No crappy plastic to cut it out of either, it came packaged in a simple box which was great.</li>
            <li>The clamp relaxes and smoothes the rattiness and allows the whole hair to look nice.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fantastic it was here in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>but supplier asked me to keep it for free and give it a try</li>
            <li>After a month of use, there seem to be a issue with wiring, as the iron would turn off and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to turn on right a way.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for!!</li>
            <li>curls so easy and so quickly</li>
            <li>fun!&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair was going to look</li>
            <li>Works great on my niece&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li>but I actually like mine BETTER than the picture! :)</li>
            <li>Overall, the Conair Spiral Styler is awesome and I totally recommend it!! :)</li>
            <li>I think if it had higher heat temperatures it would be better.</li>
            <li>I would choose this over any other wand for beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, medium length hair with layers and even I can use it to get the wonderful spiral look.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>This curler heats up super quick &amp; works as promised--great price for this quality-would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly...</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I love my new curling iron</li>
            <li>Perfect way to get prom curls on long and short hair.</li>
            <li>After watching some online videos, it worked the first time i tried it!</li>
            <li>hot fast&lt;br /&gt;But!</li>
            <li>I feel like a curling wand would achieve the same results much more easily.</li>
            <li>It does warm up quickly and it does have alot of different heating settings for ally types of hair.</li>
            <li>My mother has shoulder length, fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I had a smaller one as a child and my girls like to use it, so bought them each one of their own.  </li>
            <li>They just fell right out.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get your hair into the right &amp;#34;grooves&amp;#34; while using it, the hair comes out with ridges in it.  </li>
            <li>I had this product before and it stopped working after about 2 years of almost daily use, I bought this one to replace it and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I used just a little heat-setting spray and took my time and had all-day curl.  </li>
            <li>So glad i bought it and would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, but it only lasts about a year, then the on switch breaks and can&#x27;t be turned on.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is tricky to use.  </li>
            <li>Plugged it in and it got hot.</li>
            <li>I imagine that it is hot</li>
            <li>The first curling iron I received was defective.</li>
            <li>I like first</li>
            <li>It works great and the curls last for a long while!</li>
            <li>But apparently its not that easy to achieve.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was brand new.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t say hot constantly shutting off, and when and if it does stay warm, the curls don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair different lengths.  </li>
            <li>This works really well on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend buying it unless you have a lot of time on your hands or are very into hair.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair, you may be able to use this item if you have help, but otherwise there&#x27;s absolutely no way</li>
            <li>Heats fast.</li>
            <li>At a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>, i can&#x27;t give it away haha</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have the time or patience to play around with it every time I need to use it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants a spiral perm look.</li>
            <li>A beaker was flipped and the whole fuse blew out for all three of our bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often, but when I do it works really well.  </li>
            <li>It heated up fast and styled well UNTIL it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s shoulder length) for this to really work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my old conair spiral curling iron had died years ago and after looking at a few pictures from then I was reminded at how good mohair looked using a spiral curling iron.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than my other waving curling iron.  </li>
            <li>better than other curling irons</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to be able to use this in my short hair, but the barrel clip is much too short.</li>
            <li>The curls are fast, easy, very pretty and very long lasting!  </li>
            <li>it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that will actually curl my fine hair!</li>
            <li>The clamp is super short.</li>
            <li>and I keep hoping for decent results</li>
            <li>I love the results of this and wish I can buy the same thing in a larger dimension!</li>
            <li>dials/handle is very professional and reminds me of the more expensive brands I have looked at - for a much better price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and we are both very please with the natural look we get after running our fingers through our hair.</li>
            <li>Great purchase; works well with long, thick hair which might surprise you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough for textured hair</li>
            <li>Not that easy for short hair (Like me)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say for that low price</li>
            <li>only problem is buttons are right at grip area..</li>
            <li>BRAND NEW IN PACKAGE</li>
            <li>It is still new since it was a Christmas gift</li>
            <li>This was the exact same one and brand new</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed w this product-I sure love it!</li>
            <li>I used only the first  setting.</li>
            <li>Had an old one of these for years and couldn&#x27;t find another anywhere.</li>
            <li>This just isn&#x27;t like the old one.</li>
            <li>mines came a day early .</li>
            <li>Hair gets entangled in this rod and very time consuming hence wanted to send it back</li>
            <li>so it heats up fast, and has a temperature control to set it at different degrees depending upon your hair type.  </li>
            <li>I bought this styler for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for someone else and although I haven&#x27;t personally used it, I understand it works very well.</li>
            <li>That is making a statement when my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>After two months, it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>But I at least thought that this would be effective because it had a camp, albeit it a short and stubby clamp.</li>
            <li>the curl lasts a full 2 days in my slick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>so it could hold your hair when using only the right hand on your left side....</li>
            <li>Making curls is super easy and they stay in my hair which is difficult</li>
            <li>Because of the way the guides are, you can only curl your hair in certain directions, and if you&#x27;re not careful the guides will leave dents in your curl.</li>
            <li>Love that I can have loose waves or tight ringlets based on the amount of hair I curl at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use.</li>
            <li>It works ok if used properly, but the problem is that it is not easy to use properly!  </li>
            <li>Heats up in an instant and the curls last all day in my straight as a board hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, very straight, fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, you can&#x27;t alternate the direction of the curl.</li>
            <li>Second of all, the curls I achieved from it, I don&#x27;t really think are any different than a regular 3/4\\&quot; barrell curling iron.  </li>
            <li>cause it look natural overall</li>
            <li>This does give some nice spiral curls, but it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of.</li>
            <li>so I plugged it in right away and curled a few strands</li>
            <li>As long as you curl all around your head in one direction you can have a very natural effect.  </li>
            <li>I have long, natural wavy, medium thickness hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many of these irons in the past few year&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> Her hair is thicker and this worked great with her hair as well</li>
            <li> and it works great</li>
            <li> They are great when my hair will curl inbetween them, but sometimes it just won&#x27;t go in between the spirals.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> this curler is great</li>
            <li> have been searching for a spiral curling iron for a while and am so happy I made a great decision with both the price, product and seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>

            <li> it heats up really good.</li>

            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> im satisfied.</li>
            <li> We saw a hairstyle on a cute girls hairstyles website.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT styler - easy to use, and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and was packaged good.</li>
            <li> works perfect on my long hair to!</li>
            <li> After some Great customer service, I recieved a new one.</li>
            <li> lol have to buy me a new one</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li> ITS SO EASY TO USE AND WORKS WONDERS&lt;</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery</li>
            <li> I assumed my hair would swirl through this, but you just wrap your hair around it, I just don&#x27;t find it easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and takes around 3 seconds to curl a piece of your hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls, that are smooth and bouncy, AND lasting!!!!</li>
            <li> you have to use little pieces of hair and get the best curls.</li>
            <li> it is hot,very very hot!</li>
            <li> No crappy plastic to cut it out of either, it came packaged in a simple box which was great.</li>
            <li> The clamp relaxes and smoothes the rattiness and allows the whole hair to look nice.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fantastic it was here in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> but supplier asked me to keep it for free and give it a try</li>
            <li> After a month of use, there seem to be a issue with wiring, as the iron would turn off and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to turn on right a way.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for!!</li>
            <li> curls so easy and so quickly</li>
            <li> fun!&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair was going to look</li>
            <li> Works great on my niece&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li> but I actually like mine BETTER than the picture! :)</li>
            <li> Overall, the Conair Spiral Styler is awesome and I totally recommend it!! :)</li>
            <li> I think if it had higher heat temperatures it would be better.</li>
            <li> I would choose this over any other wand for beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length hair with layers and even I can use it to get the wonderful spiral look.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This curler heats up super quick &amp; works as promised--great price for this quality-would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly...</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron</li>
            <li> Perfect way to get prom curls on long and short hair.</li>
            <li> After watching some online videos, it worked the first time i tried it!</li>
            <li> hot fast&lt;br /&gt;But!</li>
            <li> I feel like a curling wand would achieve the same results much more easily.</li>
            <li> It does warm up quickly and it does have alot of different heating settings for ally types of hair.</li>
            <li> My mother has shoulder length, fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller one as a child and my girls like to use it, so bought them each one of their own.  </li>
            <li> They just fell right out.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get your hair into the right &amp;#34;grooves&amp;#34; while using it, the hair comes out with ridges in it.  </li>
            <li> I had this product before and it stopped working after about 2 years of almost daily use, I bought this one to replace it and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I used just a little heat-setting spray and took my time and had all-day curl.  </li>
            <li> So glad i bought it and would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, but it only lasts about a year, then the on switch breaks and can&#x27;t be turned on.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is tricky to use.  </li>
            <li> Plugged it in and it got hot.</li>
            <li> I imagine that it is hot</li>
            <li> The first curling iron I received was defective.</li>
            <li> I like first</li>
            <li> It works great and the curls last for a long while!</li>
            <li> But apparently its not that easy to achieve.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was brand new.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t say hot constantly shutting off, and when and if it does stay warm, the curls don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair different lengths.  </li>
            <li> This works really well on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying it unless you have a lot of time on your hands or are very into hair.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter hair, you may be able to use this item if you have help, but otherwise there&#x27;s absolutely no way</li>
            <li> Heats fast.</li>
            <li> At a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> , i can&#x27;t give it away haha</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have the time or patience to play around with it every time I need to use it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants a spiral perm look.</li>
            <li> A beaker was flipped and the whole fuse blew out for all three of our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often, but when I do it works really well.  </li>
            <li> It heated up fast and styled well UNTIL it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s shoulder length) for this to really work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my old conair spiral curling iron had died years ago and after looking at a few pictures from then I was reminded at how good mohair looked using a spiral curling iron.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than my other waving curling iron.  </li>
            <li> better than other curling irons</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to be able to use this in my short hair, but the barrel clip is much too short.</li>
            <li> The curls are fast, easy, very pretty and very long lasting!  </li>
            <li> it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that will actually curl my fine hair!</li>
            <li> The clamp is super short.</li>
            <li> and I keep hoping for decent results</li>
            <li> I love the results of this and wish I can buy the same thing in a larger dimension!</li>
            <li> dials/handle is very professional and reminds me of the more expensive brands I have looked at - for a much better price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and we are both very please with the natural look we get after running our fingers through our hair.</li>
            <li> Great purchase; works well with long, thick hair which might surprise you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough for textured hair</li>
            <li> Not that easy for short hair (Like me)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say for that low price</li>
            <li> only problem is buttons are right at grip area..</li>
            <li> BRAND NEW IN PACKAGE</li>
            <li> It is still new since it was a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> This was the exact same one and brand new</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed w this product-I sure love it!</li>
            <li> I used only the first  setting.</li>
            <li> Had an old one of these for years and couldn&#x27;t find another anywhere.</li>
            <li> This just isn&#x27;t like the old one.</li>
            <li> mines came a day early .</li>
            <li> Hair gets entangled in this rod and very time consuming hence wanted to send it back</li>
            <li> so it heats up fast, and has a temperature control to set it at different degrees depending upon your hair type.  </li>
            <li> I bought this styler for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone else and although I haven&#x27;t personally used it, I understand it works very well.</li>
            <li> That is making a statement when my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> After two months, it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> But I at least thought that this would be effective because it had a camp, albeit it a short and stubby clamp.</li>
            <li> the curl lasts a full 2 days in my slick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> so it could hold your hair when using only the right hand on your left side....</li>
            <li> Making curls is super easy and they stay in my hair which is difficult</li>
            <li> Because of the way the guides are, you can only curl your hair in certain directions, and if you&#x27;re not careful the guides will leave dents in your curl.</li>
            <li> Love that I can have loose waves or tight ringlets based on the amount of hair I curl at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use.</li>
            <li> It works ok if used properly, but the problem is that it is not easy to use properly!  </li>
            <li> Heats up in an instant and the curls last all day in my straight as a board hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very straight, fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, you can&#x27;t alternate the direction of the curl.</li>
            <li> Second of all, the curls I achieved from it, I don&#x27;t really think are any different than a regular 3/4\\&quot; barrell curling iron.  </li>
            <li> cause it look natural overall</li>
            <li> This does give some nice spiral curls, but it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> so I plugged it in right away and curled a few strands</li>
            <li> As long as you curl all around your head in one direction you can have a very natural effect.  </li>
            <li> I have long, natural wavy, medium thickness hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many of these irons in the past few year&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Makes nice curls can only do really small sections tho and take a long time to curl I have past the shoulder hair and almost to long to use</li>
            <li> Still my favorite curling iron and the only thing that will curl my thick, heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> She just got it for Christmas, we had an early one due to travel.  </li>
            <li> the part that you lift to hold the hair is only about and 1 1/2 long... maybe 2 inches...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair is long enough yet</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter loves this tool, she has very long, thick hair, but it curls it right up for her.  </li>
            <li> curling barrel not as long as I thought</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, works as I expected and holds the curl for the entire day and overnight</li>
            <li> hair does not stay wrapped around the spiral part and you certainly don&#x27;t want to get your fingers near it trying to wrap it around... useless for me</li>
            <li> The curls I created looked just like any other curl that I could have made with my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Works better than a wand on thick hair and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I do have very straight, thin hair</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve found as long as I&#x27;m careful, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> I can only get about half my head done.</li>
            <li> Typically I can count on curls lasting about an hour MAX.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is a little time consuming.</li>
            <li> my hair is thin pin straight.</li>
            <li> well just be careful while  using  this product</li>
            <li> The curls cold out weird other then that, great gift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a month but bought it 2 months ago so can&#x27;t return or replace it due to amazon&#x27;s policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still I am not very comfortable using this.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t let that put you down.</li>
            <li> It was a waterfall braid with the section that falls down in a spiral curl.</li>
            <li> The curls weren&#x27;t all that defined in some spots, and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp.  </li>
            <li> spiral curls, little effort</li>
            <li> but when I bought this my hair was a few inches shorter</li>
            <li> but this is just some reject waste of my time.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding something to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that hates holding curls, but this is the only curling iron i&#x27;ve found that gives me curls that stay in all night-</li>
            <li> She has trouble using this.</li>
            <li> but i had to destroy the packaging it was in just to</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, heavy, hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron after reading numerous positive reviews and was very disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap</li>
            <li> Wasted money!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that is impossible to curl with a normal, barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a 3 barrel waver that is way too hard.</li>
            <li> so instead of inward, you have to do it outwards), at least for me.</li>
            <li> If you have lot of hair or thick hair you should not buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> they arent tooo thick</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t usually hold curl well, but it does with this!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward with that little thing</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> I have really thick difficult to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I also have an extremely curly hairline, which is sooo annoying.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s relatively useless.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend based on the fact that they seem to have a problem with randomly ceasing to turn on.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item i have ever bought...would have sent it back</li>
            <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t hold, again, no matter the product(s) used and in an hour I have my hair up in a tie because it just looks limp and pathetic.</li>
            <li> This item is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> hate all curls go in one direction.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The curls cold out weird other then that, great gift</li>
            <li> I have never found a curling iron that works this well for my girl&#x27;s hair. The curl hold overnight even! Very happy!</li>
            <li> But I got a 1in and it too big for me I would like to have a litter one for me</li>
            <li> This curler heats up super quick &amp; works as promised--great price for this quality-would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only curling iron that will actually curl my hair and stay!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I have wanted one for years and finally ordered this one. Great price, cheaper than anything in stores. It arrived quickly and was brand new. It works quick and creates beautiful curls! The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have a button to push the spiral part up, to hold hair in place while curling. But I&#x27;ve found as long as I&#x27;m careful, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> I had one of these once that steamed your hair to help it curl, I definitely need that feature to get my hair to do anything. I would prefer a bigger curling iron instead of this one, but it works!</li>
            <li> Curls stay in soooo well! Works better than a wand on thick hair and thin hair. Bought my sister one and myself one when I saw hers worked so well!</li>
            <li> In love with this curler. Making curls is super easy and they stay in my hair which is difficult bc my hair is thin pin straight. So glad i bought it and would totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect way to get prom curls on long and short hair. I love the guiding coil.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my daughters hair.  I like the temperature setting.  I have short hair, so I am just learning on this.  I like the coiled barrel and she likes the way her hair comes out.  Overall, we like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This item is very difficult to use. I would not recommend buying it unless you have a lot of time on your hands or are very into hair.</li>
            <li> This does give some nice spiral curls, but it&#x27;s difficult to get the hang of. Because of the way the guides are, you can only curl your hair in certain directions, and if you&#x27;re not careful the guides will leave dents in your curl. As far as I can tell, you can&#x27;t alternate the direction of the curl. I have shoulder length hair and it works well, but when I bought this my hair was a few inches shorter and I couldn&#x27;t use it. If you have shorter hair, you may be able to use this item if you have help, but otherwise there&#x27;s absolutely no way you&#x27;re curling the back of your head. I feel like a curling wand would achieve the same results much more easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Heats fast.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than my other waving curling iron.  I like the way my hair looks when I use it.</li>
            <li> curling barrel not as long as I thought</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  Heats up in an instant and the curls last all day in my straight as a board hair.  At a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly...only problem is buttons are right at grip area..sometimes change setting or turn off...better than other curling irons</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap, i can&#x27;t give it away haha</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. Got a refund.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, but it only lasts about a year, then the on switch breaks and can&#x27;t be turned on. I&#x27;ve been through many of these irons in the past few year&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is tricky to use.  Especially if you have short layers.  Second of all, the curls I achieved from it, I don&#x27;t really think are any different than a regular 3/4\\&quot; barrell curling iron.  The curls weren&#x27;t all that defined in some spots, and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp.  I&#x27;d skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for a super item. Great quality and the shipping and packaging was fast. No crappy plastic to cut it out of either, it came packaged in a simple box which was great. Plugged it in and it got hot. GREAT ITEM</li>
            <li> I have fine hair different lengths.  The curls did not stay.  They just fell right out. This did not work for me.</li>
            <li> it heats up really good. I love my spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to be able to use this in my short hair, but the barrel clip is much too short. I&#x27;m sure this works perfectly for longer hair, but if you&#x27;re a short haired girl- don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for she like to curl her hair a lot and washes it every day</li>
            <li> ? makes no sense at all... the part that you lift to hold the hair is only about and 1 1/2 long... maybe 2 inches... hair does not stay wrapped around the spiral part and you certainly don&#x27;t want to get your fingers near it trying to wrap it around... useless for me</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT styler - easy to use, and works very well.  I have really long hair and it doesn&#x27;t usually hold curl well, but it does with this!  Some of the reviews mentioned difficulty with using it, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues at all, just lots of compliments!  Love it!</li>
            <li> good quality and works great</li>
            <li> I use this time to time. If you have lot of hair or thick hair you should not buy. It takes me over and hour to do my hair. And if you don&#x27;t get the hair on the iron correct you will have crimps in your hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and was packaged good. Had an old one of these for years and couldn&#x27;t find another anywhere. This was the exact same one and brand new</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old conair spiral curling iron had died years ago and after looking at a few pictures from then I was reminded at how good mohair looked using a spiral curling iron. This just isn&#x27;t like the old one. The clamp is super short. Maybe some people can use that well. It&#x27;s probably those same obnoxious people who got the hair styling people away from using clamps at all and replaced all the spiral curling irons with bubble irons that are entirely clamp-less. My hair is course and even with brushing or combing and product and trims it is still all ratty at the ends. The clamp relaxes and smoothes the rattiness and allows the whole hair to look nice. But I at least thought that this would be effective because it had a camp, albeit it a short and stubby clamp. It&#x27;s awkward with that little thing and it&#x27;s relatively useless. Then there&#x27;s the heat. I imagine that it is hot but it just doesn&#x27;t control my hair well. Again, I had a great one from Conair but this is just some reject waste of my time. The curl doesn&#x27;t hold, again, no matter the product(s) used and in an hour I have my hair up in a tie because it just looks limp and pathetic. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and I keep hoping for decent results but it just doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Curling iron works great.</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron tx u guys have the best stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago for my thick wavy hair. It works great and the curls last for a long while!</li>
            <li> Kind of neat to do to your hair  fun!&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Gives the best curls! Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Purchased because a co-worker recommended.  It works ok if used properly, but the problem is that it is not easy to use properly!  If you don&#x27;t get your hair into the right &amp;#34;grooves&amp;#34; while using it, the hair comes out with ridges in it.  Don&#x27;t really have the time or patience to play around with it every time I need to use it.</li>
            <li> This does great curling your hair the different levels of heat are great and they tell you what heat settings you need for the type of hair you have which was great.  My hair is thin so it took a lower heat but the curls were perfect spirals better than anything else I have tried.  I had bought it for my daughter and for her prom.  Her hair is thicker and this worked great with her hair as well and the curl seemed to have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair was going to look but, once I got a quarter of my hair done, I could tell it was going to look really good!  I have long, very straight, fine hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long.  Surprisingly, I used just a little heat-setting spray and took my time and had all-day curl.  I am impressed and look forward to using again for a &#x27;fun&#x27; hair day.</li>
            <li> I love styling my hair and so I decided to buy one of these. I love it! It heats up quick and it makes the curls so beautiful. I can curl almost all my hair within like 30 minutes. Glad I bought it! :)</li>
            <li> nice iron though when will they ever make one for left handed or even reversible??? hate all curls go in one direction.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I had this product before and it stopped working after about 2 years of almost daily use, I bought this one to replace it and so far, so good. Still my favorite curling iron and the only thing that will curl my thick, heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: My second one of these curling irons stopped working shortly after I bought it, and a third stopped working almost immediately. I would not recommend based on the fact that they seem to have a problem with randomly ceasing to turn on.</li>
            <li> I use this just like I would a wand - wrap the hair around it.  The curls are fast, easy, very pretty and very long lasting!  I would choose this over any other wand for beautiful curls.  I have never nor will I ever try to make actual spiral curls with this styler - but its perfect for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the last one that we finally wore out after several years!  Love this product for making spiral curls...it is the only one I&#x27;ve found that will actually curl my fine hair!</li>
            <li> i love this thing!!! it makes perfect curls!! they arent tooo thick and i love it!!! so happy&#x27; its a great buy!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. Perfect for her and her hair style. Easy to handle and use.  The .75 diameter was what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Chose this product for the great price and it works great!  The shipping was fantastic it was here in a couple of days.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a spiral perm look.</li>
            <li> The first curling iron I received was defective. A beaker was flipped and the whole fuse blew out for all three of our bathrooms. After some Great customer service, I recieved a new one. This works great and everyone loved my curls. Ships fast. I ordered it on a Sunday night and it came in Thursday. Whoever I was emailing at the company either didn&#x27;t speak much English, or just didn&#x27;t care about grammar and spelling. So beware if you have to contact the company.</li>
            <li> mines came a day early . you have to use little pieces of hair and get the best curls. ilove the different heat options . also it has a rotating cord so it wont bend or twist at the bottom of the iron</li>
            <li> Hair gets entangled in this rod and very time consuming hence wanted to send it back but supplier asked me to keep it for free and give it a try but still I am not very comfortable using this.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift.  Recipient is very happy!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Exactly what I was hoping for!! Perfect spiral curls and heats up super fast!! Great price too!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING.. BRAND NEW IN PACKAGE</li>
            <li> This product works well if you want spiral curls.  It has an on/off switch which also has a turbo heat setting so it heats up fast, and has a temperature control to set it at different degrees depending upon your hair type.  I don&#x27;t use it very often, but when I do it works really well.  The price was also really good, which was what made me buy it.</li>
            <li> Great warms up quickly</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding something to curl my hair. I love the results of this and wish I can buy the same thing in a larger dimension! love, love, love</li>
            <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON&lt;br /&gt;1.) ITS CHEAPE&lt;br /&gt;2.) ITS SO EASY TO USE AND WORKS WONDERS&lt;br /&gt;it curls so easy and so quickly and the rod that it comes with makes sure every peice of hair get curled and no hair overlaps.... All in all&lt;br /&gt;IN LOVE!! BEST CURLING IRON IVE TRIED!!</li>
            <li> This was a great curler, just what I was looking for! It heated up fast and styled well UNTIL it just stopped working. I&#x27;ve used it a month but bought it 2 months ago so can&#x27;t return or replace it due to amazon&#x27;s policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the money on a good curler, unless you want to risk that it will just stop working all together.</li>
            <li> Its OK I guess..I like first but it&#x27;s OK...</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery and it works great</li>
            <li> Great purchase; works well with long, thick hair which might surprise you.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works way better than some of my pricier irons. Thank you for this iron.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using this product.  The curls I created looked just like any other curl that I could have made with my regular curling iron.  Maybe I just need some practice, but who has time?</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the look it gives her and is very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that hates holding curls, but this is the only curling iron i&#x27;ve found that gives me curls that stay in all night- and my hair is still curled when i wake up the next morning after sleeping on it! the only problem is the spirals- they are a blessing and a curse. They are great when my hair will curl inbetween them, but sometimes it just won&#x27;t go in between the spirals.</li>
            <li> She has trouble using this. Wasted money!</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. Product as described.Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Actually stays in all day.  I just have a problem with my left hand.  Don&#x27;t know how to use on that side.  It should have something so it could hold your hair when using only the right hand on your left side....&lt;br /&gt;I probably just need to learn how to use on opposite side...</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter loves this tool, she has very long, thick hair, but it curls it right up for her.  She just got it for Christmas, we had an early one due to travel.  :)</li>
            <li> Used it last night and it looks like it will require practice before i get the look i&#x27;m going for,but i did get some curls. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much but it gets very hot and works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair is long enough yet (it&#x27;s shoulder length) for this to really work well on my hair.  However, I will save it and continue to try it in the future.  I do have very straight, thin hair and it is held into place nicely by the clamp.  I also like the fact that it has an adjustable dial to control the heat.</li>
            <li> this curler is great it takes sometime to get used to how to work it but don&#x27;t let that put you down. It is a very good curler and it makes the perfect curls</li>
            <li> I love this spiral iron! I have thick, medium length hair with layers and even I can use it to get the wonderful spiral look. I sectioned my hair and it took about 15 mins to do. It is somewhat tricky to get the hang of the clasp. I have a 3 barrel waver that is way too hard. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed w this product-I sure love it!</li>
            <li> Makes nice curls can only do really small sections tho and take a long time to curl I have past the shoulder hair and almost to long to use</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for my two daughters.  They LOVE them and so do I.  I had a smaller one as a child and my girls like to use it, so bought them each one of their own.  This is better than mine.  We love these!</li>
            <li> Works great on my niece&#x27;s long hair.  She is very happy with this gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron it works so well on my hair and all of my friends hair so yeah(:</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! works perfect on my long hair to!(:</li>
            <li> it does not work, plugged it in and nothing</li>
            <li> I assumed my hair would swirl through this, but you just wrap your hair around it, I just don&#x27;t find it easy to use</li>
            <li> well just be careful while  using  this product it is hot,very very hot! I used only the first  setting.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and I can finally get the look I want without having to wait for someone else to do it for me. A great find  from my favorite shopping place-------amazon.com!!!</li>
            <li> The color as not the same as the picture (my barrel is gold and not gray like the pic) but I actually like mine BETTER than the picture! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a bag, not the box in picture - but that is stated in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so I plugged it in right away and curled a few strands and it is GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dials/handle is very professional and reminds me of the more expensive brands I have looked at - for a much better price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a spiral curling iron for a while and am so happy I made a great decision with both the price, product and seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it wasn&#x27;t bedtime so I could curl my whole head now...but looking forward to making my hair look awesome in the morning! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Great price, shipped fast, works well.</li>
            <li> Leave it in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this is the second.  i liked it a lot. spiral curls, little effort</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. excellent quality.</li>
            <li> so awesome and it is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful spiral to make your hair looks as curly as you want. It is easy to use and takes around 3 seconds to curl a piece of your hair. I have used it several times and still very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this styler for my 13 year old daughter.  She likes it and it does a good job.  She would had only wished that it didn&#x27;t have the clip at the end of the wand.</li>
            <li> So I got this product expecting perfect bouncy curls. But apparently its not that easy to achieve. I have really thick difficult to manage hair. I&#x27;ve been playing around with this for about 2 weeks and I think I&#x27;m starting to get it. You have to curl the iron in reverse (so instead of inward, you have to do it outwards), at least for me. I still haven&#x27;t managed to get the curls I want from it. I can only get about half my head done. It does warm up quickly and it does have alot of different heating settings for ally types of hair.</li>
            <li> For years, the only thing i used to get curls was the Caruso Molecular Steam curler, which is still a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product, in my opinion. I bought the Spiral Styler with some apprehension, since i am a klutz at styling. I could not see how that tiny clip works. After watching some online videos, it worked the first time i tried it! Beautiful curls, that are smooth and bouncy, AND lasting!!!! the curl lasts a full 2 days in my slick, straight hair. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> its all that ill ever need, I am not the type of person who has all the time in the world to doll myself up and this one works like magic and it curl instantly, stays all day and ive been getting compliments cause it look natural overall im satisfied.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough for textured hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product&lt;br /&gt;Getting hot fast&lt;br /&gt;But! Not that easy for short hair (Like me)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say for that low price...... Take it&lt;br /&gt;Will do the job. put some hairspray after you curl it cause it won&#x27;t hold forever without it</li>
            <li> Great iron for my pre-teen.  She had some friends over and they all did spiral curls.  Easy to use and it looks good.</li>
            <li> My grnddaughter likes it well enough.  It is still new since it was a Christmas gift and she needs to practice with it to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone else and although I haven&#x27;t personally used it, I understand it works very well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it.  She has used it several times and says it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this!! I have thick, wavy hair that is impossible to curl with a normal, barrel curling iron. I also have an extremely curly hairline, which is sooo annoying. This curling iron made beautiful, spiral curls in my hair and it looks awesome!! The only thing is it is a little time consuming. It took me about an hour to do, so I would not use this on my hair before school, work, etc. Also, I sometimes have to guide my hair while twirling it up the curling iron. Overall, the Conair Spiral Styler is awesome and I totally recommend it!! :)</li>
            <li> Love that I can have loose waves or tight ringlets based on the amount of hair I curl at a time.  As long as you curl all around your head in one direction you can have a very natural effect.  I have long, natural wavy, medium thickness hair.  My mother has shoulder length, fine, straight hair and we are both very please with the natural look we get after running our fingers through our hair.</li>
            <li> great deal got it for myself and my grand daughter took it from me lol have to buy me a new one</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it. Took her a bit of practice to get the hang of using it but her hair looks great and shes happy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron after reading numerous positive reviews and was very disappointed in the product.  It won&#x27;t say hot constantly shutting off, and when and if it does stay warm, the curls don&#x27;t last.  That is making a statement when my hair is naturally curly and I simply use an iron occasionally for texture.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it. Her hair looks really nice when she goes to school. Easy to use. It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, heavy, hard to curl hair. Typically I can count on curls lasting about an hour MAX. This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Curls lasted all night and even when I woke up the next morning.</li>
            <li> This is the worst item i have ever bought...would have sent it back but i had to destroy the packaging it was in just to&lt;br /&gt;open it up....i checked this item &amp; they said it would work with short hair...well it does not...the clip is way too short..&lt;br /&gt;I am going to just throw it out...</li>
            <li> After a month of use, there seem to be a issue with wiring, as the iron would turn off and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to turn on right a way.  It was hit or miss to whether it would work or not.  After two months, it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, works as I expected and holds the curl for the entire day and overnight</li>
            <li> I do like it, but it takes a lot of time. I think if it had higher heat temperatures it would be better.</li>
            <li> We saw a hairstyle on a cute girls hairstyles website. It was a waterfall braid with the section that falls down in a spiral curl. The person doing the hair said she used this to create the spiral curls and showed it pressing the curls together. This does not have the \\&quot;curl press\\&quot; - keep looking on here if you want that feature!</li>
