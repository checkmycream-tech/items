            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not so happy about this purchase decision.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re welcome, shark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pens work great and they are so convenient.  </li>
            <li>Women customers know this is a fairly routine procedure for brush on cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>this is helpful and the problem can be corrected, because it is a good product when the pens have the product inside.</li>
            <li>oh so right LOL!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I forget to use as often as I should.  </li>
            <li>It seems ok though, but to rate it fairly will have to try more often</li>
            <li>So easy and it bleached my discolored fillings as well as my teeth!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy in stores any more so was very glad to fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will end up in the ocean one day</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t turned too many turns when the brush/cap blew off as if something had been stopped up &amp; all the product inside shot out on the counter top &amp; my clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I had been so pleased with the product when it happened to me before the ULTA incident I thought I had just used it all up and threw it away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the product was OK.</li>
            <li>Best results of all similar products.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>this is a good product,  it is priceless effectively and affordably it works it does brighten up my smile and my teeth everyday</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the GoSmile touchup Pods, but figured I&#x27;d give this less-expensive, seemingly easier option a try.  </li>
            <li>The product looks very well made and the pen has a very sleek metallic design that not only looks great, but works great as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest White strips which work, but are a hassle to do &amp; are gross lol!!</li>
            <li>But I used this &amp; not only did it whiten my teeth really well, but it&#x27;s way more convient to use!!</li>
            <li>Please let me know how I can get my money back for this defective product - because even though I know life isn&#x27;t fair, I really shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My Amazon account shows that this is rated as a hazardous product &amp; can&#x27;t be shipped back</li>

            <li>The solution takes forever to come to the bristles....not really worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick and efficient with no mess !</li>
            <li>One of the pens I was only able to use once</li>
            <li>I received the package and opened the first pen.  </li>
            <li>I patiently turned watching the brush closely for the first signs of product.</li>
            <li>Amazon should be aware of the problem by now, but I see that it is still being offered.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the top popped off.  </li>
            <li>your better off using baking soda or a different product.</li>
            <li>I use Go Smile products regularly, and I was glad to see them develop a new product that made it even easier to use when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews which echo my own experience which is that the pens do not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I carefully followed the instructions where it says to twist the bottom so the solution comes out at the top.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s wayyyyy too much work, so</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the liquid inside because both of the pens are so defective it prevented their use.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Two pens for 25 dollars is a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Go Smile single use delivery system for quite sometime now, but this is the first to try these whitening pens.  </li>
            <li>Well in that case, I&#x27;ll continue my story in this little text box where I&#x27;m free to tell my tale of teeth-whitening woe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>So, now the bent bristles are surrounded by scotch tape  holding the bristles straight &amp; the pen cap back on.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it helps whiten and doesn&#x27;t taste terrible.it is expensive but has good but ungrammatical results.</li>
            <li>The only complain I have is that my teeth felt a bit sensitive after each application.</li>
            <li>I am usually a fan of Go Smile products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly reasonable person most of the time, so I figured hey, maybe I got a bad one - and pulled out the second.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mediocre &amp; you can&#x27;t even really tell that it makes much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about sensitivity because my teeth can be somewhat sensitive</li>

            <li> I think they are a bit expensive but definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Received product quickly but both pens had stiff bristles and product was dried up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t attempt to use this because even it the product flows out evenly, it will run in several other directions than my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just writing this to advise other customers of the potential for pen defects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry..</li>
            <li> I bought these in Nov but didn&#x27;t open them until today as some other dental bleach I had lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken yet, but I&#x27;ve only used the second pen twice so far.</li>
            <li> but I was careful,</li>
            <li> and it too was empty and one of the parts of the pen while they were turning it as directed to get it started</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the other pen, but do have to turn it a lot of times for the gel to go to the tip.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use it due to that,</li>
            <li> went flying over their counter onto the floor luckily not hitting anybody.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Not that you could really mess that step up...</li>
            <li> Was unable to use and am unable to return defective item back due to return policy on this type of product, which I don&#x27;t recall being aware of when I made my pruchase.  </li>
            <li> I opened it &amp; the cap had been placed with quite a few brush bristles bent out &amp; down.</li>
            <li> JUST HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seemed like they were dried up??</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Tried in the past and still not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also past the return window.</li>
            <li> Following the directions on the package, I twisted the bottom to release the liquid into the brush.  </li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works!  </li>
            <li> Is that so hard for your pre-programmed messages to understand?</li>
            <li> The bristles were hard as a rock and no gel would come out.</li>
            <li> so some shark will probably get the really white teeth I so desperately wanted and paid for.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> And twisted.</li>
            <li> And twisted.  </li>
            <li> It tastes bad and burns my gums.  </li>
            <li> of them I turned the base as instructed, you can hear &amp; feel the clicks.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> Easy to use, quick and efficient with no mess !</li>
            <li> I USED A TEETH WHITENING TOOTHPASTE DAILY ALONG WITH THE WHITENING PEN AND IT WORKS!  JUST HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE AND YOU WILL SEE RESULTS!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews which echo my own experience which is that the pens do not work very well.  One of the pens I was only able to use once and then it stopped working.  I&#x27;m still using the other pen, but do have to turn it a lot of times for the gel to go to the tip.  It hasn&#x27;t broken yet, but I&#x27;ve only used the second pen twice so far.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it helps whiten and doesn&#x27;t taste terrible.it is expensive but has good but ungrammatical results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry.. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it..</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the GoSmile touchup Pods, but figured I&#x27;d give this less-expensive, seemingly easier option a try.  I received the package and opened the first pen.  I carefully followed the instructions where it says to twist the bottom so the solution comes out at the top. (Not that you could really mess that step up... but I was careful, nonetheless.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with the product is, you can twist away for hours - but nothing ever comes out!  I&#x27;m a fairly reasonable person most of the time, so I figured hey, maybe I got a bad one - and pulled out the second.  It does the same thing!  Now, I&#x27;m not so happy about this purchase decision.  I then tried to &amp;#34;replace or return&amp;#34; on Amazon and it says you &amp;#34;can&#x27;t send this product back&amp;#34; and loops me to &amp;#34;Continue Shopping&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t want to continue shopping, Amazon - I want my money back.  Is that so hard for your pre-programmed messages to understand? Oh, It is? Well in that case, I&#x27;ll continue my story in this little text box where I&#x27;m free to tell my tale of teeth-whitening woe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to know the kicker that made my day? There&#x27;s no way to contact the seller. So ultimately, the only way I&#x27;m going to get to test this product is if I saw the tube open and apply the solution with a Q-tip or something.  But that&#x27;s wayyyyy too much work, so it&#x27;s going in the trash...and I&#x27;m sure it will end up in the ocean one day so some shark will probably get the really white teeth I so desperately wanted and paid for. You&#x27;re welcome, shark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: If you want a product that actually functions - skip this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SELLER:  Please let me know how I can get my money back for this defective product - because even though I know life isn&#x27;t fair, I really shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am usually a fan of Go Smile products. I bought these in Nov but didn&#x27;t open them until today as some other dental bleach I had lasted longer than I expected. I can&#x27;t really speak to the liquid inside because both of the pens are so defective it prevented their use.&lt;br /&gt;One of them I turned the base as instructed, you can hear &amp; feel the clicks. I patiently turned watching the brush closely for the first signs of product. Women customers know this is a fairly routine procedure for brush on cosmetics.  I hadn&#x27;t turned too many turns when the brush/cap blew off as if something had been stopped up &amp; all the product inside shot out on the counter top &amp; my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I thought, I&#x27;ve got the second pen. I opened it &amp; the cap had been placed with quite a few brush bristles bent out &amp; down. I didn&#x27;t attempt to use this because even it the product flows out evenly, it will run in several other directions than my teeth. I don&#x27;t want a bunch of this any where but on my teeth, it&#x27;s a bleaching agent. So, now the bent bristles are surrounded by scotch tape  holding the bristles straight &amp; the pen cap back on. Hopefully, after a week or so, the bent bristles will have been straightened &amp; I can use the 2nd pen.  My Amazon account shows that this is rated as a hazardous product &amp; can&#x27;t be shipped back and it&#x27;s also past the return window. I understand that, that&#x27; on me. I usually open &amp; use my orders sooner. I like Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just writing this to advise other customers of the potential for pen defects.</li>
            <li> this is a good product,  it is priceless effectively and affordably it works it does brighten up my smile and my teeth everyday</li>
            <li> Received product quickly but both pens had stiff bristles and product was dried up.  Was unable to use and am unable to return defective item back due to return policy on this type of product, which I don&#x27;t recall being aware of when I made my pruchase.  Very disappointed and I am out $25.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be aware of the problem by now, but I see that it is still being offered.  I had been using this product for over a year (buying it from Amazon or my local ULTA store until about Oct. 2013) when the pens from both places came with no product in the pens.  ULTA took mine back and gave me another which they opened and tried it for me and it too was empty and one of the parts of the pen while they were turning it as directed to get it started went flying over their counter onto the floor luckily not hitting anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had been so pleased with the product when it happened to me before the ULTA incident I thought I had just used it all up and threw it away.  If I had known about the problem I would have sent it back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful and the problem can be corrected, because it is a good product when the pens have the product inside.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the price but I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s mediocre &amp; you can&#x27;t even really tell that it makes much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about sensitivity because my teeth can be somewhat sensitive but I didn&#x27;t have any issues. That was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product was OK. Not great.</li>
            <li> I ordered these &amp;#34;Go Smile On The Go Teeth Whitening Pens&amp;#34; and when I received them, BOTH of the pens did not work. The bristles were hard as a rock and no gel would come out. Seemed like they were dried up?? I checked for an expiration date but nothing was listed on the box. I tried to return them but Amazon would not accept my return.</li>
            <li> Have used this product in the daily form for years and now have the pen to carry with me.  Best results of all similar products.</li>
            <li> I just got around to using this product.  Following the directions on the package, I twisted the bottom to release the liquid into the brush.  And twisted. And twisted.  Finally, the top popped off.  I tried the second pen.  The brush fell off and the liquid oozed out.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The pen doesn&#x27;t twist anything onto the brush tip and you also can&#x27;t return to Amazon...what a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The solution takes forever to come to the bristles....not really worth the wait.  Tried in the past and still not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> it does not wok as well as you would like. your better off using baking soda or a different product.</li>
            <li> I use Go Smile products regularly, and I was glad to see them develop a new product that made it even easier to use when you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> This product does work. I use it after my Arm&amp;Hammer whitening toothpaste. My teeth look white and oh so right LOL!</li>
            <li> Been using the pen for a week now and already see results! The product looks very well made and the pen has a very sleek metallic design that not only looks great, but works great as well. Two pens for 25 dollars is a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I forget to use as often as I should.  It seems ok though, but to rate it fairly will have to try more often</li>
            <li> So easy and it bleached my discolored fillings as well as my teeth!  The taste isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works!  Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> The pens work great and they are so convenient.  I think they are a bit expensive but definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Go Smile single use delivery system for quite sometime now, but this is the first to try these whitening pens.  My teeth seemed to get whiter.  The only complain I have is that my teeth felt a bit sensitive after each application.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy in stores any more so was very glad to fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White strips which work, but are a hassle to do &amp; are gross lol!! But I used this &amp; not only did it whiten my teeth really well, but it&#x27;s way more convient to use!! I paint it on at night &amp; then brush my teeth in the morning with noticeable difference!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  It tastes bad and burns my gums.  I don&#x27;t want to use it due to that, so I don&#x27;t even know if it actually works.</li>
