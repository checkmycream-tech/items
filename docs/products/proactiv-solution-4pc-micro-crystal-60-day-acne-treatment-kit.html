            <li>It&#x27;s so far very good product.</li>
            <li>I love ordering Proactive from Amazon because I don&#x27;t have join the Proactive club.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this stuff.</li>
            <li>When I saw a many ads for Proactiv, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>They made me think my acne could get better if I bought the product.</li>
            <li>However, it is a risky treatment with many side effects.</li>
            <li>i love proactive and it works.</li>
            <li>:) would buy again when supply runs out</li>
            <li>Of course I love proactive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had combination skin, leaning more towards oily.</li>
            <li>for sure</li>
            <li>You will love it too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended it highly to many friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>most skin care wont do it all</li>
            <li>He was pleased to avoid a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for clearing skin and maintaining same.</li>
            <li>AND THEY REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li>had many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it did not irritate my skin, however, I don&#x27;t believe that it works miracles.  </li>
            <li>and so I bought this kit and like magic</li>
            <li>I have my skin back under control (to the best of my ability)</li>
            <li>(it would just make my skin more oily)</li>
            <li>I used to love proactiv.</li>
            <li>I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has been very impressed with this Proactive acne treatment kit.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time love love love</li>
            <li>Glad to not have this monthly bill now.</li>
            <li>it  love love love</li>
            <li>know friend who use it and love it...just not for my skin i guess.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it after the hundreds of commercials on tv, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it got in just 5 days.</li>
            <li>very happy with product; Teenagers have breakouts during their teen years;  </li>
            <li>For $20 or 30 a month your better off going to Macys and buying their beauty supplies</li>
            <li>OK, I saw the infomercials and saw the hype and tried every OTC product instead.  </li>
            <li>My face is looking better.</li>
            <li>Even washing you face with anything will take some time:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying the results.  </li>
            <li>This way I can control when I pay for and receive more product (I don&#x27;t need more every month)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>so I guess its ok.</li>
            <li>My skin is flaking off and I have more acne.</li>
            <li>Have been using proactive for many years.</li>
            <li>One of the better products i have ever came across...</li>
            <li>I love the product and it has cleared my completion.</li>
            <li>My sister was suffering from break outs and wasn&#x27;t able to control them.  </li>
            <li>With Proactiv she is able to control her acne without going to the doctor for a prescription.  </li>
            <li>Most times she has it longer than 60 days.  </li>
            <li>Highly satisfied with product and the timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied with this purchase and seller… Thank you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheaper than buying off the site because you get more</li>
            <li>I love the product and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>My acne look already better in 4 days</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to be seen with no makeup because my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and very effective.</li>
            <li>I had always enjoyed perfectly beautiful and clear skin until I turned forty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They put on a pretty good show about their product, and show some convincing evidence.</li>
            <li>My daughter used Proactive throughout High School and her skin always looked great.  </li>
            <li>For those of us with normal skin, it is great for clearing of blemishes and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this because it makes my complexion look pretty darn good for 63.</li>
            <li>want your skin to be beautiful and be natural without makeup or hiding yourself buy this.</li>
            <li>Product cleared my grand daughter&#x27;s skin easily.</li>
            <li>but the youthful problem continues to win the battle, but so far we have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>, it works great but doesn&#x27;t take ten minutes to rinse off, the toner astringent, number 2, is nice also.  </li>
            <li>They say it works great, and helps clear up their face!</li>
            <li>Be SURE to read all the fine print.</li>
            <li>many reviews will tell you, there is nothing special about this product, and it boasts ingredients found in most drugstore formulas.</li>
            <li>There are ton of better options available on amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the milder formula works for sensitive skin now, Proactiv didn&#x27;t fair well for my best friends fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love that my daughters have beautiful skin again and have their confidence back!</li>
            <li>and my skin does look fresh and nice.  </li>
            <li>Seems to improve grand daughter&#x27;s face significantly.</li>
            <li>and he said it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I believe this product was to strong for my skin type</li>
            <li>quite frankly I think after a week usage of this product that it is to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>Proactiv is a complete line of effective acne treatments!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product if you have normal skin...</li>
            <li>I really liked this at first because my acne was severe.</li>
            <li>It works great and keeps my skin clear and clean.  </li>
            <li>After a week of use it cleared up my forehead and has been fine ever since</li>
            <li>excellent product, in less than three weeks is beginning to see the benefits of using it.</li>
            <li>Super product!  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle on the face and the toner I feel does the magic!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad we tried this product first!  </li>
            <li>Of course you should follow the steps, and it takes a little time out of your day, but if you want a perfect complexion, it might take some time.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using this product for five days now, and it is already making a huge difference for her.</li>
            <li>Works great, I just wanted  to say Thank You for bringing back my smooth skin.</li>
            <li>, the mask makes a huge differece.</li>
            <li>I swear on Acne Free.</li>
            <li>Something you only use once or twice per week cannot have that huge of an impact on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;You are better off saving your money for products that are more affordable yet still effective.</li>
            <li>Although it WAS NOT 2 months worth of treatment like the description said it would be, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>FREE TV time// cause what kid would say  NO to free TV time  and to be on MTV commercials.  </li>
            <li>The product itself was great new formula, and nice big sizes!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, and mild at the same time.  </li>
            <li>not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is a bunch of rich greedy bastids imo.</li>
            <li>I originally started using proactiv when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for a long time now, it works great on my skin, takes care of my problematic acne including cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>It Was Worth Buying !</li>
            <li>Wish it come with original box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in their complexions when they are using this item</li>
            <li>, she is excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I am so far very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, I still had two sets of the original formula in my cosmetic arsenal.  </li>
            <li>It worked a perfectly as it did over the past 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teenager is happy with the product and it does not burn and cause dry spots.</li>
            <li>Clean skin</li>
            <li>amazing product, cleaned up all the acne and now I have soft radiant clear skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I had to use special reaction cream and medicine for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never needed special face stuff until after 35----I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and smooth right after use.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had problems since she was 15 and her acne hasn&#x27;t really gotten any better.</li>
            <li>i love this idea every one wants to know where i got the&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, works good definitely recommend</li>
            <li>this was not such a good product for my face, am disappoint with the outcome.</li>
            <li>It all depends on how much your complexion means to you:)</li>
            <li>But True, Folks .</li>
            <li>I  bought this for my daughter, I only hope it works as good as everyone says it is</li>
            <li>Skin got worse before better but its clearing up now :] Came in great condition and had no problem using the products.</li>
            <li>kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once again enjoyed clear, smooth, and blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li>Came sealed, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Never a problem and received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with pimples and acne since second grade ( I am 53 now) and have tried many many otc products as well as prescriptions and NOTHING has cleared my skin up like proactive products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how lucky I am for buying this product.  </li>
            <li>OR you will always run out of toner and have to buy more toner or more lotion but still have something left over  </li>
            <li>Just keep in mind to get the benefits of using it you have to use an adequate amount of each product.</li>
            <li>Not to mention all the free extras the gave me with my first order</li>
            <li>When I got this email to rate this product I saw the expiration date and wasn&#x27;t aware when ordering that information was available.  </li>
            <li>it works good as long as you use it once a day.</li>
            <li>recommended the product to several of my high school students over the years, and I have seen their skin greatly improve.  </li>
            <li>THE SHELF LIFE IS MORE THAN 4 MONTHS ON A NEW PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The results so far are amazing, and exactly what I had hoped for her.</li>
            <li>So, while I recommend the product, I also recommend not using your good towels to dry your face and hands.</li>
            <li>It  worked very quickly and within a week his complexion was very improved</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this would help a younger person or teenager with their acne, but it sure cured mine!</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what it said it would be!</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li>love this so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective, I am starting to forget that I ever had acne problems.</li>
            <li>My acne is almost completely gone and the texture of my skin is very smooth now.</li>
            <li>This was a great starter kit for anyone who is interested in Pro Active.</li>
            <li>I am seeing the effects of using it already thanks for making that product available to people like me.</li>
            <li>what I paid for(a 60 day supply about $42 free shipping if I can recall), which alot of people seem to think this is a 30 day supply when those are REALLY the 2 oz bottles so that&#x27;s cleared.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day now and it is still effective.  </li>
            <li>Still, we are happy with the results so far and it is worth it to see the added confidence my son has in just this short period to time.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son is using and have not yet seen any improvements after about a month, hoping maybe with more time it will start.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have severe acne, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>you have to use it twice a day and the mask is really worth it.</li>
            <li>this is not 2 months worth of product, its one, do not buy.</li>
            <li>The same is not even effective.</li>
            <li>Spendy but worth it</li>
            <li>The proactiv arrived on time, liked the packaging, not a lot of extra plastic to it.</li>
            <li>This is NOT two months worth of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this more than any other acne product.</li>
            <li>oh that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>it takes a while for you to find the right amount to use and for it to work, but it will help a lot.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li>Okay I am 17 and have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>, I now once again  feel a lot more confidence too socialize, due to this referral I stated using the Artistry microdermabrasion system that have my face super smooth, these products rocks, you can click or copy</li>
            <li>product is for people who probably have barely any breakouts and just needs an OKAY cleaner.</li>
            <li>All i need now is a good dark spot corrector</li>
            <li>and I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t actually be the true product, but it was!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;THIS IS NOT THE NEW ADVANCED FORMULA.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a single pimple since starting and skin is bright and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I fell for the same marketing scam that probably most Proactive users are victim to.</li>
            <li>Not only was my skin clean, but the texture was unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It began to help the first time I used</li>
            <li>the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li>When she went off to her first year of college</li>
            <li>Upon your first purchase, you basically get signed up for a \\&quot;membership\\&quot;</li>
            <li>MUCH needed in our household!</li>
            <li>I have had so many issues with the actual Proactiv company before, they have charged me constantly for a membership that I did not want and kept sending me more treatments when I did not want them.</li>
            <li>This happened to me twice, I should have learned the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I Ordered.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked well at first, but like everything else we have tried it seems to stop working after a while.  </li>
            <li>I considered taking my son to a Dermatologist first</li>
            <li>For those who have ordered (or are planning to order) from the Proactiv website or by phone, please be aware: once you purchase the first kit, they will keep your credit card information and bill you every month at a higher cost.</li>
            <li>i did it like three times the first week</li>
            <li>Well, we received our first shipment the end of October and he used it for the first 30 days...</li>
            <li>After just 2 days of using EXACTLY how the directions explain</li>
            <li>Now I am on Proactiv Plus and overall it is soooooo much better.</li>
            <li>No i bet you proactive most likely</li>
            <li>Most likely Proactiv is expired already but hiding the fact.  </li>
            <li>The revitalizing tone seems more alcohol than the last one. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>I really do regret using it!</li>
            <li>that just perpetuate your problem so you keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>This face treatment is exactly as said.  </li>
            <li>At work my boss told she wants to buy it for her daughter!</li>
            <li>First time using Proactiv</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and was what I ordered but will not use this product again!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i cant say if he uses the product exactly as intended&lt;br /&gt;his</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered and came on time.</li>
            <li>It really Works!</li>
            <li>It is a great product the consistently of the cream is not too thick or watery.</li>
            <li>I have tried a plethora of acne treatments for the mild to medium breakouts I&#x27;ve had since high school.</li>
            <li>I will stay with the original formula as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>The other stuff is kind of ehhh, it doesn&#x27;t really give me that tingle that tells me it&#x27;s working, but it could just be me!</li>
            <li>I get better results using alcohol pads such as Clean and Clear from Walgreens.</li>
            <li>It may cost a little more than buying from the proactiv website but as I make it last longer than 2 months, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more each time</li>
            <li>This helps keep her clean and clear.</li>
            <li>for acne, i use the Neutrogena rapid clean and clear toner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed and clear.</li>
            <li>It will change your face with a clean and soft face.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is a good product for younger adults possibly up to 50 after that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Proactive helps my skin a bit, but I have not experienced the great success that others claim to have had when using this line of products.</li>
            <li>Adult acne is now more manageable and easier to deal with because my skin is clear and supple to the touch</li>
            <li>He quickly achieved positive results and has ordered a new supply.  </li>
            <li>My dark spots have lightened and I feel amazing.</li>
            <li>but thats because they want your money first and fast</li>
            <li>First day I use it my skin very itchy,the foam hurt my skin.i</li>
            <li>Easy and simple and sent me a personalized note!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated it so much and will definitely purchase from Terri again :)</li>
            <li>For me being a 20 year old African American woman with very sensitive skin, this works best for me so far.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has had longstanding acne, particularly severe acne, knows how embarrassing it is and how it can really affect your self esteem negatively, especially if your acne is mostly on your face, as mine was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember when this first came out, it was way much stronger and worked much faster.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that the product was less effective, smelled different, and the texture was significantly</li>
            <li>Since I have started using these products I have really noticed a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these products to anyone who wants healthier looking skin without paying a fortune to get it.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>If you really want to treat your acne you need to balance your skin out.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing, moisturizing and treatment are what is needed to get results not this junk.</li>
            <li>This has given my son so much confidence</li>
            <li>WORKS VERY</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really loves this product.</li>
            <li>This really does work as they say it does.</li>
            <li>Keeps acne from flaring up to much, but no means has gotten rid of it.</li>
            <li>Really does work.</li>
            <li>and it proved it really does work.</li>
            <li>and it really did work.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was very unsure if this product was going to do anything.</li>
            <li>It really does the job for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>Works fast.  </li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>Fast and product was as promised.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nothing else I used  did a whole lot for my acne, some were quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t sign up unless you have lots of free time and want to spend hours on hold and talking to different customer service people who don&#x27;t know how to do their job.</li>
            <li>Got some of the products from amazon and some from my friend and my whole face broke out into a rash.</li>
            <li>It really works..</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using this on a regular basis, and enjoy the things i like to do.</li>
            <li>Mainly really like the scrub, number 1</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and i like it...</li>
            <li>Worked for me but is very drying and this set doesn&#x27;t come with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like the refining mask.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell though</li>
            <li>but I think whatever they&#x27;re putting in it nowadays is too much.</li>
            <li>My son uses Proactiv and really likes it.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep it because I really needed to start the program..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12-year-old sister-in-law and it seems to work very well for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li>Very please with company, product and shipping.</li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change in blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seeing her much improved skin condition inspired me to give proactive a try.  </li>
            <li>They also own sheer cover the make up company who will do the same thing to you.</li>
            <li>I feel the product is good but bottles were much smaller than I expected them to be.  </li>
            <li>The Proactiv Solutions products have by far shown the most improvement in overall clearing my skin of blemishes.</li>
            <li>still in the process of finishing the bottles of Proactiv and so far it has cleared my skin up pretty good, still working on some small blemishes though.</li>
            <li>but I rotate it in and it keeps my skin clear!!!</li>
            <li>It significantly improved my son&#x27;s moderate to severe acne.  </li>
            <li>The repairing treatment is a Paula&#x27;s Choice top rated product, with the other two just being so so.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I usually get Proactiv directly from their website but this was too good</li>
            <li>recently ordered the &#x27;New Advanced Formula&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>After trying to use my own regimen on my 13-yr old son (washing 3x daily including a salicylic acid wash, applying 10% benzoyl peroxide) and resisting to purchase Proactiv because of the mixed reviews (plus I thought I could figure this out for my son), I decided to try Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>First myself, then my daughter and now my 14 year old</li>
            <li>So far I did receive the 4 pc kit and it was EXACTLY</li>
            <li>The only two things I do not like about this product - it seems very overpriced to me, and if I stop using it for more than a day, my acne comes back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li>I would say the original formula (or gentle if you have sensitive skin) is enough to get the job done without the &amp;#34;fancy stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Micro - crystal acne kit, and received the older product.  </li>
            <li>worth the money and fast results for people who suffer from breakouts like me constantly.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m also please to find out that this was the older version.</li>
            <li>Decently priced.</li>
            <li>Marketed as a 60 day kit it will last you 40 days if you are super frugal with it.</li>
            <li>They love Proactiv but rave especially about the facial mask that is included in this kit.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise and to the delight of my son (who currently has his very first girlfriend</li>
            <li>For what these products cost, I had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li>I tried proactiv with high hopes  </li>
            <li>I used this is junior high when my acne started up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>shipped very fast, however its the old formula and is missing a months worth of treatment, DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li>If you have even remotely sensitive skin, DO NOT use this product!!  </li>
            <li>I have heard that Proactiv is helpful for mild acne, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s honest that the company markets the product as being effective for people with even severe acne, especially when acne is a condition that can really affect a person&#x27;s self esteem, rather than just a typical useless product.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using this and switched to a gentle, all natural cleanser</li>
            <li>If you are like me, and searching for that \\&quot;magic solution\\&quot; to your trouble skin, save your money and your stress, and focus on the ingredients of your products, or consult your dermotologist.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after my teenage niece had success with her purchase.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money...for me.</li>
            <li>and I have tried quite a few things to try and get rid of it, the problem is there are too many lies out there and products like Proactiv</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li>Yes this product does work, but it can get pretty expensive because you have to keep using it  till the acne goes away for good.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how well the system works, I have to give it one star because it&#x27;s only one month worth of the product - contrary to the title.</li>
            <li>THE FACE MORE CLEAR AND LESS</li>
            <li>The red marks from previous acne is fading nicely, and it&#x27;s preventing new breakouts.</li>
            <li>The box had been opened and re taped with other items--not part of my order, like the free with purchase proactiv</li>
            <li>continued to use the product, and I expanded my order to include other Proactive products, e.g., oil free moisture, nourishing eye cream,</li>
            <li>the products came on time and were new.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to wake up and worry about if I&#x27;m going to find a new blemish today...</li>
            <li>But mine was brand new.</li>
            <li>New dermatologist has started her on a stronger prescription now that is getting it under control, so we aren&#x27;t using this anymore.</li>
            <li>and I want to use products that are more natural and without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>or paid  the {{top star actors}} $5000 and got these random kids and just gave them a -free sample -for saying it works and</li>
            <li>This company relies on sneaky procedures and fine print to stuff its products down your throat.</li>
            <li>of your skin is sensitive your literally going to pay for it!</li>
            <li>Yes--this is a two month supply but proactiv products generally arrive with a much longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li>product came in as described and fast, was kind of skeptical about using this stuff at first because of my sensitive skin and worked well with helping clear up my face thank you.</li>
            <li>but so worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I clearly bought and choose the new formula of Proactiv, in which I was expecting the new version.</li>
            <li>Even though all of the descriptions listed for this item is describing the NEW FORMULA, but they are using an old formula picture makes you think you will be getting the NEW FORMULA.</li>
            <li>The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I spent a couple of weeks using the products, and found them to be pretty much equivalent to their drugstore counterparts, only more expensive and more drying.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is very harsh on the skin and will not work for many people because of this.</li>
            <li>is now smooth looking clear very clean and very few acne visible after the second week I would definitely recommend this product to anyone having issues</li>
            <li>The product was not the new version of Proactiv, but instead it was the old version.</li>
            <li>As the title says, this is the old proactive chemicals that are being sold and not the new micro crystal proactive solution as it is stated.</li>
            <li>The product itself works decent but I&#x27;m warning anyone thinking of buying Proactiv that there are better products out there that won&#x27;t get you trapped in some automatic payment spiral!!</li>
            <li>We received the next month&#x27;s shipment and my son used it again but suddenly his face started becoming red and flaky.</li>
            <li>sheer finish mattifying gel, daily oil control, replenishing eye semum, mild exfoliating peel,green tea moisturizer, refining mask, and the mini maintenance system travel</li>
            <li>the refining mask is very important to use at least once a week.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman who has taken every pill, cream, astringent, and gel under the sun in various combinations for 20+ years in an attempt to cure or at least help my severe acne, and am very familiar with the importance of using these regimens consistently.</li>
            <li>Acne prone skin should not be burned,dried out, irritated, sunburned and bleached to get clear.</li>
            <li>Having clear skin brings out a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Three steps is all it took to clear her face</li>
            <li>Proactive did clear up the acne I&#x27;d been experienceing and my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li>and I thought that once I was grown and had children my face would clear up.</li>
            <li>For a while it did but it never stayed clear.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever have clear skin</li>
            <li>If its because your skin is too sensitive and breaks out from anything that skip it.</li>
            <li>I tried using some &amp;#34;Acido Retinoico&amp;#34; my wife bought in a Mexican pharmacy but it didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>The testimonials and before and after photos depicting people with severe acne improving markedly encouraged me.</li>
            <li>But for now I use Proactiv in the morning and a natural product at night...</li>
            <li>My 13 year old seems to be doing well with the product...  </li>
            <li>but it makes your skin so soft</li>
            <li>Btw the 4 oz bottles have lasted over 2 months so far...</li>
            <li>really well we started to see the changes in her skin around the second week after she began using it complexion</li>
            <li>It dries your face out after two washes no matter how far apart the washes are.</li>
            <li>But this is the second time we buy this product and it has really helped her.</li>
            <li>tried this a long time ago when it first came out</li>
            <li>: buy it on Amazon, because if you buy it directly from Proactiv they stick you with a contract, and they will NOT stop charging you even after you have cancelled your order.</li>
            <li>Once as a teenager and once as an adult.</li>
            <li>I work at a spa that sells skinceuticals &amp; bought the Skinceutical Adult Acne kit b/c</li>
            <li>i could tell a difference immediately as far as redness and swelling.</li>
            <li>I called them and told them that I sent the whole kit back to them</li>
            <li>Am very upset I actually would like to return it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if u have sensitive skin, please dont use this.</li>
            <li>This was clearly part of a prepackaged kit sold directly from proactiv.  </li>
            <li>plus I didn&#x27;t want to deal directly with the company with my credit card.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works makes your pours go smaller.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s old version.</li>
            <li>Purchase for my 14 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>My sister used the product years ago directly through Proactiv</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter used this for months.  </li>
            <li>They work well as a set as long as the user is consistent and follows the directions that are on the label.  </li>
            <li>DID THIS COMPANY SEND ME OLD STOCK?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and my face already feels better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent, the packages state to use with care on sensitive skin, and I can only use it a few times a week, but I think I am seeing an improvement.  </li>
            <li>If you want proof, go to scam top dot com and see for yourself, I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s had trouble.</li>
            <li>I always keep one set at home, but recently the price pump up dramatically; therefore, I have to save my frequent to use it!!!</li>
            <li>In any case I started using the product right away hoping, that I would get the same results from the commercial on television.</li>
            <li>My teenagers had major breakout issues on the faces and within 2 weeks they all had almost completely clear skin!</li>
            <li>Absolutely is a solution for my sudden burst out of pimples; it clears up within a few days and I meant it&#x27;s so clean that I gain confidence after using it.  </li>
            <li>Works incredibly well and was far less expensive than purchasing through a kiosk or direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the items were larger than they actually are.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product based on my personal experience and my nephew&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95.</li>
            <li>To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply.</li>
            <li>new formula simply does not work for my changing hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the only thing that tames my wild breakouts, but its not 100% clear skin for me all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed to realize that I have paid double the price for the same product.</li>
            <li>My face may smell like a Whole Foods aisle now, but at least my acne is rarely an issue.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the $!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend the 60 day supply last long time and price is worth it</li>
            <li>I began noticing small cystic acne along my jawline which grew into huge cysts which refused to go away--even weeks later.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars just because I have to give it at least a month for precise results.</li>
            <li>Proactive was my last resort to clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was they only thing that would help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>Any product that will help them have clear skin; Teenagers are developing their self confidence during this time of breakouts; Skin problems are very emotional problems for teenagers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I thought it would help clear up and prevent future pimples.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t just blackheads, it was deep inflamed pores that would take over a week to clear</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then build up to using it daily.</li>
            <li>I am a 77 year old male and about 3 or 4 years ago</li>
            <li>so maybe my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive or maybe the warnings on the package are stronger than really necessary for protection.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using it.</li>
            <li>My 25 year old son has recently had issues with acne, and he asked me to buy this product for him.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered this for my 76 year old mother, who recently started getting acne.  </li>
            <li>After only one week of use, his face is at least 50% better and improving daily!  </li>
            <li>The oil free moisturizer I was constantly reapplying and same for the green tea one.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over the plus system any day especially for those who have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it would get slightly worse before it got better, just because it was clearing all the junk and toxins out, but</li>
            <li>i found my skin got worse before it got better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve broken out more after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I still paid more than I wanted for a product that seemed to make my face worse.  </li>
            <li>I actually would have given it a half a star, was very dissapointed, it hasn&#x27;t worked, I have used extra strength and has worked, this was very water based.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but this new advanced formula is making everything worse.</li>
            <li>First of all, when I opened it, half of the tonor leaked out all over the box.</li>
            <li>She was developing a lot of acne on her forehead due to her very oily skin..</li>
            <li>It cause new acne to develop and it made my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Doctor reccomended for my 13 yr old daughter to get her acne under control now if only she would use it daily as she is suppose to</li>
            <li>Within a week of using the product religiously, my forehead developed a rash of papules that were red and irritated and unpoppable.</li>
            <li>Only use the facial mask or scrub directly onto the break out area.  </li>
            <li>With regular use, his mild/moderate acne (he&#x27;s 15, so it&#x27;s all about hormonal changes &amp; growth-caused acne), is barely visible.  </li>
            <li>In a few hours though it got pretty oily.</li>
            <li>Hey I had bought this product some months ago and it only caused more break out on my  face, it have chemicals in this products that don&#x27;t agree with all skin type, however my girlfriend&#x27;s friend introduce me to the clear now system which I was skeptical about and</li>
            <li>so i got her the proactiv advance formula 4 pc and her acne problems have vanished and there is no more making fun of her at school.</li>
            <li>so she has mild to moderate acne, and after using this for about a month, she gets very few breakouts</li>
            <li>Both my teenage boys use this product and have little to no acne problems, it is so sad to see their friends with huge acne issues when these kinds of products are available to them now.</li>
            <li>So I used the whole set once a day for 2 months and, not at first, but after awhile, I had worse acne.</li>
            <li>Her acne was  leaving red marks on her face, which was really tearing her self esteem down.</li>
            <li>At the time of purchase I had 2 small pimples on the left side of my cheek and 1 started to develop one on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>To make it worse, my skin used to be SUPER sensitive.</li>
            <li>If it seems to be drying her skin a little too much she will skip a day of using the product.</li>
            <li>clearly there was a space that was empty - even if it was advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s so far very good product.</li>
            <li> I love ordering Proactive from Amazon because I don&#x27;t have join the Proactive club.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I saw a many ads for Proactiv, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> They made me think my acne could get better if I bought the product.</li>
            <li> However, it is a risky treatment with many side effects.</li>
            <li> i love proactive and it works.</li>
            <li> :) would buy again when supply runs out</li>
            <li> Of course I love proactive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had combination skin, leaning more towards oily.</li>
            <li> for sure</li>
            <li> You will love it too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended it highly to many friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> most skin care wont do it all</li>
            <li> He was pleased to avoid a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for clearing skin and maintaining same.</li>
            <li> AND THEY REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li> had many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it did not irritate my skin, however, I don&#x27;t believe that it works miracles.  </li>
            <li> and so I bought this kit and like magic</li>
            <li> I have my skin back under control (to the best of my ability)</li>
            <li> (it would just make my skin more oily)</li>
            <li> I used to love proactiv.</li>
            <li> I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has been very impressed with this Proactive acne treatment kit.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time love love love</li>
            <li> Glad to not have this monthly bill now.</li>
            <li> it  love love love</li>
            <li> know friend who use it and love it...just not for my skin i guess.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it after the hundreds of commercials on tv, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it got in just 5 days.</li>
            <li> very happy with product; Teenagers have breakouts during their teen years;  </li>
            <li> For $20 or 30 a month your better off going to Macys and buying their beauty supplies</li>
            <li> OK, I saw the infomercials and saw the hype and tried every OTC product instead.  </li>
            <li> My face is looking better.</li>
            <li> Even washing you face with anything will take some time:)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m enjoying the results.  </li>
            <li> This way I can control when I pay for and receive more product (I don&#x27;t need more every month)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> so I guess its ok.</li>
            <li> My skin is flaking off and I have more acne.</li>
            <li> Have been using proactive for many years.</li>
            <li> One of the better products i have ever came across...</li>
            <li> I love the product and it has cleared my completion.</li>
            <li> My sister was suffering from break outs and wasn&#x27;t able to control them.  </li>
            <li> With Proactiv she is able to control her acne without going to the doctor for a prescription.  </li>
            <li> Most times she has it longer than 60 days.  </li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with product and the timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with this purchase and seller… Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheaper than buying off the site because you get more</li>
            <li> I love the product and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> My acne look already better in 4 days</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to be seen with no makeup because my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and very effective.</li>
            <li> I had always enjoyed perfectly beautiful and clear skin until I turned forty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They put on a pretty good show about their product, and show some convincing evidence.</li>
            <li> My daughter used Proactive throughout High School and her skin always looked great.  </li>
            <li> For those of us with normal skin, it is great for clearing of blemishes and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this because it makes my complexion look pretty darn good for 63.</li>
            <li> want your skin to be beautiful and be natural without makeup or hiding yourself buy this.</li>
            <li> Product cleared my grand daughter&#x27;s skin easily.</li>
            <li> but the youthful problem continues to win the battle, but so far we have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> , it works great but doesn&#x27;t take ten minutes to rinse off, the toner astringent, number 2, is nice also.  </li>
            <li> They say it works great, and helps clear up their face!</li>
            <li> Be SURE to read all the fine print.</li>
            <li> many reviews will tell you, there is nothing special about this product, and it boasts ingredients found in most drugstore formulas.</li>
            <li> There are ton of better options available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the milder formula works for sensitive skin now, Proactiv didn&#x27;t fair well for my best friends fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love that my daughters have beautiful skin again and have their confidence back!</li>
            <li> and my skin does look fresh and nice.  </li>
            <li> Seems to improve grand daughter&#x27;s face significantly.</li>
            <li> and he said it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I believe this product was to strong for my skin type</li>
            <li> quite frankly I think after a week usage of this product that it is to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a complete line of effective acne treatments!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product if you have normal skin...</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first because my acne was severe.</li>
            <li> It works great and keeps my skin clear and clean.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use it cleared up my forehead and has been fine ever since</li>
            <li> excellent product, in less than three weeks is beginning to see the benefits of using it.</li>
            <li> Super product!  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle on the face and the toner I feel does the magic!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad we tried this product first!  </li>
            <li> Of course you should follow the steps, and it takes a little time out of your day, but if you want a perfect complexion, it might take some time.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using this product for five days now, and it is already making a huge difference for her.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just wanted  to say Thank You for bringing back my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> , the mask makes a huge differece.</li>
            <li> I swear on Acne Free.</li>
            <li> Something you only use once or twice per week cannot have that huge of an impact on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;You are better off saving your money for products that are more affordable yet still effective.</li>
            <li> Although it WAS NOT 2 months worth of treatment like the description said it would be, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> FREE TV time// cause what kid would say  NO to free TV time  and to be on MTV commercials.  </li>
            <li> The product itself was great new formula, and nice big sizes!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, and mild at the same time.  </li>
            <li> not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a bunch of rich greedy bastids imo.</li>
            <li> I originally started using proactiv when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for a long time now, it works great on my skin, takes care of my problematic acne including cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> It Was Worth Buying !</li>
            <li> Wish it come with original box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in their complexions when they are using this item</li>
            <li> , she is excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I am so far very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, I still had two sets of the original formula in my cosmetic arsenal.  </li>
            <li> It worked a perfectly as it did over the past 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teenager is happy with the product and it does not burn and cause dry spots.</li>
            <li> Clean skin</li>
            <li> amazing product, cleaned up all the acne and now I have soft radiant clear skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had to use special reaction cream and medicine for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed special face stuff until after 35----I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and smooth right after use.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had problems since she was 15 and her acne hasn&#x27;t really gotten any better.</li>
            <li> i love this idea every one wants to know where i got the&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works good definitely recommend</li>
            <li> this was not such a good product for my face, am disappoint with the outcome.</li>
            <li> It all depends on how much your complexion means to you:)</li>
            <li> But True, Folks .</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my daughter, I only hope it works as good as everyone says it is</li>
            <li> Skin got worse before better but its clearing up now :] Came in great condition and had no problem using the products.</li>
            <li> kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once again enjoyed clear, smooth, and blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li> Came sealed, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Never a problem and received it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with pimples and acne since second grade ( I am 53 now) and have tried many many otc products as well as prescriptions and NOTHING has cleared my skin up like proactive products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how lucky I am for buying this product.  </li>
            <li> OR you will always run out of toner and have to buy more toner or more lotion but still have something left over  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind to get the benefits of using it you have to use an adequate amount of each product.</li>
            <li> Not to mention all the free extras the gave me with my first order</li>
            <li> When I got this email to rate this product I saw the expiration date and wasn&#x27;t aware when ordering that information was available.  </li>
            <li> it works good as long as you use it once a day.</li>
            <li> recommended the product to several of my high school students over the years, and I have seen their skin greatly improve.  </li>
            <li> THE SHELF LIFE IS MORE THAN 4 MONTHS ON A NEW PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The results so far are amazing, and exactly what I had hoped for her.</li>
            <li> So, while I recommend the product, I also recommend not using your good towels to dry your face and hands.</li>
            <li> It  worked very quickly and within a week his complexion was very improved</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this would help a younger person or teenager with their acne, but it sure cured mine!</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what it said it would be!</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> love this so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super effective, I am starting to forget that I ever had acne problems.</li>
            <li> My acne is almost completely gone and the texture of my skin is very smooth now.</li>
            <li> This was a great starter kit for anyone who is interested in Pro Active.</li>
            <li> I am seeing the effects of using it already thanks for making that product available to people like me.</li>
            <li> what I paid for(a 60 day supply about $42 free shipping if I can recall), which alot of people seem to think this is a 30 day supply when those are REALLY the 2 oz bottles so that&#x27;s cleared.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day now and it is still effective.  </li>
            <li> Still, we are happy with the results so far and it is worth it to see the added confidence my son has in just this short period to time.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son is using and have not yet seen any improvements after about a month, hoping maybe with more time it will start.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have severe acne, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> you have to use it twice a day and the mask is really worth it.</li>
            <li> this is not 2 months worth of product, its one, do not buy.</li>
            <li> The same is not even effective.</li>
            <li> Spendy but worth it</li>
            <li> The proactiv arrived on time, liked the packaging, not a lot of extra plastic to it.</li>
            <li> This is NOT two months worth of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this more than any other acne product.</li>
            <li> oh that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> it takes a while for you to find the right amount to use and for it to work, but it will help a lot.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li> Okay I am 17 and have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> , I now once again  feel a lot more confidence too socialize, due to this referral I stated using the Artistry microdermabrasion system that have my face super smooth, these products rocks, you can click or copy</li>
            <li> product is for people who probably have barely any breakouts and just needs an OKAY cleaner.</li>
            <li> All i need now is a good dark spot corrector</li>
            <li> and I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t actually be the true product, but it was!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;THIS IS NOT THE NEW ADVANCED FORMULA.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single pimple since starting and skin is bright and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I fell for the same marketing scam that probably most Proactive users are victim to.</li>
            <li> Not only was my skin clean, but the texture was unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It began to help the first time I used</li>
            <li> the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li> When she went off to her first year of college</li>
            <li> Upon your first purchase, you basically get signed up for a \\&quot;membership\\&quot;</li>
            <li> MUCH needed in our household!</li>
            <li> I have had so many issues with the actual Proactiv company before, they have charged me constantly for a membership that I did not want and kept sending me more treatments when I did not want them.</li>
            <li> This happened to me twice, I should have learned the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I Ordered.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked well at first, but like everything else we have tried it seems to stop working after a while.  </li>
            <li> I considered taking my son to a Dermatologist first</li>
            <li> For those who have ordered (or are planning to order) from the Proactiv website or by phone, please be aware: once you purchase the first kit, they will keep your credit card information and bill you every month at a higher cost.</li>
            <li> i did it like three times the first week</li>
            <li> Well, we received our first shipment the end of October and he used it for the first 30 days...</li>
            <li> After just 2 days of using EXACTLY how the directions explain</li>
            <li> Now I am on Proactiv Plus and overall it is soooooo much better.</li>
            <li> No i bet you proactive most likely</li>
            <li> Most likely Proactiv is expired already but hiding the fact.  </li>
            <li> The revitalizing tone seems more alcohol than the last one. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I really do regret using it!</li>
            <li> that just perpetuate your problem so you keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> This face treatment is exactly as said.  </li>
            <li> At work my boss told she wants to buy it for her daughter!</li>
            <li> First time using Proactiv</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and was what I ordered but will not use this product again!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i cant say if he uses the product exactly as intended&lt;br /&gt;his</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered and came on time.</li>
            <li> It really Works!</li>
            <li> It is a great product the consistently of the cream is not too thick or watery.</li>
            <li> I have tried a plethora of acne treatments for the mild to medium breakouts I&#x27;ve had since high school.</li>
            <li> I will stay with the original formula as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The other stuff is kind of ehhh, it doesn&#x27;t really give me that tingle that tells me it&#x27;s working, but it could just be me!</li>
            <li> I get better results using alcohol pads such as Clean and Clear from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It may cost a little more than buying from the proactiv website but as I make it last longer than 2 months, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more each time</li>
            <li> This helps keep her clean and clear.</li>
            <li> for acne, i use the Neutrogena rapid clean and clear toner.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed and clear.</li>
            <li> It will change your face with a clean and soft face.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a good product for younger adults possibly up to 50 after that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Proactive helps my skin a bit, but I have not experienced the great success that others claim to have had when using this line of products.</li>
            <li> Adult acne is now more manageable and easier to deal with because my skin is clear and supple to the touch</li>
            <li> He quickly achieved positive results and has ordered a new supply.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots have lightened and I feel amazing.</li>
            <li> but thats because they want your money first and fast</li>
            <li> First day I use it my skin very itchy,the foam hurt my skin.i</li>
            <li> Easy and simple and sent me a personalized note!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated it so much and will definitely purchase from Terri again :)</li>
            <li> For me being a 20 year old African American woman with very sensitive skin, this works best for me so far.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has had longstanding acne, particularly severe acne, knows how embarrassing it is and how it can really affect your self esteem negatively, especially if your acne is mostly on your face, as mine was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember when this first came out, it was way much stronger and worked much faster.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that the product was less effective, smelled different, and the texture was significantly</li>
            <li> Since I have started using these products I have really noticed a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these products to anyone who wants healthier looking skin without paying a fortune to get it.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> If you really want to treat your acne you need to balance your skin out.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing, moisturizing and treatment are what is needed to get results not this junk.</li>
            <li> This has given my son so much confidence</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really loves this product.</li>
            <li> This really does work as they say it does.</li>
            <li> Keeps acne from flaring up to much, but no means has gotten rid of it.</li>
            <li> Really does work.</li>
            <li> and it proved it really does work.</li>
            <li> and it really did work.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was very unsure if this product was going to do anything.</li>
            <li> It really does the job for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> Works fast.  </li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> Fast and product was as promised.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nothing else I used  did a whole lot for my acne, some were quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sign up unless you have lots of free time and want to spend hours on hold and talking to different customer service people who don&#x27;t know how to do their job.</li>
            <li> Got some of the products from amazon and some from my friend and my whole face broke out into a rash.</li>
            <li> It really works..</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this on a regular basis, and enjoy the things i like to do.</li>
            <li> Mainly really like the scrub, number 1</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and i like it...</li>
            <li> Worked for me but is very drying and this set doesn&#x27;t come with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like the refining mask.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell though</li>
            <li> but I think whatever they&#x27;re putting in it nowadays is too much.</li>
            <li> My son uses Proactiv and really likes it.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it because I really needed to start the program..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12-year-old sister-in-law and it seems to work very well for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li> Very please with company, product and shipping.</li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change in blackhead removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seeing her much improved skin condition inspired me to give proactive a try.  </li>
            <li> They also own sheer cover the make up company who will do the same thing to you.</li>
            <li> I feel the product is good but bottles were much smaller than I expected them to be.  </li>
            <li> The Proactiv Solutions products have by far shown the most improvement in overall clearing my skin of blemishes.</li>
            <li> still in the process of finishing the bottles of Proactiv and so far it has cleared my skin up pretty good, still working on some small blemishes though.</li>
            <li> but I rotate it in and it keeps my skin clear!!!</li>
            <li> It significantly improved my son&#x27;s moderate to severe acne.  </li>
            <li> The repairing treatment is a Paula&#x27;s Choice top rated product, with the other two just being so so.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually get Proactiv directly from their website but this was too good</li>
            <li> recently ordered the &#x27;New Advanced Formula&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> After trying to use my own regimen on my 13-yr old son (washing 3x daily including a salicylic acid wash, applying 10% benzoyl peroxide) and resisting to purchase Proactiv because of the mixed reviews (plus I thought I could figure this out for my son), I decided to try Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> First myself, then my daughter and now my 14 year old</li>
            <li> So far I did receive the 4 pc kit and it was EXACTLY</li>
            <li> The only two things I do not like about this product - it seems very overpriced to me, and if I stop using it for more than a day, my acne comes back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I would say the original formula (or gentle if you have sensitive skin) is enough to get the job done without the &amp;#34;fancy stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Micro - crystal acne kit, and received the older product.  </li>
            <li> worth the money and fast results for people who suffer from breakouts like me constantly.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m also please to find out that this was the older version.</li>
            <li> Decently priced.</li>
            <li> Marketed as a 60 day kit it will last you 40 days if you are super frugal with it.</li>
            <li> They love Proactiv but rave especially about the facial mask that is included in this kit.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise and to the delight of my son (who currently has his very first girlfriend</li>
            <li> For what these products cost, I had high expectations.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li> I tried proactiv with high hopes  </li>
            <li> I used this is junior high when my acne started up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast, however its the old formula and is missing a months worth of treatment, DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> If you have even remotely sensitive skin, DO NOT use this product!!  </li>
            <li> I have heard that Proactiv is helpful for mild acne, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s honest that the company markets the product as being effective for people with even severe acne, especially when acne is a condition that can really affect a person&#x27;s self esteem, rather than just a typical useless product.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this and switched to a gentle, all natural cleanser</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and searching for that \\&quot;magic solution\\&quot; to your trouble skin, save your money and your stress, and focus on the ingredients of your products, or consult your dermotologist.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after my teenage niece had success with her purchase.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money...for me.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few things to try and get rid of it, the problem is there are too many lies out there and products like Proactiv</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li> Yes this product does work, but it can get pretty expensive because you have to keep using it  till the acne goes away for good.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how well the system works, I have to give it one star because it&#x27;s only one month worth of the product - contrary to the title.</li>
            <li> THE FACE MORE CLEAR AND LESS</li>
            <li> The red marks from previous acne is fading nicely, and it&#x27;s preventing new breakouts.</li>
            <li> The box had been opened and re taped with other items--not part of my order, like the free with purchase proactiv</li>
            <li> continued to use the product, and I expanded my order to include other Proactive products, e.g., oil free moisture, nourishing eye cream,</li>
            <li> the products came on time and were new.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to wake up and worry about if I&#x27;m going to find a new blemish today...</li>
            <li> But mine was brand new.</li>
            <li> New dermatologist has started her on a stronger prescription now that is getting it under control, so we aren&#x27;t using this anymore.</li>
            <li> and I want to use products that are more natural and without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> or paid  the {{top star actors}} $5000 and got these random kids and just gave them a -free sample -for saying it works and</li>
            <li> This company relies on sneaky procedures and fine print to stuff its products down your throat.</li>
            <li> of your skin is sensitive your literally going to pay for it!</li>
            <li> Yes--this is a two month supply but proactiv products generally arrive with a much longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li> product came in as described and fast, was kind of skeptical about using this stuff at first because of my sensitive skin and worked well with helping clear up my face thank you.</li>
            <li> but so worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I clearly bought and choose the new formula of Proactiv, in which I was expecting the new version.</li>
            <li> Even though all of the descriptions listed for this item is describing the NEW FORMULA, but they are using an old formula picture makes you think you will be getting the NEW FORMULA.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple of weeks using the products, and found them to be pretty much equivalent to their drugstore counterparts, only more expensive and more drying.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is very harsh on the skin and will not work for many people because of this.</li>
            <li> is now smooth looking clear very clean and very few acne visible after the second week I would definitely recommend this product to anyone having issues</li>
            <li> The product was not the new version of Proactiv, but instead it was the old version.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this is the old proactive chemicals that are being sold and not the new micro crystal proactive solution as it is stated.</li>
            <li> The product itself works decent but I&#x27;m warning anyone thinking of buying Proactiv that there are better products out there that won&#x27;t get you trapped in some automatic payment spiral!!</li>
            <li> We received the next month&#x27;s shipment and my son used it again but suddenly his face started becoming red and flaky.</li>
            <li> sheer finish mattifying gel, daily oil control, replenishing eye semum, mild exfoliating peel,green tea moisturizer, refining mask, and the mini maintenance system travel</li>
            <li> the refining mask is very important to use at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman who has taken every pill, cream, astringent, and gel under the sun in various combinations for 20+ years in an attempt to cure or at least help my severe acne, and am very familiar with the importance of using these regimens consistently.</li>
            <li> Acne prone skin should not be burned,dried out, irritated, sunburned and bleached to get clear.</li>
            <li> Having clear skin brings out a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Three steps is all it took to clear her face</li>
            <li> Proactive did clear up the acne I&#x27;d been experienceing and my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> and I thought that once I was grown and had children my face would clear up.</li>
            <li> For a while it did but it never stayed clear.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever have clear skin</li>
            <li> If its because your skin is too sensitive and breaks out from anything that skip it.</li>
            <li> I tried using some &amp;#34;Acido Retinoico&amp;#34; my wife bought in a Mexican pharmacy but it didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> The testimonials and before and after photos depicting people with severe acne improving markedly encouraged me.</li>
            <li> But for now I use Proactiv in the morning and a natural product at night...</li>
            <li> My 13 year old seems to be doing well with the product...  </li>
            <li> but it makes your skin so soft</li>
            <li> Btw the 4 oz bottles have lasted over 2 months so far...</li>
            <li> really well we started to see the changes in her skin around the second week after she began using it complexion</li>
            <li> It dries your face out after two washes no matter how far apart the washes are.</li>
            <li> But this is the second time we buy this product and it has really helped her.</li>
            <li> tried this a long time ago when it first came out</li>
            <li> : buy it on Amazon, because if you buy it directly from Proactiv they stick you with a contract, and they will NOT stop charging you even after you have cancelled your order.</li>
            <li> Once as a teenager and once as an adult.</li>
            <li> I work at a spa that sells skinceuticals &amp; bought the Skinceutical Adult Acne kit b/c</li>
            <li> i could tell a difference immediately as far as redness and swelling.</li>
            <li> I called them and told them that I sent the whole kit back to them</li>
            <li> Am very upset I actually would like to return it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if u have sensitive skin, please dont use this.</li>
            <li> This was clearly part of a prepackaged kit sold directly from proactiv.  </li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t want to deal directly with the company with my credit card.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works makes your pours go smaller.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s old version.</li>
            <li> Purchase for my 14 year old grandson.</li>
            <li> My sister used the product years ago directly through Proactiv</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter used this for months.  </li>
            <li> They work well as a set as long as the user is consistent and follows the directions that are on the label.  </li>
            <li> DID THIS COMPANY SEND ME OLD STOCK?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and my face already feels better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent, the packages state to use with care on sensitive skin, and I can only use it a few times a week, but I think I am seeing an improvement.  </li>
            <li> If you want proof, go to scam top dot com and see for yourself, I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s had trouble.</li>
            <li> I always keep one set at home, but recently the price pump up dramatically; therefore, I have to save my frequent to use it!!!</li>
            <li> In any case I started using the product right away hoping, that I would get the same results from the commercial on television.</li>
            <li> My teenagers had major breakout issues on the faces and within 2 weeks they all had almost completely clear skin!</li>
            <li> Absolutely is a solution for my sudden burst out of pimples; it clears up within a few days and I meant it&#x27;s so clean that I gain confidence after using it.  </li>
            <li> Works incredibly well and was far less expensive than purchasing through a kiosk or direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the items were larger than they actually are.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product based on my personal experience and my nephew&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95.</li>
            <li> To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply.</li>
            <li> new formula simply does not work for my changing hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the only thing that tames my wild breakouts, but its not 100% clear skin for me all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed to realize that I have paid double the price for the same product.</li>
            <li> My face may smell like a Whole Foods aisle now, but at least my acne is rarely an issue.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth the $!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend the 60 day supply last long time and price is worth it</li>
            <li> I began noticing small cystic acne along my jawline which grew into huge cysts which refused to go away--even weeks later.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars just because I have to give it at least a month for precise results.</li>
            <li> Proactive was my last resort to clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was they only thing that would help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Any product that will help them have clear skin; Teenagers are developing their self confidence during this time of breakouts; Skin problems are very emotional problems for teenagers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I thought it would help clear up and prevent future pimples.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t just blackheads, it was deep inflamed pores that would take over a week to clear</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then build up to using it daily.</li>
            <li> I am a 77 year old male and about 3 or 4 years ago</li>
            <li> so maybe my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive or maybe the warnings on the package are stronger than really necessary for protection.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using it.</li>
            <li> My 25 year old son has recently had issues with acne, and he asked me to buy this product for him.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this for my 76 year old mother, who recently started getting acne.  </li>
            <li> After only one week of use, his face is at least 50% better and improving daily!  </li>
            <li> The oil free moisturizer I was constantly reapplying and same for the green tea one.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the plus system any day especially for those who have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it would get slightly worse before it got better, just because it was clearing all the junk and toxins out, but</li>
            <li> i found my skin got worse before it got better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken out more after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I still paid more than I wanted for a product that seemed to make my face worse.  </li>
            <li> I actually would have given it a half a star, was very dissapointed, it hasn&#x27;t worked, I have used extra strength and has worked, this was very water based.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but this new advanced formula is making everything worse.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I opened it, half of the tonor leaked out all over the box.</li>
            <li> She was developing a lot of acne on her forehead due to her very oily skin..</li>
            <li> It cause new acne to develop and it made my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Doctor reccomended for my 13 yr old daughter to get her acne under control now if only she would use it daily as she is suppose to</li>
            <li> Within a week of using the product religiously, my forehead developed a rash of papules that were red and irritated and unpoppable.</li>
            <li> Only use the facial mask or scrub directly onto the break out area.  </li>
            <li> With regular use, his mild/moderate acne (he&#x27;s 15, so it&#x27;s all about hormonal changes &amp; growth-caused acne), is barely visible.  </li>
            <li> In a few hours though it got pretty oily.</li>
            <li> Hey I had bought this product some months ago and it only caused more break out on my  face, it have chemicals in this products that don&#x27;t agree with all skin type, however my girlfriend&#x27;s friend introduce me to the clear now system which I was skeptical about and</li>
            <li> so i got her the proactiv advance formula 4 pc and her acne problems have vanished and there is no more making fun of her at school.</li>
            <li> so she has mild to moderate acne, and after using this for about a month, she gets very few breakouts</li>
            <li> Both my teenage boys use this product and have little to no acne problems, it is so sad to see their friends with huge acne issues when these kinds of products are available to them now.</li>
            <li> So I used the whole set once a day for 2 months and, not at first, but after awhile, I had worse acne.</li>
            <li> Her acne was  leaving red marks on her face, which was really tearing her self esteem down.</li>
            <li> At the time of purchase I had 2 small pimples on the left side of my cheek and 1 started to develop one on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> To make it worse, my skin used to be SUPER sensitive.</li>
            <li> If it seems to be drying her skin a little too much she will skip a day of using the product.</li>
            <li> clearly there was a space that was empty - even if it was advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that they are really small, just expected a little more.</li>
            <li> the past, I might have a few days a month where I would feel comfortable going out without makeup to cover splotches and or blemishes.</li>
            <li> It did not completely clear his acne as there still remains acne bumps and an occasional white head development</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to play around with it a bit, and I&#x27;ve found that the toner and moisturizer dry out my skin, so I&#x27;ve only been using the face wash and occasionally the mask.</li>
            <li> This might sound crazy but since I&#x27;ve been using this my skin is way too sensitive!</li>
            <li> Purchased for granddaughter and not sure how much she likes it.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it&#x27;s real one..</li>
            <li> anyways)and if I&#x27;m expected to pay THAT MUCH for THAT LITTLE</li>
            <li> After only a week or two ,I am not breaking out nearly as often and the few places that do show up are gone much quicker than in the past.</li>
            <li> This stuff flat out WORKS!</li>
            <li> After a few months of using it I was able to touch my face without irritating it.</li>
            <li> (I searched the fine print for any clues about this membership, as I had read poor reviews of Proactiv&#x27;s business tactics, and even then, I could not find anything that made me realize that I was signing up for MONTHLY purchases, that increase in price!).</li>
            <li> have tried numerous other cleansers and facial scrubs that had varied results..</li>
            <li> It did little to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> My face did clear up a little bit.</li>
            <li> I will rate later on how the pro active actually works after I use it.</li>
            <li> At first I scolded her a little for buying something that was probably a waste of money, but when it came I started using it just to satisfy her.  </li>
            <li> My pores are hardly visible now and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> The so called improved Proactiv sucks just as much as before.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but in just a few days all the pimples went away and my chin and mouth area were completely clear.  </li>
            <li> .. I&#x27;d like to use the product, but any instruction booklet was left out, just the indentation in the plastic paskage was empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old with acne and started using this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my son&#x27;s acne was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for a long time</li>
            <li> After doing further research, we found that simple baking soda works extremely well!  </li>
            <li> He has extreme acne and the only thing that helps him are pills.</li>
            <li> The last thing I needed to hear from these people was their suggestion for me to try their other products.</li>
            <li> The product also lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long</li>
            <li> Using the 3 will dry your skin so skip one and dont use it every day.</li>
            <li> , Proactiv can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is ridiculous that Proactiv takes advantage of people who are really trying to make an improvement for themselves.</li>
            <li> It does seem to overly dry my skin, so after this runs out, I&#x27;d like to try the &amp;#34;Exposed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and clears the acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reluctant to stop using Proactiv because my skin isn&#x27;t too dry</li>
            <li> It makes your face really dry and it does not work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily and dry patches now and even some of the darker (age) spots are lighter or gone now.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in Proactiv is the only thing that works for me.  </li>
            <li> She was have a major breakout, and it cleared it within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months now and have not had a single recurrence of a single blemish</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use this every single day</li>
            <li> I use proactive myself every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not a gullible person.</li>
            <li> I use the whole kit at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I mean, to see your child suffering from acne and for them to get their hopes up high thinking Proactiv is the answer to their skin problems only to be let down</li>
            <li> It does seem to cut down on the amount of obvious pimples</li>
            <li> This item arrived earlier than i expected!!</li>
            <li> and I still have over half left.  </li>
            <li> None the less it was a present</li>
            <li> Plus, it is not too harsh or does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li> This product literally has made no difference on my acne and it makes my face very dry</li>
            <li> my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as they say it will.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were not severe but stubborn and sometimes certain foods, or STRESS would make them worse.</li>
            <li> Little pimples that were neither blackheads nor white heads.</li>
            <li> Now I am giving it as a gift to my little sister who is currently having acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the other products.</li>
            <li> I give this product a big thumbs down!</li>
            <li> Not 100% clear but at least showing the progress by reducing the quantity of Acne.</li>
            <li> As an adult in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is what I need to clear rash on face and other rash that is on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Also, it came in an enormous box that appeared to be missing something, the instruction booklet?</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try to those who are skeptical.</li>
            <li> Killed me skin left scares</li>
            <li> I looked in to proactive cause of my minimal break outs.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE MISSING THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE</li>
            <li> it does not really help with marks, but it does heal pimples in 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> My face looked worse than its ever been my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Their products irritated damaged my skin even worse than it already was and they over ship their product to you way too much, way before you need it and keep charging you.</li>
            <li> Do not work as expected and instruct.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son when he came home from the United States Military Academy over the holidays..</li>
            <li> I really do not notice a big improvement after using the Proactive kit for a few months.</li>
            <li> it costs me less in the long run to buy it PRN (the proactiv website ships automatically every 2 months).</li>
            <li> I actually catch myself constantly looking in the mirror as I seriously cannot get over the difference.  </li>
            <li> But I think they are not very useful for me.</li>
            <li> It is costly, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s even when I use it once a day or every other day.</li>
            <li> I hate proactiv billing and this was a perfect way to not deal with their weird way of collecting- and saved a few bucks</li>
            <li> I use the product in conjunction with other acne products.</li>
            <li> It was an endless nightmare.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone who has ever had skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product without reading the reviews of other customers.</li>
            <li> and because, the product doesn&#x27;t indicate what type of skin texture this product should be used on other than acne</li>
            <li> but the other day just change to $39.</li>
            <li> In the past I only brought it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Do not use all over your face because it will cause extreme drying.</li>
            <li> and I used the Indian healing clay and apple cider vinegar mask every other day.</li>
            <li> I think it over dried my skin because it got a little red</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottles are a little cheap and the holes in the bottles are a touch small, sometimes a little tough to get the scrub out.</li>
            <li> Like to try pro active +</li>
            <li> Proactiv has the active ingredient in both the wash and the repairing lotion, it&#x27;s like having them both give acne the one-two punch.</li>
            <li> My acne started to flare up in my late teens and every drugstore product was too harsh on my sensitive</li>
            <li> Thank You Pro Active</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter suffers from acne problems and classmates were making fun of her at school</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but my face is fairly oily.</li>
            <li> Used everyday since received and minimal difference.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You think these So called actors are promoting this crap just cause they have nothing else better to do..  </li>
            <li> but i think they need to come down on the price.</li>
            <li> began using Proactive in 2003/2004 when I turned forty and started to have harsh breakouts due to hormonal changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We ordered it to give it a try, within two weeks I could see a difference with less pimples and it clearing up.</li>
            <li> and i wear less make up</li>
            <li> I thought it was typical acne cream hype</li>
            <li> and there was some slight peeling.</li>
            <li> (at one of those humiliating vending machines at the mall) for half of the price.  </li>
            <li> ProActive less than a week</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for a month and a half once a day and it works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t struggle with zits previously.</li>
            <li> can of soda, and about half the radius.</li>
            <li> if you have acne and haven&#x27;t tried this system yet, i highly recommend trying it before the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I bought it for acne on my face and after 3 months of using it consistently, my skin has been getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this and little results.</li>
            <li> I started having little pimples or whiteheads in my chin and mouth area.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would work a little faster</li>
            <li> I used to buy this crap for my ex-wife all the time, she should have probably just quit taking pills and her complexion would have cleared up fine.</li>
            <li> Boxed interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like its missing info material or a video?</li>
            <li> My daughter has used proactive for a few years.</li>
            <li> i still get a few spots, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few negatives though.</li>
            <li> everyday tho bc</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li> I began using this product a few years ago to help get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> I would say I have moderate acne but gets worse randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t seem to work after months of use and when I stopped it made my acne even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments about my skin</li>
            <li> His mom had bought him multiple &amp;#34;proactive-like&amp;#34; products from Walmart/Target/etc, however, all these products basically &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; his skin and made his acne worse.</li>
            <li> Never before did a product actually make my skin WORSE, until Proactiv, that is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun, including harsh Retin-A and Benzaclin.</li>
            <li> I saw results within just a few days.</li>
            <li> I tried expensive professional salon facials, over the counter treatments, organic products, and homemade remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I know that this typically happens in the beginning, but it stayed that way for 2 months!</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and a half and broke out all over my face!  </li>
            <li> This lady was trying so hard to keep me as a customer by suggesting other Proactiv products.</li>
            <li> I know some other reviews complained.</li>
            <li> The product look a little bit different than the one I order from amazon.and also the character on the side of foam bottle came off ,,it was like fake product..</li>
            <li> Other than that I give it 5 stars all the way!!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the small bottles that I paid a large price for.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne and think its from either too much cell production, oil or bacteria then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Bottles are kinda small</li>
            <li> Please watch for the small letters</li>
            <li> Literally, for the past 6 years I haven&#x27;t had another pimple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying to wean myself off of Proactiv because it is so expensive</li>
            <li> How do you make print too small for even reading with a magnifying glass?</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> (usually just a morning person)</li>
            <li> its expensive, and you can only get it online.</li>
            <li> &amp; I would still get breakouts on my upper lip, under my cheek bones, eyebrows, chin, randomly on my forehead...</li>
            <li> I ordered this system for my 16 year old son who suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> It cleared it all up but maybe a small bump or two here and there.</li>
            <li> When i call back they just say sorry.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the authenticity of the product received.</li>
            <li> I have a 16 y/o nephew who has been struggling with acne for the past year.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have used it in the past</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, just buy baking soda!  </li>
            <li> I gave the product four stars because I&#x27;ve used this product in the past</li>
            <li> Other sites would not allow companies to false advertise, misrepresent, or supply incorrect/incomplete items.  </li>
            <li> There are other, less expensive option.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> because the advertising was false it said that is was the pro active plus micro crystals</li>
            <li> My skin has always looked dull no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff burned soooooo bad and had my face so tight and red.</li>
            <li> I was going to ask my girlfriend for advice on how to clear up my really bad acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;The breakouts were so terrible that they were actually huge nodules in my cheek area, forehead, and chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took time though - at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> They were not effective.</li>
            <li> I tried acne products made for my age (late 40s)</li>
            <li> Products arrived (within Amazon box) in a dirty, white, proactiv box with the mailing label torn off.</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel but it was to late.</li>
            <li> In just a few months her acne has decreased amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this stuff to its crap all it does is dry out your skin and flake it out or make your breakouts worse then before  and turn your cheeks red.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv is full of nasty chemicals and is overpriced.</li>
            <li> They have the green tea moisturizer but it is very expensive for a little amount.</li>
            <li> it literally burned my skin so bad that my entire face was peeling....</li>
            <li> We are disappointed in the current results in using this product.  </li>
            <li> love,except the cleanser is very hard to squeeze out/have to remove the cap to get it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to get into the routine of washing up every night and morning.</li>
            <li> Very dishonest business.  </li>
            <li> Within a FEW DAYS, I could see immediate results!!!  </li>
            <li> , the majority of us do not need a toner, it is an unnecessary item.</li>
            <li> it didnt take away my redness, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I diden&#x27;t expect that because I was tired baying product for my face dident</li>
            <li> but salicylic acid products made me break out even worse.  </li>
            <li> my face even look worse than before I start used this product.</li>
            <li> how she convinced me with the organic dermatologist approved ingredients they use for this product, after approximately 8 days of using this product I saw a dramatically difference in my fac e</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face look worse than before.</li>
            <li> My guess is that this product is outdated.have done nothing but break my face out even worse.</li>
            <li> I had never experienced before, in places</li>
            <li> Aside from not working/making things worse, my face was cracked and flaky-dry.</li>
            <li> im not happy</li>
            <li> All my friends wanted to know the secret to my youthful glowing skin--it was Proactive and lots of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO I have to say it is false advertisement on the part of the company.  </li>
            <li> This rating was due to my bad, it had nothing to do with quality or delivery of product.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have been around in my youth as my life would have been so much less painful.</li>
            <li> I have awful skin: acne, scars, dark spots, enlarged pores, and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, my skin isn&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin except dry it out, and made the pimples worse and painful!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MEANINGLESS.</li>
            <li> Not perfect at all, (w/o diet/lifestyle changes</li>
            <li> but maybe that&#x27;s my unfair expectation.</li>
            <li> downer with this is that it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This time I found it on amazon and figured that I would not have to deal with the random charges to my account</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin took a weird turn after I had my daughter</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it gave me the s***s....</li>
            <li> I tried using expensive brands like Elemis, and Dermalogica, and when I go off proactiv to try these, my skin gets out of control</li>
            <li> it all went wrong.</li>
            <li> needless to say, i had to stop using this product because my face continued to get</li>
            <li> Proactiv unfortunately makes me break out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about proactive for a while</li>
            <li> Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret not buying this fake, irritating, and garbage-like infomercial product!</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product I received.</li>
            <li> and I did see results however your skin becomes addicted to the product!</li>
            <li> It was VERY frustrating</li>
            <li> Trust me if proactiv did not have the small words saying results may vary people wold be suing the crap of this product.  </li>
            <li> I am middle-aged, but due to health problems I have terrible skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Afraid this product was used, &amp; resealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try the proactiv product line but was too chicken to try.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it!</li>
            <li> Mediocre!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very difficult to control acne.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just bad for my skin type, but I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on Proactiv again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, its bad how dependent you can get to this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have bad acne, my problem is break-outs under the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drying out my face so badly that it peels.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t ALL bad.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne around my chin.</li>
            <li> My skin started breaking out badly.</li>
            <li> Stop buying bad chemicals on your face and buy this.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before,  however without this product he gets breakouts.  </li>
            <li> his skin was really bad...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nodules were also extremely painful and ugly.  </li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i should have listened to all of the reviews these people WERE not lying :(</li>
            <li> For now I am disappointed that they did not mail the micro crystal.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed and will complain to amazon.  </li>
            <li> not what i was specting :(</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> You will cancel but they will keep sending you crap and charging you for it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I hate this product, I now have a rash of pimples on both sides of my face.</li>
            <li> Could be a tad bit stronger when cleaning up the annoying ance that tends to make a permanent home on your face.</li>
            <li> HATE buying anything through proactive because they will send you unwanted items and charge you for them without your consent.</li>

            <li> He is a teenager and has acne very bad.</li>

            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part is you can&#x27;t stop the shipments.</li>
            <li> This was TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I hate this!!</li>
            <li> Not even my worst enemies!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The refining mask is great! The other stuff is kind of ehhh, it doesn&#x27;t really give me that tingle that tells me it&#x27;s working, but it could just be me!</li>
            <li> Since I have started using these products I have really noticed a difference in my complexion. I would recommend these products to anyone who wants healthier looking skin without paying a fortune to get it.</li>
            <li> I love ordering Proactive from Amazon because I don&#x27;t have join the Proactive club. I can get it whenever  I need it without the automatic shipment that Proactive insists on.</li>
            <li> I had the worst acne in my family as a kid growing up. I tried everything from retinal to everything in the store. Nothing worked on my skin and I looked terrible. My Junior year of HS my uncle told my dad that his neighbor used it and it worked great. We ordered it to give it a try, within two weeks I could see a difference with less pimples and it clearing up. It is the only thing that has ever cleared my skin. Proactive lets you customize the kit. I never used the number 2 toner so I opted for two soaps and one cream. It lasted me about 2-3 months. Use at night. If you have sensitive skin then build up to using it daily. If you have bad acne and think its from either too much cell production, oil or bacteria then this product is for you. If its because your skin is too sensitive and breaks out from anything that skip it.</li>
            <li> Like to try pro active +</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but my face is fairly oily. I thought this would be perfect, but it&#x27;s just terrible. It makes my skin feel drier and doesn&#x27;t touch any of the acne. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the price. I get better results using alcohol pads such as Clean and Clear from Walgreens. I think there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this and little results. Maybe it&#x27;s just bad for my skin type, but I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on Proactiv again.</li>
            <li> It was a great price for all the products that I got!</li>
            <li> feeling good after use product.</li>
            <li> my son is happy, face is better</li>
            <li> I am a 77 year old male and about 3 or 4 years ago I started having little pimples or whiteheads in my chin and mouth area.  They were a nuisance but I would just pop them and put up with them.  I tried using some &amp;#34;Acido Retinoico&amp;#34; my wife bought in a Mexican pharmacy but it didn&#x27;t do much.  I asked my doctor and he prescribed Hydro-cortisone cream and that didn&#x27;t do anything I could see.  But somewhere my wife saw this Proactiv Solution Acne Treatment Kit and ordered it for me.  At first I scolded her a little for buying something that was probably a waste of money, but when it came I started using it just to satisfy her.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but in just a few days all the pimples went away and my chin and mouth area were completely clear.  I have been using it for a couple of months now and have not had a single recurrence of a single blemish and I still have over half left.  Also, I haven&#x27;t had any reaction at all when I used it at night and morning so maybe my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive or maybe the warnings on the package are stronger than really necessary for protection.  I only use it once a day now and it is still effective.  I don&#x27;t know if this would help a younger person or teenager with their acne, but it sure cured mine!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Yes it works. Bottles are kinda small but it&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting. I was going to ask my girlfriend for advice on how to clear up my really bad acne but, oh that&#x27;s right, I don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> Proactive was my last resort to clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;It began to help the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still in the process of finishing the bottles of Proactiv and so far it has cleared my skin up pretty good, still working on some small blemishes though.</li>
            <li> It has helped my daugthers acne. Using the 3 will dry your skin so skip one and dont use it every day. I would reconend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product at a good cost. Makes your skin feel good. Very satisfied. Also the expiration date is on the product.</li>
            <li> It works great for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time, and prompt. The product was not the new version of Proactiv, but instead it was the old version. I clearly bought and choose the new formula of Proactiv, in which I was expecting the new version. I am still waiting to hear back from the seller.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what it said it would be! Came sealed, shipped quickly. I am very please, and the best part is the price is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this supplier, however, wanted to purchase the product without having to sign up for the autoshipping thru PROACTIV. As for the product, I havent used it yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received the wrong product. I ordered the Micro - crystal acne kit, and received the older product.  Also, it came in an enormous box that appeared to be missing something, the instruction booklet? a reorder booklet? clearly there was a space that was empty - even if it was advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company  seems sketchy. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND buying from this supplier.  Other sites would not allow companies to false advertise, misrepresent, or supply incorrect/incomplete items.  BE WARNED RE THIS SUPPLIER</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as expected. Used everyday since received and minimal difference.  Teenage girl with ance using product.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in Proactiv is the only thing that works for me.  Proactiv has the active ingredient in both the wash and the repairing lotion, it&#x27;s like having them both give acne the one-two punch.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Boxed interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like its missing info material or a video?</li>
            <li> My daughter has used proactive for a few years. She asks for it every Christmas. She works at a restuarant. This helps keep her clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not a gullible person. When I saw a many ads for Proactiv, I was intrigued. The testimonials and before and after photos depicting people with severe acne improving markedly encouraged me. They made me think my acne could get better if I bought the product. Anyone who has had longstanding acne, particularly severe acne, knows how embarrassing it is and how it can really affect your self esteem negatively, especially if your acne is mostly on your face, as mine was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, Proactiv did not help my skin one bit. I am a woman who has taken every pill, cream, astringent, and gel under the sun in various combinations for 20+ years in an attempt to cure or at least help my severe acne, and am very familiar with the importance of using these regimens consistently. I also never wear makeup. I have heard that Proactiv is helpful for mild acne, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s honest that the company markets the product as being effective for people with even severe acne, especially when acne is a condition that can really affect a person&#x27;s self esteem, rather than just a typical useless product. Upon the encouragement of my husband, I ended up taking Accutane, under the supervision of a dermatologist. I&#x27;m happy to report it cured (not just helped) my severe acne. However, it is a risky treatment with many side effects.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using it. I won&#x27;t be purchasing proactive again.</li>
            <li> Is working for my daughter</li>
            <li> I help my wife to order this product using the proactiv website. Please watch for the small letters were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months, even when you only needed/wanted 30 days supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife didn&#x27;t get any good results from the product anyway.</li>
            <li> My daughter used Proactive throughout High School and her skin always looked great.  When she went off to her first year of college she decided she wanted to go another route.  Well after a year of fighting acne and all that goes with it,  she asked me to send her some ProActive again.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and she wrote me today saying, &amp;#34; I am so grateful for Proactive!!! I don&#x27;t know why I ever stopped using it!!  So yes,  I will buy it over and over again.  I bought it on Amazon because I knew with Amazon Prime she would get it in Two days and I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it at all.  I actually have three children using proactive.  It is really a good and reliable product!</li>
            <li> i love proactive and it works. the products came on time and were new. not disappointed at all. :) would buy again when supply runs out</li>
            <li> I have bought this for 2 years and use it daily. Still do not see radical results but reduces break outs.</li>
            <li> because the advertising was false it said that is was the pro active plus micro crystals but it was not</li>
            <li> going to go ahead and give my opinion on this.  it&#x27;s been two months.  it has helped A LOT.  it took time though - at least 2 weeks.  the only reason i kept using is because my husband assured me it worked for him in college.  the refining mask is very important to use at least once a week.  it dried my face out too much to use it all twice a day.  i skip the cleanser in the morning since i always shower, but use it all at night with the refining mask as a spot correcter.  it will work, but you&#x27;ll need to work the system for you.  it takes a while for you to find the right amount to use and for it to work, but it will help a lot.  i still get a few spots, but NO breakouts.  and i wear less make up and my skin does look fresh and nice.  i recommend and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> If you have even remotely sensitive skin, DO NOT use this product!!  I bought it for acne on my face and after 3 months of using it consistently, my skin has been getting worse and worse.  I thought maybe it would get slightly worse before it got better, just because it was clearing all the junk and toxins out, but no.  I have stopped using this and switched to a gentle, all natural cleanser and after only 2 days my skin seems to be improving.  Avoid Proactiv products at ALL COST!</li>
            <li> Great product. 2 nd time ordering from same guy. Never a problem and received it quickly.  Of course I love proactive. Nothing else works on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for almost 6 years now. My acne started to flare up in my late teens and every drugstore product was too harsh on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had combination skin, leaning more towards oily. To make it worse, my skin used to be SUPER sensitive. If I touched my forehead at all I would break out. I finally tried Proactiv and after a month it worked wonders. Literally, for the past 6 years I haven&#x27;t had another pimple. It&#x27;s amazing. After a few months of using it I was able to touch my face without irritating it. Now I don&#x27;t have to wake up and worry about if I&#x27;m going to find a new blemish today... I haven&#x27;t had to worry about that for 6 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few negatives though. My fiance tried Proactiv but it did nothing for him. He has extreme acne and the only thing that helps him are pills. Proactiv just didn&#x27;t get to the root cause for him and may not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Proactiv can dry out your skin. For the longest time I didn&#x27;t know that their Repairing Lotion (step 3) wasn&#x27;t a moisturizer. There should technically be 4 steps because I can&#x27;t imagine that someone won&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer after washing their face with Proactiv. They have the green tea moisturizer but it is very expensive for a little amount. I just use Aveeno and I&#x27;m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, its bad how dependent you can get to this product. I had a friend who used Proactiv for almost 3 years and once he stopped he immediately broke out again. The only thing that worked for him was Proactiv. I&#x27;m currently trying to wean myself off of Proactiv because it is so expensive and I want to use products that are more natural and without the harsh chemicals. But for now I use Proactiv in the morning and a natural product at night... still no blemishes.</li>
            <li> I tried the product but my face went all red and sore.  My face burned and itched and I had to call the doctor.  I had to use special reaction cream and medicine for it.  That is why I don&#x27;t use your product anymore.  Thanks anyway but I will not be ordering anymore.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many reviews will tell you, there is nothing special about this product, and it boasts ingredients found in most drugstore formulas. Beyond that, this company is a total scam. Upon your first purchase, you basically get signed up for a \\&quot;membership\\&quot; (I searched the fine print for any clues about this membership, as I had read poor reviews of Proactiv&#x27;s business tactics, and even then, I could not find anything that made me realize that I was signing up for MONTHLY purchases, that increase in price!). I spent a couple of weeks using the products, and found them to be pretty much equivalent to their drugstore counterparts, only more expensive and more drying. They were not effective. Honestly, I fell for the same marketing scam that probably most Proactive users are victim to. They put on a pretty good show about their product, and show some convincing evidence. It&#x27;s MEANINGLESS. If you are like me, and searching for that \\&quot;magic solution\\&quot; to your trouble skin, save your money and your stress, and focus on the ingredients of your products, or consult your dermotologist. I regret falling for this scam, and that truly is what Proactiv is, and just hope that I can keep some of you from making the same mistake. I think it is ridiculous that Proactiv takes advantage of people who are really trying to make an improvement for themselves.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with pimples and acne since second grade ( I am 53 now) and have tried many many otc products as well as prescriptions and NOTHING has cleared my skin up like proactive products. I wish it would have been around in my youth as my life would have been so much less painful. Thank you for your product I would recomend it to anyone...and have!  Cindy</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and it appears to be working well. She is happy and looks great, so I am happy!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been asking for this product for years, so am finally going to try it and with the savings, will see if it works for her.</li>
            <li> Purchased for granddaughter and not sure how much she likes it.  Cost is expensive and with teenage acne, maybe a doctor prescription would have been better.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a good product for younger adults possibly up to 50 after that I think its best to find something that specifically works for menopausal/hormonal acne. This rating was due to my bad, it had nothing to do with quality or delivery of product. Years ago when 50 it worked so great so I thought it would be what I needed but they are not miracle workers, there has to be a line drawn somewhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super effective, I am starting to forget that I ever had acne problems. It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling :D for sure</li>
            <li> Super product!  I can&#x27;t say enough.  You will love it too.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it highly to many friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> How do you make print too small for even reading with a magnifying glass?.. I&#x27;d like to use the product, but any instruction booklet was left out, just the indentation in the plastic paskage was empty. Afraid this product was used, &amp; resealed.&lt;br /&gt; Sorry I bought it! AND, I never received the Blemish treatment !!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old seems to be doing well with the product...  she is struggling with her back though...  Any suggestions</li>
            <li> Not perfect at all, (w/o diet/lifestyle changes most skin care wont do it all anyways)and if I&#x27;m expected to pay THAT MUCH for THAT LITTLE I cant help but feel disappointed...and kinda used and taken advantage of.  :(  Proactiv is a bunch of rich greedy bastids imo.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a great product but you must be consistent with this product in order to see the desired results.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try the proactiv product line but was too chicken to try.  But since the the product is here u cant tell me nothing....Thanks a bunch!!</li>
            <li> My 25 year old son has recently had issues with acne, and he asked me to buy this product for him.  He quickly achieved positive results and has ordered a new supply.  He was pleased to avoid a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It is not showing a big improvement in facial acne.  We are disappointed in the current results in using this product.  Not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for clearing skin and maintaining same. Easy to use and effective. Product cleared my grand daughter&#x27;s skin easily.</li>
            <li> Both my teenage boys use this product and have little to no acne problems, it is so sad to see their friends with huge acne issues when these kinds of products are available to them now.</li>
            <li> Just like the TV ads, this product is wonderful. My teenager is happy with the product and it does not burn and cause dry spots.</li>
            <li> It works. It smells great. It&#x27;s tough to get into the routine of washing up every night and morning. (usually just a morning person) but it makes your skin so soft, I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, and I can already see a difference.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this for my 76 year old mother, who recently started getting acne.  She loved it and she said it cleared her skin up in a weeks time.  I guess I will have to reorder it for her.  haha</li>
            <li> The so called improved Proactiv sucks just as much as before. Acne prone skin should not be burned,dried out, irritated, sunburned and bleached to get clear. If you really want to treat your acne you need to balance your skin out. Gentle cleansing, moisturizing and treatment are what is needed to get results not this junk.</li>
            <li> Doctor reccomended for my 13 yr old daughter to get her acne under control now if only she would use it daily as she is suppose to</li>
            <li> I am seeing the effects of using it already thanks for making that product available to people like me. It Is excellent</li>
            <li> After trying to use my own regimen on my 13-yr old son (washing 3x daily including a salicylic acid wash, applying 10% benzoyl peroxide) and resisting to purchase Proactiv because of the mixed reviews (plus I thought I could figure this out for my son), I decided to try Proactiv.  To my surprise and to the delight of my son (who currently has his very first girlfriend and that is why I&#x27;m writing this review), THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  It significantly improved my son&#x27;s moderate to severe acne.  It did not completely clear his acne as there still remains acne bumps and an occasional white head development but it controls his acne from developing into those big ones.  This has given my son so much confidence and I am thankful for Proactiv!  Btw the 4 oz bottles have lasted over 2 months so far... it&#x27;s worth a try to those who are skeptical.</li>
            <li> MY KIDS USED AND THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW THE FACE MORE CLEAR AND LESS ACNE EXCELLENT AND THEY REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li> this works over everything else i have ever used. worth the money and fast results for people who suffer from breakouts like me constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed special face stuff until after 35----I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin.Having clear skin brings out a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter and for the record I must say it works really well we started to see the changes in her skin around the second week after she began using it complexion is now smooth looking clear very clean and very few acne visible after the second week I would definitely recommend this product to anyone having issues</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter and it actually worked. Three steps is all it took to clear her face it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> this stuff is NOTHING like they say it is. its expensive, and you can only get it online. It dries your face out after two washes no matter how far apart the washes are. I recommend Acne Free at target-half the price and works better! I swear on Acne Free. my acne was severe and after a month all of the blemishes are almost gone. don&#x27;t use proactive!</li>
            <li> Your product is the answer to problem skin. I will tell others about the product to help them with their skin problem.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ITEM PURCHASED AGAIN FOR MY NEPHEWS FOR CHRISTMAS. WORKS VERY WELL. CLEANS AND MAKE YOUR SKINN FEELS REFRESHED.THX YOU</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about Proactive.  I have very sensitive skin and had very good luck with this product.  I was pleased that it did not irritate my skin, however, I don&#x27;t believe that it works miracles.  I do not have bad acne, my problem is break-outs under the skin.  I really do not notice a big improvement after using the Proactive kit for a few months.</li>
            <li> This company relies on sneaky procedures and fine print to stuff its products down your throat. Be SURE to read all the fine print.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This is the best ever purchase of my life.  I can&#x27;t believe how lucky I am for buying this product.  My life has changed for the best.  For ever.</li>
            <li> I originally started using proactiv when I was a teenager. It was they only thing that would help clear up my skin. As an adult in my late 20&#x27;s I am having the same skin issues I did when I was a teenager and so I bought this kit and like magic I have my skin back under control (to the best of my ability) It is a formula that works. I have extremely oily skin so I can&#x27;t use this every single day (it would just make my skin more oily) but I rotate it in and it keeps my skin clear!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Would recommend not using the step 1 everyday tho bc it can be a bit abrasive on skin.</li>
            <li> I used to love proactiv. Using it, my skin was the clearest it has ever been. But this time, it&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s drying out my face so badly that it peels. That&#x27;s even when I use it once a day or every other day. I use sunscreen all the time as well. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but this new advanced formula is making everything worse.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive multiple times it never seems to work I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better my skin has never been better!    WAY BETTER!!   [...]</li>
            <li> thank you very good product</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really loves this product. She&#x27;s had problems since she was 15 and her acne hasn&#x27;t really gotten any better. But this is the second time we buy this product and it has really helped her. In just a few months her acne has decreased amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some friends who have also tried this warn me, though. This is not for everyone as it works differently on different people. You should try consulting your dermatologist before giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> MUCH needed in our household! First myself, then my daughter and now my 14 year old so uses PROACTIV ---- EVEN my husband uses &amp;#34;once in awhile&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This turned my grandgirl&#x27;s acne problem into beautiful, clear, bright skin.  This really does work as they say it does.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work a little faster but maybe that&#x27;s my unfair expectation. However, I can see a change so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Works well for teenage acne when regime is followed as directed</li>
            <li> I hate proactiv billing and this was a perfect way to not deal with their weird way of collecting- and saved a few bucks</li>
            <li> Keeps acne from flaring up to much, but no means has gotten rid of it. Also dries my skin out to the point of flaking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely is a solution for my sudden burst out of pimples; it clears up within a few days and I meant it&#x27;s so clean that I gain confidence after using it.  I always keep one set at home, but recently the price pump up dramatically; therefore, I have to save my frequent to use it!!!</li>
            <li> Always works great my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as they say it will.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my grandson. He loved it and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Really does work. I was a non believer of this product until I bought it for someone else and it proved it really does work.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter. Her acne was  leaving red marks on her face, which was really tearing her self esteem down. She&#x27;s been using this product for five days now, and it is already making a huge difference for her. If it seems to be drying her skin a little too much she will skip a day of using the product. The results so far are amazing, and exactly what I had hoped for her. The red marks from previous acne is fading nicely, and it&#x27;s preventing new breakouts. She was all too happy and thrilled to show me her face this morning, because the product is working like it&#x27;s supposed to, and doing what the product has been advertised to do. I recommend this product as its helping my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product literally has made no difference on my acne and it makes my face very dry and my skin hurt</li>
            <li> The repairing treatment is a Paula&#x27;s Choice top rated product, with the other two just being so so.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this a long time ago when it first came out and it really did work. Then I stopped and started again and it didn&#x27;t work the same.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing about skin care products. A good skin care product is a good skin care product. I would take the reparing treatment and incorporate it into a skin care routine that I already have.&lt;br /&gt;A downer with this is that it is expensive. There are other, less expensive option.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the majority of us do not need a toner, it is an unnecessary item. So save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Same with the mask. Something you only use once or twice per week cannot have that huge of an impact on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;You are better off saving your money for products that are more affordable yet still effective.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to anti my blemish. It really does work. I will share it to my friend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. Proactive works excellent for her.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried every product out there and we keep coming back to Proactiv.  It works amazingly.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dried out.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Proactive still has the best mask around for the acne skin type. I use the product in conjunction with other acne products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is what I need to clear rash on face and other rash that is on other parts of my body. Rash could be from different medication that I take.</li>
            <li> Although it WAS NOT 2 months worth of treatment like the description said it would be, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase. I have had so many issues with the actual Proactiv company before, they have charged me constantly for a membership that I did not want and kept sending me more treatments when I did not want them. This happened to me twice, I should have learned the first time. This time I found it on amazon and figured that I would not have to deal with the random charges to my account so this makes me very happy. Also the newer version of proactiv did not seem to work on my face so I&#x27;m also please to find out that this was the older version. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and my face already feels better. Thank you</li>
            <li> it helped me get red of my acne in just 2 months</li>
            <li> Seems to improve grand daughter&#x27;s face significantly.</li>
            <li> Great such a great transformation my face look and feel so much better will surely continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> i found my skin got worse before it got better. it didnt take away my redness, it made it worse. once i miss a day, i start to break out again. i prefer to use one or 2 products at a time from proactiv. if i use the entire set, or my skin just dries out with lots of redness. i have combo skin.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has been very impressed with this Proactive acne treatment kit. It definitely is working for her, after only 6 weeks of using it. Plus, it is not too harsh or does not dry out her skin. It is costly, but a little goes a long way. We have been very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is a complete line of effective acne treatments!  My teenage daughter and I both use it and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I heart them from my friends. But I think they are not very useful for me. I don&#x27;t want to buy them anymore.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure if this product was going to do anything. After a week of use it cleared up my forehead and has been fine ever since</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  My 17-year-old son is already seeing results; skin is smoother and acne is drying up.  I purchased the 4-step with the mask; he has not used this yet but will take the time once he returns from a baseball tournament.  I purchased the 60-day size but I doubt that it will last for two months.  Still, we are happy with the results so far and it is worth it to see the added confidence my son has in just this short period to time.</li>
            <li> Great product, it leaves my skin literally glowing and feeling great.  Tip: buy it on Amazon, because if you buy it directly from Proactiv they stick you with a contract, and they will NOT stop charging you even after you have cancelled your order.</li>
            <li> Killed me skin left scares</li>
            <li> I thought it was typical acne cream hype but it worked.</li>
            <li> Holy moly!  Bought this for my teenager.  After only one week of use, his face is at least 50% better and improving daily!  Amazing!  I&#x27;m thanking God for this stuff!</li>
            <li> prefect, good quality, love it</li>
            <li> I began using this product a few years ago to help get rid of my acne. I would say I have moderate acne but gets worse randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t seem to work after months of use and when I stopped it made my acne even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is for people who probably have barely any breakouts and just needs an OKAY cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from R &amp; M shop. It may cost a little more than buying from the proactiv website but as I make it last longer than 2 months, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more each time cos it costs me less in the long run to buy it PRN (the proactiv website ships automatically every 2 months). Product works well. I received the correct sized products, as well.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the lack of results. For what these products cost, I had high expectations.  What a scam!</li>
            <li> It really does the job for my daughter&#x27;s skin.  Works fast.  Great product, and mild at the same time.  She was have a major breakout, and it cleared it within a few days.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is full of nasty chemicals and is overpriced. Just buy a benzoyl peroxide wash instead. There are ton of better options available on amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time love love love</li>
            <li> Great product. It really works</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this crap for my ex-wife all the time, she should have probably just quit taking pills and her complexion would have cleared up fine. Glad to not have this monthly bill now.</li>
            <li> Perfect and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after my teenage niece had success with her purchase.  I am middle-aged, but due to health problems I have terrible skin on my face.  This stuff is potent, the packages state to use with care on sensitive skin, and I can only use it a few times a week, but I think I am seeing an improvement.  Hope so.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just wanted  to say Thank You for bringing back my smooth skin. All the acne are gone and you can say good bye to ugly pimples. This products works for me.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. It cause new acne to develop and it made my skin extremely dry. I tried to return it but the merchant wouldn&#x27;t respond to my request for return label and rma #. I regret making the purchase</li>
            <li> been using this for years. since I was 21. now 40. does a great job with my skin, not a pimplr yet!!!!!!!!!! and the on-the-spot treatment will wipe away any potential pimple trying to poke out!!</li>
            <li> i love this idea every one wants to know where i got the&lt;br /&gt;love it  love love love this happy</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son is using and have not yet seen any improvements after about a month, hoping maybe with more time it will start.</li>
            <li> Amazon always has the best deals!! I usually get Proactiv directly from their website but this was too good a deal to pass up! I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years and still love it!</li>
            <li> Overall it does help... but at the expense of my skin... my entire face has been on fire.. it literally burned my skin so bad that my entire face was peeling....it&#x27;s a good product if you have normal skin... of your skin is sensitive your literally going to pay for it!</li>
            <li> This might sound crazy but since I&#x27;ve been using this my skin is way too sensitive! I bought this because my skin took a weird turn after I had my daughter and I started breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like sandpaper against my skin. I hate it. Has a burning sensation after Im done. I&#x27;ve broken out more after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I know friend who use it and love it...just not for my skin i guess.</li>
            <li> Fast and product was as promised.</li>
            <li> Purchase as a gift for my daughter... She was developing a lot of acne on her forehead due to her very oily skin.. Over 10 months of acne were nuked in about 2 weeks of daily use of proactive.... I am very pleased with my daughters results and she is no longer being picked on by her class mates... This is one of the best investments I have ever made... ~ Mark Tahiliani</li>
            <li> This product has damaged my washcloths and towels!  Not sure if it is worth the $!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had ordered. I know some other reviews complained. But mine was brand new. Exactly what I Ordered. I even paid for it to get here next day and it did! I would way rather pay for it on here than sign up with Gunthy Renker. But the Proactive is perfect! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandchild and it has been used diligently, it seems to help some - maybe - we think??? but the youthful problem continues to win the battle, but so far we have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> excellent product, in less than three weeks is beginning to see the benefits of using it. Continuous buying it to keep skin amazing</li>
            <li> I found this kit to be value for money, and liked that I could get all four products in one purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactive helps my skin a bit, but I have not experienced the great success that others claim to have had when using this line of products.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours. It did little to clear my acne. My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pictured regimen twice. Once as a teenager and once as an adult. Both times I used for them for around 2 months. Until I ran out of product. My face felt clean and smooth right after use. In a few hours though it got pretty oily. I think it over dried my skin because it got a little red and there was some slight peeling. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my acne though. I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li> Buy this for my daughter. She really likes it.</li>
            <li> got this for my tween and he loves it. works for him.</li>
            <li> I tried proactiv with high hopes  Unfortunately it gave me the s***s....</li>
            <li> Proactive did not work as good as I thought it would for my face.&lt;br /&gt;It was cracked up to be this AMAZING product when for me it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;However,  it wasn&#x27;t ALL bad. My face did clear up a little bit. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again though. I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money...for me.</li>
            <li> I like proactive but i think they need to come down on the price.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple and sent me a personalized note!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated it so much and will definitely purchase from Terri again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joy</li>
            <li> It worked fairly well on my son&#x27;s acne, but it hasn&#x27;t disappeared like the testimonials on television.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have severe acne, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that works and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;break the bank&#x27;.....you MUST try Proactiv products. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good description and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very difficult to control acne.  We have tried prescriptions and over the counter everything.  We were between dermatologists when we got this.  It worked well at first, but like everything else we have tried it seems to stop working after a while.  New dermatologist has started her on a stronger prescription now that is getting it under control, so we aren&#x27;t using this anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works incredibly well and was far less expensive than purchasing through a kiosk or direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. It has proven successful for my teenager. I only recommend it if the person using it will follow a strict routine.</li>
            <li> Definitely works. Clears up blemishes. Over time it stops working. I recommend starting off using it at night. If you have oily skin, like me, it will cause dryness that may lead to irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I looked in to proactive cause of my minimal break outs. To order threw the company there is always a recurring charge so you can keep receiving the product. I only use it once in a while so I was very happy that I could order once on amazon. The product itself was great new formula, and nice big sizes!!!</li>
            <li> This 4 step program has done an amazing job for my son. I highly recommend it! Great price, Great deal</li>
            <li> I considered taking my son to a Dermatologist first but I&#x27;m glad we tried this product first!  Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I decided to try it after the hundreds of commercials on tv, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve had to play around with it a bit, and I&#x27;ve found that the toner and moisturizer dry out my skin, so I&#x27;ve only been using the face wash and occasionally the mask.</li>
            <li> I bought proactive for my daughter because she like the way proactive cleans her face. I would recommended its a great product.</li>
            <li> the product I guess meet the needs, but only for a while, after the second week the pimples start showing up again! it was has my mother says an &amp;#34;alegron de burro&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I work at a spa that sells skinceuticals &amp; bought the Skinceutical Adult Acne kit b/c I get a 40% discount.  After using the product, I felt like my already oily face got oilier &amp; I would still get breakouts on my upper lip, under my cheek bones, eyebrows, chin, randomly on my forehead... It was VERY frustrating b/c even with the discount, I still paid more than I wanted for a product that seemed to make my face worse.  When I ran out of the serum, I gave in &amp; bought ProActive (at one of those humiliating vending machines at the mall) for half of the price.  Within a FEW DAYS, I could see immediate results!!!  I&#x27;d been using the Skinceuticals products for MONTHS &amp; nothing.  ProActive less than a week &amp; my skin was clearing up!!  It does seem to overly dry my skin, so after this runs out, I&#x27;d like to try the &amp;#34;Exposed&amp;#34; skincare system.</li>
            <li> For those who have ordered (or are planning to order) from the Proactiv website or by phone, please be aware: once you purchase the first kit, they will keep your credit card information and bill you every month at a higher cost. They charged me somewhere around $70 after the 30 days and did not inform me that they were doing so. I tried to cancel but the automatic payments kept coming out. I had to cancel my ATM card and get another re-issued. I was relieved that they wouldn&#x27;t take anymore money out until I get another Proactiv box in the mail...and then a bill stating that I owed them $70 for the package they had sent. I returned the box with a confirmation from the post office that it was delivered. I tried to call them and tell them that I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the $70 because I returned the shipment. They said that it had been over the 30 day period and that I still had to pay it (even though the items were returned!!). It was an endless nightmare. The product itself works decent but I&#x27;m warning anyone thinking of buying Proactiv that there are better products out there that won&#x27;t get you trapped in some automatic payment spiral!! Stay away from Proactiv. I will NEVER buy their products again. By the way, I recommend checking out Acne.org. I use all of their products and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> At 63 I began to have an acne problem.  Nothing else I used  did a whole lot for my acne, some were quite pricey.  I will continue to use this because it makes my complexion look pretty darn good for 63.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves this product!  he couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and use it.  Loved it after he used it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived earlier than i expected!! I was very happy about this and the product works amazingly i definitely reccomend!</li>
            <li> love this so far! i could tell a difference immediately as far as redness and swelling. but the biggest difference was on the fifth day of using the product. i couldn&#x27;t believe how much better it got in just 5 days. you have to use it twice a day and the mask is really worth it. i did it like three times the first week and now i do it once or twice a week, the mask makes a huge differece. if you have acne and haven&#x27;t tried this system yet, i highly recommend trying it before the expensive ones. i also use the skinlaboratory chemical peel (salicylic acid 20%) only once a week and that seems to help a lot too. you can order it here on amazon as well and its fairly inexpsensive.</li>
            <li> This product make my face red, rash, and make my eyes red and swollen. I will never try this products again</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd set being used to treat Acne, and starting to show its effectiveness. Not 100% clear but at least showing the progress by reducing the quantity of Acne.</li>
            <li> I ordered this system for my 16 year old son who suffers from acne. Seeing his self esteem diminish was breaking my heart. I ordered the Proactiv system online and enrolled in the automatic billing. Well, we received our first shipment the end of October and he used it for the first 30 days...no results. We received the next month&#x27;s shipment and my son used it again but suddenly his face started becoming red and flaky. At one point, his face literally started bleeding! I told him to stop using it immediately and I called the company to cancel our enrollment and we sent it back to the company. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know they billed me AGAIN in January! I called them and told them that I sent the whole kit back to them and they said they hadn&#x27;t received it yet (even though I sent it back 6 weeks ago)so once they do, they will reimburse me. They tranferred me over to another department I guess that specializes in \\&quot;retention\\&quot; by trying to convince you to stay with them. This lady was trying so hard to keep me as a customer by suggesting other Proactiv products. That was like a slap in the face to me. I mean, to see your child suffering from acne and for them to get their hopes up high thinking Proactiv is the answer to their skin problems only to be let down is heart breaking. The last thing I needed to hear from these people was their suggestion for me to try their other products. Proactiv is very harsh on the skin and will not work for many people because of this. I give this product a big thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I pruchased this for my son and it worked. great.  A fix for his acne when used properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i should have listened to all of the reviews these people WERE not lying :( why advertise what you do not have also product came in a bag -</li>
            <li> I have bad acne around my chin. Yaz cleared it up but I am no longer on birth control.  Proactiv is good at keeping my acne under control but i do have times when i break out.  I tried using expensive brands like Elemis, and Dermalogica, and when I go off proactiv to try these, my skin gets out of control and I go back to Proactiv.  I have been off Proactiv since September and my acne has been a constant struggle.  I just bought Proactiv again today, it&#x27;s the only thing that tames my wild breakouts, but its not 100% clear skin for me all the time.</li>
            <li> amazing product, cleaned up all the acne and now I have soft radiant clear skin!!!!!! I have used it before and went back to it...</li>
            <li> this product did great jo I diden&#x27;t expect that because I was tired baying product for my face dident help non&lt;br /&gt;so proactive for me it best one</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works good definitely recommend</li>
            <li> So far I did receive the 4 pc kit and it was EXACTLY what I paid for(a 60 day supply about $42 free shipping if I can recall), which alot of people seem to think this is a 30 day supply when those are REALLY the 2 oz bottles so that&#x27;s cleared. Another thing, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently with different products and also depends on the person&#x27;s acne type so it may not work for some. For me being a 20 year old African American woman with very sensitive skin, this works best for me so far. After just 2 days of using EXACTLY how the directions explain my skin is already clearing up and at this rate I give it 2 weeks max for my skin to show clarity. I gave it four stars just because I have to give it at least a month for precise results. It came in 2 days (Quicker than I thought). Other than that I give it 5 stars all the way!!! If anyone has questions Instagram:@Nina_Da_Pooh</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first because my acne was severe. It cleared it all up but maybe a small bump or two here and there. But then the dryness came and nothing that proactiv reccomended worked. The oil free moisturizer I was constantly reapplying and same for the green tea one. Then it stopped working. Now I am on Proactiv Plus and overall it is soooooo much better. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and clears the acne. Not to mention all the free extras the gave me with my first order</li>
            <li> this is not 2 months worth of product, its one, do not buy. shipped very fast, however its the old formula and is missing a months worth of treatment, DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> ProActiv has always worked amazingly well for my skin. I used it for a couple of months before my wedding and was very pleased with the results. Not only was my skin clean, but the texture was unbelievably smooth. The only two things I do not like about this product - it seems very overpriced to me, and if I stop using it for more than a day, my acne comes back with a vengeance. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone who has ever had skin problems.</li>
            <li> I actually would have given it a half a star, was very dissapointed, it hasn&#x27;t worked, I have used extra strength and has worked, this was very water based.  Am very upset I actually would like to return it.</li>
            <li> Middle-aged acne has meet it&#x27;s match in Proactiv!  My face feels awesome and the blemishes that were the reason I purchased this product are now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> very happy with product; Teenagers have breakouts during their teen years;  Any product that will help them have clear skin; Teenagers are developing their self confidence during this time of breakouts; Skin problems are very emotional problems for teenagers.</li>
            <li> This stuff flat out WORKS!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, fast shipping.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great kit keeps face clean when working around grease.</li>
            <li> The product worked for a while but soon stopped working. I follow all direction they provided. The worst part is you can&#x27;t stop the shipments. I called customer service to delay shipment but they send anyway. When i call back they just say sorry. When I call to cancel my account they said they will process, but then they just keep sending shipments and charging me anyway. It&#x27;s a cult, you cant get out. Don&#x27;t sign up unless you have lots of free time and want to spend hours on hold and talking to different customer service people who don&#x27;t know how to do their job.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for a month and a half once a day and it works. It works good.</li>
            <li> Proactive did clear up the acne I&#x27;d been experienceing and my skin looks smoother. I was very happy with the results. The only problem I have with it, and I did not see this mentioned anywhere, is it bleaches your towels and/or clothing. Knowing my sister uses Proactive, I asked her about it and she said she had the same problem. So, while I recommend the product, I also recommend not using your good towels to dry your face and hands.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work!I bought it for my son and his face was all red.</li>
            <li> My daughter tells me this product works.  I can see her complexion is now totally flawless.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy Proactive Solution.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE MISSING THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE THIS IS PROACTIV A PAID advertisement of course there gonna screw you over on the shipping and billing but thats because they want your money first and fast&lt;br /&gt;You think these So called actors are promoting this crap just cause they have nothing else better to do..  aaa No i bet you proactive most likely gave them a (lifetime supply) of proactiv. or paid  the {{top star actors}} $5000 and got these random kids and just gave them a -free sample -for saying it works and FREE TV time// cause what kid would say  NO to free TV time  and to be on MTV commercials.  YES  I&#x27;ve use this stuff to its crap all it does is dry out your skin and flake it out or make your breakouts worse then before  and turn your cheeks red.  OR you will always run out of toner and have to buy more toner or more lotion but still have something left over  Trust me if proactiv did not have the small words saying results may vary people wold be suing the crap of this product.  For $20 or 30 a month your better off going to Macys and buying their beauty supplies</li>
            <li> OK, I saw the infomercials and saw the hype and tried every OTC product instead.  I tried acne products made for my age (late 40s) but salicylic acid products made me break out even worse.  My skin has always looked dull no matter what I tried. I bought this 2-3 weeks ago and am amazed at the difference!  Why didn&#x27;t I try this earlier.  I actually catch myself constantly looking in the mirror as I seriously cannot get over the difference.  Not a single pimple since starting and skin is bright and fresh looking. I wish I had taken before and after photos!</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and husband love this stuff!! They say it works great, and helps clear up their face! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> So this product worked wonderful for the first two weeks. I had the best skin of my life thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it all went wrong. My skin started breaking out badly. Little pimples that were neither blackheads nor white heads. needless to say, i had to stop using this product because my face continued to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has not healed properly, but it is getting there. for acne, i use the Neutrogena rapid clean and clear toner. it does not really help with marks, but it does heal pimples in 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if u have sensitive skin, please dont use this.</li>
            <li> Be careful before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the proactiv I got from LOW COST 2 U had their expiration date rubbed off.  Most likely Proactiv is expired already but hiding the fact.  Very dishonest business.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The revitalizing tone seems more alcohol than the last one. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> this was not such a good product for my face, am disappoint with the outcome. my face even look worse than before I start used this product. I really do regret using it!</li>
            <li> Got some of the products from amazon and some from my friend and my whole face broke out into a rash. My face looked worse than its ever been my whole life.  This stuff burned soooooo bad and had my face so tight and red. Never again I let someone convince me to try this.</li>
            <li> It really works.. My face is looking better. I plan to continue using this on a regular basis, and enjoy the things i like to do.</li>
            <li> I saw this product from TV and I ordered it here.First day I use it my skin very itchy,the foam hurt my skin.i don&#x27;t think I can use it two time a day because my skin is red after I use the foam.I look it from Proactiv.co.uk. The product look a little bit different than the one I order from amazon.and also the character on the side of foam bottle came off ,,it was like fake product.. I am not sure it&#x27;s real one..I still using it and still a bit itching.. I will write again if its work.</li>
            <li> This review is on the part of what I ordered.  From what I can tell the company did NOT send Micro-Crystal because I went on Pro Activ website to see what the micro crystal bottles look like. SO I have to say it is false advertisement on the part of the company.  I will rate later on how the pro active actually works after I use it. For now I am disappointed that they did not mail the micro crystal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for 1+ years, it works amazing. Of course you should follow the steps, and it takes a little time out of your day, but if you want a perfect complexion, it might take some time. Even washing you face with anything will take some time:) It all depends on how much your complexion means to you:)</li>
            <li> While this product is good. When we buy this product from the Proactiv Kiosk they are more effective. But when I ordered from Amazon the product was sent without packaging or any seals. Not sure of the authenticity of the product received. The same is not even effective. I had to go again and buy the product from their Kiosk. I will never buy this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well without being too harsh, wish I had this when I was a teenager instead of the industrial cleaners they sold then.  Mainly really like the scrub, number 1, it works great but doesn&#x27;t take ten minutes to rinse off, the toner astringent, number 2, is nice also.  My only complaint is that the bottles are a little cheap and the holes in the bottles are a touch small, sometimes a little tough to get the scrub out.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. It helps my skin get cleared up from all my problem areas including my acne a problem.</li>
            <li> I would give it no stars if I could. I have acne and I have tried quite a few things to try and get rid of it, the problem is there are too many lies out there and products like Proactiv that just perpetuate your problem so you keep coming back for more. Their products irritated damaged my skin even worse than it already was and they over ship their product to you way too much, way before you need it and keep charging you. Also, they won&#x27;t let you cancel your account. You will cancel but they will keep sending you crap and charging you for it. If you want proof, go to scam top dot com and see for yourself, I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s had trouble. They also own sheer cover the make up company who will do the same thing to you. STAY AWAY!! They don&#x27;t want to help, they just want your money.</li>
            <li> This was a great starter kit for anyone who is interested in Pro Active. I have a bit of acne thats pops up from time to time and this product not only reduced the appearance of my acne within 2-3 days but it also kept me from having future acne.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and i like it...tx</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a Christmas present for my daughter who uses proactive. she was very pleased with the product and I was very pleased with the price</li>
            <li> I love using Proactive!! It works great and keeps my skin clear and clean.  I work in a greasy kitchen so I need something good!  Proactive is great! !</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, my skin isn&#x27;t terrible but it&#x27;s still embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, but my skin is drying out too.  I&#x27;m reluctant to stop using Proactiv because my skin isn&#x27;t too dry and I&#x27;m enjoying the results.  All in all I&#x27;ll buy this again.  I got it from Amazon to avoid the monthly charge and shipments of extra product.  This way I can control when I pay for and receive more product (I don&#x27;t need more every month) so it&#x27;s worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li> Decently priced. Proactiv unfortunately makes me break out. I think it&#x27;s the scrub, because almost any scrub or exfoliant does that to my skin.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter said it is working.</li>
            <li> I am getting Proactive for my grandson in Ky.  Yes this product does work, but it can get pretty expensive because you have to keep using it  till the acne goes away for good.  We are talking years here. I was dealing with the actual company with automatic shipments and forget that.  When I got this email to rate this product I saw the expiration date and wasn&#x27;t aware when ordering that information was available.  Nice to know.</li>
            <li> i will continue to order this product, it has met my expectations and i will be happy to order again</li>
            <li> Hey I had bought this product some months ago and it only caused more break out on my  face, it have chemicals in this products that don&#x27;t agree with all skin type, however my girlfriend&#x27;s friend introduce me to the clear now system which I was skeptical about and some how she convinced me with the organic dermatologist approved ingredients they use for this product, after approximately 8 days of using this product I saw a dramatically difference in my fac e, I now once again  feel a lot more confidence too socialize, due to this referral I stated using the Artistry microdermabrasion system that have my face super smooth, these products rocks, you can click or copy n paste the link below&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Yuck!  This was clearly part of a prepackaged kit sold directly from proactiv.  Products arrived (within Amazon box) in a dirty, white, proactiv box with the mailing label torn off. The box had been opened and re taped with other items--not part of my order, like the free with purchase proactiv offers--clearly removed.  3 of the 4 products expire in two months.  Yes--this is a two month supply but proactiv products generally arrive with a much longer shelf life.  None of the products I purchased had been opened or used but I&#x27;ve got to wonder where these actually came from and if they had been stored properly or if they are legit. Ew--I&#x27;m grossed out that Amazon would fulfill a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; order with such well traveled items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for a long time now, it works great on my skin, takes care of my problematic acne including cystic pimples. It&#x27;s been the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has worked on my skin. The reason for the 1 star?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT THE NEW ADVANCED FORMULA. THIS IS THE ONE THAT&#x27;S BEEN AROUND FOR FOREVER. Even though all of the descriptions listed for this item is describing the NEW FORMULA, but they are using an old formula picture makes you think you will be getting the NEW FORMULA. This seller is not selling properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Amazon is WONDERFUL and took care of me.</li>
            <li> Worked for me but is very drying and this set doesn&#x27;t come with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> want your skin to be beautiful and be natural without makeup or hiding yourself buy this. Stop buying bad chemicals on your face and buy this. I had ache problems all my life now since I&#x27;m in college and want my face to stop breaking out I will be using this and only this. Buy this guys trust me it works!</li>
            <li> It makes your face really dry and it does not work</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face look worse than before.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m 30 years old with acne and started using this product a few months ago. Definitely recommend the 60 day supply last long time and price is worth it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about proactive for a while plus I didn&#x27;t want to deal directly with the company with my credit card. When I found it on Amazon I thought I&#x27;d try it and I am so glad I did. I have awful skin: acne, scars, dark spots, enlarged pores, and uneven skin tone. I&#x27;ve used the product for only 4 days and I&#x27;m stunned by the results already. My acne is almost completely gone and the texture of my skin is very smooth now. My dark spots have lightened and I feel amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments about my skin and I have never gotten that before. Very happy customer and I will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> Do not work as expected and instruct. I still waiting for the miracle drug that would help cure my son &#x27; acne.</li>
            <li> It arrives as advertised, on time and packaged well.  My son&#x27;s acne isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before,  however without this product he gets breakouts.  It&#x27;s not a 1 or 2 or 3 time purchase, we are on our 4th order,  it works, but without it the acne returns</li>
            <li> I have bought this product without reading the reviews of other customers. I&#x27;m very dissapointed to realize that I have paid double the price for the same product. I tried to cancel but it was to late. I&#x27;m going to return it now...I&#x27;m writting to save others to get caught in this trap</li>
            <li> I used this is junior high when my acne started up. Now I am giving it as a gift to my little sister who is currently having acne. Amazing product! I haven&#x27;t known anyone who it hasn&#x27;t worked on, literally!</li>
            <li> it works good as long as you use it once a day. I really like the refining mask. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell though</li>
            <li> Clean skin what more can you ask for! It was a 2 month pack. I didn&#x27;t realize that it would come in just bigger bottles; I thought it would be two sets of smaller bottles. Still great though!</li>
            <li> As the title says, this is the old proactive chemicals that are being sold and not the new micro crystal proactive solution as it is stated. None the less it was a present so the receiver doesn&#x27;t know what it should have been so I guess its ok. They should remove the title though since it is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> I use proactive myself every single day. I have a 16 y/o nephew who has been struggling with acne for the past year. His mom had bought him multiple &amp;#34;proactive-like&amp;#34; products from Walmart/Target/etc, however, all these products basically &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; his skin and made his acne worse. I introduced my nephew to proactive (step by step how to use it) and within 3-5 days the difference was visible! I have bought this 2-mo supply. He&#x27;s been extremely happy and told me his self-esteem has improved now that his acne is under good control. I highly recommend this product based on my personal experience and my nephew&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv for years and I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t actually be the true product, but it was!! SUPER happy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great product but I think whatever they&#x27;re putting in it nowadays is too much. This burns my face!!! I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face itches but it is clearing up my blemishes. I would say the original formula (or gentle if you have sensitive skin) is enough to get the job done without the &amp;#34;fancy stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the items were larger than they actually are. Not that they are really small, just expected a little more.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my son&#x27;s acne was almost completely gone.  With regular use, his mild/moderate acne (he&#x27;s 15, so it&#x27;s all about hormonal changes &amp; growth-caused acne), is barely visible.  I love Proactiv!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I thought it would help clear up and prevent future pimples. At the time of purchase I had 2 small pimples on the left side of my cheek and 1 started to develop one on my right cheek. In any case I started using the product right away hoping, that I would get the same results from the commercial on television. I have to say that I hate this product, I now have a rash of pimples on both sides of my face. I believe this product was to strong for my skin type and because, the product doesn&#x27;t indicate what type of skin texture this product should be used on other than acne, I assumed this was a universal product, in any case I no longer use the product and I plan on returning it to the seller because, there is nothing on the product that states this product can be used for all skin types, quite frankly I think after a week usage of this product that it is to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son when he came home from the United States Military Academy over the holidays..his skin was really bad...by the tine he left (9 days later) you could visibly see a remarkable improvement!...he loved this gift for sure!</li>
            <li> My son uses Proactiv and really likes it. He is a teenager and has acne very bad. The Proactiv helps keep it under control! I have ordered it multiple times.</li>
            <li> I remember when this first came out, it was way much stronger and worked much faster. I wish they would&#x27;ve keep it stronger</li>
            <li> Terrible horrible no good very bad product. Did nothing for my skin except dry it out, and made the pimples worse and painful!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel the product is good but bottles were much smaller than I expected them to be.  Will buy larger size next time</li>
            <li> My guess is that this product is outdated.have done nothing but break my face out even worse.This sucks.want be buying again.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works makes your pours go smaller. your face feel great.. no contract.. i am going to buy it again</li>
            <li> best product on the market / PERIOD.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and I&#x27;m not locked into any club.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loved using it. I&#x27;ll have to order more because the value was great.</li>
            <li> This was TERRIBLE! First of all, when I opened it, half of the tonor leaked out all over the box. THEN, the cleanser cap was snapped off! I decided to keep it because I really needed to start the program..but I wish I never did! My skin FREAKED out! And I know that this typically happens in the beginning, but it stayed that way for 2 months! I now have red, rashy cheeks and chin that hurt. My skin is flaking off and I have more acne. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> he loves these products. He has finally learned to use white towels and not my colored towels when using these products. Yeah</li>
            <li> Have been using proactive for many years. One of the better products i have ever came across... Spendy but worth it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t not but it . I bought it for $43 but the other day just change to $39. And it&#x27;s old version.</li>
            <li> I have tried a plethora of acne treatments for the mild to medium breakouts I&#x27;ve had since high school. Never before did a product actually make my skin WORSE, until Proactiv, that is. In fact, Proactiv introduced my skin to types of acne I had never experienced before, in places I didn&#x27;t struggle with zits previously. Within a week of using the product religiously, my forehead developed a rash of papules that were red and irritated and unpoppable. I began noticing small cystic acne along my jawline which grew into huge cysts which refused to go away--even weeks later. Aside from not working/making things worse, my face was cracked and flaky-dry. I couldn&#x27;t even wear foundation because of all the flakiness. Eventually, I quit using Proactiv, and switched to using an acne moisturizer and spot-treated with undiluted lavender and tea tree oil. My face may smell like a Whole Foods aisle now, but at least my acne is rarely an issue.</li>
            <li> The product was good but directions would of been nice.</li>
            <li> This face treatment is exactly as said.  It works!  I recommend it to anyone that has problems with the skin on their face.</li>
            <li> Purchase for my 14 year old grandson. It  worked very quickly and within a week his complexion was very improved and he said it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these products for myself this time. In the past I only brought it for my daughter. I love the product and it has cleared my completion. I received the product with no problems.</li>
            <li> This 60 Day Kit Cleared My Face ! It Works Real Good It Was Worth Buying ! Thank You Pro Active</li>
            <li> I get compliments about the smoothness of my face everywhere I go. At work my boss told she wants to buy it for her daughter!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I do not suffer from Acne but I have purchased the items for my sister as a present.  My sister used the product years ago directly through Proactiv but it is more expensive through the retailer.  The retailer also charges shipping and handling.  My sister was suffering from break outs and wasn&#x27;t able to control them.  With Proactiv she is able to control her acne without going to the doctor for a prescription.  The product also lasts a very long time.  Most times she has it longer than 60 days.  For those of us with normal skin, it is great for clearing of blemishes and breakouts.  Only use the facial mask or scrub directly onto the break out area.  Do not use all over your face because it will cause extreme drying.</li>
            <li> i just paid $50 dollars for a supposed 2 month supply of proactive. I have had a 2 month supply before and what i recieved is no where close to 2 months.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter suffers from acne problems and classmates were making fun of her at school so i got her the proactiv advance formula 4 pc and her acne problems have vanished and there is no more making fun of her at school.</li>
            <li> Okay I am 17 and have mild to moderate acne. When I ordered this I purchased the 3 month supply. So I used the whole set once a day for 2 months and, not at first, but after awhile, I had worse acne. I hate this!! I would NEVER recommend to ANYONE! Not even my worst enemies! Just don&#x27;t purchase and keep your money! Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret not buying this fake, irritating, and garbage-like infomercial product! Wish I could give this NO stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years and it has always worked wonders. I&#x27;m not sure how the milder formula works for sensitive skin now, Proactiv didn&#x27;t fair well for my best friends fair skin. The only caveat is once you start Proactiv, you&#x27;ll start breaking out once you stop using it.</li>
            <li> 2 ounces is a 1 month supply, not 2 as advertised.  Highly disappointed and will complain to amazon.  Also, it did not come with a box and instructions. They came in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Great product for your money. Could be a tad bit stronger when cleaning up the annoying ance that tends to make a permanent home on your face. Next I am going to try the proactive plus.</li>
            <li> The proactiv arrived on time, liked the packaging, not a lot of extra plastic to it. Great to deal with.</li>
            <li> Marketed as a 60 day kit it will last you 40 days if you are super frugal with it. Just keep in mind to get the benefits of using it you have to use an adequate amount of each product. Good product but give people what they are paying for.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with product and the timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my daughter&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> Wish it come with original box.</li>
            <li> My grandkids are loving this product</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, and the product is not expired at all and it works for me as I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I recommend this over the plus system any day especially for those who have sensitive skin like myself. Highly satisfied with this purchase and seller… Thank you</li>
            <li> First time using Proactiv and it actually works!!! My skin is already clearing up. So happy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Mediocre! Soo A No Gooo . I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online. I used the product daily for over a month &amp; continued to breakout. To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply. I called to say I&#x27;d keep the order but wanted to cancel for the future. I was billed 32.95 2x after that. In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95. Now That&#x27;s $130 done the drain &amp; my facial complexion still resembles a pizza. Sad But True, Folks . (&amp; Customer Service Was Dreadful.)</li>
            <li> according to my friend, they are very good, excellent products</li>
            <li> love this product will purchase it again amazing results</li>
            <li> I have just started useing it. I no with out a doubt that it would get the job done!</li>
            <li> product came in as described and fast, was kind of skeptical about using this stuff at first because of my sensitive skin and worked well with helping clear up my face thank you.</li>
            <li> They love Proactiv but rave especially about the facial mask that is included in this kit.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in their complexions when they are using this item</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and a half and broke out all over my face!  I only used it once a day. I ended up giving it away to someone else.  Shipping was fast and was what I ordered but will not use this product again!</li>
            <li> bought for my son for his acne&lt;br /&gt;i cant say if he uses the product exactly as intended&lt;br /&gt;his acne has not cleared up at all</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have used it in the past and I was very disappointed in the product. I used it twice a day to start then upped it to three times a day. After a month not only was there no improvement but my issue got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my daughter, I only hope it works as good as everyone says it is, she is excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 11 years (since I was 19). I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun, including harsh Retin-A and Benzaclin. I ALWAYS go back to Proactiv. It&#x27;s gentle and very effective. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the other products. I need to just stick to it this time!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12-year-old sister-in-law and it seems to work very well for her. She&#x27;s just started puberty so she has mild to moderate acne, and after using this for about a month, she gets very few breakouts</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered and came on time. It&#x27;s also cheaper than buying off the site because you get more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone debating on buying this through pro-active vs amazon....&lt;br /&gt;I HATE buying anything through proactive because they will send you unwanted items and charge you for them without your consent. With amazon you do not have to worry about that!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter used this for months.  It didn&#x27;t work too well.  We followed the directions but it didn&#x27;t help.  After doing further research, we found that simple baking soda works extremely well!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, just buy baking soda!  Google it and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter, and she loves it for her face, I have never used it for myself. she swears by it</li>
            <li> Adult acne is now more manageable and easier to deal with because my skin is clear and supple to the touch</li>
            <li> This product came on time and works as advertised.  They work well as a set as long as the user is consistent and follows the directions that are on the label.  It works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how well the system works, I have to give it one star because it&#x27;s only one month worth of the product - contrary to the title. This is NOT two months worth of this product. For reference, the biggest bottle is as tall as a 12oz. can of soda, and about half the radius.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I highly recommend it. It will change your face with a clean and soft face. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My son was using a different line on his acne and it helped for awhile and then stopped working.  He asked for Proactiv and it is working great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for a long time and I haven&#x27;t stopped it. It really Works! I strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as described. Lesson learned, pay attention to bottle sizes. I was shocked to see the small bottles that I paid a large price for. Probably going to switch to a different skin care line.</li>
            <li> My teenagers had major breakout issues on the faces and within 2 weeks they all had almost completely clear skin! Just amazing! I love that my daughters have beautiful skin again and have their confidence back! I highly recommend this, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I use the whole kit at least every other day. It leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed and clear. Finally something to help me with my embarrassing acne problem!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product and would recommend to others. good service</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so far very good product. I love this more than any other acne product. I didn&#x27;t like proactiv plus which is garbage. My acne look already better in 4 days and I used the Indian healing clay and apple cider vinegar mask every other day. I am so far very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great I&#x27;m seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li> Very please with company, product and shipping.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is always good. Nothing wrong with the product I received. I don&#x27;t ever use the repairing lotion though.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A 60 DAY SUPPLY ONLY 30 DAYS. FYI. WHAT A SCAM.</li>
            <li> Does not work for cystic acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a process but so worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> this product really works. i wanted to buy 1 set of what you see on the infomercial without having to commit to the monthly purchase.  for the $ very happy with product, packaging and quick delivery.  would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a ripoff. It just does not work.</li>
            <li> love,except the cleanser is very hard to squeeze out/have to remove the cap to get it out.</li>
            <li> I found the product to arrive in a timely matter. I gave the product four stars because I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and I did see results however your skin becomes addicted to the product! It is a great product the consistently of the cream is not too thick or watery. The cleanser is gentle on the face and the toner I feel does the magic!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE ITEMS TODAY AND THEY ALL EXPIRE 3/2013. IT IS MID NOVEMBER, I WOULD ASSUME THE SHELF LIFE IS MORE THAN 4 MONTHS ON A NEW PRODUCT. DID THIS COMPANY SEND ME OLD STOCK?</li>
            <li> it works but no where close to what they say that it does... not what i was specting :( im not happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne breakouts since I was 12 and I&#x27;m 56 now. My breakouts were not severe but stubborn and sometimes certain foods, or STRESS would make them worse. It wasn&#x27;t just blackheads, it was deep inflamed pores that would take over a week to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I felt my breakouts were triggered by hormones and I thought that once I was grown and had children my face would clear up. For a while it did but it never stayed clear. Then after I started going through menapaus my face started breaking out again and I chalked it up to stress and hormones. I didn&#x27;t think I would ever have clear skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous other cleansers and facial scrubs that had varied results.. The Proactiv Solutions products have by far shown the most improvement in overall clearing my skin of blemishes. I saw results within just a few days. After only a week or two ,I am not breaking out nearly as often and the few places that do show up are gone much quicker than in the past. My pores are hardly visible now and my skin is so much softer. I don&#x27;t have oily and dry patches now and even some of the darker (age) spots are lighter or gone now. I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I might have a few days a month where I would feel comfortable going out without makeup to cover splotches and or blemishes. Now it doesn&#x27;t bother me to be seen with no makeup because my skin looks so much better. This is the healthiest my skin has looked since before puberty over 40 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Skin got worse before better but its clearing up now :] Came in great condition and had no problem using the products.</li>
            <li> Used to use proactive add a teen. Then stopped Started again and it gave my face a wonderful glow. All i need now is a good dark spot corrector</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long so my feelings might change. It does seem to cut down on the amount of obvious pimples but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change in blackhead removal. It also dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> I had always enjoyed perfectly beautiful and clear skin until I turned forty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Proactive in 2003/2004 when I turned forty and started to have harsh breakouts due to hormonal changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breakouts were so terrible that they were actually huge nodules in my cheek area, forehead, and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nodules were also extremely painful and ugly.  I tried expensive professional salon facials, over the counter treatments, organic products, and homemade remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A commercial featuring the Proactive spokes person Vanessa Williams convinced me to consider trying Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article in Ebony Magazine where Vanessa Williams shared her heartbreaking story about her untamed skin issues.  She suffered breakouts throughout her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing her much improved skin condition inspired me to give proactive a try.  I took advantage of the $19.99 introductory offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactive exceeded my expectations.  I followed the instructions and Proactive worked within a two week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use the product, and I expanded my order to include other Proactive products, e.g., oil free moisture, nourishing eye cream, sheer finish mattifying gel, daily oil control, replenishing eye semum, mild exfoliating peel,green tea moisturizer, refining mask, and the mini maintenance system travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once again enjoyed clear, smooth, and blemish free skin.  All my friends wanted to know the secret to my youthful glowing skin--it was Proactive and lots of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended the product to several of my high school students over the years, and I have seen their skin greatly improve.  They are also completely different people--boosted self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed myself on the automatic monthly supply rotation.  I accumulated several months of products over a four year time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a hold on my automatic monthly supply until my supply began to diminish--February 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered the &#x27;New Advanced Formula&#x27;.  I immediately noticed that the product was less effective, smelled different, and the texture was significantly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I still had two sets of the original formula in my cosmetic arsenal.  It worked a perfectly as it did over the past 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula simply does not work for my changing hormonal breakouts.  I will stay with the original formula as long as it is available.</li>
