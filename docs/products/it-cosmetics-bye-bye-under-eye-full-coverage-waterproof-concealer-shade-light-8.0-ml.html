            <li>But if your like me and you dont want to use anything that absorbs or goes into your body thats been made I  china; fair warning.</li>

            <li>The coverage is nice though</li>
            <li>It is really good, probably the best I have tryed so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommend.</li>

            <li>(I&#x27;ve never felt that confident about my complexion before!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am completely satisfied with this product and have begun raving to my friends and co-workers about it.</li>
            <li>Give it a try &amp; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love makeup</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love IT cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage of this product.</li>
            <li>Looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>easily, and I have not had that problem with IT.  </li>
            <li>Covers fine lines and looks smooth while doing it.</li>
            <li>Not only as a great concealer but also as cover mark for fine veins in the face, etc.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great pigment with only a dot size of concealer.</li>
            <li>New favorite concealer!</li>
            <li>and so far (after a handful of uses), I&#x27;m VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>The light color is perfect on my uber pale skin, and whether I go just with the Bye Bye and a little eyeliner/mascara or do a full face of makeup with foundation, powder, eye shadow, and the works over the concealer, it looks great, *</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage, applies silky and seamlessly.</li>
            <li>The overall quality of this makeup was good</li>
            <li>I have read a lot of good things about this one, and I totally agree.</li>
            <li>My wife had heard great things about the coverage for dark circles</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m supposed to pat it on very gently or use a brush, not swipe it under my eyes with my finger, but I&#x27;d still like to find something as good but with a little more slip to it.</li>
            <li>The also clean very easily with a tiny drop of baby shampoo or dawn.  </li>
            <li>Great job of hiding dark circles!  </li>
            <li>I use very little and the brush spreads and feathers it on so beautifully.  </li>
            <li>After a little experimentation, I discovered that it was best to apply it to a completely bare eye.</li>
            <li>When I received my concealer, I tried it on right away.</li>
            <li>It has a very good coverage and you only need a small amount for a full coverage.</li>
            <li>Especially on an old lady!</li>
            <li>you will need a lite powder to set as this product is pretty greasy and will make your eyeliner run.  </li>
            <li>Nicely covered a raspberry birthmark on the face and a dark mole on the leg.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I find the medium too dark and the light too light.</li>
            <li>best eye under cover, use proper applications, you need very little and use a soft brush</li>
            <li>So give it a try after warming it up, it really helps</li>
            <li>Thank You so much,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re an improvement (over nothing and over other products), but still weren&#x27;t quite leaving me satisfied, and sometimes they didn&#x27;t wear/</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations for this concealer.  </li>
            <li>But, it looks great, and it takes so little product to get the right look, one tube is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if another shade would be better, but I hit my eye and it caused a black eye.  </li>
            <li>Using only the tiniest drop, it covered my entire eye area, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>My best bets so far (which I alternate between) have been I.D. Bare Minerals Bisque powder, Benefit Eye Brightener pencil (the pale pink blends into my pale skin fairly well), and Benefit Erase Paste.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, they don&#x27;t lose little bristles like other brushes do.  </li>
            <li>I suspect someone younger with oily skin would be able to make this work, but even with lots of moisturizer,  a tiny amount of product and an airbrush concealer brush, I could not get a natural effect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give a good review on the actual product because I have an icky feeling that this may have been probed in a Target beauty aisle or something,</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is easy to blend, and covers dark circles like a dream.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I break out&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different concealers over the years, and nothing has worked very well.</li>
            <li>not dark</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a pic of me in low lighting which would normally show undereye discoloration and shadow.</li>
            <li>The price was a little higher than what I would normally pay, but nothing else worked.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, however was unusable due to gritty sand like texture.</li>
            <li>It looked so natural that I&#x27;ve even begun to wear it as my sole form of make-up when I&#x27;m in a hurry to leave the house.</li>
            <li>almost* does away completely with the darkness under my eyes and in the inner corner by my nose, and doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup.</li>
            <li>I swear, the first time I pressed down on the tube</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice and thick, but in order to look natural and not caked, you have to use very little spread it a lot and compromise the coverage.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and other much cheaper concealers that I have used.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t crease or barely cover the shadow from my deep set eyes!</li>

            <li> last well with other makeup and activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This concealer is quite thick and it takes just a very little bit to get full coverage.  </li>
            <li> This little tube will last forever.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cover as expected.</li>
            <li> Still decent as a regular cover up if you can apply it thin and don&#x27;t have very dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist basically said it&#x27;s genetics and aging, and there&#x27;s nothing that can be done for them other than makeup.</li>
            <li> You can use only a very, very small amount.  </li>
            <li> and I often spend money on expensive high quality (i.e, MAC, Chanel).  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and it truly does get rid of dark under eye circles and other small imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Downside is that it&#x27;s a little bit drying for people who have dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Wish it were just a little lighter.</li>
            <li> ; a few weeks ago, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I put my tube of product in my bra between the girls and it warmed the product up enough to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve struggled for at least the past 5+ years with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The secret is to use VERY LITTLE of the product -- sometimes just run your finger around the bottle cap opening and just press it on, then wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too thick, I suggest mixing it with a little of your eye cream before applying.</li>
            <li> I too had trouble with this product because of its thick texture.  </li>
            <li> My skin is like a sponge and my makeup is usually gone in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> Just apply small amount, blend and then pat with some powder to set.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have dark circles and look tired</li>
            <li> A little tough to apply without pulling.</li>
            <li> I wanted to respond to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Yes it goes on thick</li>
            <li> but she said it applies very thickly and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the hype.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not perfect</li>
            <li> it was difficult (almost impossible) to get out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have tried every kind of concealer out there &amp; have never been satisfied. They either don&#x27;t cover dark circles, highlight every wrinkle &amp; make you look older, or almost immediately slide halfway down your cheeks. After seeing this product demonstrated on &amp;#34;The Today Show&amp;#34; a few weeks ago, I decided to give it a try. The price was a little higher than what I would normally pay, but nothing else worked. When I received my concealer, I tried it on right away. After a little experimentation, I discovered that it was best to apply it to a completely bare eye. No moisturizer or eye creams, as that would not allow the concealer to stick to the eye area. Using only the tiniest drop, it covered my entire eye area, top and bottom. It looked so natural that I&#x27;ve even begun to wear it as my sole form of make-up when I&#x27;m in a hurry to leave the house. (I&#x27;ve never felt that confident about my complexion before!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with this product and have begun raving to my friends and co-workers about it. Give it a try &amp; you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It is marketed to not crease or fall into the lines and wrinkles....it does.  The coverage is nice though</li>
            <li> I love makeup and I often spend money on expensive high quality (i.e, MAC, Chanel).  I really had high expectations for this concealer.  I had seen a recommendation on the Today show so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I sometimes have dark circles and look tired so I wanted something that would help me say \\&quot;bye bye\\&quot; to under eye circles.  The overall quality of this makeup was good but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and other much cheaper concealers that I have used. If you buy this keep your expectations low.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough coverage.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and thick, but in order to look natural and not caked, you have to use very little spread it a lot and compromise the coverage.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results. Nicely covered a raspberry birthmark on the face and a dark mole on the leg. Best coverage I&#x27;ve found for these things, leaving them almost not visible.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cover as expected. It does lighten the area.</li>
            <li> I wanted to respond to the negative reviews.  I too had trouble with this product because of its thick texture.  I purchased mine from QVC and a brush came with it.  I put my tube of product in my bra between the girls and it warmed the product up enough to thin it out.  I use very little and the brush spreads and feathers it on so beautifully.  It covers my rosacea, doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and it stays on all day for me.  My skin is like a sponge and my makeup is usually gone in a couple of hours.  This stuff works for me, and it is lasting forever!  The brushes are great, they don&#x27;t lose little bristles like other brushes do.  The also clean very easily with a tiny drop of baby shampoo or dawn.  So give it a try after warming it up, it really helps</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! You only need an itty bitty tiny amount, so it&#x27;s going to last a while, which helps me justify the price. It goes on smoothly, is easy to blend, and covers dark circles like a dream. Great product!</li>
            <li> I received the package -- and it feels like 90% of the product is used. I swear, the first time I pressed down on the tube it was difficult (almost impossible) to get out. This isn&#x27;t a sample size, what gives? I can&#x27;t really give a good review on the actual product because I have an icky feeling that this may have been probed in a Target beauty aisle or something,</li>
            <li> best eye under cover, use proper applications, you need very little and use a soft brush</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and it truly does get rid of dark under eye circles and other small imperfections.  I even turned my grown daughter on to it (and she is allergic to everything!)  The secret is to use VERY LITTLE of the product -- sometimes just run your finger around the bottle cap opening and just press it on, then wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> on time delivery;as described</li>
            <li> It has a very good coverage and you only need a small amount for a full coverage. Downside is that it&#x27;s a little bit drying for people who have dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> This is too mask-like and cakey for me.  I could not use this under my eyes.  I suspect someone younger with oily skin would be able to make this work, but even with lots of moisturizer,  a tiny amount of product and an airbrush concealer brush, I could not get a natural effect.</li>
            <li> Wish it were just a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love IT cosmetics. The under eye is great, but I don&#x27;t need that cause I have bags, not dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the middle of getting rid of all my cosmetics and replacing them with IT. My skin is very sensitive and I break out&lt;br /&gt;very easily, and I have not had that problem with IT.  Thank You so much, I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great job of hiding dark circles!  Especially on an old lady!</li>
            <li> I have very fair, very sensitive skin and just turned 40... and I&#x27;ve struggled for at least the past 5+ years with dark circles under my eyes. My dermatologist basically said it&#x27;s genetics and aging, and there&#x27;s nothing that can be done for them other than makeup. I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different concealers over the years, and nothing has worked very well. My best bets so far (which I alternate between) have been I.D. Bare Minerals Bisque powder, Benefit Eye Brightener pencil (the pale pink blends into my pale skin fairly well), and Benefit Erase Paste. They&#x27;re an improvement (over nothing and over other products), but still weren&#x27;t quite leaving me satisfied, and sometimes they didn&#x27;t wear/last well with other makeup and activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing several online reviews raving about Bye Bye Under Eye, I decided to give it a try... and so far (after a handful of uses), I&#x27;m VERY pleased. It&#x27;s still not perfect (there&#x27;s still SOME shading under the eye), but the before/after difference is REMARKABLE.  The light color is perfect on my uber pale skin, and whether I go just with the Bye Bye and a little eyeliner/mascara or do a full face of makeup with foundation, powder, eye shadow, and the works over the concealer, it looks great, *almost* does away completely with the darkness under my eyes and in the inner corner by my nose, and doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup. If this keeps working this well, I will be a permanent customer!</li>
            <li> Best undereye concealer I&#x27;ve ever used!  Great coverage without caking.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, however was unusable due to gritty sand like texture.</li>
            <li> Great pigment with only a dot size of concealer. Use it as primer on lids. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  The best concealer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this product. I gave it 4 stars because I find the medium too dark and the light too light.</li>
            <li> I purchases this only to find its made in china. For those who dont care than ive heard this is an excellent product. But if your like me and you dont want to use anything that absorbs or goes into your body thats been made I  china; fair warning.</li>
            <li> IT Bye-Bye is my go to. Not only as a great concealer but also as cover mark for fine veins in the face, etc. Stays on all day. Does not cake or look &amp;#34;mask like.&amp;#34; Love it!</li>
            <li> This works great. Yes it goes on thick but that&#x27;s what helps with the coverage. If it&#x27;s too thick, I suggest mixing it with a little of your eye cream before applying. You only need a very little. This little tube will last forever. I got the Fair color and I should of gotten the next shade up for my skin, especially when it is summer and I am tanner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if another shade would be better, but I hit my eye and it caused a black eye.  It helps, but could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, as always, Amazon.  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! New favorite concealer! Covers fine lines and looks smooth while doing it. Doesn&#x27;t crease or barely cover the shadow from my deep set eyes! Looks fantastic! Here&#x27;s a pic of me in low lighting which would normally show undereye discoloration and shadow.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of good things about this one, and I totally agree. It is really good, probably the best I have tryed so far.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!... you will need a lite powder to set as this product is pretty greasy and will make your eyeliner run.  Just apply small amount, blend and then pat with some powder to set.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage, applies silky and seamlessly. Excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Probably the best concealer that I have found.  The lightest color matches my skin tone.  You can use only a very, very small amount.  Very nice. This one was another purchase and was for my daughter.  I have one also.</li>
            <li> My wife had heard great things about the coverage for dark circles but she said it applies very thickly and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the hype. Still decent as a regular cover up if you can apply it thin and don&#x27;t have very dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> A little tough to apply without pulling. Yes, I&#x27;m supposed to pat it on very gently or use a brush, not swipe it under my eyes with my finger, but I&#x27;d still like to find something as good but with a little more slip to it. But, it looks great, and it takes so little product to get the right look, one tube is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great item and works wonders for my undereyes and stays put all day!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This concealer is quite thick and it takes just a very little bit to get full coverage.  It stays on all day and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts.</li>
            <li> happy with product and transaction.</li>
