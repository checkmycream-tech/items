            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful purchase.  </li>
            <li>great, no streaking and cleans well off skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but didn&#x27;t cover my gray...</li>
            <li>No itch, color&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>She always uses this and is happy with it.</li>
            <li>- the 3 pk is great</li>
            <li>All in all a good deal</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Easier to acquire here as in stores of any kind</li>
            <li>I choose a shade lighter than my own</li>
            <li>Item was fine, packaging not so good</li>
            <li>Many people use this.&lt;br /&gt;Covers</li>
            <li>I love the product, but one of the three packages had a lid screwed on incorrectly so it had leaked out and destroyed the box and made the hair color unusable.  </li>
            <li>GIVES A VERY NICE NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very gentle and non-damaging as permanent colors may be.</li>
            <li>It has undergone formula changes over the years, but I have been consistently happy with the outcome and have tried different colors.  </li>
            <li>I found these packets very useful and bought this offer specifically to obtain them.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and LOVE ION.</li>
            <li>My stylist compliments me on my color because it looks natural and works with the color variation in my own hair to make highlights.</li>
            <li>I love the color and how gentle is is to my hair,</li>
            <li>I have tried another brand of a dark blond non-permanent color and was not as happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product pretty much since it came on the market and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Natural Instinct temporary color for many years.</li>
            <li>For the last few years, I have used the light blond or the medium blond and been very happy with both.</li>
            <li>I am about 40% (some areas are nearly 100% white) and the rest a faded warm light blondish color (used to be a light redhead).</li>
            <li>just what I expected - so nice to have it brought right to the front door</li>
            <li>THAT FIRST BOX ALSO DID NOT COVER THE GRAY</li>
            <li>THE SECOND BOX HAD MORE ITEMS</li>
            <li>THAT I THUS HAD STREAKS OF THE BLONDE WHICH IS OKAY.</li>
            <li>On the other hand the Sunflower G8 medium golden blond color does do a great job of blending in my predominantly grey and I get compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>Like others who have commented I do not understand why Clairol is making this great and useful color so difficult to obtain and why the packets were not provided as promised.                 </li>
            <li>I used to think this was the best, but they changed the formulation and my scalp started to itch like crazy.</li>
            <li>It is not approved for direct application to the skin by the FDA!!</li>
            <li>I use this to cover gray even though I am naturally a brunette because the gray roots don&#x27;t show as readily.  </li>
            <li>The FDA apparently feels that it is unsafe to use PPD for uses such as tattoos but safe enough to apply directly onto your scalp.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was just as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the price and special order.</li>
            <li>NO AMONIA AND NO HARSH CHEMICALS.</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts 04</li>
            <li>The only legal use of PPD in cosmetics is as a hair dye.</li>
            <li>Hair dye is in direct contact with the skin for sometimes up to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>People always think it is my natural color.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural appearance to my hair.</li>
            <li>The only product I could find that doesn&#x27;t use this is  ION 8N Light Natural Blonde, used with a sensitive skin developer (I mixed them 1:1).</li>
            <li>The products seemed to be older than the products currently on store shelves.</li>
            <li>I did some googling and found this to be a universal complaint voiced loudly across many channels.</li>
            <li>I have moved to a new area and my local stores do not carry this color so</li>
            <li>and it looks natural (ie no red over tones).  </li>
            <li>I have tried to get this particulaar shade of natural instincts at many stores and have been unable to.  </li>
            <li>THE FIRST BOX OF PRODUCT WAS MISSING ITEMS WHICH I DISCOVERED WHEN DID HAIR SECOND TIME.</li>

            <li> Just as stated on description.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover gray even though I am naturally a brunette because the gray roots don&#x27;t show as readily.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST BOX OF PRODUCT WAS MISSING ITEMS WHICH I DISCOVERED WHEN DID HAIR SECOND TIME. THAT FIRST BOX ALSO DID NOT COVER THE GRAY YET KEPLT ON OVER THIRTY MINUTES AND IT HAD PEROXIDE AND COLORING STUFF. THE SECOND BOX HAD MORE ITEMS AND I KEPT IT ON OVER THIRTY MINUTES, TOO. THAT SECOND ONE COEVRED GREY TO EXTENT THAT I THUS HAD STREAKS OF THE BLONDE WHICH IS OKAY. I HAVE NOT OPENED THE THIRD BOX.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  NO AMONIA AND NO HARSH CHEMICALS. GIVES A VERY NICE NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easier to acquire here as in stores of any kind it&#x27;s hard to find. Many people use this.&lt;br /&gt;Covers great, no streaking and cleans well off skin.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about the omission of the promised &amp;#34;Includes Natural Instincts Week 2 Color Refresher, a conditioning creme formula that deposits color pigments 15 days after coloring&amp;#34;.  That were supposed to come with this offer.  I found these packets very useful and bought this offer specifically to obtain them. I would like to know how to contact the Shipper to have those provided.   On the other hand the Sunflower G8 medium golden blond color does do a great job of blending in my predominantly grey and I get compliments on the color.  Like others who have commented I do not understand why Clairol is making this great and useful color so difficult to obtain and why the packets were not provided as promised.                 Natural Instincts 04 Sunflower medium golden blond is essential for covering delicate gray hair (the number has changed).  CVS has stopped carrying this color which is a big mistake.  I will now shop where I can get what I want.</li>
            <li> Item was fine, packaging not so good</li>
            <li> I love the product, but one of the three packages had a lid screwed on incorrectly so it had leaked out and destroyed the box and made the hair color unusable.  It was too much trouble to send it back so I just ignored it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but didn&#x27;t cover my gray... Have used it for years, but time to find a new color, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I used to think this was the best, but they changed the formulation and my scalp started to itch like crazy. I did some googling and found this to be a universal complaint voiced loudly across many channels. Then I found that this and almost every other hair color &#x27;contains Phenylenediamine / PPD (or the even stronger TDS), which is an aniline dye also known as a coal tar dye. Basically, it is petroleum. It is a substance used in rubber chemicals, photo developer, oil, gasoline, ink, textile dyes, and, of course, hair dye. The only legal use of PPD in cosmetics is as a hair dye. It is not approved for direct application to the skin by the FDA!! Hair dye is in direct contact with the skin for sometimes up to 30 minutes. The FDA apparently feels that it is unsafe to use PPD for uses such as tattoos but safe enough to apply directly onto your scalp.&#x27; The only product I could find that doesn&#x27;t use this is  ION 8N Light Natural Blonde, used with a sensitive skin developer (I mixed them 1:1). Amazon and Sally Beauty Carry ION. I used it for the first time and LOVE ION. No itch, color&#x27;s great and I feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used Natural Instinct temporary color for many years. People always think it is my natural color. Very easy to use and very gentle and non-damaging as permanent colors may be.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It gives a natural appearance to my hair.</li>
            <li> These hair dyes are perfect for covering my grey hair without getting that horrible roots showing thing from perminant dyes.  I choose a shade lighter than my own (I tried the same shade and it seems to make my hair too dard and too obviously dyed) and it looks natural (ie no red over tones).  It lasts as stated on the box.  The cost is quite a deal and if you use the subscribe and save you never have to worry about remembering to order... All in all a good deal and I will keep using it until I decide to let my grey hang out for everyone to see.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful purchase.  I will be purchasing this product again.  It is my color and cannot be purchased&lt;br /&gt;locally.</li>
            <li> One of the packages was leaking and not worth the hassle to return it. The products seemed to be older than the products currently on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product pretty much since it came on the market and love it.  It has undergone formula changes over the years, but I have been consistently happy with the outcome and have tried different colors.  For the last few years, I have used the light blond or the medium blond and been very happy with both. I am about 40% (some areas are nearly 100% white) and the rest a faded warm light blondish color (used to be a light redhead). I leave it on for 15-20 minutes depending on how long it has been since the last color.  One color lasts me about 7 weeks with no touch-up.  I haven&#x27;t used the refresh packets and my color lasts and changes gradually. My stylist compliments me on my color because it looks natural and works with the color variation in my own hair to make highlights. I think the semi-permanent color is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife.  She always uses this and is happy with it.</li>
            <li> just what I expected - so nice to have it brought right to the front door - the 3 pk is great</li>
            <li> I have tried to get this particulaar shade of natural instincts at many stores and have been unable to.  I love the color and how gentle is is to my hair,</li>
            <li> I have used this color for several years.  I have moved to a new area and my local stores do not carry this color so, i ordered on-line.  It arrived quickly and was just as I expected.  I have tried another brand of a dark blond non-permanent color and was not as happy.</li>
            <li> This product not only didn&#x27;t cover gray, but it didn&#x27;t grab my hair at all.  Not worth the price and special order.</li>
