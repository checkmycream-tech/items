            <li>so you cant put them on your nails right</li>
            <li>All of the little bows came perfectly and in a cute little package c:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These were NOT worth waiting a month for even though it was a good price.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these but the backs of them are flat, not curved to fit better on nails.</li>

            <li>but maybe if the packaging was just a tiny bit better they would&#x27;ve survived the shipping.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i won&#x27;t order big bow tie any more ,</li>
            <li>Just as pictured without all the pretty lighting.</li>
            <li>The bows are cute, slightly larger than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors it comes withðŸ˜¸!!!</li>
            <li>other then that their really cute and fun to use!</li>
            <li>I thought these would be almost like stickers, flat and easily able to stick to nails.  </li>
            <li>Just look good in picture , its littler bit big for finger nails, all my client pick the smaller one , after that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping didn&#x27;t take too long and they&#x27;re really cute.</li>
            <li>This product got here a few weeks early BUT most bows had no matches or too many matches.</li>
            <li>They came I&#x27;m happy with the amount of black bows I read in the reviews before buying people only got one I got 4 of each color</li>
            <li>So dont see much use of them.</li>
            <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>But all in all they arrived fast and are what they say.</li>
            <li>im very upset</li>
            <li>i will recommend to family and friends thanks</li>
            <li>but I have my real nails</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t look like the picture, they look cheap and are too big for nails.</li>
            <li>I have all ready put these bows on peoples</li>
            <li>These are 3D and way to big to even fit on my nails.  </li>
            <li>to big for nail art, but good for other craft.</li>
            <li>I have used a few and they are perfect with their little polka dots!</li>
            <li>When I tried to gently heat them with a curling iron, hoping to bend them a little to curve the, they promptly snapped in half.&lt;br /&gt;These would be cute to glue to sunglass frames, cell phones, scarpbooking, etc...</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, but they stick up high off the nail and there&#x27;s only 1 purple bow, 1 hot pink, and 1 orange....</li>
            <li>I really love these little bows</li>
            <li>i love these little bows and so did everyone else.</li>
            <li>Half of the bows are not painted fully and they look like the top of an old school phone handle rather than a bow.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little bigger than I expected and the colors aren&#x27;t nearly as cute as what was shown, but they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>If you had fake nails they would be perfect but they are to wide for mine.</li>
            <li>They are cute but there were not enough of the colors I liked, making it impossible to do both hands in an identical design.  </li>
            <li>first let me start by saying it took extremely long for me to receive them</li>
            <li>But my bows look far from the picture shown.</li>
            <li>The colors are not the same as in photo, I got teal, yellow, white, salmon, hot and light pink.</li>
            <li>No black.</li>
            <li>I threw them out, they were so big they were not even remotely realistic to wear.</li>
            <li>and thats not the bad part because the bows that came in were beautiful</li>
            <li>Love the colors but too big &amp; thick to use on nails.</li>
            <li>Ridiculously thick and huge, no way u can put em on, u would have to put loads of acrylic to hold the bows in place</li>
            <li>if your looking to have 2 of the same bow steer clear or order 2.</li>
            <li>These are pretty colors however;  have ruffled edges and loop upward odd shape.  </li>
            <li>and when ever i try to put them on they slide and mess up the whole nail</li>
            <li>are so large that they would not fit on even my thumb.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The shipping didn&#x27;t take too long and they&#x27;re really cute.</li>
            <li> This product got here a few weeks early BUT most bows had no matches or too many matches.</li>
            <li> They came I&#x27;m happy with the amount of black bows I read in the reviews before buying people only got one I got 4 of each color</li>
            <li> So dont see much use of them.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> But all in all they arrived fast and are what they say.</li>
            <li> im very upset</li>
            <li> i will recommend to family and friends thanks</li>
            <li> but I have my real nails</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t look like the picture, they look cheap and are too big for nails.</li>
            <li> I have all ready put these bows on peoples</li>
            <li> These are 3D and way to big to even fit on my nails.  </li>
            <li> to big for nail art, but good for other craft.</li>
            <li> I have used a few and they are perfect with their little polka dots!</li>
            <li> When I tried to gently heat them with a curling iron, hoping to bend them a little to curve the, they promptly snapped in half.&lt;br /&gt;These would be cute to glue to sunglass frames, cell phones, scarpbooking, etc...</li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, but they stick up high off the nail and there&#x27;s only 1 purple bow, 1 hot pink, and 1 orange....</li>
            <li> I really love these little bows</li>
            <li> i love these little bows and so did everyone else.</li>
            <li> Half of the bows are not painted fully and they look like the top of an old school phone handle rather than a bow.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bigger than I expected and the colors aren&#x27;t nearly as cute as what was shown, but they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> If you had fake nails they would be perfect but they are to wide for mine.</li>
            <li> They are cute but there were not enough of the colors I liked, making it impossible to do both hands in an identical design.  </li>
            <li> first let me start by saying it took extremely long for me to receive them</li>
            <li> But my bows look far from the picture shown.</li>
            <li> The colors are not the same as in photo, I got teal, yellow, white, salmon, hot and light pink.</li>
            <li> No black.</li>
            <li> I threw them out, they were so big they were not even remotely realistic to wear.</li>
            <li> and thats not the bad part because the bows that came in were beautiful</li>
            <li> Love the colors but too big &amp; thick to use on nails.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously thick and huge, no way u can put em on, u would have to put loads of acrylic to hold the bows in place</li>
            <li> if your looking to have 2 of the same bow steer clear or order 2.</li>
            <li> These are pretty colors however;  have ruffled edges and loop upward odd shape.  </li>
            <li> and when ever i try to put them on they slide and mess up the whole nail</li>
            <li> are so large that they would not fit on even my thumb.</li>
            <li> My favorites are the hot pink with white polka dots and the black with white.</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly for the black and white bows as well as the pink and white.</li>
            <li> but i dont know how can you put them on your finger to stay because no nail is flat and bows are.</li>
            <li> to big for the nail, and other color green, yellow, orange very ungly</li>
            <li> Thought these bows were flat turns out that they are cocked in the air</li>
            <li> They are completely flat on the bottom</li>
            <li> I just got these , I only got ONE black though which sucks as i was expecting more black ones.</li>
            <li> But unless you have long long nails these will not work on short nails.</li>
            <li> The bows came earlier than expected but they are cracked.</li>
            <li> then I expected, There were two though that the pokadots were only on have of it.</li>
            <li> , they did take a long to arrive though....</li>
            <li> They are way too big for nails, so big you cant even glue them down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wait that long to recive them about a week!</li>
            <li> There were only 4 pairs (1 black, 1 pink, and 2 white)</li>
            <li> I received only 2 black and no pink and white with mainly green bow with pink polka which I do not plan on using.</li>
            <li> These took a little while to get to me and a few of the bows only have polka dots on half of them but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> 10 bows were broken and it was all the pretty colors</li>
            <li> so I got one black, three white, etc.</li>
            <li> I received 5 orange/peach, 2 single-different shades of red, 3 single shades of pink, 1 black, 5 white, 3 lime green and one purple.  </li>
            <li> but i feel a little big for the nails</li>
            <li> A little big.</li>
            <li> They are plastic and a little too big.  </li>
            <li> I got these and hated them they are so huge in real life</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves them they are all intact just what i expected the price can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected w nail art.</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I will make due with what I have</li>
            <li> And because I ordered two sets the colors I didn&#x27;t get in one I got in the other.</li>
            <li> The other problem was that these have no curve to them, meaning that the edges stick up, causing them to catch on things and come off my nails.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to make small earrings for the middle school girls in family  worked</li>
            <li> but when it came, 1 of them was BROKEN and in the photo there are 3 blue and white ones</li>
            <li> Bigger then I was thinking the size of a pinky nail bed and thick like 2cmm</li>
            <li> They came early, none are broken.</li>
            <li> I think a little over a month very poor quality, cheaply made,half of them are not even painted and the other half or broken</li>
            <li> One came broke in half</li>
            <li> Polka dots missing on half of them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> and they do not fit.</li>
            <li> I got a few broken bows, but I ordered two sets so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> The bows are way to big, it seems impossible to put it on the nails except for the big finger.</li>
            <li> A little nail glue and 3D nail art is yours!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them and there really small.</li>
            <li> They look so small in the pics on here.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they didn&#x27;t actually stick on my nails with or without nail glue.</li>
            <li> not cute at all..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any of the colors in the picture and half of them were broken</li>
            <li> the black bow (the reason i ordered this set) was broken and had no pair.</li>
            <li> but one of my bows was broken in half.</li>
            <li> I received these bows and one was broken in half and at least 4 had the dots rubbed off of them.</li>
            <li> Also a few were broken and they don&#x27;t contour or curve yet</li>
            <li> Not good quality .</li>
            <li> These are way too big for my nails and have to use glue to put in :( not thrilled .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all peach and white :(</li>
            <li> Very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I did receive 20 bows, but 5 were broken to pieces.  </li>
            <li> None of them were chipped or broken.</li>
            <li> but they were broken...</li>
            <li> 4 came broken and 3-8 of them had dots that were printed wrong and can not be used.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> and I have 7 random colored ones without matches.</li>
            <li> I use them randomly in my arts and craft projects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just random colors.</li>
            <li> They come in a baggie with totally random amounts of each color</li>
            <li> : so i&#x27;m very sad about that..</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Dear lord these are horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality bow ties.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are way too big for my nails and have to use glue to put in :( not thrilled .</li>
            <li> They look cute but i dont know how can you put them on your finger to stay because no nail is flat and bows are. So dont see much use of them.</li>
            <li> I changes my nails every week lol n these bow r just what I need it there fun cute n diffrent thank u</li>
            <li> Bows are more for phone decoration than nails. There too big but very cute! The colors are not the same as in photo, I got teal, yellow, white, salmon, hot and light pink. No black.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They are so simple to use great for the decoration and easy combinate . They are totally cute  . If you likebto decorate  you nails in 3 D is a must have</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them she takes them into the place where she gets her nails done and they get the biggest poop out of a good deal</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  i love them</li>
            <li> Not good quality . Polka dots missing on half of them. Very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them and there really small. Not a big bag</li>
            <li> I received these bows and one was broken in half and at least 4 had the dots rubbed off of them. These were NOT worth waiting a month for even though it was a good price. Out of 20 bows, 5 aren&#x27;t even usable. I contacted the seller about the damaged bows and got no response. It&#x27;s over a week later and I still have yet to receive a response.</li>
            <li> These were much much larger than what I was expecting. They look so small in the pics on here. Sad.</li>
            <li> some of the bows never got the dots painted on! took forever to get here.i was also disapointed there were only one bow of some and not sets. if your looking to have 2 of the same bow steer clear or order 2.</li>
            <li> to big for nail art, but good for other craft. different color than on the picture. But its not bothering me</li>
            <li> The bows came earlier than expected but they are cracked. I could of only use have of it. Maybe it was just me, but I would recommend anyone to purchase these bows. But they look PRETTY.</li>
            <li> Cute but bigger then I expected. I used them one time and haven&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> All colors did not have pairs definitely not 20 ..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these but the backs of them are flat, not curved to fit better on nails. If they would&#x27;ve been curved then I probably would&#x27;ve given them five stars. The colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> Liked the bows were pretty good size not too to big like the others. Overall pretty satisfied need 3 more words</li>
            <li> I received my product before the estimated arrival date, but that&#x27;s the only good thing about it.  I did receive 20 bows, but 5 were broken to pieces.  There were only 4 pairs (1 black, 1 pink, and 2 white) and I have 7 random colored ones without matches. I will make due with what I have but maybe if the packaging was just a tiny bit better they would&#x27;ve survived the shipping.</li>
            <li> These are great, bigger then I expected, There were two though that the pokadots were only on have of it. But the price is so good I didn&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> These are some pretty cute bows I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet on my nails I will be going to get them done this weekend, they did take a long to arrive though....</li>
            <li> Recieved these asap loved them super cute for 3d nail art and cell phn cases! Didn&#x27;t wait that long to recive them about a week! Great company I recieved a niece extra gift. ;)</li>
            <li> Just look good in picture , its littler bit big for finger nails, all my client pick the smaller one , after that&#x27;s i won&#x27;t order big bow tie any more ,</li>
            <li> They stay on perfect when applied to the nail with a small bead of acrylic.</li>
            <li> these are so cute! I use them randomly in my arts and craft projects. I will probably have to order more!</li>
            <li> These are just as cute as they are in the picture! I&#x27;m really excited to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping didn&#x27;t take too long and they&#x27;re really cute.</li>
            <li> first let me start by saying it took extremely long for me to receive them I think a little over a month very poor quality, cheaply made,half of them are not even painted and the other half or broken I think I got One to three good Bows and that is it.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured without all the pretty lighting. Haha. I got a few broken bows, but I ordered two sets so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. And because I ordered two sets the colors I didn&#x27;t get in one I got in the other. Decent for the price. :]</li>
            <li> Love the colors but too big &amp; thick to use on nails. Better off for decorating cell phone cases or something</li>
            <li> Half of the bows are not painted fully and they look like the top of an old school phone handle rather than a bow. Oh well, atleast they&#x27;re cheap. I tried to add a pic to this review, but it wouldn&#x27;t process. But my bows look far from the picture shown. They&#x27;re super skinny and not flared out on the ends.</li>
            <li> I love the look and they are what you say in the order. But unless you have long long nails these will not work on short nails. I do alot of short nails and these will not work for me but I will find a use for them some how. But all in all they arrived fast and are what they say. I want to Thank you for such good service. Thank you again</li>
            <li> It was not exactly what I expected. The bows are way to big, it seems impossible to put it on the nails except for the big finger. I don&#x27;t like the colors, I basically received red bows not multi colors. I do not like them at all.</li>
            <li> to big for the nail, and other color green, yellow, orange very ungly</li>
            <li> I love the 3d art it doesn&#x27;t cost alot there cute i want more lol for real there worth it there worrh the wait</li>
            <li> I like them very cute can&#x27;t want to use waiting on my  other things fore amazon so I can  get start it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any of the colors in the picture and half of them were broken DO NOT BUY! Waste of money</li>
            <li> This product got here a few weeks early BUT most bows had no matches or too many matches. the black bow (the reason i ordered this set) was broken and had no pair. im very upset</li>
            <li> Bigger then I was thinking the size of a pinky nail bed and thick like 2cmm but everything was great I used them on my ring finger</li>
            <li> i got these today 1/2/2014 my daughter loves them they are all intact just what i expected the price can&#x27;t be beat i will recommend to family and friends thanks</li>
            <li> These bows are so cute and stay on so well they don&#x27;t snag anything because they&#x27;re kind of flat. love</li>
            <li> These are adorable and for the price and being from China I didn&#x27;t return.  4 came broken and 3-8 of them had dots that were printed wrong and can not be used.</li>
            <li> I threw them out, they were so big they were not even remotely realistic to wear. I wish I would have had a better idea of the product before ordering it.</li>
            <li> I like these bows! They arrived 12days after I ordered them and they were all in one piece. I received four of every color, black,white,hot pink,light pink,and red. They came just in time for my 4th of July nails! Yay!</li>
            <li> The bows are cute, slightly larger than I thought.</li>
            <li> I wanted pokodot bows and I got roses. Not at all pleased but I will try them out as I have no choice but to.</li>
            <li> Came a week sooner than time estimated. Like I said in my headline, they are just ok. They are big but that&#x27;s to be expected w nail art. One came broke in half so now I only have 19 pieces instead of 20. They do NOT come in pairs!! It&#x27;s just random colors.</li>
            <li> I loved the look of these and I was super excited when they arrived. Sadly, they didn&#x27;t actually stick on my nails with or without nail glue. I wish these worked because they are adorable, but they jut sit in a plastic container. I would not recommend buying them, but I would love it if someone bought these and got them to work. I&#x27;d love to know how they did it.</li>
            <li> Thought these bows were flat turns out that they are cocked in the air</li>
            <li> As others have said, the photo does not reflect the color assortment you actually get.  I received 5 orange/peach, 2 single-different shades of red, 3 single shades of pink, 1 black, 5 white, 3 lime green and one purple.  They are cute but there were not enough of the colors I liked, making it impossible to do both hands in an identical design.  The other problem was that these have no curve to them, meaning that the edges stick up, causing them to catch on things and come off my nails.  When I tried to gently heat them with a curling iron, hoping to bend them a little to curve the, they promptly snapped in half.&lt;br /&gt;These would be cute to glue to sunglass frames, cell phones, scarpbooking, etc... but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for nail art.</li>
            <li> I thought these were really cute but I have my real nails and they do not fit. If you had fake nails they would be perfect but they are to wide for mine.</li>
            <li> Although I love them, they just would not stay on.</li>
            <li> None of them were chipped or broken. All of the little bows came perfectly and in a cute little package c:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember if it shows you this in the picture but theres a red bow with white polkadots c:</li>
            <li> I got these for nail art.. but they are way too big to put on your nails. If you want to use these for crafts.. that&#x27;d be better. They are cute .. just not for nails.</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t look like the picture, they look cheap and are too big for nails. not a lot of different colors.</li>
            <li> My clients  loved them</li>
            <li> Great deal great price!</li>
            <li> These are really big. But super cute.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
            <li> This nail art tips are adorable and they go on very easily. With just a tiny dot of top coat or nail glue, the cute bows stick for days. I really love them and my friends love them too.</li>
            <li> Ive put on so many layers of nail glue on my nails to try to get it to stick but it just doesnt! it literally takes forever !</li>
            <li> These are so effin HUGE. I couldn&#x27;t place these on my toe nails without the sides hanging over. Freaking ENORMOUS. ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> They are way too big for nails, so big you cant even glue them down. They are completely flat on the bottom so you cant put them on your nails right</li>
            <li> They came I&#x27;m happy with the amount of black bows I read in the reviews before buying people only got one I got 4 of each color</li>
            <li> Out of 20 one 3 were unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible</li>
            <li> these bows are huge and look clownish on nails.</li>
            <li> I like them. They&#x27;re a little bigger than I expected and the colors aren&#x27;t nearly as cute as what was shown, but they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> Makes nails look more interesting and lovely</li>
            <li> Ridiculously thick and huge, no way u can put em on, u would have to put loads of acrylic to hold the bows in place</li>
            <li> Their okay but one of my bows was broken in half.</li>
            <li> I really love these little bows they are really cute and look so nice on nails. I love all the different colors it comes withðŸ˜¸!!!</li>
            <li> Dear lord these are horrible. They come in a baggie with totally random amounts of each color so I got one black, three white, etc. Also a few were broken and they don&#x27;t contour or curve yet are so large that they would not fit on even my thumb.</li>
            <li> These took a little while to get to me and a few of the bows only have polka dots on half of them but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality bow ties. Look cheap and deformed.  They look nothing like they did in the picture when I was ordering them</li>
            <li> To big, for my nails...</li>
            <li> These will look great and I&#x27;m going to be the envy of all the woman yes yes yes great I love them</li>
            <li> I bought these to make small earrings for the middle school girls in family  worked</li>
            <li> Okay so i ordered these cute bows and waited almost a month just for them to come in. they FINALLY arrive and they&#x27;re not the bows i ordered! and thats not the bad part because the bows that came in were beautiful so i would have has no complaints if it would have came with 20 instead of 10</li>
            <li> They are really cute, but the mint colored ones were my favorite but they were broken...10 bows were broken and it was all the pretty colors D: so i&#x27;m very sad about that..Otherwise they are really adorable.. Took like 4-5 weeks to arrive tho D;</li>
            <li> they are really big for nails</li>
            <li> They are very cute !!&lt;br /&gt;i Love the colors of them .&lt;br /&gt;i Definitly give this product  5 stars .</li>
            <li> I love these. They do stick out and can snag. They are perfect for the thumb nail! :)</li>
            <li> they dont stay on the nail at all and when ever i try to put them on they slide and mess up the whole nail</li>
            <li> i love these little bows and so did everyone else. i used them for my nails and everyone ask me who did my nails of course i tell them where i got my bows</li>
            <li> there cute but i feel a little big for the nails and i would not get them again for that</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves them they were the last of three items I ordered to show it shipped the same day I ordered as well :). I was excited to them show before the actual projected date to and though it was last to show up you know &amp;#34;Save the best for last&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, but they stick up high off the nail and there&#x27;s only 1 purple bow, 1 hot pink, and 1 orange....it&#x27;s all peach and white :( Not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a 0 I would...they don&#x27;t look anything like the pictures... not cute at all.. and way too big to use on nails.</li>
            <li> THEY WASN&#x27;T WHAT I EXSPECT. I GAVE THEM TO MY LIL NEICES. TO PLAY WITH FOR THEY DRESS UP DOLLS.</li>
            <li> I love these pretty poke dot bows look good on junk nails. I have all ready put these bows on peoples nails.thank you</li>
            <li> They came early, none are broken. They are the right colors and exactly as described. I have used a few and they are perfect with their little polka dots! My favorites are the hot pink with white polka dots and the black with white. They are perfect, the right size, and awesome! A little nail glue and 3D nail art is yours!</li>
            <li> A little big. But my clients love them!!</li>
            <li> i like the color, but i&#x27;ve not used them yet... don&#x27;t use with glue only, they don&#x27;t stay on the nail with nail glue only!</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> cheap and looks like cracker jack trash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and product but when it came, 1 of them was BROKEN and in the photo there are 3 blue and white ones but I only got 1 of them;(</li>
            <li> I bought these bows for myself I&#x27;m 15 and very interested in nail art. I bought these mainly for the black and white bows as well as the pink and white. I received only 2 black and no pink and white with mainly green bow with pink polka which I do not plan on using. I recommend buying fimo bows instead.</li>
            <li> These are not my favorite.  These are pretty colors however;  have ruffled edges and loop upward odd shape.  Some where cracked when I received them.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be almost like stickers, flat and easily able to stick to nails.  These are 3D and way to big to even fit on my nails.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nothing to drive home about.  They are plastic and a little too big.  I also only received 15 so yes just meh...</li>
            <li> This set it a must have, very nicely cut designs, easy to apply on nails, very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have an obsession with all the 3d art for nails and these bows are very adorable and have gotten a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> I just got these , I only got ONE black though which sucks as i was expecting more black ones. Their alittle bit bigger then i was expecting. other then that their really cute and fun to use!</li>
            <li> They are really cute!!</li>
            <li> I got these and hated them they are so huge in real life</li>
