            <li>looks better in picture .</li>
            <li>but I will give just 4 stars because I was expecting more hair in the mannequin head.</li>
            <li>Will def be buying more.</li>
            <li>Definitely on of the best mannequins I have purchased and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>She luv it and is able to do everything with the hair she want to.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll let you know :)</li>
            <li>and i already fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it, its just like brazilian hair</li>
            <li>I think she will love braiding and styling it.  </li>
            <li>I think she will love it.</li>
            <li>of which i was satisfied with neither.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to style it: braid, wedding hair, buns, etc.</li>
            <li>The tripod may have been a more practical accessory.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li>She has thoroughly enjoyed styling this mannequin hair over and over and over.  </li>
            <li>She is enjoying her head, and I will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this Mannequin head.</li>
            <li>it was much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this doll head.</li>
            <li>It now has some thinness on the top and I cut most of the length off.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter...said it was better than the ones they give them at beauty school</li>
            <li>LOVE this mannequin have done LOTS of color and Updos</li>
            <li>Hair is gorgeous and the exact length as described.</li>
            <li>, hair shed&#x27;s a bit more than a better quality mannequin, but for practicing updos and braids it is fine.</li>
            <li>she has perfect long hair!</li>
            <li>Hair is good condition and much thicker then most mannequin heads.</li>
            <li>This product is a great purchase for any young lady that enjoys designing hair styles.</li>
            <li>I received this yesterday &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how &#x27;real&#x27; the hair quality was, perfect to work with.</li>
            <li>Sections easily and realistically.</li>
            <li>This manikin has a strong smell of bleach.</li>
            <li>Very good for the price and was just right for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>Lifelike features and very nice hair very well done</li>
            <li>they are pretty nice quality.</li>
            <li>Quality seems fine, if the length does not matter to you.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but the stitching of the hair into the head must not be done well because it literally sheds out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li>I really only use this mannequin, the hair is great quality,silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m have to say I did it my money worth, and is satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>If you are needing a real human hair head to practice on, then this is absolutely the best deal around!  </li>
            <li>i love this mannequin, it has the perfect amount of hair, not to thin its super long perfect for updos and can take the heat</li>
            <li>It is a great price for how long the hair is</li>
            <li>But she is great for praticing haircuts and long hair design.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described  shipping was prompt and  We were both absolultely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Lots of fun at Halloween when I put a mask on her and anchored stand on a table!</li>
            <li>Ordered this to train for special occasion hair dos.</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and easy to manage, but I wish these dolls had better faces</li>
            <li>Price is much cheaper for more hair than I could find any where else.</li>
            <li>Good quality real human hair</li>
            <li>really good quality human hair could&#x27;ve been thicker</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>this head was better than the ones I can get at my local Armstrong mccall and way better than the ones we had in school..</li>
            <li>The main reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars is because the mannequin hair was not 24&amp;#34; it was more like 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>By the way, my daughter wants to buy another with her allowance because the price is so reasonable and this product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>We have been able to do most everything you can do on real human hair.</li>
            <li>what my grand daughter wanted&amp;#34; for her class finishing up cosmetology at East Bay High School in Tampa Bay Florida area.  </li>
            <li>but overall i am very pleased</li>
            <li>The length is perfect too, not too long &amp; not too short.</li>
            <li>yes I have curled and bloodied her hair on high heat and it has not melted off!!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for school, thank you!</li>
            <li>the hair is the right size and much better looking than other dolls good buy and would recommend to all who look at this thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it because it has the right length to work braids and such, however the length is not even</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really care about the length of the hair, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Great for little girls...</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for</li>
            <li>the hair is fun to work on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing she liked was the length.</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth almost 50 dollars but it works well with heat</li>
            <li>The appealing part of this product is that it has real hair which is much easier to work with than those made of synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li>Has real hair, length is good, its human hair so it can be washed, blow dryed and curled or pressed.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old grand daughter.</li>
            <li>I used a 40 volume developer with the bleach and her hair handled it pretty good, again, better than dolls I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>She is having fun with it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the clamp that goes with this, but in retrospect, do not think that accessory is useful.</li>
            <li>Loving the 100% human hair.</li>
            <li>Overall liked this and it works.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, but I did get a really nice red with some gold highlights</li>
            <li>The only thing i dont like is she sheds a lot, other then that, she&#x27;s great:)</li>
            <li>And super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>; so the cuts look really stringy until you take off a significant amount of length.</li>
            <li>Other than that is good for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>This product appears to have a deep tan, however, this mannequin has very light skin and is Caucasian.</li>
            <li>The hair curls very well with any hot tools!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look as funny.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a licensed cosmetologist and the first thing she did was smell the hair and said it smells synthetic.  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture and its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even put a hair brush to it yet, just a bit of gentle hand combing &amp; it has started shedding !</li>
            <li>She is not weird looking either.</li>
            <li>Being as I had 4 boys styling hair was never an issue until the 5 granddaughters ;)</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite present!</li>
            <li>exactly wat</li>
            <li>it is human hair (most of it)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and it may not be my last:)</li>
            <li>the hair was smooth and soft..</li>
            <li>her face looks funny</li>
            <li>Anyway, shipment came on time and the item was exactly as described..</li>
            <li>Though it didnt look exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for;)</li>
            <li>First impressions this is not quality.</li>
            <li>able to wrap a quick wet set on her without first hacking away four inches of scraggle.  </li>
            <li>True to length easy to create long hair styles</li>
            <li>It has little hair and the hair fall off very easily, it is getting bold after a couple of times of braiding.</li>
            <li>Is a good head for training, the hair have good quality but could be a little longer because a hair with at least 80 cm in length for braiding is required.</li>
            <li>I know the ones I used in beauty school were much better quality, however that was a long time ago.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty much like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>The hair is super soft, before and after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering a few more of these heads!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s done many different hairdos and she&#x27;s a professional now!</li>
            <li>her hair is a little bit shorter than on the picture but still is a nice length.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more money but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast.</li>
            <li>how reasonably priced it is.</li>
            <li>Not too much hair pulling out though</li>
            <li>the hair was really then hair..</li>
            <li>I really like this mannequin</li>
            <li>and it will be interesting to see if the seller responds to my email to them stating that it is not real hair as claimed.  </li>
            <li>Would have made life much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I pulled this out in my cosmetology class and my classmates asked me where did I get that it has so much hair.  </li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>just as i expected and more</li>
            <li>as much like 1 or 2 strands came out</li>
            <li>It is real hair.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much hair in sink.  </li>
            <li>And I really wanted it to</li>
            <li>Ends are very raggedy.</li>
            <li>i did not expect the amount of hair nor the size/shape of the head to be like a real person..</li>
            <li>Dolled did not look like picture, skin is a lot lighter which doesn&#x27;t really matter but just saying.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and it really exceeded our expectations, we even gave it a name ðŸ˜€.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>And her face is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for cutting, styling, braiding, anything you like to practice.</li>
            <li>I bought the doll to practice bleaching and using different colors before doing the same to my own hair.</li>
            <li>But after a couple if washes the glue started to come out and the plastic smell started to subside, but I noticed when I rolled her first perm that she had way more hair around her front hair line and less towards her nape.</li>
            <li>She loves the long silky hair and with the Manikin holder it makes for easily doing hair styles.  </li>
            <li>Best manikin head for that price.the hair was soft and long I was shocked at how nice it was.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old is interested in cosmetology and loves this manikin</li>
            <li>Mannequin came very quick and had all the length I expected.</li>
            <li>If you want a great mannequin, at an amazing price definitely buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was highly pissed when I opened the box and seen that shrunken head.</li>
            <li>product is of high quality and can take what ever my aspiring stylist throws at it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as length goes, the photo is really deceiving.  </li>
            <li>Great thick long hair.</li>
            <li>I was searching for something to practice long length updos on and the hair is long and not thin and stringy at the ends like most mannequin heads.  </li>
            <li>I wish that ALL the hair was 24&amp;#34; long, so I could practice my braiding technique better, but overall it works.</li>
            <li>She is going to a vocational school for cosmetology next year.</li>
            <li>actually the whole mannequin looks exactly like the one in the pic.</li>
            <li>Hair is thick and braids nicely.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price compared to other mannequins with the same length of human hair.</li>
            <li>The price is right,  even if she doesn&#x27;t become a stylist, I can use it to practice different techniques.</li>
            <li>It did have a lot of short hairs and some not even the right color.</li>
            <li>but I still buy heads to practice new techniques...</li>
            <li>I bought this mannequin to test out new color products and techniques before trying them on clients and to practice my braiding techniques.</li>
            <li>I have been a active stylist for 5 years, and this Mannequin head is fantastic quality.  </li>
            <li>She can use hot rollers, hot curling iron, wet the hair, dye the hair.</li>
            <li>It is kind of thin and scraggly at the very ends.</li>
            <li>The length is most certainly not 24&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not even 20&amp;#34; unless you count the three scraggly hairs dangling precariously in the back.</li>
            <li>It sheds alot but the hair is very soft</li>
            <li>it smells a little bit the first time you put heat to it but works perfectly fine and smell goes away, i cut about an inch off the bottom just to get rid of some stragglers but i highly recommend this mannequin especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The hair is wonderfully long and is easy to brush and performs just like real human hair.  </li>
            <li>X-mas gift for 12 year old!  </li>
            <li>First let me say this,  i did not order this doll expecting it to be just like a human...</li>
            <li>The hairline is too far back (more forehead than hair, the eyebrows are crooked and the doll has two different color eyes.</li>
            <li>im sure some of the hair is synthetic but its just very few since i was curling the hair</li>
            <li>i ordered this on the 3rd and it was supposed to be here on the thirteenth no later and showed up on the 9th (today) Its a realy nice mannequin and the hair is in fact human and lock the only thing that bothers me</li>
            <li>The hair is nice, but very few strands of it are actually 24&amp;#34</li>
            <li>the hair is great length for cutting and is in new condition.</li>
            <li>It definitely is nowhere near 24&amp;#34;, more like 18&amp;#34; or slightly longer.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is, that the face isn&#x27;t terribly pretty like my other mannequins that are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The hair was soft when I got it.</li>
            <li>The hair has stood up well to heat and color so far.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old cousin who loves styling hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old daughter...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 yr old to practice hair on and to play with.</li>
            <li>Some people said it sheds a lot, but not with us so far.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old because she likes to do hair.</li>
            <li>This is a gift for my 13 yr old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>but the hair has a lot of gray hair and it didn&#x27;t curl like natural hair.</li>
            <li>Her hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li>It does have thick hair at the top , but at the bottom its skinny.</li>
            <li>the hairs is a little to spaced out, but it still has good medium hair, the hair &amp;#34;follicles&amp;#34; being too spaced out just makes it a little hard to get a smooth style.</li>
            <li>actaully pretty looks asian overall</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this had such high</li>
            <li>For some reason, it would not lighten like normal human hair would.</li>
            <li>, I would buy a more expensive doll because you really do get whay you pay for.</li>
            <li>, the hair is thin enough to do a nice updo.</li>
            <li>Other than that, she shed a bit of hair at first</li>
            <li>The hair is extremely thin and fringy at the last 4-5 inches at the ends, not as full as the picture represents.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just long enough, but I can&#x27;t really trim it to even it out around the bottom.</li>
            <li>It was an unexpected Christmas present to her.</li>
            <li>This doll has good hair for styling or cutting, I haven&#x27;t tried to color or lighten though.</li>
            <li>so for those reasons i am rating her based on how she compares to other mannequins, not how closely she replicates a real person....</li>
            <li>She loves it &amp; it has endured flat irons, blow dryers, curling irons &amp; numerous hairstyles &amp;  still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>Her hair is thick at the top a SUPER thin at the ends ( which I guess you could cut</li>
            <li>It has soft hair and it&#x27;s long</li>
            <li>Her hair is long and soft.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as long as the photo.  </li>
            <li>Normal amount of shedding to be expected.</li>
            <li>I had to cut off a few straggly ends but not as many as dolls I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>and it did not flat iron well and smelled of burned synthetic.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because I do need this Mannequin for my Cosmetology State Board Exam and didn&#x27;t know if it was really &amp;#34;human hair&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> but I will give just 4 stars because I was expecting more hair in the mannequin head.</li>
            <li> Will def be buying more.</li>

            <li> and i already fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love it, its just like brazilian hair</li>
            <li> I think she will love braiding and styling it.  </li>
            <li> I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> of which i was satisfied with neither.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to style it: braid, wedding hair, buns, etc.</li>
            <li> The tripod may have been a more practical accessory.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li> She has thoroughly enjoyed styling this mannequin hair over and over and over.  </li>
            <li> She is enjoying her head, and I will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this Mannequin head.</li>
            <li> it was much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this doll head.</li>
            <li> It now has some thinness on the top and I cut most of the length off.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter...said it was better than the ones they give them at beauty school</li>
            <li> LOVE this mannequin have done LOTS of color and Updos</li>
            <li> Hair is gorgeous and the exact length as described.</li>
            <li> , hair shed&#x27;s a bit more than a better quality mannequin, but for practicing updos and braids it is fine.</li>
            <li> she has perfect long hair!</li>
            <li> Hair is good condition and much thicker then most mannequin heads.</li>
            <li> This product is a great purchase for any young lady that enjoys designing hair styles.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how &#x27;real&#x27; the hair quality was, perfect to work with.</li>
            <li> Sections easily and realistically.</li>
            <li> This manikin has a strong smell of bleach.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price and was just right for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> Lifelike features and very nice hair very well done</li>
            <li> they are pretty nice quality.</li>
            <li> Quality seems fine, if the length does not matter to you.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> but the stitching of the hair into the head must not be done well because it literally sheds out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li> I really only use this mannequin, the hair is great quality,silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m have to say I did it my money worth, and is satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> If you are needing a real human hair head to practice on, then this is absolutely the best deal around!  </li>
            <li> i love this mannequin, it has the perfect amount of hair, not to thin its super long perfect for updos and can take the heat</li>
            <li> It is a great price for how long the hair is</li>
            <li> But she is great for praticing haircuts and long hair design.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described  shipping was prompt and  We were both absolultely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Lots of fun at Halloween when I put a mask on her and anchored stand on a table!</li>
            <li> Ordered this to train for special occasion hair dos.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and easy to manage, but I wish these dolls had better faces</li>
            <li> Price is much cheaper for more hair than I could find any where else.</li>
            <li> Good quality real human hair</li>
            <li> really good quality human hair could&#x27;ve been thicker</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> this head was better than the ones I can get at my local Armstrong mccall and way better than the ones we had in school..</li>
            <li> The main reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars is because the mannequin hair was not 24&amp;#34; it was more like 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> By the way, my daughter wants to buy another with her allowance because the price is so reasonable and this product is so amazing.</li>
            <li> We have been able to do most everything you can do on real human hair.</li>
            <li> what my grand daughter wanted&amp;#34; for her class finishing up cosmetology at East Bay High School in Tampa Bay Florida area.  </li>
            <li> but overall i am very pleased</li>
            <li> The length is perfect too, not too long &amp; not too short.</li>
            <li> yes I have curled and bloodied her hair on high heat and it has not melted off!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for school, thank you!</li>
            <li> the hair is the right size and much better looking than other dolls good buy and would recommend to all who look at this thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it because it has the right length to work braids and such, however the length is not even</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really care about the length of the hair, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Great for little girls...</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for</li>
            <li> the hair is fun to work on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing she liked was the length.</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth almost 50 dollars but it works well with heat</li>
            <li> The appealing part of this product is that it has real hair which is much easier to work with than those made of synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li> Has real hair, length is good, its human hair so it can be washed, blow dryed and curled or pressed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old grand daughter.</li>
            <li> I used a 40 volume developer with the bleach and her hair handled it pretty good, again, better than dolls I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> She is having fun with it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the clamp that goes with this, but in retrospect, do not think that accessory is useful.</li>
            <li> Loving the 100% human hair.</li>
            <li> Overall liked this and it works.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, but I did get a really nice red with some gold highlights</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is she sheds a lot, other then that, she&#x27;s great:)</li>
            <li> And super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> ; so the cuts look really stringy until you take off a significant amount of length.</li>
            <li> Other than that is good for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> This product appears to have a deep tan, however, this mannequin has very light skin and is Caucasian.</li>
            <li> The hair curls very well with any hot tools!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look as funny.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a licensed cosmetologist and the first thing she did was smell the hair and said it smells synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture and its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even put a hair brush to it yet, just a bit of gentle hand combing &amp; it has started shedding !</li>
            <li> She is not weird looking either.</li>
            <li> Being as I had 4 boys styling hair was never an issue until the 5 granddaughters ;)</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite present!</li>
            <li> exactly wat</li>
            <li> it is human hair (most of it)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and it may not be my last:)</li>
            <li> the hair was smooth and soft..</li>
            <li> her face looks funny</li>
            <li> Anyway, shipment came on time and the item was exactly as described..</li>
            <li> Though it didnt look exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for;)</li>
            <li> First impressions this is not quality.</li>
            <li> able to wrap a quick wet set on her without first hacking away four inches of scraggle.  </li>
            <li> True to length easy to create long hair styles</li>
            <li> It has little hair and the hair fall off very easily, it is getting bold after a couple of times of braiding.</li>
            <li> Is a good head for training, the hair have good quality but could be a little longer because a hair with at least 80 cm in length for braiding is required.</li>
            <li> I know the ones I used in beauty school were much better quality, however that was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty much like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> The hair is super soft, before and after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering a few more of these heads!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s done many different hairdos and she&#x27;s a professional now!</li>
            <li> her hair is a little bit shorter than on the picture but still is a nice length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more money but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast.</li>
            <li> how reasonably priced it is.</li>
            <li> Not too much hair pulling out though</li>
            <li> the hair was really then hair..</li>
            <li> I really like this mannequin</li>
            <li> and it will be interesting to see if the seller responds to my email to them stating that it is not real hair as claimed.  </li>
            <li> Would have made life much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I pulled this out in my cosmetology class and my classmates asked me where did I get that it has so much hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> just as i expected and more</li>
            <li> as much like 1 or 2 strands came out</li>
            <li> It is real hair.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much hair in sink.  </li>
            <li> And I really wanted it to</li>
            <li> Ends are very raggedy.</li>
            <li> i did not expect the amount of hair nor the size/shape of the head to be like a real person..</li>
            <li> Dolled did not look like picture, skin is a lot lighter which doesn&#x27;t really matter but just saying.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it really exceeded our expectations, we even gave it a name ðŸ˜€.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> And her face is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting, styling, braiding, anything you like to practice.</li>
            <li> I bought the doll to practice bleaching and using different colors before doing the same to my own hair.</li>
            <li> But after a couple if washes the glue started to come out and the plastic smell started to subside, but I noticed when I rolled her first perm that she had way more hair around her front hair line and less towards her nape.</li>
            <li> She loves the long silky hair and with the Manikin holder it makes for easily doing hair styles.  </li>
            <li> Best manikin head for that price.the hair was soft and long I was shocked at how nice it was.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old is interested in cosmetology and loves this manikin</li>
            <li> Mannequin came very quick and had all the length I expected.</li>
            <li> If you want a great mannequin, at an amazing price definitely buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was highly pissed when I opened the box and seen that shrunken head.</li>
            <li> product is of high quality and can take what ever my aspiring stylist throws at it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as length goes, the photo is really deceiving.  </li>
            <li> Great thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something to practice long length updos on and the hair is long and not thin and stringy at the ends like most mannequin heads.  </li>
            <li> I wish that ALL the hair was 24&amp;#34; long, so I could practice my braiding technique better, but overall it works.</li>
            <li> She is going to a vocational school for cosmetology next year.</li>
            <li> actually the whole mannequin looks exactly like the one in the pic.</li>
            <li> Hair is thick and braids nicely.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price compared to other mannequins with the same length of human hair.</li>
            <li> The price is right,  even if she doesn&#x27;t become a stylist, I can use it to practice different techniques.</li>
            <li> It did have a lot of short hairs and some not even the right color.</li>
            <li> but I still buy heads to practice new techniques...</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin to test out new color products and techniques before trying them on clients and to practice my braiding techniques.</li>
            <li> I have been a active stylist for 5 years, and this Mannequin head is fantastic quality.  </li>
            <li> She can use hot rollers, hot curling iron, wet the hair, dye the hair.</li>
            <li> It is kind of thin and scraggly at the very ends.</li>
            <li> The length is most certainly not 24&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not even 20&amp;#34; unless you count the three scraggly hairs dangling precariously in the back.</li>
            <li> It sheds alot but the hair is very soft</li>
            <li> it smells a little bit the first time you put heat to it but works perfectly fine and smell goes away, i cut about an inch off the bottom just to get rid of some stragglers but i highly recommend this mannequin especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The hair is wonderfully long and is easy to brush and performs just like real human hair.  </li>
            <li> X-mas gift for 12 year old!  </li>
            <li> First let me say this,  i did not order this doll expecting it to be just like a human...</li>
            <li> The hairline is too far back (more forehead than hair, the eyebrows are crooked and the doll has two different color eyes.</li>
            <li> im sure some of the hair is synthetic but its just very few since i was curling the hair</li>
            <li> i ordered this on the 3rd and it was supposed to be here on the thirteenth no later and showed up on the 9th (today) Its a realy nice mannequin and the hair is in fact human and lock the only thing that bothers me</li>
            <li> The hair is nice, but very few strands of it are actually 24&amp;#34</li>
            <li> the hair is great length for cutting and is in new condition.</li>
            <li> It definitely is nowhere near 24&amp;#34;, more like 18&amp;#34; or slightly longer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, that the face isn&#x27;t terribly pretty like my other mannequins that are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The hair was soft when I got it.</li>
            <li> The hair has stood up well to heat and color so far.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old cousin who loves styling hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 yr old to practice hair on and to play with.</li>
            <li> Some people said it sheds a lot, but not with us so far.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old because she likes to do hair.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my 13 yr old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> but the hair has a lot of gray hair and it didn&#x27;t curl like natural hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It does have thick hair at the top , but at the bottom its skinny.</li>
            <li> the hairs is a little to spaced out, but it still has good medium hair, the hair &amp;#34;follicles&amp;#34; being too spaced out just makes it a little hard to get a smooth style.</li>
            <li> actaully pretty looks asian overall</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this had such high</li>
            <li> For some reason, it would not lighten like normal human hair would.</li>
            <li> , I would buy a more expensive doll because you really do get whay you pay for.</li>
            <li> , the hair is thin enough to do a nice updo.</li>
            <li> Other than that, she shed a bit of hair at first</li>
            <li> The hair is extremely thin and fringy at the last 4-5 inches at the ends, not as full as the picture represents.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just long enough, but I can&#x27;t really trim it to even it out around the bottom.</li>
            <li> It was an unexpected Christmas present to her.</li>
            <li> This doll has good hair for styling or cutting, I haven&#x27;t tried to color or lighten though.</li>
            <li> so for those reasons i am rating her based on how she compares to other mannequins, not how closely she replicates a real person....</li>
            <li> She loves it &amp; it has endured flat irons, blow dryers, curling irons &amp; numerous hairstyles &amp;  still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick at the top a SUPER thin at the ends ( which I guess you could cut</li>
            <li> It has soft hair and it&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and soft.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as long as the photo.  </li>
            <li> Normal amount of shedding to be expected.</li>
            <li> I had to cut off a few straggly ends but not as many as dolls I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> and it did not flat iron well and smelled of burned synthetic.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because I do need this Mannequin for my Cosmetology State Board Exam and didn&#x27;t know if it was really &amp;#34;human hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> sits relatively flat at scalp, as apposed to many manniquins that have a weird lift at the root.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do cut the SUPER thin ends her hair would be very short</li>
            <li> really like.i say i would give it 3 stars. :\</li>
            <li> But  for the price guess you can&#x27;t have  the entire  lenght that  long.</li>
            <li> She then proceeded to flat iron it</li>
            <li> It works well with roller setting, braiding  and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> and she styles it with the flat iron, crimper and washes it too.</li>
            <li> She has flat ironed, curled and braided it.</li>
            <li> The hair length at the end is too thin that it isn&#x27;t full to the 24 inches.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this head everyday to make a new hairstyle or just to brush it.  </li>
            <li> The hair is pretty thick &amp; long.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, not many grays and the doll looks kinda human...</li>
            <li> Also, neither has long hair , nor a lot.</li>
            <li> It did ship earlier than expected though.  </li>
            <li> Use it in cosmetology school for up dos and hair styles for long hair.</li>
            <li> She still uses it to work out some designs when she&#x27;s not busy.</li>
            <li> It is NOT 24 inches long.</li>
            <li> ; long.  </li>
            <li> Hair not as long as pictured.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not natural hair, but it just didn&#x27;t curl as well as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> hair was just as long as the picture and</li>
            <li> I was exited to have a long haired mannequin to work on again.</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin to use and keep for long hair styling.  </li>
            <li> Hair isn&#x27;t as long as stated sheds quite a bit</li>
            <li> The product on the screen clearly is not the product I received.  </li>
            <li> The hair is only thick at the top and thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> But when I did get it, the Mannequin is long just like the picture, the hair is very soft, the ends are thick, the hair isn&#x27;t process at all, there are a 2-3 strands of grey hair (which isn&#x27;t an issue), and it is really human hair</li>
            <li> It has so many short hairs between the lengths, it is impossible to demonstrate an updo.  </li>
            <li> Hair is a little sparse towards the ends, but then so are the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> mannequin had a little bit of lent in the hair (nothing major</li>
            <li> Ends were a bit thin, and toward the top, it&#x27;s kinda thick.</li>
            <li> The average is about 16, and it is all different lengths.</li>
            <li> I paid $50 for this project and it definitely was not worth it.</li>
            <li> like she looks in the picture she Caucasian and she smaller than an average mannequin head and also they delivered her to my porch whiteout me being there</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small it was...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and do the job but sheds horrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused with this product and why it received such high reviews.</li>
            <li> The hair does not shed or break and she has made wet and dry styles with no problems.</li>
            <li> It definitely needed a little trim.</li>
            <li> The head is a little smaller than what</li>
            <li> I only use it for braids and little things like that.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is human hair or at least not 100% human hair.</li>
            <li> You can brush and brush the hair and only a few strands</li>
            <li> There are only a few strands of hair that are 24 inches.</li>
            <li> the mannequin has alot morehair than i expected.</li>
            <li> IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really concerned with her face..</li>
            <li> This is what I expected for the price of this mannequin.  </li>
            <li> would suggest this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Also, one eyebrow is smeared with paint unlike the other one.</li>
            <li> I have done haircuts, on my other school mannequins</li>
            <li> it has realy small eyes and red lipstick and the eyes are brown over it</li>
            <li> Daughter wanted a doll head for Christmas, but the toy ones are not worth the money, so I went with this.</li>
            <li> Overall goof for pols who just need a doll to play with but for updos and braids it sucks.</li>
            <li> Not worth half of what I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to practice styling and braiding, but it will be very frustrating due to the different lengths and overall shortness of hair.</li>
            <li> Very small  amount of hair actually  24in.</li>
            <li> neck has slight damage at the end.</li>
            <li> The hair is black ,red,blond,and brown.</li>
            <li> I wish she had thicker hair and less fell out.</li>
            <li> The skin was not on right as though it had been reapplied an not fastened at the base properly.</li>
            <li> The hair was not a good enough quality for this purpose</li>
            <li> The neck of it was a little damaged when I got it</li>
            <li> The mannequin head hair seems a little bit longer in the picture than in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair shed a little, but I don&#x27;t care, its going to get cut up for State Board.</li>
            <li> but I thin thought she was black or mixed looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible) and it left the hair in a huge tangled birds nest.</li>
            <li> However, we will keep cutting different styles with her until she has no hair left.  </li>
            <li> I washed, cut and blow dried her hair</li>
            <li> I have bleached, washed,  dried,  straightened,  and colored her hair with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I did dye it quite a few times.</li>
            <li> not full enough, very thin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how small her head is, but I will say there&#x27;s still a lot of hair to work with.</li>
            <li> I know from past experiences of having my hair bleach that my hair nor the bleach reacts like that.</li>
            <li> &quot; unfortunately its only 16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to color yet</li>
            <li> Getting all my haircuts done on her before she gets bald :/ already has bald patches...</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all but too late to return and exchange before the holidays.</li>
            <li> Will dull your scissors.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed when I opend the doll, she was dirty and had glue in her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with my purchased at all....</li>
            <li> And thin.</li>
            <li> However, as others have stated, the hair is thin at the ends.  </li>
            <li> compare to what i has before ï¼Œthe bottom of hair to thin for me</li>
            <li> Ends were on the thin side though.</li>
            <li> Thin hair and a lot falls out every time I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> False advertising, is that a crime?</li>
            <li> I received a useless piece of merchandise timely...woohoo.</li>
            <li> Sent it back, very ugly, bad hair.</li>
            <li> ordered it for my daughter for cosmetology school for a cutting project.</li>
            <li> so I used it for a cutting mannequin to train my assistant.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Hair tangles like crazy, sheds worst then a dog.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed in the length!</li>
            <li> This is the worst mannequin head I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> USPS is the WORST.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter to play with. She can use hot rollers, hot curling iron, wet the hair, dye the hair. It&#x27;s fantastic! You can brush and brush the hair and only a few strands MAY come out.</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin head for a cutting/styling class at my salon. It shipped fast. The hair is super soft, before and after shampooing. I don&#x27;t like how small her head is, but I will say there&#x27;s still a lot of hair to work with. I plan on ordering a few more of these heads! Totally worth it for how reasonably priced it is.</li>
            <li> I like these, i&#x27;ve ordered  before  they are pretty nice quality. Very small  amount of hair actually  24in. But  for the price guess you can&#x27;t have  the entire  lenght that  long.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter to practice hairstyling and she love it.</li>
            <li> Sent it back, very ugly, bad hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good value for the price.  The hair is extremely thin and fringy at the last 4-5 inches at the ends, not as full as the picture represents.  I&#x27;m giving it as a gift to our teen daughter, so I curled the ends of the hair so it doesn&#x27;t look as funny.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice , the hair has a nice feel to it and it was shipped on time .I gave it 4 stars because I did not color the hair as yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this had such high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1. Her hair is thick at the top a SUPER thin at the ends ( which I guess you could cut them)&lt;br /&gt;2. Her hair is not 24&#x27;&#x27; it is only 1 foot ( 12 inches)&lt;br /&gt;3. If you do cut the SUPER thin ends her hair would be very short</li>
            <li> Lifelike features and very nice hair very well done</li>
            <li> Excellent shape, thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and do the job but sheds horrible</li>
            <li> Hair is shorter than advertised and seems layered.  Not too much hair pulling out though</li>
            <li> My daughter has enjoyed the doll. This product is a great purchase for any young lady that enjoys designing hair styles.</li>
            <li> The grand girls are having a great time styling this head. They are practicing braiding of all types. It was a good Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Perfect! And super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I thought the holder came with it and now I&#x27;m in need of the holder</li>
            <li> I purchased two mannequin head, and both of the head was different one has no name and the hair was really then hair.. Yikes!!!..... I won&#x27;t recommend this mannequin to anyone. I&#x27;m not happy with my purchased at all....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it , because the manikin isn&#x27;t as you described it  in Amazon. Also, neither has long hair , nor a lot.</li>
            <li> My gf end up using it and realized it is NOT human hair! Almost costed her the cosmetology exam.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy. Will dull your scissors.</li>
            <li> I really like this mannequin the hair is fun to work on.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product to other people.</li>
            <li> A lot of hair falls out every time I simply touch the doll head. You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is human hair or at least not 100% human hair. I bought the doll to practice bleaching and using different colors before doing the same to my own hair. When I applied the bleach, I made sure to keep it off the plastic (not knowing what kind of reaction it would have). I let it sit with a plastic cap for about 10 minutes before checking on it. When I took the cap off, there was a gooey brownish liquid in the plastic cap. I know from past experiences of having my hair bleach that my hair nor the bleach reacts like that. If this was 100% human hair, there should not have been any gooey liquid. There was also some breakage.</li>
            <li> This head does the trick. The hair was soft when I got it. It definitely needed a little trim. The hair has stood up well to heat and color so far.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I used it for state board and it worked perefect</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t imagine 24&amp;#34; of hair -- even from the front of the head. There are only a few strands of hair that are 24 inches. The average is about 16, and it is all different lengths. I bought this for my daughter to practice styling and braiding, but it will be very frustrating due to the different lengths and overall shortness of hair. Quality seems fine, if the length does not matter to you.</li>
            <li> Thank you I love the hair</li>
            <li> This doll has helped me out a great deal but I thin thought she was black or mixed looking. It doesn&#x27;t matter tho. But then it does but no fight here.</li>
            <li> This doll looks nothing like the pictured item. The hairline is too far back (more forehead than hair, the eyebrows are crooked and the doll has two different color eyes. The description says caramel complexion but this doll is totally of a lighter shade. Not pleased at all but too late to return and exchange before the holidays.</li>
            <li> Seems like there is a lot of filler length that isn&#x27;t the total 24&amp;#34; so the cuts look really stringy until you take off a significant amount of length. That was the downfall. It colors beautifully though.</li>
            <li> This is claimed to be &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34;, but it is not.  My daughter is a licensed cosmetologist and the first thing she did was smell the hair and said it smells synthetic.  She then proceeded to flat iron it and it did not flat iron well and smelled of burned synthetic.  I paid $50 for this project and it definitely was not worth it. The only thing she liked was the length. Very disappointed and it will be interesting to see if the seller responds to my email to them stating that it is not real hair as claimed.  False advertising, is that a crime? I believe so...</li>
            <li> I bought this doll head believeing that it was gonna be 24\\&quot; unfortunately its only 16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to color yet bc I just received it but I&#x27;m very disappointed in the length!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture and its exactly what I wanted. The neck of it was a little damaged when I got it but I guess that&#x27;s the shipping handlers fault. All and all it works for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mannequin head I have ever bought.  It has so many short hairs between the lengths, it is impossible to demonstrate an updo.  It did ship earlier than expected though.  I received a useless piece of merchandise timely...woohoo.</li>
            <li> The hair of this manikin is nice and shine. The length of the hair is just great to create a hairstyle.I like this manikin!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter who likes to style hair.  She loves it and enjoys braiding the hair and styling it in various styles. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase! Bought this for my 14 year old cousin who loves styling hair. She loves it &amp; it has endured flat irons, blow dryers, curling irons &amp; numerous hairstyles &amp;  still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> The hair is not 100% human as advertised, Several strands melted on the curling/flat iron. For the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> X-mas gift for 12 year old!  She&#x27;s done many different hairdos and she&#x27;s a professional now!</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price!  I bought this for my 10 year old daughter...along with a book on cute braiding ideas.  She uses the head to practice different hair styles &amp; braiding...she loves it!</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday &amp; was pleasantly surprised at how &#x27;real&#x27; the hair quality was, perfect to work with.The length is perfect too, not too long &amp; not too short.The only draw back is that i couldn&#x27;t help but notice the shedding which started as soon as i started toying with the hair. I haven&#x27;t even put a hair brush to it yet, just a bit of gentle hand combing &amp; it has started shedding ! If only the hair was made stronger i would&#x27;ve given it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this doll for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves doing hair and I am also a licensed stylist, so she loves doing what she sees Mommy doing...smile..  The doll is perfect.  If I personally needed to practice something on the doll, it would meet my needs 100%  No complaints here.  It&#x27;s perfect for fun and for practical use for students.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00AYR8BK0 24 &amp;#34; Cosmetology Mannequin Manikin Training Head with Human Hair]] My 11 year old is interested in cosmetology and loves this manikin</li>
            <li> Excellent mannequin to practice updos! The hair curls very well with any hot tools! I&#x27;m very happy I found this inexpensive mannequin!</li>
            <li> This hair wasn&#x27;t 24 inches anywhere on its head. More like 12. And thin. Won&#x27;t buy again. Not worth half of what I paid.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  Bought practice updos on ..  Works great with heating tools</li>
            <li> This manikin has a strong smell of bleach. I shampooed it several times, it still smell. It has little hair and the hair fall off very easily, it is getting bold after a couple of times of braiding. wei</li>
            <li> The hair is excellent. My daughter needed this for her cosmetology class and her teacher loves it! I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Hair is good condition and much thicker then most mannequin heads. It is a great price for how long the hair is</li>
            <li> My niece loves this manikin.  She is able to wash the hair, and style and accessorize with ease.  The quality of hair is very good.</li>
            <li> the mannequin has alot morehair than i expected.She is not weird looking either. Very good quality. She will need a good trim though. Planning to practice updos on her. Very happy with the purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> This mannequin is the best one that I have worked with thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Hair sits relatively flat at scalp, as apposed to many manniquins that have a weird lift at the root.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this mannequin to a cosmetology student.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had had a couple of these when I was in school.  Would have made life much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;Was able to wrap a quick wet set on her without first hacking away four inches of scraggle.  No thread strings in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good for braiding and updo styles.  Sections easily and realistically.</li>
            <li> The product was great. .. It came ahead of schedule.  And my daughter loves ot.</li>
            <li> Great product very satisfied. Use it to practice french braiding, different hairstyles for my granddaughters. Being as I had 4 boys styling hair was never an issue until the 5 granddaughters ;)</li>
            <li> I WASNT HAPPY WITH HOW IT LOOKED HOW THE SKIN FELT OR THE HAIR TEXTURE. IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Great doll head for updos, the hair is thin enough to do a nice updo. A lot of the reviews said the hair falls out. I haven&#x27;t had that same experience, only when I tease the hair.</li>
            <li> I pulled this out in my cosmetology class and my classmates asked me where did I get that it has so much hair.  I said Amazon and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mannequin for my granddaughter to play with, she loves doing hair. She loves the long silky hair and with the Manikin holder it makes for easily doing hair styles.  It works well with roller setting, braiding  and flat ironing. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product got the reviews it did. They must have changed it. The hair is sparse and just falls out as I run my fingers through it. Not even a comb. The length is most certainly not 24&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not even 20&amp;#34; unless you count the three scraggly hairs dangling precariously in the back. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid even $20 for this if I had known.</li>
            <li> So I had just ordered this product like a week ago and already got here i love it the hair is the right size and much better looking than other dolls good buy and would recommend to all who look at this thanks</li>
            <li> just as i expected and more</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s mannequin  is awesome at first she sheds allot but after I washed it and tryed it and brushed it she stopped shedding as much like 1 or 2 strands came out she&#x27;s not African American like she looks in the picture she Caucasian and she smaller than an average mannequin head and also they delivered her to my porch whiteout me being there</li>
            <li> Everything about it is great.  Silky hair and will be great for my granddaughter to learn to hair.  It is real hair.  Shipped in very good condition.</li>
            <li> This has been a great purchase for my daughter to practice on who is 11.  i also used it at a teen hair workshop.  you will need to order the pivot.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money. Hair is a little sparse towards the ends, but then so are the more expensive models. Would purchase more.</li>
            <li> Mannequin head is great for my daughters training. Price is much cheaper for more hair than I could find any where else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 yr old to practice hair on and to play with. She loves it. Great thick long hair. and she styles it with the flat iron, crimper and washes it too. its great</li>
            <li> Great product for great price! Use it in cosmetology school for up dos and hair styles for long hair. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this head for my daughter. It is her 3rd one.  She has the Afro and one like this with shorter hair.  She wanted a longer hair manikin.  She has already washed it and I didn&#x27;t see much hair in sink.  Some people said it sheds a lot, but not with us so far.  The ends are thinner but she hasn&#x27;t cut it yet.  But I&#x27;m sure she will.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed when I opend the doll, she was dirty and had glue in her hair. But after a couple if washes the glue started to come out and the plastic smell started to subside, but I noticed when I rolled her first perm that she had way more hair around her front hair line and less towards her nape. But she is great for praticing haircuts and long hair design. I can&#x27;t say I would buy this doll again though, I would buy a more expensive doll because you really do get whay you pay for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it becuse the hair didn&#x27;t grow back when I shaved it. And I really wanted it to but no. And i don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> the hair is great length for cutting and is in new condition. i love it as a pro and a teacher.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an extra for my class and I have been able to practice all that I want. All the girls in my class are jealous of the quality of this mannequin vs. what was issued to us in class.</li>
            <li> i love this mannequin, it has the perfect amount of hair, not to thin its super long perfect for updos and can take the heat it smells a little bit the first time you put heat to it but works perfectly fine and smell goes away, i cut about an inch off the bottom just to get rid of some stragglers but i highly recommend this mannequin especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I lovee everything about it and it came on the day it said</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My daughter was able to use it for her State Board test.  She still uses it to work out some designs when she&#x27;s not busy.</li>
            <li> For only $40 the quality of this mannequin&#x27;s hair exceeded my expectations. Much better than anything I&#x27;ve seen in stores</li>
            <li> Love this mannikin. I washed, cut and blow dried her hair and now it&#x27;s perfect for up-do&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> good hair nice density but the length is not like the picture  but its still a good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused with this product and why it received such high reviews. Maybe I received the defected mannequinn or something. The head is 3 sizes smaller than an actual human head. The hair is only thick at the top and thin at the bottom. It is NOT 24 inches long. It is silky like everyone says. I&#x27;m thinking the Bellrino company isn&#x27;t a quality business. I was highly pissed when I opened the box and seen that shrunken head.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for what I needed it for. I permed it and it turned out perfect. I love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described on site, would recommend for anyone looking for a mannequin with good quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter in cosmetology school.  The hair is nice, but very few strands of it are actually 24&amp;#34; long.  It&#x27;s layered and stringy.  I had to return it because she needed one with ALL of the hair 24&amp;#34;.  If you don&#x27;t really care about the length of the hair, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Love it! I lightened it and it works great!!</li>
            <li> feels like synthetic hair face looks better in picture . Wasn&#x27;t worth almost 50 dollars but it works well with heat</li>
            <li> No problems with this item.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very satisfied with this product. The appealing part of this product is that it has real hair which is much easier to work with than those made of synthetic hair.  It&#x27;s a little more money but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite present!</li>
            <li> Ends are very raggedy. Hair not as long as pictured.</li>
            <li> Daughter wanted a doll head for Christmas, but the toy ones are not worth the money, so I went with this. Has real hair, length is good, its human hair so it can be washed, blow dryed and curled or pressed. Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> My kids LOVED it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair feels nice. neck has slight damage at the end. When arrived covered is some sugar looking substance that had to be wiped off.  Other than that is good for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Trying to learn fancy braids on this one. She is perfect for this. Hair is thick and braids nicely.</li>
            <li> It has soft hair and it&#x27;s long but I will give just 4 stars because I was expecting more hair in the mannequin head. Everything else is great!</li>
            <li> Just recieved this. Hair is gorgeous and the exact length as described. Im in cosmetology school and even the doll heads in our kit are not this good.  Will def be buying more.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to train for special occasion hair dos. The hair is pretty thick &amp; long. The only thing i dont like is she sheds a lot, other then that, she&#x27;s great:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter , Christmas. It sheds a lot in the Beginning when combing. My daughter loves the length, and enjoys how the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase another.</li>
            <li> Mannequin came very quick and had all the length I expected. Yes it sheds, but all mannequins do. Definitely on of the best mannequins I have purchased and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Just as described, my daughter uses this for school. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have been a active stylist for 5 years, and this Mannequin head is fantastic quality.  I was searching for something to practice long length updos on and the hair is long and not thin and stringy at the ends like most mannequin heads.  I would recommended this product to anyone looking for a mannequin to practice styling/cutting on.</li>
            <li> ordered it for my daughter for cosmetology school for a cutting project. exactly wat it said it was. very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it because it has the right length to work braids and such, however the length is not even so technically they are saying it&#x27;s 24&amp;#34; length from the longest hair. The hair is very soft and easy to manage, but I wish these dolls had better faces, I feel like I&#x27;m working on some weirdo crack fiend...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old grand daughter. She luv it and is able to do everything with the hair she want to.</li>
            <li> I am not a hair stylist, but i like to learn different braids and different hair styles and different techniques. My daughter taught herself how to french braid this mannequin head.</li>
            <li> i just got it. her hair is a little bit shorter than on the picture but still is a nice length. i dont know why but i thought it would come with the support for the table... it doesn&#x27;t say it on the details so that&#x27;s fine. it is human hair (most of it) im sure some of the hair is synthetic but its just very few since i was curling the hair and there was one or two burned hair on my curling iron. lets see how it goes when i dye her hair.. i&#x27;ll let you know :)</li>
            <li> Is a good head for training, the hair have good quality but could be a little longer because a hair with at least 80 cm in length for braiding is required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetology student and bought this doll... she has perfect long hair! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase and it may not be my last:) yes I have curled and bloodied her hair on high heat and it has not melted off!!! Yay:D</li>
            <li> First let me say this,  i did not order this doll expecting it to be just like a human... no mannequin is like working with a human head.. i did not expect the amount of hair nor the size/shape of the head to be like a real person.. so for those reasons i am rating her based on how she compares to other mannequins, not how closely she replicates a real person.... I give the product 5 stars... I got my cosmo license 2 years ago but I still buy heads to practice new techniques... this head was better than the ones I can get at my local Armstrong mccall and way better than the ones we had in school.. the hair was smooth and soft.. her face looks funny but I&#x27;m not really concerned with her face.. the length of the hair looks just like the picture,  I had to cut off a few straggly ends but not as many as dolls I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I have bleached, washed,  dried,  straightened,  and colored her hair with no problems.  I used a 40 volume developer with the bleach and her hair handled it pretty good, again, better than dolls I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I will be ordering this doll again.  She works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> The mannequin actually exceeded my expectations.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent for its price</li>
            <li> Dolled did not look like picture, skin is a lot lighter which doesn&#x27;t really matter but just saying. The hair length at the end is too thin that it isn&#x27;t full to the 24 inches. Hair tangles like crazy, sheds worst then a dog. Had to return it because if I kept it I might have had a bald mannequin. Overall goof for pols who just need a doll to play with but for updos and braids it sucks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all cosmetology training purposes at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I just got this and i already fell in love with it. Her hair is long and soft. I curled,styled,and dyed her hair and it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love it, its just like brazilian hair</li>
            <li> True to length easy to create long hair styles</li>
            <li> Good quality real human hair</li>
            <li> hair is wonderful &amp; perfect for varieties of hairstyles ðŸ™Œ worth the money</li>
            <li> Awesome for cosmetology class</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old because she likes to do hair. She is having fun with it. She has flat ironed, curled and braided it. If you buy this definitely get the holder. It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers.  This is a gift for my 13 yr old granddaughter.  I think she will love braiding and styling it.  However, as others have stated, the hair is thin at the ends.  As far as length goes, the photo is really deceiving.  Not nearly as long as the photo.  I think she will love it. I&#x27;ll be back if anything changes.</li>
            <li> It does have thick hair at the top , but at the bottom its skinny. The thing i dont like is its super FRIZZY!!!!  The hair is black ,red,blond,and brown. It also has alot of gray hairs! Also, one eyebrow is smeared with paint unlike the other one. Also her name is lindsey.it says it on her neck wich i didnt really like.i say i would give it 3 stars. :\</li>
            <li> I wish that ALL the hair was 24&amp;#34; long, so I could practice my braiding technique better, but overall it works.</li>
            <li> The product on the screen clearly is not the product I received.  Extremely disappointed.  The hair is human, but the length is not 24&amp;#34; and the mannequin is white.  I have mannequins with different complexions and I wanted this one specifically for the complexion and hair length.....of which i was satisfied with neither.  I&#x27;ll just go to Sallys next time.</li>
            <li> Best manikin head for that price.the hair was soft and long I was shocked at how nice it was. I am a student and have spents hundreds on doll heads I will buy more it will save me tons of money</li>
            <li> The mannequin head hair seems a little bit longer in the picture than in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mannequin had a little bit of lent in the hair (nothing major and  was removable) but the hair has a lot of gray hair and it didn&#x27;t curl like natural hair. I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not natural hair, but it just didn&#x27;t curl as well as I thought it would have. The hair does have a scent to it like processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to style it: braid, wedding hair, buns, etc. I was expecting a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I do recommend if you just need to practice hair styling.</li>
            <li> I am in school and wanted an extra mannequin to practice on. This one is perfect the hair is in good condition and easy to work with. the only problem I have is it doesn&#x27;t always stay in my mannequin stand. It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my preteen daughter who loves to style hair. It is proving to be a practical alternative to buying oversized Bratz or Barbie heads.&lt;br /&gt;The product is of high quality and can take what ever my aspiring stylist throws at it. I purchased the clamp that goes with this, but in retrospect, do not think that accessory is useful. The tripod may have been a more practical accessory.</li>
            <li> Puchased for my Daughter for cosmetology school.  Exactly as described  shipping was prompt and  We were both absolultely satisfied.  Great Price  Thank You</li>
            <li> The doll is nice, the hair is nice, and I like how the bottom is rubberized so it stays on my mannequin stand well but the stitching of the hair into the head must not be done well because it literally sheds out in huge amounts. Getting all my haircuts done on her before she gets bald :/ already has bald patches...</li>
            <li> The mannequin was great and my daughter is preparing for cosmetology. I would recommend it for those in search of a head.</li>
            <li> it is a hobby for her to do hair so this thing makes it easier for her to learn how to do hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it really exceeded our expectations, we even gave it a name ðŸ˜€.  Anyway, shipment came on time and the item was exactly as described.. My wife is a trained hairdresser and cosmetologist but  this is a great tool for her to experiment with.  Also the fact that it is 100% human hair makes all the difference.  A great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price compared to other mannequins with the same length of human hair. The hair is soft, not many grays and the doll looks kinda human...because some of the dolls look like aliens! Great for all services including heat.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter says best birthday ever!</li>
            <li> The main reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars is because the mannequin hair was not 24&amp;#34; it was more like 18&amp;#34;. Other than that, she shed a bit of hair at first but she styles great and responds to heat well. If needed, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have done haircuts, on my other school mannequins so I bought this one for a longer one for updos. I really only use this mannequin, the hair is great quality,silky and smooth. Yet it holds well for braids, takes heat like a champ. Trimmed it a teeny bit when I got it,but still has a great amount of length. Normal amount of shedding to be expected. She fits great on my stand. My only complaint is, that the face isn&#x27;t terribly pretty like my other mannequins that are gorgeous. But for the length and quality of the hair it doesn&#x27;t matter. I have not tried color yet,but will update this review when I do. If you want a great mannequin, at an amazing price definitely buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Loving the 100% human hair. Granddaughter&#x27;s favorite gift!</li>
            <li> Though it didnt look exactly like the photo. I am satisfied with the hair length and thickness. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It sheds alot but the hair is very soft</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this head everyday to make a new hairstyle or just to brush it.  The real human hair is no joke!  Washes great, can be curled with a hot iron or curlers.  Truly a best buy in my book.  I tried beating the price elsewhere and couldn&#x27;t do it.  The hair is wonderfully long and is easy to brush and performs just like real human hair.  He even used a highlighting kit on it and it turned out perfect!  If you are needing a real human hair head to practice on, then this is absolutely the best deal around!  This is NOT a paid advertisement, I just love a great deal when I find one and want to pass it on.  By the way, my daughter wants to buy another with her allowance because the price is so reasonable and this product is so amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She has thoroughly enjoyed styling this mannequin hair over and over and over.  The hair does not shed or break and she has made wet and dry styles with no problems. I will likely purchase her another mannequin similar to this one for variety.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who dreams of being a Beauty School Dropout but am currently babysitting this head! Lots of fun at Halloween when I put a mask on her and anchored stand on a table!</li>
            <li> It was in great condition and met all of our expectations. We have been able to do most everything you can do on real human hair.</li>
            <li> compare to what i has before ï¼Œthe bottom of hair to thin for meã€‚ i feel like this product just so so</li>
            <li> i ordered this on the 3rd and it was supposed to be here on the thirteenth no later and showed up on the 9th (today) Its a realy nice mannequin and the hair is in fact human and lock the only thing that bothers me is it looks diffrent on the picture it has realy small eyes and red lipstick and the eyes are brown over it actaully pretty looks asian overall it is really nice and it hold curls and straihtens perfectly</li>
            <li> This is what I expected for the price of this mannequin.  Good for practice, hair shed&#x27;s a bit more than a better quality mannequin, but for practicing updos and braids it is fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product on the 29th it arrived on the third. It was in excellent condition. My daughter wanted this product to play with the hair versus the oversized doll heads. She is enjoying her head, and I will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like the manikin its just what the description says. The product was delivered very fast. I would recommend this product for anyone practicing some techniques.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that when my daughter used her straightner on it it  left some residue on straightner from hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise she loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this Mannequin head. I got it for her on Christmas</li>
            <li> Got for a gift for a family member wanting to do hair. Just as all the others mentioned, the complexion is lighter than advertised.</li>
            <li> This doll has good hair for styling or cutting, I haven&#x27;t tried to color or lighten though. I gave it 3 stars b/c the hairs is a little to spaced out, but it still has good medium hair, the hair &amp;#34;follicles&amp;#34; being too spaced out just makes it a little hard to get a smooth style. Still a good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. It was an unexpected Christmas present to her. She is going to a vocational school for cosmetology next year.</li>
            <li> Good quality and was a great surprise gift for my 13 yr old daughter&#x27;s birthday. She loves this thing, loves loves loves to braid hair and this gives her the opportunity to do so without aggravating her sisters lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair was just as long as the picture and actually the whole mannequin looks exactly like the one in the pic.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed for school, thank you! I was exited to have a long haired mannequin to work on again. Hair has not burned and seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice head of hair, good texture and density. Arrived on time. It definitely is nowhere near 24&amp;#34;, more like 18&amp;#34; or slightly longer. Ends were on the thin side though. I will probably need to trim about 2+ inches to make it even.</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin to use and keep for long hair styling.  The hair was not a good enough quality for this purpose so I used it for a cutting mannequin to train my assistant.  Once we got the hair to about chin length it was much better.  However, we will keep cutting different styles with her until she has no hair left.  You get what you pay for;)</li>
            <li> I gave this item 4 stars because of shipping. I order my mannequin on a Friday and was suppose to get it on  a Saturday (I sign up for prime amazon) Because of USPS not doing they job correctly, I didn&#x27;t get my package until today which is Tuesday June 10. Saturday i waited all day for my package, never came. I sign up for text alert. i got a text saying a notice was left. Someone fell to do they job because i was home and no one knocked on my door. Monday I waited all day package never came. USPS didn&#x27;t even update the info online, so I had to pick it up from the post office. smh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the mannequin. The head is a little smaller than what Im use to but that isn&#x27;t a problem to me. I was a little nervous because I do need this Mannequin for my Cosmetology State Board Exam and didn&#x27;t know if it was really &amp;#34;human hair&amp;#34;. But when I did get it, the Mannequin is long just like the picture, the hair is very soft, the ends are thick, the hair isn&#x27;t process at all, there are a 2-3 strands of grey hair (which isn&#x27;t an issue), and it is really human hair ( I know because I did do a curl test and it curled. my curlers was way pass 300 degrees.) The hair shed a little, but I don&#x27;t care, its going to get cut up for State Board. And her face is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m have to say I did it my money worth, and is satisfied with my order. Only problem I do have is I wish Amazon gives you an option of what carrier you want. USPS is the WORST. I rather FedEx or UPS..</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it...</li>
            <li> Its a mannequin, just like I used in cosmetology school. The human hair is always mediocre quality and it doesn&#x27;t get any better unless you want to double your price. For me to practice more styling and up dos its works out great.</li>
            <li> Thin hair and a lot falls out every time I brush her hair. I bought this mannequin to test out new color products and techniques before trying them on clients and to practice my braiding techniques. I wish she had thicker hair and less fell out.</li>
            <li> got my package today. really good quality human hair could&#x27;ve been thicker but overall i am very pleased</li>
            <li> Great for little girls...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to practice on. I have been doing hair for 21 years, and she at 13 is showing interest. The price is right,  even if she doesn&#x27;t become a stylist, I can use it to practice different techniques. The hair it&#x27;s just long enough, but I can&#x27;t really trim it to even it out around the bottom. It is kind of thin and scraggly at the very ends. I know the ones I used in beauty school were much better quality, however that was a long time ago. Nothing seems to be made like it used to be.</li>
            <li> not full enough, very thin</li>
            <li> Overall liked this and it works. Got it for braiding. It did have a lot of short hairs and some not even the right color.</li>
            <li> I love this doll head. Her hair is so soft and manageable. Perfect for cutting, styling, braiding, anything you like to practice. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty much like it does in the picture. Ends were a bit thin, and toward the top, it&#x27;s kinda thick. I did dye it quite a few times. For some reason, it would not lighten like normal human hair would. I did use a dye where you shampoo it in, (I don&#x27;t recommend buying it. It&#x27;s horrible) and it left the hair in a huge tangled birds nest. I had to brush all the tangles out and it lost quite a lot of hair. I blame it on the dye. It now has some thinness on the top and I cut most of the length off. She now has the &amp;#34;Miley Cyrus&amp;#34; haircut. It came out okay. Wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, but I did get a really nice red with some gold highlights</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional hair stylist. She loves the &amp;#34;manikin&amp;#34;. It helps her keep her skills up as she prepares to style hair for her customers.</li>
            <li> I think it was wroth the money.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter...said it was better than the ones they give them at beauty school</li>
            <li> Very good for the price and was just right for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small it was... but it was &amp;#34;Just what my grand daughter wanted&amp;#34; for her class finishing up cosmetology at East Bay High School in Tampa Bay Florida area.  She has had four years of this class and can sit for her license as a result.</li>
            <li> When I purchase the mannequin they say is human hair 100% and now are using the mannequin and is synthetic hair</li>
            <li> LOVE this mannequin have done LOTS of color and Updos</li>
            <li> This product appears to have a deep tan, however, this mannequin has very light skin and is Caucasian.</li>
            <li> Great for fixing hair on the next-to-be beautician</li>
            <li> Hair isn&#x27;t as long as stated sheds quite a bit but I don&#x27;t mind I only use it for braids and little things like that.</li>
            <li> The package was shipped from California to Pennsylvania to Ny then to me in Texas. Why was this necessary? Then the mannequin itself was in makeshift condition. The skin was not on right as though it had been reapplied an not fastened at the base properly. There were markers where was suppose to be implanted and never was. The skin color in the picture is not what showed up in the mail. I ordered this to practice haircuts and to find a brand of quality mannequins to use on a regular basis. First impressions this is not quality. This could be the exception but at this point I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
