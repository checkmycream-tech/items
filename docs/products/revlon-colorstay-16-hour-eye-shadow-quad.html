            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye shadow!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The lower 2 colors are good for pigment, they are creamy and easy toa apply with a brush, they have good staying power and blend out nicely.</li>
            <li>The bottom two do, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Nice colors.  </li>
            <li>nice colors but</li>
            <li>It is so nice that it is matted instead of all the frosted shadows out there.</li>
            <li>And It&#x27;s Still A Nice Palette</li>
            <li>This is a really nice Eye Shadow compact.  </li>
            <li>Good price, probably would not buy again, not that easy to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li>The top two colors don&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li>The colors are appealing and the product lasted all evening.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, however.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect anything from the top 2 lighter colors though.</li>
            <li>The look is &#x27;glowy&#x27; for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li>I love this quad.</li>
            <li>I Am Mostly Reviewing The Nude Shade</li>
            <li>I only wish they would make more matte shadows!!!</li>
            <li>These colors are great together, very natural look.</li>
            <li>I bougt those because, I usually use a makeup at day, and I should have any in case I need, those are perfect for that, for the nice</li>
            <li>I use the darkest brown for the crease and it works great if you need a natural matte powder for filling in eyebrows, too.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money nice product</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and go with everything.</li>
            <li>beautifull colors, easy to apply, no irritaton</li>
            <li>They work well in daylight, so if you want flash go for something brighter, but it stays on lasts through the day and applies easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow stays put, has nice neutral colors (that I sometimes intensify by wetting my brush first to line my eyes).  </li>
            <li>This &#x27;quartz&#x27; collection though is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use the darker colors on my lids and the light color just under the brow.</li>
            <li>The color payoff on each of the shadows is great, and they are definitely long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I have light beige skin tone, in case that&#x27;s helpful to know.  </li>
            <li>It looks great on, and it last all day.</li>
            <li>They are all soft, non-metallic or glittery, good matte colors.</li>
            <li>I love that all of the colors are matte, giving me a really lovely, natural look.</li>
            <li>My wife was surprise when i give this to her, she can believed that i bought this for her specially when i have no idea</li>
            <li>no this is a true brown</li>
            <li>This a good basic group of colors.  </li>
            <li>This is a true mat shadow ...</li>
            <li>Good basic colors.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it stays on a full 16 hours, but it&#x27;ll last a good workday.</li>
            <li>This quad is perfect for women in their 40&#x27;s 50&#x27;s whereby shimmery eyeshadow looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I find the colors on the Revlon more vibrant on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite nude quad.will</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Great for work or everyday look.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Love the natural colors.</li>
            <li>It was good and as expected.</li>
            <li>I love all the natural /neutral eyeshadow shades, and these eyeshadows are really grewat, you can mix them to get a different shade, and the brown in this is a nice medium rich brown, no funky under colors to it</li>
            <li>I wish it had one color that was a little darker but overall great makeup!</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned black woman with hazel eyes.  </li>
            <li>sure I will try the other colors available.</li>
            <li>The color is a little lighter than I thought, but it does look good on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Sparkle is fine for someone younger, but this quad seems to be better for mature women.</li>
            <li>Am pretty unimpressed by this.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to start exploring the eye shadow world and this is my first quad.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more from this line.</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li>Wears as well as higher priced eyeshadows</li>
            <li>My naked 3 palette is definitely better.</li>
            <li>I mostly wear the two left colors when I don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li>but i found that the shade on the upper right had little pigmentation, but the two bottom colors are great.</li>
            <li>Easy guide to use on back, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Very high quality and wrapped with care.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much</li>
            <li>I use an eye brush to smooth it back out.</li>
            <li>but Obviusly If you don&#x27;t use too much makeup as me it will works for you.</li>
            <li>my mom really likes this shadow.  </li>
            <li>Very chalky.</li>
            <li>I gave this four stars because it really does stay on without creasing.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it five stars, but the colors go on much lighter than they appear.  </li>
            <li>Not Too Much</li>
            <li>That really helped me, because I don&#x27;t wear eye shadow often.  </li>
            <li>liked it enough that I purchased the same thing for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice eye shadow mix for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, like they have so many other of my favorites.</li>
            <li>i was pleased with the colors in the set, however, during shipment, the eyeshadow powder cakes had come undone and became loose powder, totally unusable, i am sending back and having it replaced, give it one more shot.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day: I live in a very humid area and in my 60s.  </li>
            <li>I have blue eyes and have been told they look more blue when wearing these shadows.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it for adding color under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It Had Decent Staying Power</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I normally would not purchase makeup without seeing it in person, so when I saw this online</li>
            <li>Great for casual Friday.</li>
            <li>far as color, this is good subtle selection of browns that can be applied to sort of sultry or natural looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Two of the colors are almost exactly the same when applied.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient and simple to get things through Amazon, so as long as shipping is free when you plan properly-I will shop for anything there.</li>
            <li>I ran down to my local drugstore and found it cost way more there.</li>
            <li>Big Sale!&lt;br /&gt;Deliver so fast</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for mature, wrinkly, or hooded eyes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really soft</li>
            <li>I actually purchased the Physician Formula matte collection quad as well but much prefer this Revlon quad.</li>
            <li>The colors are very cool and dull looking.  </li>
            <li>and the product takes several swipes to get enough color  typical of cheap eye shadow</li>
            <li>I am in my early twenties, but have never been a big makeup wearer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great little set for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to pack the whole makeup bag.</li>

            <li> I mostly wear the two left colors when I don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li> but i found that the shade on the upper right had little pigmentation, but the two bottom colors are great.</li>
            <li> Easy guide to use on back, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Very high quality and wrapped with care.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much</li>
            <li> I use an eye brush to smooth it back out.</li>
            <li> but Obviusly If you don&#x27;t use too much makeup as me it will works for you.</li>
            <li> my mom really likes this shadow.  </li>
            <li> Very chalky.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because it really does stay on without creasing.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars, but the colors go on much lighter than they appear.  </li>
            <li> Not Too Much</li>
            <li> That really helped me, because I don&#x27;t wear eye shadow often.  </li>
            <li> liked it enough that I purchased the same thing for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye shadow mix for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, like they have so many other of my favorites.</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the colors in the set, however, during shipment, the eyeshadow powder cakes had come undone and became loose powder, totally unusable, i am sending back and having it replaced, give it one more shot.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day: I live in a very humid area and in my 60s.  </li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and have been told they look more blue when wearing these shadows.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it for adding color under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It Had Decent Staying Power</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I normally would not purchase makeup without seeing it in person, so when I saw this online</li>
            <li> Great for casual Friday.</li>
            <li> far as color, this is good subtle selection of browns that can be applied to sort of sultry or natural looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Two of the colors are almost exactly the same when applied.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient and simple to get things through Amazon, so as long as shipping is free when you plan properly-I will shop for anything there.</li>
            <li> I ran down to my local drugstore and found it cost way more there.</li>
            <li> Big Sale!&lt;br /&gt;Deliver so fast</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for mature, wrinkly, or hooded eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really soft</li>
            <li> I actually purchased the Physician Formula matte collection quad as well but much prefer this Revlon quad.</li>
            <li> The colors are very cool and dull looking.  </li>
            <li> and the product takes several swipes to get enough color  typical of cheap eye shadow</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties, but have never been a big makeup wearer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great little set for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to pack the whole makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Only the darkest color is completely flat matte.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d never really worn eye shadow in the past, I appreciated that the back of the packaging gave a visual tutorial of where to put which shade.</li>
            <li> Smooth matte finish, quality surpasses my expensive shadows-Estée Lauder, smash box</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, the color stays.</li>
            <li> This shadow lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The applicator tends to lose its tip long before the product is used up.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient to have four colors of eye shadow which are complementary to each other in the same case.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Since I could see the colors in person, and I found it to be what I expected, I came home and ordered it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely No Shimmer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too powdery, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what other reviews have stated, this product is NOT MATTE.  </li>
            <li> and when you go to blend it somehow it turns grayish or some other hue,</li>
            <li> Now I want to try other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find decent matte eyeshadow lately.</li>
            <li> Pretty annoying for when you want a NATURAL looking eye.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin color, and this eye color is dark enough for subtle neutral color.</li>
            <li> There is a slight shimmer to these colors, though they are not glittery, sparkly or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are just a little shimmery.</li>
            <li> so I have to ditch quite a few products... to the benefit of my 12 yo daughter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for my lid a few times, but the color doesn&#x27;t show up THAT well.</li>
            <li> but it works for my lazy days.</li>
            <li> Although I usually use brushes to apply eyeshadow, brushes cannot pick up the product well.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding matte shadows</li>
            <li> 3 of the four colors have a subtle shimmer to them.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> , I hate when you get a brown</li>
            <li> But the brush is terrible so don&#x27;t rely on that.</li>
            <li> Unlike another Revlon Revlon Colorstay 12-Hour Eye Shadow Quad, this collection isn&#x27;t nasty and shiny but instead has a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is a little lighter than I thought, but it does look good on your eyes.</li>
            <li> These colors are great together, very natural look. Smooth matte finish, quality surpasses my expensive shadows-Estée Lauder, smash box</li>
            <li> I love it - great neutral color. I have medium skin color, and this eye color is dark enough for subtle neutral color.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve done without two of the colors, but, gives a good smokey appearance.</li>
            <li> Meh. The top two colors don&#x27;t show up at all. The bottom two do, so that&#x27;s nice. But the brush is terrible so don&#x27;t rely on that. I dropped the product and it didn&#x27;t break, so that says something about durability. I won&#x27;t repurchase but I don&#x27;t regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> Am pretty unimpressed by this.  Color does not show well at all.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Big Sale!&lt;br /&gt;Deliver so fast</li>
            <li> Contrary to what other reviews have stated, this product is NOT MATTE.  3 of the four colors have a subtle shimmer to them.  Only the darkest color is completely flat matte.  The colors are appealing and the product lasted all evening.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a product for mature, wrinkly, or hooded eyes this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye shadow.  Stays on, good neutral mat colors.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, like they have so many other of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Easy guide to use on back, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> great set of neutral colors.  I have blue eyes and have been told they look more blue when wearing these shadows.  Easy to apply and go with everything.</li>
            <li> perfect for me.  Thanks much.  Those colors seem to sell out in the stores so I was extremely happy to find it.  Thanks much</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadow at a great price.  I will definitely keep my eyes on this page for your deals. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife was surprise when i give this to her, she can believed that i bought this for her specially when i have no idea what color does she like...</li>
            <li> I love the color and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive eyes so I have to ditch quite a few products... to the benefit of my 12 yo daughter.  This &#x27;quartz&#x27; collection though is fantastic.  I can wear it without any eye irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as color, this is good subtle selection of browns that can be applied to sort of sultry or natural looking. Unlike another Revlon Revlon Colorstay 12-Hour Eye Shadow Quad, this collection isn&#x27;t nasty and shiny but instead has a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough that I purchased the same thing for my daughter.  It gives her a touch of color without looking &#x27;made up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a guide for how to apply on the back for noobies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom/blogger</li>
            <li> The case broke after I used it a week or so and the product takes several swipes to get enough color  typical of cheap eye shadow</li>
            <li> This does not smudge or wear off.  Nice colors.  I enjoy it.  Arrived in perfect condition.  I am happy with purchase</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, the color stays. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t. Also gathers in the crease of my eyelids. I use an eye brush to smooth it back out.</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, easy to apply, no irritaton</li>
            <li> Great quad, in the perfect colors. Great price, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re always out of this staple, neutral set when I go looking for it locally, but I can always find it here. There is a slight shimmer to these colors, though they are not glittery, sparkly or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little set for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to pack the whole makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love all the natural /neutral eyeshadow shades, and these eyeshadows are really grewat, you can mix them to get a different shade, and the brown in this is a nice medium rich brown, no funky under colors to it, I hate when you get a brown and when you go to blend it somehow it turns grayish or some other hue, no no this is a true brown, I got this on auto-delivery, can&#x27;t be without it, Plus I can never find my favarotie cosmetics at the store anymore, they either don&#x27;t sell it or they are always out of my shades! so this is perfect, so I would recommend trying it, and if you love it like I do, get it on auto-delivery then you wonnn&#x27;t have to worry about being without it!</li>
            <li> It is convenient to have four colors of eye shadow which are complementary to each other in the same case. I tend to use the darker colors on my lids and the light color just under the brow. Like this combination for brown eyes or when you are wearing the color brown. This shadow lasts for a long time. It stays on well during the day. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This a good basic group of colors.  They work well in daylight, so if you want flash go for something brighter, but it stays on lasts through the day and applies easily.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties, but have never been a big makeup wearer. I wanted to start exploring the eye shadow world and this is my first quad. I love that all of the colors are matte, giving me a really lovely, natural look. The color payoff on each of the shadows is great, and they are definitely long-lasting. Since I&#x27;d never really worn eye shadow in the past, I appreciated that the back of the packaging gave a visual tutorial of where to put which shade. I will definitely be buying more from this line.</li>
            <li> Good price, probably would not buy again, not that easy to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye shadow mix for everyday use.  I love this stuff!  Easy to blend and you can wear each of the colors stand alone</li>
            <li> The applicator tends to lose its tip long before the product is used up.  I love the colors, however.</li>
            <li> Worth the money nice product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow!  It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t clump in creases.  Stores in our area no longer carry it so I was thrilled to find in at Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is good, i like it.</li>
            <li> Works great and stays on all day. I wish it had one color that was a little darker but overall great makeup!</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the colors in the set, however, during shipment, the eyeshadow powder cakes had come undone and became loose powder, totally unusable, i am sending back and having it replaced, give it one more shot.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great color choices and product.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding matte shadows and I am very pleased with this shadow compact.  I use the two lighter colors on my lids and I use the taupe shadow on the left bottom to fill in my eyebrows - this makes it great for traveling,  I do not use the applicators that came with, I use a brush for the shadow and an eyebrow applicator for the eyebrows then brush to blend it in.  I only wish they would make more matte shadows!!!</li>
            <li> I bougt those because, I usually use a makeup at day, and I should have any in case I need, those are perfect for that, for the nice it&#x27;s really soft but Obviusly If you don&#x27;t use too much makeup as me it will works for you.</li>
            <li> Good color combinations.&lt;br /&gt;Easy application and good permanence in the eyelids even oily skin (like mine).&lt;br /&gt;I like how Revlon manufactures does quality products with low prices.&lt;br /&gt;For sure I will try the other colors available.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow stays put, has nice neutral colors (that I sometimes intensify by wetting my brush first to line my eyes).  I do use an eye shadow primer (e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow Primer) -- and the combination lasts me all day; no creasing or smudging.</li>
            <li> Like the pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking at the 2 darker colors. Don&#x27;t expect anything from the top 2 lighter colors though. They have no pigment or anything. They are just a little shimmery. The lower 2 colors are good for pigment, they are creamy and easy toa apply with a brush, they have good staying power and blend out nicely. I use the darkest brown for the crease and it works great if you need a natural matte powder for filling in eyebrows, too.  It&#x27;s hard to find decent matte eyeshadow lately. All the drugstore brands carry nothing but shimmer and glitter now. Pretty annoying for when you want a NATURAL looking eye. But the brown in this has no shimmer, its excellent and makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  All nude.  I actually purchased the Physician Formula matte collection quad as well but much prefer this Revlon quad. I find the colors on the Revlon more vibrant on my skin.  I am a fair skinned black woman with hazel eyes.  I use all the shades  This is my new favorite nude quad.will keep on ordering.  Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Arrived Undamaged.</li>
            <li> Great every day colors.  Excellent price.  Wears as well as higher priced eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Good product, not the best quality but it works for my lazy days. I mainly use it for adding color under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used it for my lid a few times, but the color doesn&#x27;t show up THAT well. My naked 3 palette is definitely better. But I still keep this in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> this quad is great for starters and for people on the go. they are good to blend but i found that the shade on the upper right had little pigmentation, but the two bottom colors are great. and the packaging is good, just plastic.</li>
            <li> Love the natural colors.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  Very high quality and wrapped with care.  This is a true mat shadow ... no sparkles!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose as a neutral set of eyeshadow colors. I wore this today and I like the way the colors look. I used a primer.</li>
            <li> Good product -- always has been.  I think I&#x27;ve used these Revlon shades (or similar) for over 20 years.  Good basic colors.  I have light beige skin tone, in case that&#x27;s helpful to know.  I don&#x27;t know if it stays on a full 16 hours, but it&#x27;ll last a good workday.</li>
            <li> Took a chance ordering online and hoping color was correct, it was and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> my mom really likes this shadow.  she has no complaints and likes the colors and the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> Very chalky. Although I usually use brushes to apply eyeshadow, brushes cannot pick up the product well. I apply with my fingers over a maybelline color tattoo and only then is it opaque enough to bother. Not great.</li>
            <li> I mostly wear the two left colors when I don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of makeup.  Great for casual Friday.</li>
            <li> nice colors but the best part is how it stays and when it goes it doesn\\&quot;t crease or flake.  Now I want to try other colors.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because it really does stay on without creasing.  I would have given it five stars, but the colors go on much lighter than they appear.  Two of the colors are almost exactly the same when applied.  All in all, would buy again, just in different colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using two of the colors daily, the others on occasion. They are all soft, non-metallic or glittery, good matte colors. They are lasting me all day without reapplication. I like this set a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral pallet, I was looking for something I could wear that would emphasize without being too noticeable. This does the trick perfectly!</li>
            <li> This quad is perfect for women in their 40&#x27;s 50&#x27;s whereby shimmery eyeshadow looks ridiculous. If you like shimmer look elsewhere. It is perfect for a daytime polished look. Easy to apply and blend. It lasts all day no problem. The look is &#x27;glowy&#x27; for lack of a better term. I went ahead and purchased the quad seductive in this brand and see if I like the purple shades. Sparkle is fine for someone younger, but this quad seems to be better for mature women.</li>
            <li> Great! This has always been the best and still is.</li>
            <li> I normally would not purchase makeup without seeing it in person, so when I saw this online I ran down to my local drugstore and found it cost way more there. Since I could see the colors in person, and I found it to be what I expected, I came home and ordered it. It is convenient and simple to get things through Amazon, so as long as shipping is free when you plan properly-I will shop for anything there.</li>
            <li> The colors are very cool and dull looking.  I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;Autumn&amp;#34;.  This would probably work for a Winter or Summer.</li>
            <li> It was good and as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this quad. The pigmentation is amaaazing. Great for work or everyday look. If you are looking for a neutral look, this is the quad (inexpenside, great quality, great packaging, great pigmentation, great everything) what else could you ask for?. TOTALLY RECOMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Just the colors I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s extremely good deal. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Revlon product for a number of years.  It lasts all day: I live in a very humid area and in my 60s.  It is so nice that it is matted instead of all the frosted shadows out there.</li>
            <li> Came as a two pack  which is great</li>
            <li> I always us Revlon color stay - works great and good value!</li>
            <li> I Am Mostly Reviewing The Nude Shade But I Was Looking For A Matte Neutral Shade But This Is Definitely Shimmery. Not Too Much But I Wanted One With Absolutely No Shimmer. It Had Decent Staying Power And It&#x27;s Still A Nice Palette Though I Would Recommend It To People Who Don&#x27;t Mind Shimmer And Want A Neutral Palette</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too powdery, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice Eye Shadow compact.  What I like is the back gives yo directions on how to apply.  That really helped me, because I don&#x27;t wear eye shadow often.  It looks great on, and it last all day.</li>
