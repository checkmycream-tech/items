            <li>Satiny moist.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:5a765ad826a3e08d5ff99d7a6709916f]]This face and neck firming cream is really nice it does have a herbal scent to it</li>
            <li>I sure hope you have a look at the video because I can tell you more about this awesome Firming cream&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>but it does go on nicely and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said she liked the &amp;#34;nice herbal scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I Received This Product in Exchange for a Honest Review.</li>
            <li>Liked the cream but not the container pump</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: Ive received this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant scent that disappears as it absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to get rid of some of my many wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>My skin is so happy right now.</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had never tried a firming cream before, but once i got this to review, i decided to try it on my neck, and it is easily the most moisturizing cream i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>A great product, fast shipping and the item was as described,!</li>
            <li>It really does feel great,  </li>
            <li>You could pump out more of the cream if you need it.</li>
            <li>and anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>love the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not the word that comes to my mind, and it sure isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing results for sure.</li>
            <li>And I can also say my face looks smother and more youthful too.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive compared to many</li>
            <li>I can see that the top does unscrew so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>The instructions they send you in an email (along with advertising more products), states to use a (their) serum along with this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one because of my all time favorite ingredients it has.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li>I will try to do it in the morning to see better results.</li>
            <li>I love how well they work and</li>
            <li>The day before I received product, I received an email from producer, with usage tips and urging me to purchase more items from their line.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
            <li>It feels pretty good on, but it is a bit too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin looks bright, calm, and smooth.</li>
            <li>an has made most of my fine lines fade away an my skin</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this line because of the many good reviews.</li>
            <li>is more smooth</li>
            <li>It has a lovely light fragrance</li>
            <li>It is semi-thick, spreads nicely and is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>So lightweight and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This impressive formula contains all the active and beneficial ingredients it needs to do the job it claims and then some.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it was to strong of the scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>With the retseliney best face and neck  firming and tightening cream is one product can feel a tight pull around my neck and face after every use.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.  </li>
            <li>recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>Great product to add to my facial care routine.</li>
            <li>The pump seems cheap and ineffective.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it for free or anything.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream too.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li>a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>I received  Retseliney Best Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream a few days ago and so far have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this is nice and high quality print on the label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream.</li>
            <li>My skin appears firmer and more moisturized, and feels so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product on my neck for about a week now, and am pleased to say that I am seeing some positive results.  </li>
            <li>The pump bottle makes it easy to use and delivers just the right amount.</li>
            <li>made a difference initially, I was delighted.</li>
            <li>But it feels nice as a moisturizer and does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure when using this product you go through the whole neck.</li>
            <li>while I used this had to use two to three full pumps of the cream.</li>
            <li>I use this in the morning and in the evening, I also add my regular moisturizer after I let it absorb good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to reap the effects of this because if made my face very oily</li>
            <li>The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!).</li>
            <li>and this really does just that, so quickly!</li>
            <li>my own personal experience with the product and my own personal review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Sort of a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I use some of their other products before bedtime: the Retinol Advanced Moisturizer, the Advanced Retinol Serum and the Advanced Firming Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>this is a higher scented product.</li>
            <li>However it is a real challenge to get it out of the plastic bottle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give it a try to see if it actually does work, since many reviewers like it.</li>
            <li>top it off, the pump stopped working around the 2nd week.  </li>
            <li>Skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Thank you for sharing this affordable, real deal firming cream!  </li>
            <li>NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller.</li>
            <li>so I can’t say that there’s only one product that has firmed up my skin, reduced the fine lines around my eyes and softened the laugh lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li>Not sure how these products got a 5 star rating, but the ratings were so good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is thick, creamy, and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I can see a difference even after a single use and i feel like my skin has gotten firmer and tighter faster than most products I have tried</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my neck or face.  </li>
            <li>but my neck and decolletege, not so much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this face &amp; neck firming cream for about a week now an I must say it does work an very well on my face.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for about 1 month and really didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li>much finer skin textgure.</li>
            <li>I consider this a nice creme because it takes a few seconds to absorb into my skin, when it does, my skin feels moist and hydrated.</li>
            <li>If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Not only is my skin firmer, but it&#x27;s smoother, fine lines are minimized, pores are clear, skin is very supple, and acne has cleared.</li>
            <li>It makes my neck look less saggy and more youthful.</li>
            <li>I really like the results I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I first saw results after my third days of use.</li>
            <li>All natural and vegan!</li>
            <li>it is a little to strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is a nice consistency, you only need a small amount for face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;colletage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting these products if you want to firm up your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Once I used this product I could clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to have mature skin, thinning skin to use this product.</li>
            <li>Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that.</li>
            <li>Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed.</li>
            <li>My husband always compliments me on how young and soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and that is probably why it is not working for me.</li>
            <li>This peptide-firming cream contains vitamin c (brightening), glycolic acid ( clears pores), hyaluronic acid (wrinkle softening), green tea (polyphenols, protects against free radicals, toxins.).</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin that tolerates few heavier face creams, and this one actually makes my skin feel smooth and soft, not oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face and neck feeling soft but not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rear view mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared.</li>
            <li>It is a thick cream but ,goes on smooth and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried blending it with some nicely scented moisturizer, and that helps mask the scent of this product - at least somewhat, although not completely.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is good, but the bad scent of this product is a real deterrent from using it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to say if it really works</li>
            <li>I think it compares nicely to much more expensive creams which I have not been able to afford lately.</li>
            <li>Mild, hard to define natural scent</li>
            <li>Smooth neck area that doesn&#x27;t bunch up and look all craggy (you know what I mean, if you&#x27;ve been there).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it 2-3 weeks but results are obvious and I am excited to see what happens in another few weeks.</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and works well with other products I I got to try with it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pump bottle which makes it easy to use and less of a mess.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m seeing results for sure.</li>
            <li> And I can also say my face looks smother and more youthful too.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive compared to many</li>
            <li> I can see that the top does unscrew so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> The instructions they send you in an email (along with advertising more products), states to use a (their) serum along with this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one because of my all time favorite ingredients it has.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li> I will try to do it in the morning to see better results.</li>
            <li> I love how well they work and</li>
            <li> The day before I received product, I received an email from producer, with usage tips and urging me to purchase more items from their line.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
            <li> It feels pretty good on, but it is a bit too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin looks bright, calm, and smooth.</li>
            <li> an has made most of my fine lines fade away an my skin</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this line because of the many good reviews.</li>
            <li> is more smooth</li>
            <li> It has a lovely light fragrance</li>
            <li> It is semi-thick, spreads nicely and is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> So lightweight and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This impressive formula contains all the active and beneficial ingredients it needs to do the job it claims and then some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it was to strong of the scent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> With the retseliney best face and neck  firming and tightening cream is one product can feel a tight pull around my neck and face after every use.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.  </li>
            <li> recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Great product to add to my facial care routine.</li>
            <li> The pump seems cheap and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it for free or anything.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream too.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li> a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I received  Retseliney Best Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream a few days ago and so far have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this is nice and high quality print on the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream.</li>
            <li> My skin appears firmer and more moisturized, and feels so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my neck for about a week now, and am pleased to say that I am seeing some positive results.  </li>
            <li> The pump bottle makes it easy to use and delivers just the right amount.</li>
            <li> made a difference initially, I was delighted.</li>
            <li> But it feels nice as a moisturizer and does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Make sure when using this product you go through the whole neck.</li>
            <li> while I used this had to use two to three full pumps of the cream.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and in the evening, I also add my regular moisturizer after I let it absorb good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to reap the effects of this because if made my face very oily</li>
            <li> The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!).</li>
            <li> and this really does just that, so quickly!</li>
            <li> my own personal experience with the product and my own personal review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Sort of a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I use some of their other products before bedtime: the Retinol Advanced Moisturizer, the Advanced Retinol Serum and the Advanced Firming Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> this is a higher scented product.</li>
            <li> However it is a real challenge to get it out of the plastic bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give it a try to see if it actually does work, since many reviewers like it.</li>
            <li> top it off, the pump stopped working around the 2nd week.  </li>
            <li> Skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sharing this affordable, real deal firming cream!  </li>
            <li> NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller.</li>
            <li> so I can’t say that there’s only one product that has firmed up my skin, reduced the fine lines around my eyes and softened the laugh lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these products got a 5 star rating, but the ratings were so good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick, creamy, and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I can see a difference even after a single use and i feel like my skin has gotten firmer and tighter faster than most products I have tried</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my neck or face.  </li>
            <li> but my neck and decolletege, not so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face &amp; neck firming cream for about a week now an I must say it does work an very well on my face.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for about 1 month and really didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li> much finer skin textgure.</li>
            <li> I consider this a nice creme because it takes a few seconds to absorb into my skin, when it does, my skin feels moist and hydrated.</li>
            <li> If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Not only is my skin firmer, but it&#x27;s smoother, fine lines are minimized, pores are clear, skin is very supple, and acne has cleared.</li>
            <li> It makes my neck look less saggy and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I really like the results I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I first saw results after my third days of use.</li>
            <li> All natural and vegan!</li>
            <li> it is a little to strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is a nice consistency, you only need a small amount for face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;colletage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting these products if you want to firm up your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Once I used this product I could clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to have mature skin, thinning skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that.</li>
            <li> Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed.</li>
            <li> My husband always compliments me on how young and soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and that is probably why it is not working for me.</li>
            <li> This peptide-firming cream contains vitamin c (brightening), glycolic acid ( clears pores), hyaluronic acid (wrinkle softening), green tea (polyphenols, protects against free radicals, toxins.).</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin that tolerates few heavier face creams, and this one actually makes my skin feel smooth and soft, not oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face and neck feeling soft but not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rear view mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream but ,goes on smooth and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried blending it with some nicely scented moisturizer, and that helps mask the scent of this product - at least somewhat, although not completely.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is good, but the bad scent of this product is a real deterrent from using it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to say if it really works</li>
            <li> I think it compares nicely to much more expensive creams which I have not been able to afford lately.</li>
            <li> Mild, hard to define natural scent</li>
            <li> Smooth neck area that doesn&#x27;t bunch up and look all craggy (you know what I mean, if you&#x27;ve been there).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it 2-3 weeks but results are obvious and I am excited to see what happens in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing and works well with other products I I got to try with it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump bottle which makes it easy to use and less of a mess.</li>
            <li> may not sound like much, but this creme will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I also use coconut oil on my hair after I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive, but I do not like lotions that smell like medicine or even work like sour milk...</li>
            <li> I have seen slight reduction so far.</li>
            <li> To much sun and some neck wrinkles were giving me a complex.</li>
            <li> Mine was in a long tube pump.</li>
            <li> I usually buy products hoping they live up to hype</li>
            <li> Sometimes just the plain old organic formulas work.  </li>
            <li> texture of this product reminds me of a rich, expensive, luxurious department store brand.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of different facial products, but for some reason just forgot to care about the skin a few inches lower.  </li>
            <li> but especially the puppet lines that run from the nose down the sides of the mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this twice a day for a month, I have seen absolutely NO results.  </li>
            <li> I need to use just one pump as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you read some of my other reviews, you will see I have a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will say that mine was not in the short small pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other Retseliney products.</li>
            <li> an active blogger</li>
            <li> C lotion and notice a lightening of spots and dark patches, and</li>
            <li> and this one has aold sour milk smell.</li>
            <li> No more dry and itchy patches.</li>
            <li> , slightly cucumbery.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application:</li>
            <li> This does NOT mean this is a fake review.</li>
            <li> I received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit gives shine and a youthfulness to your hair.</li>
            <li> A little to soon to see results.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to work, even after you wait there is just a little change, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I started having little break outs.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for just a few weeks and have noticed an increase in firmness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a inexpensive face lift everyday.</li>
            <li> Also, Green tea increases antioxidant and capacity of tissues.</li>
            <li> and they usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> No more saggy skin.</li>
            <li> I also use the Peptide Complex Eye Gel around my eye area and on the lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Like a thick lotion or cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have oily skin and could not believe how horrible this made my face feel, will stick with my original ERA moisturizer</li>
            <li> I learned this secret from the stars that are in their 70&#x27;s today.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face,neck and behind my ears.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken.</li>
            <li> Not a great product by no means.</li>
            <li> The color of it is white and when I smoothed it on, it felt like I was putting a thin, protective base on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> so give it two stars down from a four star! :(</li>
            <li> Not usable unfortunately.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products.</li>
            <li> I removed the cap and the scent is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I end up liking a lot because they work well even if I may be slightly disappointed that it&#x27;s not the promised magic-in-a-bottle.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Too bad!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed! !  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5a765ad826a3e08d5ff99d7a6709916f]]This face and neck firming cream is really nice it does have a herbal scent to it but its on the lighter side and I really like it. You can use this product just on the neck like I do or you can use it as a face and neck cream. Its very moisturizing and works well with other products I I got to try with it. Its a great value and comes in nice packaging. I sure hope you have a look at the video because I can tell you more about this awesome Firming cream&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Such a great product.  So lightweight and easy to apply.  I have used the cream for a week now and have already noticed firmer skin and a tighter jawline.  Great to use during the day under makeup or at night.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love the cream! It makes my neck look less saggy and more youthful. I like the herbal scent. I would have given this 5 stars except the pump didn&#x27;t work. I have to unscrew it and scrap the product off the stick of the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream. The color of it is white and when I smoothed it on, it felt like I was putting a thin, protective base on my face and neck. It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried. I consider this a nice creme because it takes a few seconds to absorb into my skin, when it does, my skin feels moist and hydrated. It is quite concentrated, so 1.7 oz. may not sound like much, but this creme will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to have mature skin, thinning skin to use this product. My advice is to use it before your skin reaches those levels. Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that. Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this product reminds me of a rich, expensive, luxurious department store brand. I felt like I was pampering my face and the chest is that this product is so inexpensive! Upon wakening in the morning, my face feels moisturized. I apply it to my neck and chest as well. These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed. I will purchase this again. Next on my list is the eye cream.</li>
            <li> made a difference initially, I was delighted. No further improvement,  I keep using it to maintain the change.</li>
            <li> A great product, fast shipping and the item was as described,!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and it works!</li>
            <li> Forget the neck firming and wrinkle reduction, because it does none of that! But it feels nice as a moisturizer and does not irritate sensitive skin.  Update- bought my second bottle: 1. the bottle looks different. 2. instead of 2 oz it&#x27;s 1.7 oz (and I paid the same price). 3. the second one caused allergic reaction to my neck.</li>
            <li> Have been using for just a few weeks and have noticed an increase in firmness. Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
            <li> This is the best neck firming cream I have ever tried.  I have been using now for over a week and have seen such a big result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> With the retseliney best face and neck  firming and tightening cream is one product can feel a tight pull around my neck and face after every use. It&#x27;s like a inexpensive face lift everyday. I can see a difference even after a single use and i feel like my skin has gotten firmer and tighter faster than most products I have tried before.&lt;br /&gt; It really does feel great,  I love this product because it has a really nice mix of ingredients, that are organic and that are great for the skin and has no unsafe ingredients in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review. 100% my own personal experience with the product and my own personal review</li>
            <li> Great product to add to my facial care routine. To my nose it has a wonderful, light cucumber smell.  Feels wonderful when applied. I recommend this product, good ingredients too.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in my skin. I like the fact that it is organic and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I hate the smell. If you read some of my other reviews, you will see I have a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; thing. Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive, but I do not like lotions that smell like medicine or even work like sour milk... and this one has aold sour milk smell. I do like the way it goes on and absorbs. I CA. See that it actually has tightened my neck... so it still gets four stars. And I will continue to use it for that reason!</li>
            <li> The packaging on this is nice and high quality print on the label. I have to give this a three stars. The reason why for the three stars is an over powering of cucumber scent. For me it was to strong of the scent. Should scents be of a concern for you this is a higher scented product. This might not be the one for you. I will say that mine was not in the short small pump bottle. Mine was in a long tube pump. What I do like it is has a pump. You could pump out more of the cream if you need it. Make sure when using this product you go through the whole neck. I while I used this had to use two to three full pumps of the cream. Now even though the scent was not my cup of tea. I still used this and had results. My neck looks smoother and tighter. Not a lot but some and anything is better than nothing. Even though I have been using this product for over 10 days. Remember that your hands and neck show your age first.&lt;br /&gt;As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my neck or face.  I regularly use virgin olive oil and organic coconut on my skin every day.  Sometimes just the plain old organic formulas work.  My husband always compliments me on how young and soft my skin is.  My friends tell me often that I never age.  I learned this secret from the stars that are in their 70&#x27;s today.  Yes, they also had work done, but when they were in their 40&#x27;s they said they took olive oil baths and used coconut oil on their face.  I also use coconut oil on my hair after I flat iron it.  Just a little bit gives shine and a youthfulness to your hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to say if it really works but it does go on nicely and is not greasy. Has a cocoa butter type smell, but I can deal with that. However it is a real challenge to get it out of the plastic bottle! The pump seems cheap and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several day now. It comes in a pump bottle which makes it easy to use and less of a mess.It is a thick cream but ,goes on smooth and absorbs fast.I use it on my face,neck and behind my ears. I have seen an increase firmness in my checks and the lines around my mouth don&#x27;t look so deep.It has not caused my face to breakout at all.I use this in the morning and in the evening, I also add my regular moisturizer after I let it absorb good.I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. My neck looks much smoother and youthful after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This face and neck firming cream is good. You can feel the righting of your skin as soon as you put in on.&lt;br /&gt;I love the list of ingredients. You get the moisture, the glow, the smoothing and help with wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;This product was offered to me as a sample to try and review with my results.</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to absorb and it does minimize your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! My skin is so happy right now. No more dry and itchy patches. It&#x27;s soft and dewy. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. :)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this line because of the many good reviews. I only have this product and their Vit. C cleanser.  The cleanser is good, but the bad scent of this product is a real deterrent from using it. I&#x27;ve tried blending it with some nicely scented moisturizer, and that helps mask the scent of this product - at least somewhat, although not completely.  One reviewer said she liked the &amp;#34;nice herbal scent&amp;#34;.  Herbal?  That&#x27;s not the word that comes to my mind, and it sure isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34;  Maybe if I open the cap and let it air out, the odor will dissipate.  Let&#x27;s hope.  I&#x27;d like to give it a try to see if it actually does work, since many reviewers like it.</li>
            <li> A little to soon to see results.</li>
            <li> OK this is weird. I usually buy products hoping they live up to hype and they usually don&#x27;t. Some I end up liking a lot because they work well even if I may be slightly disappointed that it&#x27;s not the promised magic-in-a-bottle. This stuff is amazing. After a week I actually see results. I just used it tonight and looked in the mirror before putting it on and said &amp;#34;holy s--t! This stuff is actually working! I can&#x27;t believe it.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 50 and my face is holding up great but my neck and decolletege, not so much. To much sun and some neck wrinkles were giving me a complex. I&#x27;m seeing results for sure. Smooth neck area that doesn&#x27;t bunch up and look all craggy (you know what I mean, if you&#x27;ve been there). And I can also say my face looks smother and more youthful too. I use it with the toner so it could be the combination of both products. I will definitely buy it again and again. I paid for the product too, by the way. I didn&#x27;t get it for free or anything. I had never even ever heard of it until was shopping around Amazon and stumbled on it. It was inexpensive compared to many so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try! To sum up, get this stuff! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves shopkins</li>
            <li> I have been using this face &amp; neck firming cream for about a week now an I must say it does work an very well on my face. It has tightened my skin an has made most of my fine lines fade away an my skin is more smooth an looks an feels great. I will continue to use this cream for now on. I really like the results I have gotten so far. I Received This Product in Exchange for a Honest Review.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times and the then the pump stopped working so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a good product or not. I can see that the top does unscrew so I will dip my fingers into the bottle and use it that way. Too bad!  I&#x27;ll give it a 3 star and hope I can give it a 1-2 star later on if deserved.  I purchased another and had the same problem...returned it!  Liked the cream but not the container pump so give it two stars down from a four star! :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my neck for about a week now, and am pleased to say that I am seeing some positive results.  My skin appears firmer and more moisturized, and feels so soft and healthy.  I have to admit, that before this product I tended to always ignore my neck.  I have used a ton of different facial products, but for some reason just forgot to care about the skin a few inches lower.  Once I used this product I could clearly see the difference.  I will definitely continue to use this now that I see the benefit!!  I Received This Product in Exchange for a Review.</li>
            <li> it is a little to strong for my skin.  After using it for a few days, I started having little break outs.  So disappointed.  I was really hoping it would work for me.  Would have been nice to get rid of some of my many wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and that is probably why it is not working for me.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM FIRMS UP THE FACE AND HELPS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SAGGY SKIN ESPECIALLY NECK AREA. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT vegan. It contains ingredients from bees (beeswax, royal jelly, and propolis).</li>
            <li> Loving this firming cream! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5-6 days now and there is a change, especially in the elasticity of my skin. Not only is my skin firmer, but it&#x27;s smoother, fine lines are minimized, pores are clear, skin is very supple, and acne has cleared. This peptide-firming cream contains vitamin c (brightening), glycolic acid ( clears pores), hyaluronic acid (wrinkle softening), green tea (polyphenols, protects against free radicals, toxins.). Also, Green tea increases antioxidant and capacity of tissues. Jojoba is used for moisture and CoQ10 for tightening of the skin. The cream itself is a nice consistency, you only need a small amount for face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;colletage. There is no sticky or tacky feeling on the skin after applying the product. It absorbs quickly and gives the skin a healthy glow. I first saw results after my third days of use. I recommend using twice a day, especially before bedtime.</li>
            <li> So disappointed! !  Bottle leaking &amp;amp; cream all over the place.  Pump not working so cannot get rest of cream out</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to reap the effects of this because if made my face very oily and I had to wipe off. I do not have oily skin and could not believe how horrible this made my face feel, will stick with my original ERA moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks and have not seen any result.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 1 month and really didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous for my skin. The look and feel of my skin after use of this product is sparkling and i recommend it to everyone who focuses on superb skincare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to brag about. It takes a while to work, even after you wait there is just a little change, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> As a product tester I compare dozens of skin care products, and I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations from fragrance to long-term results. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Mild, hard to define natural scent, slightly cucumbery.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Like a thick lotion or cream.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Satiny moist.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Should be good for all. I have very oily skin that tolerates few heavier face creams, and this one actually makes my skin feel smooth and soft, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 2oz plastic pump-top bottle.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin looks bright, calm, and smooth. This is a great eye cream too.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Excellent. This impressive formula contains all the active and beneficial ingredients it needs to do the job it claims and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> I received  Retseliney Best Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream a few days ago and so far have been very pleased with it. It has a lovely light fragrance and I have been using it every morning prior to my moisturizing lotion I wear under my makeup. I think it compares nicely to much more expensive creams which I have not been able to afford lately. I would order this product again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Retseliney face and neck firming cream for a month.  Once in the morning and once at night...  diligently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, creamy, and has a pleasant scent.  Not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; at all to me.  Sort of a fresh scent.  It feels pretty good on, but it is a bit too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this twice a day for a month, I have seen absolutely NO results.  The instructions they send you in an email (along with advertising more products), states to use a (their) serum along with this product.  I probably would have anyway, as this isn&#x27;t the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, the pump stopped working around the 2nd week.  I would not recommend this product for the $18 price tag listed at the time of this review.</li>
            <li> Just received this. The pump is broken. I removed the cap and the scent is unpleasant. Not usable unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Skin so smooth and soft. No more saggy skin. You gotta love this product! I purchased this one because of my all time favorite ingredients it has. It contains with aloe vera extract (who doesnt love aloe vera?), organic sunflower oil, COCONUT OIL, palm oil, CASTOR OIL!! And vitamin C. I admiy i have all this product individually. I use them to have like a porcelain skin because i heard korean girls like to use castor oil before cleansinh their face! Who wouldn&#x27;t love this product. Eveeything is in there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Ive received this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> only my second day of using this product along with the vitamin C cleanser and i can already see results. its great</li>
            <li> I am 29 y.o and I have been using this to tighten and hopefully erases lines between eyes. I have seen slight reduction so far. I have been using it once a day before sleeping. I will try to do it in the morning to see better results. it is made up of organic ingredients. Non greasy and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I got this at a promotional rate to give my opinion on this product.</li>
            <li> This is a firming cream for both neck and face. It has a light, pleasant scent that disappears as it absorbs into the skin. The pump bottle makes it easy to use and delivers just the right amount. It is semi-thick, spreads nicely and is quickly absorbed into the skin. I need to use just one pump as a little bit goes a long way. It leaves my face and neck feeling soft but not greasy or sticky. I use it in combination with other Retseliney products. In the morning after cleansing my face, I use their Toner, then the Vitamin C Serum. After that absorbs, I use the Firming Cream on my face and neck. I also use the Peptide Complex Eye Gel around my eye area and on the lines around my mouth. I use some of their other products before bedtime: the Retinol Advanced Moisturizer, the Advanced Retinol Serum and the Advanced Firming Eye Cream. These products all work together so I can’t say that there’s only one product that has firmed up my skin, reduced the fine lines around my eyes and softened the laugh lines around my mouth. I would recommend getting these products if you want to firm up your skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite company and this product works great!  I love how well they work and how well they smell!  All natural and vegan!</li>
            <li> The day before I received product, I received an email from producer, with usage tips and urging me to purchase more items from their line. The instructions were welcome--we will see how the product works.</li>
            <li> I am using this with the antioxidant and Vit. C lotion and notice a lightening of spots and dark patches, and much finer skin textgure. I also notice a lifting effect all over my face but especially the puppet lines that run from the nose down the sides of the mouth. I&#x27;ve only been using it 2-3 weeks but results are obvious and I am excited to see what happens in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried high-end neck creams and low-end neck creams. Of ALL of them, this one gives the most results and almost instantly. The first time I applied, I noticed a tightening (and moisturizing!). I have now been using for 1 week. Before using this cream, I would look at my neck in my car&#x27;s rear view mirror and be horrified at how old my neck appeared. NOW, however, I am very pleasantly surprised that the skin looks tight and the lines in my neck from sleeping, etc., are greatly diminished and the skin appears fuller. I am very pleased overall with the price and the results and highly recommend this cream. BUY IT! If you have severe turkey-neck, this product will obviously not work as well, but it is definitely worth a try! Product provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> i received this for a review. i had never tried a firming cream before, but once i got this to review, i decided to try it on my neck, and it is easily the most moisturizing cream i&#x27;ve ever used! it makes sense that if your skin is absorbing moisture, that it would plump and firm and this really does just that, so quickly!</li>
            <li> Not a great product by no means. Not sure how these products got a 5 star rating, but the ratings were so good I thought I would try it. Staying with Clinique.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 4 days now, and I can tell you I already see firming results in my &amp;#34;turkey&amp;#34; neck. My best friend even said something to me....totally unsolicited!  She will be purchasing this amazing cream now that she sees my results! Thank you for sharing this affordable, real deal firming cream!  Update: I just purchased 2 more...one for me and one for my friend!</li>
