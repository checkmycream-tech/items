            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>I love this and have been using it for years.</li>

            <li>so you have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>I use this on my hands mostly.  </li>
            <li>I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gold Bond for yet another great product</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Love the texture.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I make sure to put this cream on before I go to bed</li>
            <li>Glad to see Amazon offering the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>This is more a cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon is able to offer Gold Bond at a lower price than in any supermarket or department store.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Now it is better.  </li>
            <li>And I love her.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have allergies so can&#x27;t use most lotions or creams.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of hand lotions and this one ranks up towards the top.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and the lotion is nice.  </li>
            <li>It seems to permeate the skin and also leave a layer on top.</li>
            <li>I bought the standup tube which, I think, is better than a pump bottle</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I think the cream is much better than the lotion .</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love Gold Bond -</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it really does a very nice job on my hands...</li>
            <li>This lotion is very unique in that it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>use it mainly as a post shave lotion when shaving with an electric razor and it is great.</li>
            <li>, this has a hint of a smell, nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Seems to do pretty good there too</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>and this is just wonderful for those dry scaly patches that have sprung up heading into menopause.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing lotion that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who does a fair amount outside, and a fair amount with his hands.  </li>
            <li>You could spend 4x the price on other, fancier creams and I promise you they would not work better than this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>One of the very best lotions for very dry hands (and feet).</li>
            <li>Gold Bond Ultimate skin therapy lotion is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs quickly with the moist skin and my face is looking better and better.  </li>
            <li>True to it&#x27;s adverstiment -  this product does truly work!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfume-y, not greasy, and goes on easily and socks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a brilliant product, as it is not oily on the skin and stays quite a long time, even when you wash it off lightly.</li>
            <li>It is more of a cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>Again, I really appreciate Amazon offering the option of good products in quantity packs in addition to single packs at great prices.</li>
            <li>What a welcome surprise to open the box and find that I received the Skin Therapy Cream, which I already know to be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s a link for a free sample set and a $10 coupon:</li>
            <li>Am happy with the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing Aloe</li>
            <li>This is fabulous hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and nice cream.  </li>
            <li>the be the best solution to our cracked, dried hands.  </li>
            <li>followed my a light coating of Gold Bond.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Better price than walmart or walgreens, this is the best for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>This versatile lotion can serve as both a day or night moisturizer, and it provides a degree of relief that I generally associate with moisturizers priced considerably higher...therefore making it a product of excellent value.</li>

            <li>Since I am satisfied with the Gold Bond powder, when I saw the pack of 3 Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Lotion, I thought OK!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this because of internet reviews on how this reduced the crepe like look on arms.  </li>
            <li>But they haven&#x27;t turned into eczema yet, so as long as it keeps that from happening and spreading, I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I am really loving these new Gold Bond products.  </li>
            <li>Despite this thicker consistency, it is just about as easy to work into skin as many thinner-weight lotions, but it provides a degree of relief that most thinner lotions I have used fall short of.</li>
            <li>This lotion is the absolute best of any other creams/lotions that I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will say it&#x27;s working very quickly on the older bumps in the rash, the newer ones are feeling much better but aren&#x27;t drying up as quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean soft smell.</li>
            <li>It does not have much of a fragrance which is ok with me.</li>
            <li>You also do not get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my toes and heels and feet are as soft and nice as a baby&#x27;s.)  </li>
            <li>Simply put it makes your tootsies feel good.</li>
            <li>So, we turned to the net and found comparable, good buys.</li>
            <li>When I found this item on Amazon, even though it said it was a lotion, it sounded so similar, and at a good price, that I decided to order it.</li>
            <li>I have severe dry sensitive skin and eczema and this lotion is great!</li>
            <li>I first found out about this product when I was on holiday in LA, California 3 years ago and found it a very effective skin cream for my arms that gets itchy blisters in the sun, especially in summer.</li>
            <li>So based on my own positive experiences, I highly recommend Gold Bond Ultimate.get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of similar products such as lotions, cremes and ointments and of all of them, I like this one the best.   </li>
            <li>Vaseline Renewal (almost like water) and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly</li>
            <li>I like the mild scent of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a good unisex moisturizer: the scent is one which is very mild and to me just smells kind of &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; As a male, I prefer not to use a lotion that leaves me smelling like a floral display, and so this minor fresh scent is preferable to me.</li>

            <li>This squeeze tube container is is the best way to get the most use out of this lush, thick, dreamy lotion.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this lotion to others!!</li>
            <li>This is the first commercially available skin cream that works for</li>
            <li>-- this also means it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which may be appreciated by some folks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Gold Bond products and find that they are all outstanding!</li>
            <li>GOLD BOND ULTIMATE HEALING LOTION is without a doubt the best thing on the market for dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>I have Gold Bond skin cream tucked in various places around the house for easy access - the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and even the livingroom by my husband and my favorite recliners.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, with continued use, this stuff actually does soften the roughest patches and then keeps them from returning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it sure makes the red itchy place on my arm feel and look better, and I really need that.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at how much better it was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice balance between not to watery that vanishes in minutes to greasy that leaves hands gross.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin on my face imaginable</li>
            <li>This lotion is nice in a couple different ways.   </li>
            <li>Once I complete the use of this package of 3 I will purchase some more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy because maintenance is important for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it has a nice, fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m sure all the money I&#x27;ve spent searching for relief pales in comparison to just about everyone, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try, it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try a warm wash cloth at night to wipe my face</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Seems to go on and get absorbed right away.  </li>
            <li>Afterall I was already more than pleased with every other Gold Bond product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>My husbands irritated skin has healed after trying numerous other products Gold Bond worked the best</li>
            <li>Another reason I prefer skin moisturizers with minimal scents is because many of the ingredients used to create fragrances are strong skin</li>
            <li>Another reason I prefer skin moisturizers with minimal scents is because many of the ingredients used to create fragrances are strong skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, thick, smooth cream that really works well.</li>
            <li>This is the best rehydrater  I&#x27;ve used to soften and moisturize hands, knees and other spots that dry out,</li>
            <li>Cooking is a passion of mine, and I make huge messes in the kitchen when I&#x27;m trying out new ideas</li>
            <li>My skins tends to dry out/crack easily, and Gold Bond heals it very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Washes off fairly easily (which means frequent re-application, which is why I&#x27;ve listed this under &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>oh my gosh i LOVE this lotion i saw instant results</li>
            <li>The Gold Bond Healing Body Wash is the first moisturizing body wash that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love, and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>I had my first eczema breakout this winter at age 37.</li>
            <li>I highly recommened this product!!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>My nails have even stopped splitting and breaking so much!  </li>
            <li>It does wash off the first time you wash your hands which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Living in the Arizona desert for most of our life, we end up with extra-dry skin, especially the elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li>I am a avid supporter of all of Gold Bond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>So based on my own positive experiences, I highly recommend Gold Bond Ultimate.</li>
            <li>see by other reviewers&#x27; comments that it evidently is effective for eczema and that may well be so.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hands each day and it has made a positive difference.</li>
            <li>Also read the long list of ingredients on the product, many of which are known toxins.</li>
            <li>This lotion works great as hand or foot lotion, and although it is a bit cheaper to buy the pump bottle, those pumps have failed me on a significant number of bottles that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>So this is a product that can moisturize even more severe dry</li>
            <li>With the large pump containers, you lose a large portion of the cream that sticks to the inside of the containers.</li>
            <li>We can certainly recommenmd this healing lotion,</li>
            <li>(like many popular brands).. Since it is expensive, I will mix it with some Lubriderm before putting on my legs.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it</li>
            <li>the pump, and without so much \\&quot;waste.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil, A&amp;D, and prescription stuff, but nothing really kept it in check until now.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much it cost because it is cheaper than a co-pay and paying for medicines that did not work.</li>
            <li>The healing lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll use it when if my hands are very chapped</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being too greasy except when I&#x27;ve put way too much on.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, works really well, and is unscented.  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Yet it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works as it claims.</li>
            <li>You can also feel the lotion on your skin after the night so it really works through day and night.</li>
            <li>The container made things much easier to apply the lotion.</li>
            <li>It really is the &amp;#34;Ultimate&amp;#34; skin healing lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t done much for that except soothe the itch.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hands are oily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Leaves my hands feeling really greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for problem hands!</li>
            <li>This really brings moisturizing therapy to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending the cream so fast.  </li>
            <li>We recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Many lotions and creams I have used simply do not provide ample relief, need reapplication often, and have inflamed my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine; if you can buy a single tube easily at about the same price in a retail store, there shouldn&#x27;t be a need to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pet groomer and this lotion applied a few times during the day and at night is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that can keep my hand stay healthy!!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, sinks in fast, doesn&#x27;t smell awful like so many do, and this package size is perfect to keep in the car or your computer bag.</li>
            <li>The first one that ever completely did the job is this Gold Bold Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion---yet is is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>lotion(it&#x27;s really a cream) came to the rescue and within 2 days my hands looked and felt like new.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is almost dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker than most lotions I&#x27;ve previously used (or am still trying to use up) - examples:  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and need soothing and smooth effects this what you need.</li>
            <li>Brought some of this back home from my last trip to USA.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.could not find it here locally,ordered more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Because it does work.</li>
            <li>After washing my hands countless times, using hand sanitizer countless more, my hands don&#x27;t crack and peel like they used to.  </li>
            <li>but it is so mild you are not likely to notice it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is actually helping to reduce the crepe-like look, but it is definitely good at hydrating.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite go to lotion - essential for living in the dry southwest.  </li>
            <li>What I do is put just a bit on then rub it in, move to a new spot and repeat.</li>
            <li>overall, Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>overall, Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I used to think that Gold Bond was for old folks, but this particular product changed my mind.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And while Gold Bond Ultimate delivers the relief that I generally expect of a heavy-weight cream, it wears super well.</li>
            <li>i used this one time and my skin was soft as silk!</li>
            <li>Among those products are their various lines of lotions/creams, many which are priced in the range of a value moisturizer, but give the performance of products which are generally much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance.</li>
            <li>Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance.</li>
            <li>Not sure what it was, but this mostly keeps it 100% gone.</li>
            <li>Now, they are soft as can be!</li>
            <li>My significant other tells me every day how soft my skin is!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only hand cream which has actually made a significant difference, and I use it regularly</li>
            <li>main issue I am personally dealing with is dry skin that is very dry (and hence VERY easily irritated).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a general purpose moisturizing lotion and tried this mainly because the tube container was convenient to slip into my gym bag.  </li>
            <li>My only concern for any and all commercial skin products (and it is a valid one voiced by many health experts and doctors) is that the human body ingests a long list of potential toxins as they are absorbed into your skin and bloodstream.  </li>
            <li>It is a very thick lotion and hydrates nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and this product really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I have been using a little 1 oz. tube of the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Cream that I bought while I was traveling and fell in love with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
            <li>I Love Gold Bond products, helps with My dry skin due to Diabetic problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that a Company like Gold    </li>
            <li>I have been to two Dermatologist and about five different prescriptions that were very pricey and did not work.</li>
            <li>Package claims gentle enough for face, and yes it is.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily on my whole body, including my face.  </li>
            <li>Works fast, and is alot cheaper if you use it regularly to buy it from here.!!</li>
            <li>Am diabetic and have no problems so far.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nearly a cream consistency.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t ever feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>so I can have one at work, in the kitchen and near the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and mutliple types (</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve tried dozens of types of hand lotion... as a group of nurses who wash their hands often this has proven by far</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything, including pricy Cetaphil, and nothing works like GOLD BOND ULTIMATE</li>
            <li>and my hands are soft and healed in the morning.</li>
            <li>So much for several hundred dollars at the cosmetics counter!  </li>
            <li>(I keep a tube in my bedside table and one in the kitchen and really do rub the cream on 2-3 times daily).  </li>
            <li>but it still doesn&#x27;t disperse lotion when you get near the bottom.</li>
            <li>When it is almost empty, I cut off the middle section of the tube, but the top back on the bottom, and use my finger to reach into the tube.</li>
            <li>I also have developed Excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I keep my hands in a lot of water and this lotion helps to keep my hands soft.</li>
            <li>Overall it is far better than any other similar product that I have tried.</li>
            <li>So happy they offer it in the tube as the bottle with pump left way too much product at bottom of bottle, that was impossible to get out.  </li>
            <li>My hands and legs were pretty dry (from winter weather) where layers of skin were showing and it took about a week to heal back to its normal state (applied once to twice per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that would work on my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>What started out as a tiny patch of hives from a minor food allergy, quickly took over almost my entire shin.</li>
            <li>I find it is helpful for my dry skin condition, my skin is much softer since using this product.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is thicker going on and really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li>When I put my comp0ression socks on in the morning this stuff really works well to keep my skin from getting dry and sore in spots.  </li>
            <li>It has a thick creamy texture and it makes my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>it is a bit thick but easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it greasy, but maybe the shiny slickness is \\&quot;moisturizer,\\&quot; and not due to the petrolatum on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and very arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li>have only been using this product a few weeks, but noticed my skin was so soft the first couple of times I used the Gold Bond!  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product in the market to reduce these lumps and leave a clear skin, and Gold Bond actually does this!</li>
            <li>It is not oily, &#x27;dries&#x27; fast, and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am an old man with lots of outdoor exposure--great stuff for the human body.</li>
            <li>It particularly helps my hands&#x27; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond Ultimate works very well for dry skin, and this formula does not feel greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li>It really has healed my red, extremely dry, cracking skin.</li>
            <li>it on like hand lotion, then expecting the excess to be absorbed by skin only makes a mess.</li>
            <li>It wears lightly, does not have a greasy residue, provides all-day relief with a single application, and is capable of giving necessary relief to even the driest of skin without irritating sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other lotions, but there&#x27;s something in this that really seems to heal skin as advertized.  </li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in the way my hands feel vs other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Not soft like a younger person but at least it doesn&#x27;t split any more.  </li>
            <li>This is my second favorite lotion behind JnJ&#x27;s Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and once on it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my daily go to skin therapy lotion when my skin is dry but otherwise normal.</li>
            <li>I used to use multiple layers of normal lotion and wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>During the day I generally use this Gold Bond Ultimate lotion because it wears well yet provides ample relief...</li>
            <li>But if you just want a general purpose moisturizer lotion, I recommend sticking to Vaseline (or similar) lotions.</li>
            <li>I like what came, but it&#x27;s in a green pump bottle and has a medicinal smell at first.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used this cream and really like it.  </li>
            <li>My hands get dry and cracked from frequent washing and working outside.</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s not very practical to reapply a lotion at work, having a product that gives ample relief with a single application is very convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s not very practical to reapply a lotion at work, having a product that gives ample relief with a single application is very convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should I have to handle a semi delicate fabric--say, doing laundry, or hugging my wife or children--and my hands frequently act like a really grabby sandpaper.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The lotion also spreads nicely given</li>

            <li> Most cremes I have used are runny or require reapplication to keep and area moist but not this stuff.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot more money for aftershave balms.</li>
            <li> Works better than Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has helped more than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> my hands are in water more often .</li>
            <li> Anyway, you will love this if you haven&#x27;t already discovered it.  </li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied, with the product, the price and the seller.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic overnight.</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands mostly.  </li>
            <li> I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gold Bond for yet another great product</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Love the texture.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I make sure to put this cream on before I go to bed</li>
            <li> Glad to see Amazon offering the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> This is more a cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon is able to offer Gold Bond at a lower price than in any supermarket or department store.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Now it is better.  </li>
            <li> And I love her.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have allergies so can&#x27;t use most lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of hand lotions and this one ranks up towards the top.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and the lotion is nice.  </li>
            <li> It seems to permeate the skin and also leave a layer on top.</li>
            <li> I bought the standup tube which, I think, is better than a pump bottle</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I think the cream is much better than the lotion .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love Gold Bond -</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> it really does a very nice job on my hands...</li>
            <li> This lotion is very unique in that it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> use it mainly as a post shave lotion when shaving with an electric razor and it is great.</li>
            <li> , this has a hint of a smell, nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Seems to do pretty good there too</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> and this is just wonderful for those dry scaly patches that have sprung up heading into menopause.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing lotion that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who does a fair amount outside, and a fair amount with his hands.  </li>
            <li> You could spend 4x the price on other, fancier creams and I promise you they would not work better than this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> One of the very best lotions for very dry hands (and feet).</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate skin therapy lotion is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs quickly with the moist skin and my face is looking better and better.  </li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s adverstiment -  this product does truly work!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfume-y, not greasy, and goes on easily and socks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is a brilliant product, as it is not oily on the skin and stays quite a long time, even when you wash it off lightly.</li>
            <li> It is more of a cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> Again, I really appreciate Amazon offering the option of good products in quantity packs in addition to single packs at great prices.</li>
            <li> What a welcome surprise to open the box and find that I received the Skin Therapy Cream, which I already know to be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s a link for a free sample set and a $10 coupon:</li>
            <li> Am happy with the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing Aloe</li>
            <li> This is fabulous hand cream.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and nice cream.  </li>
            <li> the be the best solution to our cracked, dried hands.  </li>
            <li> followed my a light coating of Gold Bond.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Better price than walmart or walgreens, this is the best for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> This versatile lotion can serve as both a day or night moisturizer, and it provides a degree of relief that I generally associate with moisturizers priced considerably higher...therefore making it a product of excellent value.</li>

            <li> Since I am satisfied with the Gold Bond powder, when I saw the pack of 3 Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Lotion, I thought OK!  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this because of internet reviews on how this reduced the crepe like look on arms.  </li>
            <li> But they haven&#x27;t turned into eczema yet, so as long as it keeps that from happening and spreading, I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I am really loving these new Gold Bond products.  </li>
            <li> Despite this thicker consistency, it is just about as easy to work into skin as many thinner-weight lotions, but it provides a degree of relief that most thinner lotions I have used fall short of.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the absolute best of any other creams/lotions that I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will say it&#x27;s working very quickly on the older bumps in the rash, the newer ones are feeling much better but aren&#x27;t drying up as quickly.</li>
            <li> Has a nice clean soft smell.</li>
            <li> It does not have much of a fragrance which is ok with me.</li>
            <li> You also do not get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my toes and heels and feet are as soft and nice as a baby&#x27;s.)  </li>
            <li> Simply put it makes your tootsies feel good.</li>
            <li> So, we turned to the net and found comparable, good buys.</li>
            <li> When I found this item on Amazon, even though it said it was a lotion, it sounded so similar, and at a good price, that I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry sensitive skin and eczema and this lotion is great!</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product when I was on holiday in LA, California 3 years ago and found it a very effective skin cream for my arms that gets itchy blisters in the sun, especially in summer.</li>
            <li> So based on my own positive experiences, I highly recommend Gold Bond Ultimate.get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of similar products such as lotions, cremes and ointments and of all of them, I like this one the best.   </li>
            <li> Vaseline Renewal (almost like water) and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly</li>
            <li> I like the mild scent of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a good unisex moisturizer: the scent is one which is very mild and to me just smells kind of &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; As a male, I prefer not to use a lotion that leaves me smelling like a floral display, and so this minor fresh scent is preferable to me.</li>

            <li> This squeeze tube container is is the best way to get the most use out of this lush, thick, dreamy lotion.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this lotion to others!!</li>
            <li> This is the first commercially available skin cream that works for</li>
            <li> -- this also means it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which may be appreciated by some folks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Gold Bond products and find that they are all outstanding!</li>
            <li> GOLD BOND ULTIMATE HEALING LOTION is without a doubt the best thing on the market for dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> I have Gold Bond skin cream tucked in various places around the house for easy access - the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and even the livingroom by my husband and my favorite recliners.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, with continued use, this stuff actually does soften the roughest patches and then keeps them from returning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it sure makes the red itchy place on my arm feel and look better, and I really need that.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at how much better it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice balance between not to watery that vanishes in minutes to greasy that leaves hands gross.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin on my face imaginable</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice in a couple different ways.   </li>
            <li> Once I complete the use of this package of 3 I will purchase some more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy because maintenance is important for younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has a nice, fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m sure all the money I&#x27;ve spent searching for relief pales in comparison to just about everyone, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try, it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try a warm wash cloth at night to wipe my face</li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Seems to go on and get absorbed right away.  </li>
            <li> Afterall I was already more than pleased with every other Gold Bond product I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> My husbands irritated skin has healed after trying numerous other products Gold Bond worked the best</li>
            <li> Another reason I prefer skin moisturizers with minimal scents is because many of the ingredients used to create fragrances are strong skin</li>
            <li> Another reason I prefer skin moisturizers with minimal scents is because many of the ingredients used to create fragrances are strong skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, thick, smooth cream that really works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best rehydrater  I&#x27;ve used to soften and moisturize hands, knees and other spots that dry out,</li>
            <li> Cooking is a passion of mine, and I make huge messes in the kitchen when I&#x27;m trying out new ideas</li>
            <li> My skins tends to dry out/crack easily, and Gold Bond heals it very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Washes off fairly easily (which means frequent re-application, which is why I&#x27;ve listed this under &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> oh my gosh i LOVE this lotion i saw instant results</li>
            <li> The Gold Bond Healing Body Wash is the first moisturizing body wash that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love, and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I had my first eczema breakout this winter at age 37.</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this product!!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> My nails have even stopped splitting and breaking so much!  </li>
            <li> It does wash off the first time you wash your hands which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Living in the Arizona desert for most of our life, we end up with extra-dry skin, especially the elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li> I am a avid supporter of all of Gold Bond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> So based on my own positive experiences, I highly recommend Gold Bond Ultimate.</li>
            <li> see by other reviewers&#x27; comments that it evidently is effective for eczema and that may well be so.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hands each day and it has made a positive difference.</li>
            <li> Also read the long list of ingredients on the product, many of which are known toxins.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great as hand or foot lotion, and although it is a bit cheaper to buy the pump bottle, those pumps have failed me on a significant number of bottles that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> So this is a product that can moisturize even more severe dry</li>
            <li> With the large pump containers, you lose a large portion of the cream that sticks to the inside of the containers.</li>
            <li> We can certainly recommenmd this healing lotion,</li>
            <li> (like many popular brands).. Since it is expensive, I will mix it with some Lubriderm before putting on my legs.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it</li>
            <li> the pump, and without so much \\&quot;waste.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil, A&amp;D, and prescription stuff, but nothing really kept it in check until now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much it cost because it is cheaper than a co-pay and paying for medicines that did not work.</li>
            <li> The healing lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll use it when if my hands are very chapped</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being too greasy except when I&#x27;ve put way too much on.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, works really well, and is unscented.  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Yet it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works as it claims.</li>
            <li> You can also feel the lotion on your skin after the night so it really works through day and night.</li>
            <li> The container made things much easier to apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> It really is the &amp;#34;Ultimate&amp;#34; skin healing lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t done much for that except soothe the itch.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hands are oily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Leaves my hands feeling really greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream for problem hands!</li>
            <li> This really brings moisturizing therapy to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending the cream so fast.  </li>
            <li> We recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Many lotions and creams I have used simply do not provide ample relief, need reapplication often, and have inflamed my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine; if you can buy a single tube easily at about the same price in a retail store, there shouldn&#x27;t be a need to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pet groomer and this lotion applied a few times during the day and at night is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that can keep my hand stay healthy!!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, sinks in fast, doesn&#x27;t smell awful like so many do, and this package size is perfect to keep in the car or your computer bag.</li>
            <li> The first one that ever completely did the job is this Gold Bold Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion---yet is is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> lotion(it&#x27;s really a cream) came to the rescue and within 2 days my hands looked and felt like new.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is almost dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker than most lotions I&#x27;ve previously used (or am still trying to use up) - examples:  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and need soothing and smooth effects this what you need.</li>
            <li> Brought some of this back home from my last trip to USA.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.could not find it here locally,ordered more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Because it does work.</li>
            <li> After washing my hands countless times, using hand sanitizer countless more, my hands don&#x27;t crack and peel like they used to.  </li>
            <li> but it is so mild you are not likely to notice it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is actually helping to reduce the crepe-like look, but it is definitely good at hydrating.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to lotion - essential for living in the dry southwest.  </li>
            <li> What I do is put just a bit on then rub it in, move to a new spot and repeat.</li>
            <li> overall, Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> overall, Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I used to think that Gold Bond was for old folks, but this particular product changed my mind.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And while Gold Bond Ultimate delivers the relief that I generally expect of a heavy-weight cream, it wears super well.</li>
            <li> i used this one time and my skin was soft as silk!</li>
            <li> Among those products are their various lines of lotions/creams, many which are priced in the range of a value moisturizer, but give the performance of products which are generally much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance.</li>
            <li> Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was, but this mostly keeps it 100% gone.</li>
            <li> Now, they are soft as can be!</li>
            <li> My significant other tells me every day how soft my skin is!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only hand cream which has actually made a significant difference, and I use it regularly</li>
            <li> main issue I am personally dealing with is dry skin that is very dry (and hence VERY easily irritated).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a general purpose moisturizing lotion and tried this mainly because the tube container was convenient to slip into my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> My only concern for any and all commercial skin products (and it is a valid one voiced by many health experts and doctors) is that the human body ingests a long list of potential toxins as they are absorbed into your skin and bloodstream.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick lotion and hydrates nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this product really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I have been using a little 1 oz. tube of the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Cream that I bought while I was traveling and fell in love with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
            <li> I Love Gold Bond products, helps with My dry skin due to Diabetic problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that a Company like Gold    </li>
            <li> I have been to two Dermatologist and about five different prescriptions that were very pricey and did not work.</li>
            <li> Package claims gentle enough for face, and yes it is.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily on my whole body, including my face.  </li>
            <li> Works fast, and is alot cheaper if you use it regularly to buy it from here.!!</li>
            <li> Am diabetic and have no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nearly a cream consistency.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t ever feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> so I can have one at work, in the kitchen and near the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mutliple types (</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried dozens of types of hand lotion... as a group of nurses who wash their hands often this has proven by far</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything, including pricy Cetaphil, and nothing works like GOLD BOND ULTIMATE</li>
            <li> and my hands are soft and healed in the morning.</li>
            <li> So much for several hundred dollars at the cosmetics counter!  </li>
            <li> (I keep a tube in my bedside table and one in the kitchen and really do rub the cream on 2-3 times daily).  </li>
            <li> but it still doesn&#x27;t disperse lotion when you get near the bottom.</li>
            <li> When it is almost empty, I cut off the middle section of the tube, but the top back on the bottom, and use my finger to reach into the tube.</li>
            <li> I also have developed Excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I keep my hands in a lot of water and this lotion helps to keep my hands soft.</li>
            <li> Overall it is far better than any other similar product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> So happy they offer it in the tube as the bottle with pump left way too much product at bottom of bottle, that was impossible to get out.  </li>
            <li> My hands and legs were pretty dry (from winter weather) where layers of skin were showing and it took about a week to heal back to its normal state (applied once to twice per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that would work on my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> What started out as a tiny patch of hives from a minor food allergy, quickly took over almost my entire shin.</li>
            <li> I find it is helpful for my dry skin condition, my skin is much softer since using this product.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is thicker going on and really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When I put my comp0ression socks on in the morning this stuff really works well to keep my skin from getting dry and sore in spots.  </li>
            <li> It has a thick creamy texture and it makes my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> it is a bit thick but easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it greasy, but maybe the shiny slickness is \\&quot;moisturizer,\\&quot; and not due to the petrolatum on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and very arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> have only been using this product a few weeks, but noticed my skin was so soft the first couple of times I used the Gold Bond!  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product in the market to reduce these lumps and leave a clear skin, and Gold Bond actually does this!</li>
            <li> It is not oily, &#x27;dries&#x27; fast, and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am an old man with lots of outdoor exposure--great stuff for the human body.</li>
            <li> It particularly helps my hands&#x27; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate works very well for dry skin, and this formula does not feel greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li> It really has healed my red, extremely dry, cracking skin.</li>
            <li> it on like hand lotion, then expecting the excess to be absorbed by skin only makes a mess.</li>
            <li> It wears lightly, does not have a greasy residue, provides all-day relief with a single application, and is capable of giving necessary relief to even the driest of skin without irritating sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lotions, but there&#x27;s something in this that really seems to heal skin as advertized.  </li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference in the way my hands feel vs other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Not soft like a younger person but at least it doesn&#x27;t split any more.  </li>
            <li> This is my second favorite lotion behind JnJ&#x27;s Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and once on it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my daily go to skin therapy lotion when my skin is dry but otherwise normal.</li>
            <li> I used to use multiple layers of normal lotion and wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> During the day I generally use this Gold Bond Ultimate lotion because it wears well yet provides ample relief...</li>
            <li> But if you just want a general purpose moisturizer lotion, I recommend sticking to Vaseline (or similar) lotions.</li>
            <li> I like what came, but it&#x27;s in a green pump bottle and has a medicinal smell at first.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this cream and really like it.  </li>
            <li> My hands get dry and cracked from frequent washing and working outside.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s not very practical to reapply a lotion at work, having a product that gives ample relief with a single application is very convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s not very practical to reapply a lotion at work, having a product that gives ample relief with a single application is very convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should I have to handle a semi delicate fabric--say, doing laundry, or hugging my wife or children--and my hands frequently act like a really grabby sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Fast drying, non greasy, and no strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so you need half of the normal amount of lotion you would need), but it feels feather-light on the skin.</li>
            <li> Handling paper a lot of the day, my hands become dry - not to mention my natural tendency toward dry skin.  </li>
            <li> red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say you should be careful of the amount; it doesn&#x27;t take much to adequately cover an entire hand, maybe a blob 2-3mm thick.  </li>
            <li> I am going to remain neutral on the packaging because my tube is quite old and plastics do wear/break down over time.</li>
            <li> I constantly have to wash my hands at work and thus have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It disappears into the skin providing instant relief for dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Took only one use for me to realize this was the answer to stopping itchy, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond with aloe is the only lotion that truly heals my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It definitely eliminates dry skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone in the healthcare field, and since it&#x27;s not highly scented, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it bothering patients like some lotions do.</li>
            <li> Although I bought this at my grocery store and it was a bit pricier than the other ones on the shelf, next time I am going for the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this above any other.  </li>
            <li> It is hard for me to believe that a product could put this much allergy causing perfume in one tube.  </li>
            <li> Dry seasons here in the Midwest can be brutal and lotion is a must, this one however is not as great as Shaq makes it seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait long before I can use my hands again, and I don&#x27;t go around leaving a residue on anything I touch</li>
            <li> I recommend it to people who have minor scraps and burns.</li>
            <li> What a waste, a three pack of this stuff is now going straight down the apartment building garbage chute.</li>
            <li> I like the tubes much better than the pump bottle, and they are generally less expensive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have realy dry skin</li>
            <li> I have skin so dry and cracked that it bleeds sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always have dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry a flakie.</li>
            <li> am testing this in a dry climate in the southwest...</li>
            <li> This is one heck of a cream for dry skin, whether you are using it for hands or feet or any body part for that matter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> help protect dry hands (softens the skin, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My elderly dry skin was cracking and spliting until I started using this creme.  </li>
            <li> This gives a lot of nutrition for people looking to use fewer layers on dry or damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> lotion is thick and smooth, but not the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> Very thick lotion, exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I tried several remedies suggested online with no success.</li>
            <li> I pick up the travel size tubes from my local pharmacy for less than $2.00.</li>
            <li> , I mentioned my rough dry cracked</li>
            <li> used a bit of this a 2-3 times a day, and there were only a few patches that were dry or</li>
            <li> This is one of the few dry skin products that actually give relief and not just another promise.  </li>
            <li> this very thick and rick moisturizer really does what it says it will and is therapy for your dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin due to surgery and medicines.</li>
            <li> Also relieves the itching due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> The gold bond lotion is one of the few lotions that actually helps my skin stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond does the job, it&#x27;s not real greasy and has no girly odor.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot so ended up with elephant rough skin on my knuckles.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of applying this everyday my hands have improved dramatically, a lot cheaper than my next option which was to begin treatments with a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It will last a few days at a time without the skin drying out again.  </li>
            <li> it does what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very greasy either.</li>
            <li> It is icy up here</li>
            <li> I also use it on Saddle Sores from sitting too long driving down the road.  </li>
            <li> For this reason alone, I try to use skin moisturizers only once in a while, when my skin gets desperately dry (usually during winter months).</li>
            <li> And my children and wife are constantly asking me to do something about my super dry and crack-y (and painful)</li>
            <li> My dry cracked skin itches and hurts less each time I move.   </li>
            <li> It is so thick and its moisturizing characteristics last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-irritating and just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t bring myself to wear rubber gloves, and so my poor old dry hands spend a lot of time in soapy water and with sponges and cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products but nothing compares to this body lotion.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because it was Gold Bond and was expecting something medicine smelling.  </li>
            <li> This is in contrast to other moisturizers that are almost glue like.  </li>
            <li> gold bond has all of the other healing lotions beat, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I bought a small one in my local drugstore on a whim when I was checking out and put some on when I got home.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and compare to other skin products.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is very hard to avoid such ingredients in personal care products these days.)</li>
            <li> your hands are so dry that they&#x27;re cracked and bleeding (this happens to me in the winter), the lotion might cause a little bit of stinging.</li>
            <li> I was very careful when I ordered this and noted the description says lotion and the image is for lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin all year round.</li>
            <li> After trying this one out, all other lotions ive tried seem &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is not with the product but with the way Amazon sells it in a package of three which will probably last me four years.  </li>
            <li> It can provide satisfactory relief in a wide variety of situations, and for skins of all types, including situations in which some serious moisturizing is necessary.</li>
            <li> It can provide satisfactory relief in a wide variety of situations, and for skins of all types, including situations in which some serious moisturizing is necessary.</li>
            <li> Bond would use such shoddy packaging.</li>
            <li> Judging by the average rating, my opinion is in the minority but here goes:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick - roughly consistency of toothpaste, and (2) it leaves a greasy residue that takes a LONG time to soak into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have about the product is that is does leave a residue where it is not needed.  </li>
            <li> It is thick enough to feel that it will penetrate  dry&lt;</li>
            <li> No more dry flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> This, combined with probably excessive hand washing, caused my hands to be dry and chapped.  </li>
            <li> This choice was on the basis of previous uses.</li>
            <li> I try using less, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect -- my hands are still greasy.</li>
            <li> I had worse cracking skin on my hands due to frequent washings and using alcoholic hand sanitizing products in the healthcare setting.</li>
            <li> (If you don&#x27;t want a very slightly greasy feeling you might check for other Gold Bond products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and work with my hands so at the end of the day they need a little TLC.  </li>
            <li> This is probably a 3.5 star product for me, but since I can&#x27;t give half stars, I&#x27;ll round up.</li>
            <li> My little guy doesn&#x27;t have to suffer anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen type guy who has been looking at my ageing, dry skin for the past couple of years and wondering what I could do about it without spending a small fortune.  </li>
            <li> the price will come down a little?!</li>
            <li> Works wonders and a few dabs here</li>
            <li> I find the product poor for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to save a few bucks</li>
            <li> Also, it is a heavy greasy creme, and not a lotion at all.</li>
            <li> everything dried my skin, made it break out etc.</li>
            <li> + tubes of Biotene antibacterial toothpaste, which again are not available here.</li>
            <li> And the Excema disappears after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it&#x27;s just not the tube of lotion that is described.</li>
            <li> Then, a little bit of slick goo gets on stuff when I touch things.</li>
            <li> Typically, cold weather makes my hands dry and the skin brittle, especially the knuckles.  </li>
            <li> Even though I live in the south, I get cold hands.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE dab is plenty!</li>
            <li> As a person who cares for horses (and cats and dogs and chickens and finches and a guinea fowl), I must wash my hands often, then go back outside--frequently in cold weather, using rope, or hay, or hammers, or wood, or any other surfaces that share roughness with drying and chapping and,</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after I use the cream, my hands look shiny, and feel slick.</li>
            <li> not many products I have used have the ability to do both of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with my hands cracking and peeling for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I have found in the past.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible scent ever!</li>
            <li> have used this product for my rough cracking hands due to cold weather etc.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use an organic lotion, but I havent found one that is thick, creamy, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick</li>
            <li> cold weather, particularly, my hands fall victim frequently to really painful cracks at the ends of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product that can handle some of the worst skin issues around, but it wears heavily and is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean you don&#x27;t get that feeling which is almost sticky</li>
            <li> I mean to the point where they would crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> hands, feet, everwhere, and the fragrance is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOD</li>
            <li> In cold weather, I get dry and chapped hands and this Gold Bond hand lotion helps my hands a lot without making them greasy.</li>
            <li> I will be recommending this to my mom who, like I do, suffers from winter dry out.</li>
            <li> , I think it is a little expensive, or maybe I use too&lt;br /&gt;much, because it makes your hands and toes(yes, toes, I use them nightly on my toes and  </li>
            <li> The lotion is so thick!    </li>
            <li> I have poor circulation that causes my legs to swell while driving truck.  </li>
            <li> not aggravate my skin allergies (since it doesn&#x27;t contain unnecessary dyes or fragrances</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve read the awful trouble people have looking for relief and treatment, and I can&#x27;t imagine how awful it must really be for those with severe cases when my minor outbreak drove me batty from itching.</li>
            <li> Breaks my skin out when I play it to the sides of my forehead or my cheeks, but it works wonders for getting rid of a weird skin rash</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful -- the dermatologist sample was totally odorless but this smells like a combination of flowers, ass, and rotting lettuce.  </li>
            <li> yet I hate heavy lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive Nordstrom&#x27;s creams and lotions -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really dry cuticles, and they just get horrible because of cooking.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that Amazon Prime does not offer the Gold Bond Hand Cream - yet.</li>
            <li> I used Amazon because I hate to shop</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it is on the way, otherwise I shall be very disappointed with Amazon!</li>
            <li> , I have used this on my feet when they were REAL bad, and it healed the cracks in my skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great, I love it.  It&#x27;s also hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon stocks it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best cream for foot and hand rubs. It is so thick and its moisturizing characteristics last a long time. Most cremes I have used are runny or require reapplication to keep and area moist but not this stuff. I have not tried it on sensitive areas like the face but in my opinion it is the best I have tried for feet and hands. It does not have much of a fragrance which is ok with me. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  My whole family uses it</li>
            <li> The label says this is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;However, after I use the cream, my hands look shiny, and feel slick. Then, a little bit of slick goo gets on stuff when I touch things. I&#x27;d call it greasy, but maybe the shiny slickness is \\&quot;moisturizer,\\&quot; and not due to the petrolatum on the ingredient list. (Yeah, right!)&lt;br /&gt;Slathering it on like hand lotion, then expecting the excess to be absorbed by skin only makes a mess. A LITTLE dab is plenty! Even then, the shiny slickness stays until I wash it off with soap.&lt;br /&gt;But, it sure makes the red itchy place on my arm feel and look better, and I really need that. So, I&#x27;ll give the cream 4 stars instead of just 3.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of similar products such as lotions, cremes and ointments and of all of them, I like this one the best.   It is not greasy or sticky, goes on easily and feels good to the skin. It helps heal my hands for cracking and chapping. Overall it is far better than any other similar product that I have tried. I was quite surprised at how much better it was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the lotion. It&#x27;s the \\&quot;pump-    bottle\\&quot; that i take issue with. The lotion is so thick!    that it won&#x27;t come out of the pump. Also, the stem of the    pump, breaks off, and gets lost inside the container.    I&#x27;ve purchased \\&quot;two\\&quot; bottles. The same thing has happened    both times. I&#x27;m really surprised that a Company like Gold    Bond would use such shoddy packaging. I&#x27;ve just found out    you can purchase the product in a smaller size, without    the pump, and without so much \\&quot;waste.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for something that would work on my son&#x27;s eczema.  We suffer with it every year.  I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil, A&amp;D, and prescription stuff, but nothing really kept it in check until now.  This stuff is AMAZING!  My little guy doesn&#x27;t have to suffer anymore.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh i LOVE this lotion i saw instant results i have realy dry skin i used this one time and my skin was soft as silk!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. I constantly have to wash my hands at work and thus have a problem with dry skin. The gold bond lotion is one of the few lotions that actually helps my skin stay moisturized. I use it for my hands, body and sometimes even my face. It absorbs very quickly and just works great! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the market</li>
            <li> This is my second Gold Bond therapy lotion I have bought. I have severe dry sensitive skin and eczema and this lotion is great! It has a thick creamy texture and it makes my skin soft, smooth, and moisturized. I wish I could use an organic lotion, but I havent found one that is thick, creamy, and moisturizing. I even use this lotion on my face. I prefer it over the COQ10 lotion. Next I will try the Shea therapy lotion.</li>
            <li> One of the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s a nice balance between not to watery that vanishes in minutes to greasy that leaves hands gross. It goes on and softens yet doesn’t feel greasy.  It&#x27;s not fragrant either so good for men and women who don&#x27;t need a smelly lotion.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond makes some excellent products. Among those products are their various lines of lotions/creams, many which are priced in the range of a value moisturizer, but give the performance of products which are generally much more expensive. Their Ultimate lineup (this product) is one of the finest skin moisturizers that I have used. It wears lightly, does not have a greasy residue, provides all-day relief with a single application, and is capable of giving necessary relief to even the driest of skin without irritating sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue I am personally dealing with is dry skin that is very dry (and hence VERY easily irritated). Many lotions and creams I have used simply do not provide ample relief, need reapplication often, and have inflamed my sensitive skin. Through trial-and-error I have found a regiment that works best for me. At night I use a thicker weight cream made by a company called VaniCream. It is an amazing product that can handle some of the worst skin issues around, but it wears heavily and is very expensive. During the day I generally use this Gold Bond Ultimate lotion because it wears well yet provides ample relief...not many products I have used have the ability to do both of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond advertises their &amp;#34;Ultimate Skin Therapy&amp;#34; as a lotion and I am not sure exactly why because Gold Bond Ultimate Lotion is closer in consistency to a lighter-weight cream than it is a lotion. Despite this thicker consistency, it is just about as easy to work into skin as many thinner-weight lotions, but it provides a degree of relief that most thinner lotions I have used fall short of. So this is a product that can moisturize even more severe dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Gold Bond Ultimate delivers the relief that I generally expect of a heavy-weight cream, it wears super well. By that I mean you don&#x27;t get that feeling which is almost sticky in which you know you have a moisturizer on your skin. You also do not get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance. I can put this on in the morning and it keeps my skin moist, non-itchy, and better-looking all day. As it&#x27;s not very practical to reapply a lotion at work, having a product that gives ample relief with a single application is very convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a good unisex moisturizer: the scent is one which is very mild and to me just smells kind of &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; As a male, I prefer not to use a lotion that leaves me smelling like a floral display, and so this minor fresh scent is preferable to me. Another reason I prefer skin moisturizers with minimal scents is because many of the ingredients used to create fragrances are strong skin irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate is a fantastic product. It can provide satisfactory relief in a wide variety of situations, and for skins of all types, including situations in which some serious moisturizing is necessary. This versatile lotion can serve as both a day or night moisturizer, and it provides a degree of relief that I generally associate with moisturizers priced considerably higher...therefore making it a product of excellent value. So based on my own positive experiences, I highly recommend Gold Bond Ultimate.get a greasy residue, and Gold Bond Ultimate does NOT clog pores, making it a good product for usage on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond Ultimate also has something many other lotions lack: endurance.

            <li> I have eczema and this is my go to lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with my hands cracking and peeling for the past two years. I mean to the point where they would crack and bleed. It has got to the point where I don&#x27;t even like to shake people hands. I have been to two Dermatologist and about five different prescriptions that were very pricey and did not work. I was amazed that a cream that I got from the drug store made such a big difference. I don&#x27;t care how much it cost because it is cheaper than a co-pay and paying for medicines that did not work. Gold Bond has a dedicated customer from me!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really loving these new Gold Bond products.  The Gold Bond Healing Body Wash is the first moisturizing body wash that has ever worked for me.  No more dry flakey skin.  And I love their hand and body lotions too!  Non greasy and good moisture.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products but nothing compares to this body lotion. Perfect for dry, itchy skin. Good for winter skin and even safe to use on your face.</li>
            <li> It is the best product for getting your hands, arms, feet and whatever moisturized again and keeps them that way. I love this and have been using it for years. Recently bought a tube for one of my teenaged grandaughters. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of my aunt.  At first I was skeptical because it was Gold Bond and was expecting something medicine smelling.  Smells great and works even better!</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot more money for aftershave balms. Nivea, Every Man Jack.. This stuff works just as well. I pick up the travel size tubes from my local pharmacy for less than $2.00. Works wonders and a few dabs here and there will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing and leaves your face smooth!!! Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product for men.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream on the market.  You could spend 4x the price on other, fancier creams and I promise you they would not work better than this wonderful product.  It disappears into the skin providing instant relief for dry hands.  Package claims gentle enough for face, and yes it is.  Feet, hands, body, face...this stuff cannot be beat.  I have the most sensitive skin on my face imaginable and this is just wonderful for those dry scaly patches that have sprung up heading into menopause.  So happy they offer it in the tube as the bottle with pump left way too much product at bottom of bottle, that was impossible to get out.  Good job Gold Bond!</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick (so you need half of the normal amount of lotion you would need), but it feels feather-light on the skin. I&#x27;m in love, and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have skin so dry and cracked that it bleeds sometimes.  Tried everything... even cetaphil which was recommended by every dermatologist.  Works better than Aquaphor.  Gave it 4/5 stars bc of the price.  I almost bought from amazon but found it at target for $5.95 (5.5 oz)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and work with my hands so at the end of the day they need a little TLC.  Gold Bond does the job, it&#x27;s not real greasy and has no girly odor.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate works very well for dry skin, and this formula does not feel greasy on your skin. My only concern for any and all commercial skin products (and it is a valid one voiced by many health experts and doctors) is that the human body ingests a long list of potential toxins as they are absorbed into your skin and bloodstream.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Just &#x27;Google&#x27; Dr. Mercola and search and read his many excellent articles on skin creams and shampoos. Also read the long list of ingredients on the product, many of which are known toxins. For this reason alone, I try to use skin moisturizers only once in a while, when my skin gets desperately dry (usually during winter months).</li>
            <li> This is my daily go to skin therapy lotion when my skin is dry but otherwise normal.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I use it daily on my whole body, including my face.  I sunbathed for about 65 years and my skin is damaged.  This lotion has helped more than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it. My winter hands were falling apart last winter when I discovered this hand cream for myself. Now I use it on hands and feet</li>
            <li> Breaks my skin out when I play it to the sides of my forehead or my cheeks, but it works wonders for getting rid of a weird skin rash I was getting around my eyebrows and nose.  Not sure what it was, but this mostly keeps it 100% gone.</li>
            <li> Since I am satisfied with the Gold Bond powder, when I saw the pack of 3 Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Lotion, I thought OK!  After only one day, I notice that my hands, arms, and legs feel smoother after using the Gold Bond Skin Lotion.  Again, I really appreciate Amazon offering the option of good products in quantity packs in addition to single packs at great prices.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It goes on easy, sinks in fast, doesn&#x27;t smell awful like so many do, and this package size is perfect to keep in the car or your computer bag.</li>
            <li> have used this product for my rough cracking hands due to cold weather etc. Works fast, and is alot cheaper if you use it regularly to buy it from here.!!</li>
            <li> This lotion works great as hand or foot lotion, and although it is a bit cheaper to buy the pump bottle, those pumps have failed me on a significant number of bottles that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry skin.Brought some of this back home from my last trip to USA.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.could not find it here locally,ordered more from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Because it does work.</li>
            <li> I take water aerobics and often my skin gets irritated by the chlorine in the pool.  I have found that this product is the best in terms of taking away the itchy feeling I get on my legs and arms.  Highly recommend it.  Also good for sunburn I have found in the past.</li>
            <li> Definitely moisturizing. It really does protect your skin for up to 24 hours after applying - great for winter months!</li>
            <li> Judging by the average rating, my opinion is in the minority but here goes:  I was looking for a general purpose moisturizing lotion and tried this mainly because the tube container was convenient to slip into my gym bag.  I find the product poor for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  It&#x27;s too thick - roughly consistency of toothpaste, and (2) it leaves a greasy residue that takes a LONG time to soak into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see by other reviewers&#x27; comments that it evidently is effective for eczema and that may well be so.  But if you just want a general purpose moisturizer lotion, I recommend sticking to Vaseline (or similar) lotions.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by a friend.  I find it is helpful for my dry skin condition, my skin is much softer since using this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice in a couple different ways.   1- It goes on smooth and is almost dry. This is in contrast to other moisturizers that are almost glue like.  2- It makes my skin pliable almost as soon as I put it on. My dry cracked skin itches and hurts less each time I move.   3- The scent is not floral. As a man I appreciate this.     If I didn&#x27;t have to keep reapplying or it actually cured my dryness I would then rate this 5 stars and love it!  This is one of the better hand lotions out there though!</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot so ended up with elephant rough skin on my knuckles. After about 2 weeks of applying this everyday my hands have improved dramatically, a lot cheaper than my next option which was to begin treatments with a dermatologist. It has no perfume so is good for my face also as I have allergies and tend to rub my eyes a lot, this never burns me if I forget and rub.</li>
            <li> Use it every night on my feet. then use utter balm (Corona) every morning. Am diabetic and have no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I always have dry and cracked hands.  When my Mom was in the hospital, teaching me how to&lt;br /&gt;give the IV antibiotics she had to go home with, I mentioned my rough dry cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;The nurse said she used to have them too, suggested I use Working Hands to heal the cracks, then&lt;br /&gt;use the Gold Bond Ultimate.  Now, they are soft as can be! Won&#x27;t be without again!</li>
            <li> gold bond has all of the other healing lotions beat, in my opinion.  It is thick enough to feel that it will penetrate  dry&lt;br /&gt;skin and do some good, and it does!  I only have one complaint, I think it is a little expensive, or maybe I use too&lt;br /&gt;much, because it makes your hands and toes(yes, toes, I use them nightly on my toes and  the cuticles  and  skin&lt;br /&gt;on my toes and heels and feet are as soft and nice as a baby&#x27;s.)  I  think it last longer on my feet than on my hands&lt;br /&gt;because my hands are in water more often . Anyway, you will love this if you haven&#x27;t already discovered it.  Maybe&lt;br /&gt; the price will come down a little?!</li>
            <li> I used to think that Gold Bond was for old folks, but this particular product changed my mind. It is really wonderful for winter beaten skin. This squeeze tube container is is the best way to get the most use out of this lush, thick, dreamy lotion. Works all over your body. Has a nice clean soft smell.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order and I&#x27;ll be reordering it again.  Great to have by my bed, chair, and bathroom.</li>
            <li> Dry seasons here in the Midwest can be brutal and lotion is a must, this one however is not as great as Shaq makes it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find an awesome all natural balm lotion product by the Honest Company and have been amazed how great it is. Fast drying, non greasy, and no strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to save a few bucks here&#x27;s a link for a free sample set and a $10 coupon: http://goo.gl/9XL6ZI</li>
            <li> I have  permeantent skin damage on my lower legs.  I must have 30 different lotions, salves, and creams to protect and hydrate this skin.  The first one that ever completely did the job is this Gold Bold Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion---yet is is not greasy.  It will last a few days at a time without the skin drying out again.  It is a wonderful product.  I now use it all over my body and hands.  I am an old man with lots of outdoor exposure--great stuff for the human body.</li>
            <li> Am happy with the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing Aloe it does what I expected. Once I complete the use of this package of 3 I will purchase some more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing lotion that absorbs quickly. I haven&#x27;t been itchy all winter because of it.  The healing lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer my husband will use as he feels it&#x27;s the only one that isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t have what he feels is a female scent.  It does a wonderful job and I&#x27;ll use it when if my hands are very chapped but I prefer something in a pump bottle.  His hands are seldom chapped since we have tubes of this in several locations in the house. It&#x27;s made a big difference for him and  I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived on time</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen type guy who has been looking at my ageing, dry skin for the past couple of years and wondering what I could do about it without spending a small fortune.  My problem now has been solved and inexpensively.  This stuff nicely lubricates and smoothes out the skin . . . hands, feet, everwhere, and the fragrance is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOD</li>
            <li> This lotion is the absolute best of any other creams/lotions that I have tried. My skins tends to dry out/crack easily, and Gold Bond heals it very quickly. I very highly recommend this lotion to others!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  The smell is very pleasant.  It is a very thick lotion and hydrates nicely.  I originally bought this because of internet reviews on how this reduced the crepe like look on arms.  Not sure if this is actually helping to reduce the crepe-like look, but it is definitely good at hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied, with the product, the price and the seller. I do recommend this product and I am impressed with the results. In cold weather, I get dry and chapped hands and this Gold Bond hand lotion helps my hands a lot without making them greasy.</li>
            <li> I got samples from my dermatologist and they worked great.  I thought I struck gold and that this was the best skin lotion ever.  I&#x27;ve had skin issues since I was a child and this seemed like a godsend.  So I ordered a three pack from Amazon.  Absolutely awful -- the dermatologist sample was totally odorless but this smells like a combination of flowers, ass, and rotting lettuce.  What a waste, a three pack of this stuff is now going straight down the apartment building garbage chute.</li>
            <li> Since finding gold bond I stick with what works and Gold Bond products work. My skin is no longer dry a flakie. It&#x27;s healthy because maintenance is important for younger looking skin. So try what works, try Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d wanted cream, I&#x27;d have ordered cream. It&#x27;s going back for a refund. I was very careful when I ordered this and noted the description says lotion and the image is for lotion.  But I did not receive lotion.  (Yes, I keep screen shots as well.)</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without the greasy residue.  It makes my hands feel very soft.  I love this product.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion, not greasy, easily absorbed and I like the tube rather than a pump bottle.  You can put or take them anywhere.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond has to be blowing the competition off the shelves.  Come to think of it, I don&#x27;t think there is any competition.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and I should know.  I bought the three-pack to use everywhere and keeping one in my car.  This is fabulous hand cream.  I am disappointed that Amazon Prime does not offer the Gold Bond Hand Cream - yet.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nearly a cream consistency.  It is just what it says it is- healing.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being too greasy except when I&#x27;ve put way too much on.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to lotion - essential for living in the dry southwest.  It is not greasy, works really well, and is unscented.  It is magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> this very thick and rick moisturizer really does what it says it will and is therapy for your dry skin!</li>
            <li> My significant other tells me every day how soft my skin is!  I owe it all to gold bond ultimate aloe lotion. I use it every morning after my shower. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t ever feel heavy or sticky. I order it in the 3 pack so I can have one at work, in the kitchen and near the shower.  Applied to my feet before bed it works it&#x27;s magic overnight. I Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite lotion behind JnJ&#x27;s Aveeno.  It&#x27;s a thicker than most lotions I&#x27;ve previously used (or am still trying to use up) - examples:  Vaseline Renewal (almost like water) and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly so you have to make sure to rub it in thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a lilac(?) flowery smell.  The smell is stronger than I&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Simply put it makes your tootsies feel good. Use it every day on my feet to start the day. Feels good and I have it on auto re-fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what to add to that except good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mutliple types (oil/dry) .. This lotion is very unique in that it is not greasy at all. Yet it moisturizes very well. I can even use this on my face and not get acne after three days.. (like many popular brands).. Since it is expensive, I will mix it with some Lubriderm before putting on my legs. The combo of the two work well to extend the life of the goldbond..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am testing this in a dry climate in the southwest...</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands mostly.  Very soothing and nice cream.  Not greasy or sticky, just very comfortable.  Yay.</li>
            <li> The best lotion on the market well worth the price. Took only one use for me to realize this was the answer to stopping itchy, dry skin. Will be the only brand of lotion I use from here on.</li>
            <li> This is the first commercially available skin cream that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these squeeze bottles, because you can get almost all of it out.  With the large pump containers, you lose a large portion of the cream that sticks to the inside of the containers.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is great.  I like it because it is thicker going on and really helps dry skin.  It particularly helps my hands&#x27; dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Handling paper a lot of the day, my hands become dry - not to mention my natural tendency toward dry skin.  A friend of mine recommended this item, so I tried it.  I&#x27;m on my second order.  I even gave a tube to a male co-worker.  That should tell you that the smell is unoffensive and that the product works.  No burning, no wearing off in five minutes.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works as it claims. The lotion stays on even after washing my hands several times. You can also feel the lotion on your skin after the night so it really works through day and night. My hands and legs were pretty dry (from winter weather) where layers of skin were showing and it took about a week to heal back to its normal state (applied once to twice per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion also spreads nicely given it is a slighlty &amp;#34;thick/heavy&amp;#34; lotion. Lastly, it has a nice, fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li> The lotion cleared several facial marks.  I am well satisfied.  The container made things much easier to apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> Good quality as always..........</li>
            <li> I Love Gold Bond products, helps with My dry skin due to Diabetic problems.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I got a LOT of bottles of this hand lotion for the money! I only use this lotion because it&#x27;s the only one that works for me and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is one heck of a cream for dry skin, whether you are using it for hands or feet or any body part for that matter. I had worse cracking skin on my hands due to frequent washings and using alcoholic hand sanitizing products in the healthcare setting. In fact, the skin on my hands was peeling off one December. Gold Bond skin therapy lotion(it&#x27;s really a cream) came to the rescue and within 2 days my hands looked and felt like new. Not very greasy either. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For me, this is the best! Use all the time.  Keeps hands, feet and elbows soft and wonderful</li>
            <li> I have dry skin yet I hate heavy lotions. A little goes a long way and once on it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I do not understand Amazon&#x27;s need to title reviews but I play by their rules.  Even though I live in the south, I get cold hands.  When I lived and worked in an office in NJ, I wore gloves at work.  This, combined with probably excessive hand washing, caused my hands to be dry and chapped.  I borrowed a tube of Gold Bond from my wife and I liked the results.  So I ordered a set from Amazon.  The only complaint that I have about the product is that is does leave a residue where it is not needed.  I use a tissue to wipe my hands afterwards.  The other complaint is not with the product but with the way Amazon sells it in a package of three which will probably last me four years.  The product itself is fine; if you can buy a single tube easily at about the same price in a retail store, there shouldn&#x27;t be a need to buy it from Amazon. I used Amazon because I hate to shop and I have no patience. The only store I looked for it in didn&#x27;t have it; as happens often, I went to Amazon, and with Prime, received my order in two days.</li>
            <li> This is the best rehydrater  I&#x27;ve used to soften and moisturize hands, knees and other spots that dry out,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who does a fair amount outside, and a fair amount with his hands.  As a person who cares for horses (and cats and dogs and chickens and finches and a guinea fowl), I must wash my hands often, then go back outside--frequently in cold weather, using rope, or hay, or hammers, or wood, or any other surfaces that share roughness with drying and chapping and, well, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In cold weather, particularly, my hands fall victim frequently to really painful cracks at the ends of my fingers.  Should I have to handle a semi delicate fabric--say, doing laundry, or hugging my wife or children--and my hands frequently act like a really grabby sandpaper.  And my children and wife are constantly asking me to do something about my super dry and crack-y (and painful) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got this.  It&#x27;s not perfume-y, not greasy, and goes on easily and socks in very quickly.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how it makes me feel, too: I don&#x27;t have to wait long before I can use my hands again, and I don&#x27;t go around leaving a residue on anything I touch afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really does a very nice job on my hands...I have had a lot smoother skin--I feel it myself, and my wife and kids tell me all the time.  I&#x27;m very pleased with Gold Bond--I&#x27;ve loved their powder for years.  It really is the &amp;#34;Ultimate&amp;#34; skin healing lotion.</li>
            <li> The product is non-oil based, which is the best thing to use. It&#x27;s non-irritating and just a little bit goes a long way. So, one bottle should last a while. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have poor circulation that causes my legs to swell while driving truck.  When I put my comp0ression socks on in the morning this stuff really works well to keep my skin from getting dry and sore in spots.  I&#x27;ve used other lotions, but there&#x27;s something in this that really seems to heal skin as advertized.  I also use it on Saddle Sores from sitting too long driving down the road.  Seems to do pretty good there too</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried dozens of types of hand lotion... as a group of nurses who wash their hands often this has proven by far the be the best solution to our cracked, dried hands.  Thanks Gold Bond for yet another great product</li>
            <li> This lotion/cream does not leave a greasy feel and does an excellent job of moisturizing my hands.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is icy up here and I need something to keep my skin supple. I bought a small one in my local drugstore on a whim when I was checking out and put some on when I got home. I love this moisturizing cream. It&#x27;s not greasy and I instantly noticed a difference in my skin. I will be recommending this to my mom who, like I do, suffers from winter dry out. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial lubricant, I like it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take the best care of my skin, so my legs look like crocodile skin.  Been putting this on 2-3 times a week and have seen a great improvement.  Well worth the cost</li>
            <li> Great product but leaves a greasy film seems like it doesn&#x27;t run all the way I to the skin</li>
            <li> I had my first eczema breakout this winter at age 37. What started out as a tiny patch of hives from a minor food allergy, quickly took over almost my entire shin. I tried several remedies suggested online with no success. After reading the reviews here, I decided to try it. Afterall I was already more than pleased with every other Gold Bond product I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three days, and immediately the itching subsided and now the rash is starting to lighten up in color, bumps are going away and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;drying up.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve read the awful trouble people have looking for relief and treatment, and I can&#x27;t imagine how awful it must really be for those with severe cases when my minor outbreak drove me batty from itching. That said, I&#x27;m sure all the money I&#x27;ve spent searching for relief pales in comparison to just about everyone, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try, it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say it&#x27;s working very quickly on the older bumps in the rash, the newer ones are feeling much better but aren&#x27;t drying up as quickly. I have a quarter-size patch of hives by my elbow and it hasn&#x27;t done much for that except soothe the itch. But they haven&#x27;t turned into eczema yet, so as long as it keeps that from happening and spreading, I&#x27;m still a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Use it on my head after shaving it every day. Love the texture. After trying this one out, all other lotions ive tried seem &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down. This one has a texture a bit thicker than others which goes on well and stays on longer it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mainly as a post shave lotion when shaving with an electric razor and it is great. Although I bought this at my grocery store and it was a bit pricier than the other ones on the shelf, next time I am going for the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Finally some relief!  I use this before and after my 12 hour shift in IMCU.  After washing my hands countless times, using hand sanitizer countless more, my hands don&#x27;t crack and peel like they used to.  I&#x27;ve also noticed it helps keep my nails looking healthier and my cuticles have shown a world of difference.  Definitely recommend for anyone in the healthcare field, and since it&#x27;s not highly scented, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it bothering patients like some lotions do.</li>
            <li> works wonderful for someone who washes their hands many many many times a day...i also use it before bed to help heal cracks</li>
            <li> GOLD BOND ULTIMATE HEALING LOTION is without a doubt the best thing on the market for dry skin and eczema.  I&#x27;ve been plagued with hand eczema for several years now and I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything, including pricy Cetaphil, and nothing works like GOLD BOND ULTIMATE does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is thick and smooth, but not the least bit greasy.  It absorbs quickly into the skin, and a little goes a very long way.  It won&#x27;t cure eczema (but then nothing will), but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually makes a visible difference in how my hands look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here on Amazon is very good - you can pay $8-9 a tube for this in your local drug store.  I like the tubes much better than the pump bottle, and they are generally less expensive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  Nothing but raves here!</li>
            <li> This choice was on the basis of previous uses. We had been purchasing it from Wholesale wearhouses; but, found they were no longer carrying it. So, we turned to the net and found comparable, good buys.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and compare to other skin products. I have very dry skin, and this product really didn&#x27;t help much. Also, it is a heavy greasy creme, and not a lotion at all.</li>
            <li> One of the very best lotions for very dry hands (and feet).</li>
            <li> This is the best skin moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Purchased it on a whim and have been very satisfied. It really has healed my red, extremely dry, cracking skin. I highly recommened this product!!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of this lotion. It&#x27;s not oily. Seems to go on and get absorbed right away.  It does an great job of healing.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using a little 1 oz. tube of the Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Cream that I bought while I was traveling and fell in love with. When I found this item on Amazon, even though it said it was a lotion, it sounded so similar, and at a good price, that I decided to order it. What a welcome surprise to open the box and find that I received the Skin Therapy Cream, which I already know to be a fabulous product. My hands get dry and cracked from frequent washing and working outside. I make sure to put this cream on before I go to bed and my hands are soft and healed in the morning. Great product. Glad to see Amazon offering the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Typically, cold weather makes my hands dry and the skin brittle, especially the knuckles.  I&#x27;ve had winters where just flexing my hands will cause bleeding cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a bit of this a 2-3 times a day, and there were only a few patches that were dry or red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say you should be careful of the amount; it doesn&#x27;t take much to adequately cover an entire hand, maybe a blob 2-3mm thick.  If you use too much, your hands are oily.  What I do is put just a bit on then rub it in, move to a new spot and repeat.</li>
            <li> I have Gold Bond skin cream tucked in various places around the house for easy access - the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and even the livingroom by my husband and my favorite recliners. It&#x27;s a great, thick, smooth cream that really works well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this size to carry in a bag or suitcase. It is a great travel size. And the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate skin therapy lotion is a very good product.  My husbands irritated skin has healed after trying numerous other products Gold Bond worked the best</li>
            <li> I keep ordering over and over-for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face every night after wearing Cotz sunscreen during the day. Finally found an inexpensive solution to rolling back the years on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive Nordstrom&#x27;s creams and lotions - everything dried my skin, made it break out etc. Sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you pay for.  I finally decided to try a warm wash cloth at night to wipe my face followed my a light coating of Gold Bond.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it absorbs quickly with the moist skin and my face is looking better and better.  So much for several hundred dollars at the cosmetics counter!  All I need is to read the reviews on Amazon....</li>
            <li> Best Lotion I have found..love this product..would recommend it to anyone...received it earlier than expected..extremely happy with the supplier..would purchase from them again..</li>
            <li> This is the strongest perfume smell I have ever encountered!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE ANY SENSITIVITY TO PERFUME!  It is hard for me to believe that a product could put this much allergy causing perfume in one tube.  This is the most horrible scent ever!</li>
            <li> I like the Gold Bond Medicated Body Lotion Extra Strength 8 oz. a lot and so I thought I would try this lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Does not aggravate my skin allergies (since it doesn&#x27;t contain unnecessary dyes or fragrances -- this also means it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which may be appreciated by some folks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Does help protect dry hands (softens the skin, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Convenient packaging, with one caveat. The screw-on cap of mine has come off and will not reattach. I am going to remain neutral on the packaging because my tube is quite old and plastics do wear/break down over time. However, this might be a concern if you were thinking of keeping a tube of this in a purse or backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Leaves my hands feeling really greasy. I try using less, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect -- my hands are still greasy. I have a tube of this lotion at work and my keyboard even has a residue on it from typing after using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If your hands are so dry that they&#x27;re cracked and bleeding (this happens to me in the winter), the lotion might cause a little bit of stinging. (I have super-sensitive skin, though. And this is only a problem when my hands are cracked and bleeding.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Washes off fairly easily (which means frequent re-application, which is why I&#x27;ve listed this under &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about such things, this lotion contains hydrolyzed collagen, which is derived from animal proteins. (This doesn&#x27;t impact my rating one way or another, I just wanted people to know in case it was a concern. In fact, it is very hard to avoid such ingredients in personal care products these days.) This is probably a 3.5 star product for me, but since I can&#x27;t give half stars, I&#x27;ll round up.</li>
            <li> This is the very best hand lotion I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and does an incredible job of  hydrating.  I have used it on my face for wrinkle repair, too.</li>
            <li> Better price than walmart or walgreens, this is the best for normal to dry skin. It does not leave greasy. I do not like lotions with fragrance because I get headaches, this has a hint of a smell, nice and clean. This is more a cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li> Love these!! I gave them as stocking stuffers, &amp; everyone enjoyed receiving them!</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate saves me from the frantic itching and cracked skin of winter.  I use it daily.  It instantly softens my skin.</li>
            <li> I have actual lumps along my arms from my hand to my elbow that are the result of prednisone that I took years ago. I have tried every product in the market to reduce these lumps and leave a clear skin, and Gold Bond actually does this! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> On time good purchase</li>
            <li> Gold Bond with aloe is the only lotion that truly heals my dry hands. I&#x27;m glad Amazon is able to offer Gold Bond at a lower price than in any supermarket or department store. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Cooking is a passion of mine, and I make huge messes in the kitchen when I&#x27;m trying out new ideas (ie: a lot!).  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to wear rubber gloves, and so my poor old dry hands spend a lot of time in soapy water and with sponges and cleaning solutions. I&#x27;ve always had really dry cuticles, and they just get horrible because of cooking.  This is the first and only hand cream which has actually made a significant difference, and I use it regularly (I keep a tube in my bedside table and one in the kitchen and really do rub the cream on 2-3 times daily).  My nails have even stopped splitting and breaking so much!  I&#x27;ve been using Gold Bond Ultimate for about 2 years now, and outside of an occasional  almond oil massage of my cuticles I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I highly recommend this cream for problem hands!</li>
            <li> It definitely eliminates dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.  I use it several times a day and I can really tell a difference in the way my hands feel vs other creams I have tried.  I would definitely recommend this above any other.  It is also great to use after shaving your legs.</li>
            <li> My elderly dry skin was cracking and spliting until I started using this creme.  Now it is better.  Not soft like a younger person but at least it doesn&#x27;t split any more.  I highly recommend this creme.</li>
            <li> Excellent/ My wife loves it. And I love her.</li>
            <li> I buy this Gold Bond lotion for my wife, but I use it as well.  This really brings moisturizing therapy to your skin.  We especially like the soothing aloe for sun-damaged skin.  We can certainly recommenmd this healing lotion, ESPECIALLY AT THIS BARGAIN PRICE FOR THE PACKAGE OF THREE!.  [[ASIN:B001G7PLBY Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing, Aloe, 5.5 oz , (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> Gold Bond makes an excellent product. If you have dry skin and need soothing and smooth effects this what you need.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin all year round. I absolutely love this product. It keeps me hydrated and it has a very, very light fragrance. I have allergies so can&#x27;t use most lotions or creams. This does have one but it is so mild you are not likely to notice it. I buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> Great product not greasy good skin therapy skin lotion. Would definitely give 5 stars to this product. Works great with no residue or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Very thick lotion, exactly what I was looking for.  This gives a lot of nutrition for people looking to use fewer layers on dry or damaged skin.  I used to use multiple layers of normal lotion and wait for it to dry.  With this one layer is enough.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of hand lotions and this one ranks up towards the top.  The smell is light and the lotion is nice.  It does wash off the first time you wash your hands which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.  I was my hands a ton and don&#x27;t always have time to reapply lotion after every wash.</li>
            <li> A great product---makes skin feel supple. I would not call it nongreasy as advertised. It seems to permeate the skin and also leave a layer on top. I find this very pleasant for my ultra-dry skin. I use it as a body lotion and also on my face under makeup. (If you don&#x27;t want a very slightly greasy feeling you might check for other Gold Bond products. I know they make on with CoQ10.) I also like Gold Bond powder which is not talcum but corn starch based. I bought the standup tube which, I think, is better than a pump bottle but it still doesn&#x27;t disperse lotion when you get near the bottom. When it is almost empty, I cut off the middle section of the tube, but the top back on the bottom, and use my finger to reach into the tube. Bit of a nuisance but meanwhile the standup tube is easier to store.</li>
            <li> This lotion is probably the best I&#x27;ve had. It has truly healed my problem elbows after just two wears. The packaging is so convenient too with the dispenser at the bottom. I love it and I will not go back to another brand.</li>
            <li> Great hand and body cream!  Really works. I think the cream is much better than the lotion . Even lasts through hand washing!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few dry skin products that actually give relief and not just another promise.  I have tried several of the Gold Bond products and find that they are all outstanding!</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending the cream so fast.  I love this stuff and I will come back when I run out!</li>
            <li> As a guy we don&#x27;t use moisturizers at all. After a dermatologist visit that has changed. She recommended this brand and it works perfectly. It is not oily, &#x27;dries&#x27; fast, and is long lasting. I use it every day now.</li>
            <li> I ordered Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing, Aloe in July, 2012, from Amazon, as I cannot get it here in Australia.I first found out about this product when I was on holiday in LA, California 3 years ago and found it a very effective skin cream for my arms that gets itchy blisters in the sun, especially in summer. It is a brilliant product, as it is not oily on the skin and stays quite a long time, even when you wash it off lightly. My skin does not blister anymore, but I still like using it as a silky moisturizer. This + 2 books I ordered came promptly after 10 days of ordering them. So, on Aug 22, I  ordered another 2 packs to stock, as summer is just around the corner here in Australia, + tubes of Biotene antibacterial toothpaste, which again are not available here. Again, the Gold Bond lotion arrived after 10days of ordering, when I was advised in the order that they will be sent in one shipping, but to date, 8th September, I still have not received the Biotene toothpaste! Hopefully, it is on the way, otherwise I shall be very disappointed with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pet groomer and this lotion applied a few times during the day and at night is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that can keep my hand stay healthy!! I also use it on my feet and it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I love Gold Bond - it is just the best skin lotion.</li>
            <li> I have it on my &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;. I use it all over (except for my face) and especially on my hands and feet. Keeps me smooth and comfortable. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I like the mild scent of this product. it is a bit thick but easily absorbs into the skin. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> My husband had tried everything for the splitting skin on his hands.  This works!  We use it for our feet and elbows.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin due to surgery and medicines. Gold Bond Ultimate has 7 moisturizers which help maintain the skin barrier to infections. Also relieves the itching due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, good value</li>
            <li> I use this on my cracked heels.  It about the best I&#x27;ve found for that type of thing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> GREAT Skin care, I have used this on my feet when they were REAL bad, and it healed the cracks in my skin</li>
            <li> Love this product!  This has been a God-send!  I have very dry skin and very arthritic hands.  I also have developed Excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product a few weeks, but noticed my skin was so soft the first couple of times I used the Gold Bond!  And the Excema disappears after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> Living in the Arizona desert for most of our life, we end up with extra-dry skin, especially the elbows and heels.  Amazingly, with continued use, this stuff actually does soften the roughest patches and then keeps them from returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s terrific as a hand lotion after doing dishes, as well, but it is truly NOT a lotion, as self-proclaimed.  It is more of a cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue.  Wonderful texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both believe in the healing attributes of aloe and use it regularly.  We recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this on my hands each day and it has made a positive difference. I keep my hands in a lot of water and this lotion helps to keep my hands soft.</li>
            <li> The product pictured is NOT the product I received.  I like what came, but it&#x27;s in a green pump bottle and has a medicinal smell at first.  I use it everyday, it&#x27;s just not the tube of lotion that is described.</li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s adverstiment -  this product does truly work!  I am a avid supporter of all of Gold Bond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this cream and really like it.  I recommend it to people who have minor scraps and burns.</li>
