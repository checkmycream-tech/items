            <li>I smelled this in Sephora and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>In regards to this fragrance, it is best to go to a department store and try it on because there seems to be some questions as to its authenticity and or quality of this cologne in particular.</li>
            <li>We had seen it in department stores for so much more and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>their products that i&#x27;ve purchased have been great too, and this is the first time that i have ever been displeased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is appropriate for the office, but is also sexy and suitable for dates/casual wear.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the product itself was in good condition and the receiver was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>In truth this is one of my favorite fragrances for men.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cologne that can be worn anytime but is better suited for the daytime.</li>
            <li>This is just incredible value for such a nice products.</li>
            <li>If you like Bvlgari, you will love the price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Bulgari, but this isn&#x27;t Bulgari.  </li>

            <li>I have always enjoyed Bulgari for men and this product lives up to Bulgari&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li>I can not compare it to the original b/c I don&#x27;t remember, but it seems okay.  </li>
            <li>It was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t not have any of the strong and frankly overpowering musk of most colognes nor is it too sweet and girly that it leaves people \\&quot;wondering\\&quot;......  </li>
            <li>Smells so very clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>item arrived very quickly and was in the original package, shrink wrapped in plastic and all.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best everyday cologne&#x27;s for men.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smells unique.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>

            <li>Very elegant smell my new fragrance for my collection Bvlgari</li>
            <li>We are never disappointed with Bvlgari.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a men sent, but its clean and spicy in a feminine way.</li>
            <li>Am certain I&#x27;ll buy more when gone.</li>
            <li>It has a nice musky, earthy masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>I bought this full size one after having tried the sample.</li>
            <li>Many people have given me compliments on Bulgari pour Homme, and it is a personal favorite of mine.    </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour at most.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li>Mailed quickly.</li>
            <li>it and Enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>The product arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect in-store condition.</li>
            <li>it smells a lot better when sprayed directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>a classic, respectful scent,&lt;br /&gt;- suitable for both professional and personal settings,&lt;br /&gt;- stays for a whole day on most skin types,&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for your loyal service throughout the years</li>
            <li>I like the sccent since this is mild and not irritating to the nose.</li>
            <li>Of course it didn´t smell like the first time I try on, but the smell was there.</li>
            <li>but they were not posted which raises the question of authenticity regarding these reviews in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Wife told me i wasn&#x27;t allowed to wear it around any hot women unless she&#x27;s with me.    </li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for years and it is my first time to purchase it online.</li>
            <li>Ordered as a gift and arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>This cologne is mild and nice and don&#x27;t trouble my sinus</li>
            <li>smells really good not overpowering and not strong.</li>
            <li>They are clean, nice and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The scent is attractive, but it is so weak as to defeat the purpose of buying cologne in the first place.  </li>
            <li>but what I really like about this one is that it lasts forever..</li>
            <li>Bulgari pour Homme is a very versatile scent.  </li>
            <li>I consider it a masterpiece amongst modern mens&#x27; colognes.      </li>
            <li>This has a really disconcerting note in it.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not the real Bvlgari Product.</li>
            <li>I managed to find it on Amazon for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are variations of the scent (extreme, etc.); most are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>using this several times, i would like to say that i think it is the original bvlgari for men.</li>
            <li>I originally meant to buy Bvlgari Blue for Men, and mistakenly purchased this cologne.</li>
            <li>it may just be slightly old, which would explainthe initial strong smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have another bottle that I recently got from a department store for comparison that smells different and much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for my friends and family I give this a five star.</li>
            <li>To say that this is subtle is kind.  </li>
            <li>It was the original product and not a copy as stated by some other reviews.</li>
            <li>it smells better when sprayed on skin, yet that sharp acidic overtone stays with you for a long time.</li>
            <li>my GUESS, is that it is old.</li>
            <li>I went to the bvlgari store and let them smell the item they laughed at me and said sorry</li>
            <li>I have purchased this exact same size for double the price at retail outlets.</li>
            <li>This is classic and only cologne I wear.  </li>
            <li>This is similar to the real thing, but it has an odd undertone that is very off putting to me.</li>
            <li>bold yet tame...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the one he usually gets (because I got confused) but he loved it just the same.</li>

            <li> Shorter then the time expected.</li>
            <li> i smelled bulgari pour homme on s friend a few years back</li>
            <li> The product came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Pour Homme is just plain gross.</li>
            <li> i have ordered other colognes from amazon (carolina herrera for men and jil sander for men)</li>
            <li> it takes about an hour for that sharp smell to fade.</li>
            <li> also, other colognes do not leave a sticky film on your skin like this one does.</li>
            <li> At least the Amazon&#x27;s one is totally different from what I brought from shops.</li>
            <li> it smelled very, sharp and acidic.</li>
            <li> other colognes, once dried off, do not leave that stickiness.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a fake, or maybe it&#x27;s old and has gone sour.</li>
            <li> But the note is  little soapy but over-all</li>
            <li> I received my cologne in just a few days.</li>
            <li> just received this in the mail a few days ago.</li>
            <li> My husband got this as a gift a few years ago and since then he has stuck to it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, but not surprising considering the cost is a third of the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on, and Amazon has neglected my efforts to resolve this.  </li>
            <li> The bottle of Bvlgari I received is not authentic.  </li>
            <li> We have used this for at least the past two decades, and it never seizes to amaze:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I placed negative reviews on fragrancenet.com</li>
            <li> but i want you guys to know that at least some of these bottles are not quite up to par.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that the reviews I read were just there bottles, and I was in for a rude awakening.</li>
            <li> I mean,  I try on one of my shirts and it lasted almost a week.</li>
            <li> It is manly and subtle.  </li>
            <li> It smells so strange and sick.</li>
            <li> One thing I am not happy about it</li>
            <li> Very weak.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is not BVL but may be from some fake producers.</li>
            <li> this one does, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I did not check the reviews and felt silly for ordering it after I did but could not cancel it.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;m drinking a cold, savory beverage like V8.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in really bad shape.</li>
            <li> This SMELLS REALLY BAD</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very classy , I have been using this for the past 3 years and I plan on buying it again for as long as they offer it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is mild and nice and don&#x27;t trouble my sinus and I would order it again and I have let my friends smell and like it too.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say about this product but superb smell. Highly recommended for my friends and family I give this a five star.</li>
            <li> Got spritzed by a girl at Harrod&#x27;s with this stuff, grew to like it and now its my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; since no one else I know wears this stuff.</li>
            <li> In truth this is one of my favorite fragrances for men.  It doesn&#x27;t not have any of the strong and frankly overpowering musk of most colognes nor is it too sweet and girly that it leaves people \\&quot;wondering\\&quot;......  Only gripe is that the fragrance does not last.  After only a few hours the only way to get any remnant of the fragrance is to sniff hard at where you sprayed, but if you use on a regular basis, builds a nice, subtle after-smell, if that is a word...</li>
            <li> It is good, the smell its good, I have try better one´s but what I really like about this one is that it lasts forever.. I mean,  I try on one of my shirts and it lasted almost a week. Of course it didn´t smell like the first time I try on, but the smell was there. I think I made my point...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and it smelled amazing on him.  It wasn&#x27;t the one he usually gets (because I got confused) but he loved it just the same.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best everyday cologne&#x27;s for men.  and the best price is on amazon.com espcially with free shipping!  i&#x27;ve bought this one over 6 times now from amazon and will continue to do so.  at retail, this goes for 70 or 80 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> I received my cologne in just a few days. Shorter then the time expected. It was well wrapped &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> Bulgari pour Homme is a very versatile scent.  It is manly and subtle.  It is a bit spicy with a cooling hint of tea leaves.  I consider it a masterpiece amongst modern mens&#x27; colognes.      This is my go-to-scent when I am unsure of what to wear.  It is appropriate for the office, but is also sexy and suitable for dates/casual wear.  Many people have given me compliments on Bulgari pour Homme, and it is a personal favorite of mine.    The price here for this product is a great deal.  The product arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect in-store condition.</li>
            <li> This has a really disconcerting note in it. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m drinking a cold, savory beverage like V8. Despite it being nourishing your senses are telling you \\&quot;something&#x27;s not right\\&quot;. The odor reminds of boiled vegetables. It smells so similar to the \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; version that the difference is negligible. Like BLV and BLV Notte. There was no point in making both of them.    Pour Homme is just plain gross.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in really bad shape. The inner box was crumpled as well. Luckily the product itself was in good condition and the receiver was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after amazon &amp;#34;transferred&amp;#34; me to another website, that being fragrancenet.com.  To say that this is subtle is kind.  This &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour at most.  The scent is attractive, but it is so weak as to defeat the purpose of buying cologne in the first place.  I placed negative reviews on fragrancenet.com but they were not posted which raises the question of authenticity regarding these reviews in the first place.  In regards to this fragrance, it is best to go to a department store and try it on because there seems to be some questions as to its authenticity and or quality of this cologne in particular.</li>
            <li> Hola, la colonia es de un olor bastante fuerte, rico olor pero a mi no me sirvió por el olor tan fuerte para los que problemas con los olores fuertes.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim after reading review.  Never tried or smelled it prior.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Wife told me i wasn&#x27;t allowed to wear it around any hot women unless she&#x27;s with me.    If you like scents along the lines of Aqua di Gio, you&#x27;ll appreciate this.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and intact. Bvlgari is a light citrus fragrance that is absolutely wonderful. It&#x27;s a cologne that can be worn anytime but is better suited for the daytime. I only wish the scent lasted a bit longer while wearing.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and it is my first time to purchase it online. At least the Amazon&#x27;s one is totally different from what I brought from shops. It smells so strange and sick. I believe it is not BVL but may be from some fake producers. I want to return this product!!!</li>
            <li> We have used this for at least the past two decades, and it never seizes to amaze:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a classic, respectful scent,&lt;br /&gt;- suitable for both professional and personal settings,&lt;br /&gt;- stays for a whole day on most skin types,&lt;br /&gt;- stays on clothing very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are variations of the scent (extreme, etc.); most are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Bvlgari scents such as Blv, Black, etc. do not compare to this; they are completely different.</li>
            <li> This is just incredible value for such a nice products. Departments stores sell it for $88 and up!!!!</li>
            <li> COOOOL&lt;br /&gt;AS YOU KNOW&lt;br /&gt;BLVGARI&lt;br /&gt;IS THE BEST PERFUME and SMELL&lt;br /&gt;GIRLS LIKE IT&lt;br /&gt;Have it and Enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> If you like Bvlgari, you will love the price. I have purchased this exact same size for double the price at retail outlets. Never again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product &amp; I have been using for years. Every guy should try this product its great&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Bulgari, but this isn&#x27;t Bulgari.  What I received from Amazon just smells like alcohol.  When we checked with Bulgari, we were told that Amazon is not an authorized reseller of their products.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on, and Amazon has neglected my efforts to resolve this.  Bulgari is still great, but don&#x27;t expect to find that great sexy scent here.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. One of my favorites. Get a lot of compliments on it as well so that should say something.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it was priced very competitively .  Would order from this company again.  It was the original product and not a copy as stated by some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for several years.  It has a nice musky, earthy masculine scent.  Though it may be worn during the day, I prefer wearing this cologne at night and during winter.  Will get this one again definitely once I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is classic and only cologne I wear.  It was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Quite to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love! The great price is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought multiple bottles to give as gifts for men in my family. That way when I am around them, they smell so good. My husbands favorite too.</li>
            <li> excellent product excellent service</li>
            <li> Very weak.  Smell was gone within an hour and I am to say I feel ripped off as if I purchased an imposter</li>
            <li> just received this in the mail a few days ago. item arrived very quickly and was in the original package, shrink wrapped in plastic and all. there is not problems with the purchase and shipping services. although...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me preface by saying that i am by no means an expert on cologne. i smelled bulgari pour homme on s friend a few years back and it immediately grabbed my attention. i have ordered other colognes from amazon (carolina herrera for men and jil sander for men) and i was well pleased with both of those. but i have to say that there was something off about this bulgari. i&#x27;m not trying to \\&quot;diss\\&quot; on amazon or anything, cause i have enjoyed their service throughout the years. their products that i&#x27;ve purchased have been great too, and this is the first time that i have ever been displeased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as soon as i sprayed this bulgari it smelled very, sharp and acidic. indeed, almost like bug spray would. it smells better when sprayed on skin, yet that sharp acidic overtone stays with you for a long time. it takes about an hour for that sharp smell to fade. the undertone smells like bulgari, like the same smell i smelled when my friend used to wear it. but the overtone smells OFF. also, other colognes do not leave a sticky film on your skin like this one does. other colognes, once dried off, do not leave that stickiness. this one does, unfortunately. my GUESS, is that it is old. again, i&#x27;m no cologne expert. since it was a fraction of the cost of the bulgari&#x27;s in the mall, i am not too upset. that being said, i love you amazon. but i want you guys to know that at least some of these bottles are not quite up to par. thanks for your loyal service throughout the years though!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love,&lt;br /&gt;izzy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated march 11, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after using this several times, i would like to say that i think it is the original bvlgari for men. it smells a lot better when sprayed directly on the skin. it may just be slightly old, which would explainthe initial strong smell of alcohol. but that smell fades after about 15-20 mins, and after that it does indeed smell like bvlgari. so considering that it is a lot cheaper than buying at the mall, i would give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Bvlgari Product. I bought this product hoping that the reviews I read were just there bottles, and I was in for a rude awakening. This SMELLS REALLY BAD TO THE POINT BUGS DIE OFF ONE SNIFF. I went to the bvlgari store and let them smell the item they laughed at me and said sorry but you were scammed. I will never purchase any fragrance on line again (TO RISKY AND YOU CANT RETURN IT).</li>
            <li> This appears to be a fake, or maybe it&#x27;s old and has gone sour. I have another bottle that I recently got from a department store for comparison that smells different and much better. This is similar to the real thing, but it has an odd undertone that is very off putting to me. Very disappointing, but not surprising considering the cost is a third of the real thing.</li>
            <li> What a great scent this has!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  It&#x27;s light and smells unique.&lt;br /&gt;Its bold yet tame...its perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Time to get some more.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift and arrived so fast! recommend every men to give it a try as all women I know adore it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems diluted now.</li>
            <li> Great. The product came on time and as expected. I am very happy. I bought this full size one after having tried the sample. I love this scent. And when you buy it on-line it&#x27;s even more affordable. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Ordered this cologne again because it is all my son wears.  Great price, excellent fast service and a happy guy!</li>
            <li> great product, cant wait to order more.</li>
            <li> I like the sccent since this is mild and not irritating to the nose. But the note is  little soapy but over-all the product is great. One thing I am not happy about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stay longer.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I loved this scent.  We are never disappointed with Bvlgari.  They are clean, nice and long lasting.  Great gift always!</li>
            <li> I originally meant to buy Bvlgari Blue for Men, and mistakenly purchased this cologne. This was a very happy mistake. This was a gift for someone, and both he and I LOVE this scent!!!  Well worth the error :D</li>
            <li> Sample first,its not for everyone..</li>
            <li> smells really good not overpowering and not strong. Very elegant smell my new fragrance for my collection Bvlgari you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> An excellent perfume. Recommended to all. Great setting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Success olfactory, for sure. Traditional that does success.&lt;br /&gt;Sucessfull</li>
            <li> I smelled this in Sephora and I really liked it.  I just wanted to see if I could find it at a lower cost.  So I ordered this.  I did not check the reviews and felt silly for ordering it after I did but could not cancel it.  So it arrived, I smelled it, seems good!  Everything smells good on hubby so I am sure this will.  I can not compare it to the original b/c I don&#x27;t remember, but it seems okay.  We will see how it is/how he likes it after he gets his gift this Saturday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my best for daily use is excellent for the day which is such describre. no use sending complaints is within the set limits.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Wore this for last 10 years and I still love it to this day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s legitimate Bvlgari. The guy who introduce me to it confirmed. He works at the retailer. I think it smells great. I will be getting another. My wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> My husband got this as a gift a few years ago and since then he has stuck to it. When something works....!&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this fragrance. Light and just wonderful. Smells so very clean and fresh! I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend for Father&#x27;s Day. We had seen it in department stores for so much more and he really liked it. I managed to find it on Amazon for much cheaper. He&#x27;s very happy with it and the size was great. The bottle was much bigger than I had figured it would be which it always a bonus.</li>
            <li> Mailed quickly. Got what I ordered. I adore this scent. It&#x27;s a men sent, but its clean and spicy in a feminine way. I&#x27;ve worn it for years and always get compliments. Not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s all I was told it would be and I&#x27;ve, since, bought more.  Am certain I&#x27;ll buy more when gone.</li>
            <li> My signature scent. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Bulgari for men and this product lives up to Bulgari&#x27;s reputation. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have worn this item for years.  The bottle of Bvlgari I received is not authentic.  I will not purchase in the future.</li>
