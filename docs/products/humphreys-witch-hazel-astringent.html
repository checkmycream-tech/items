            <li> Good drying agent for the moist areas of skin that you have</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with unclear face fo as long as I can remember as a result, I have tried so many products that I started getting annoyed everytime I walked through the skincare isle.&lt;br /&gt;I have really oily and sensitive skin so I react to almost everything.&lt;br /&gt; At first, I did not like the witch hazel because it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; my face as my friend had said it would but my aunt suggested I mix a little bit of rubbing alcohol in it since the alcohol content is not so high and I&#x27;ve been happy with it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I use a mild facewash first then I cleanse with the mixture and moisturize with almond oil and rose water. I have been getting compliments on my \\&quot;lovely skin\\&quot; which makes me love it even more.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great size, you will not need to be purchasing a new bottle for a while.</li>
            <li> The price for the size and how great it works is fantastic. I could have redness on my face and within minutes the Witch Hazel takes care if it. it is very cooling and helps with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle showed up with the cap cracked so of course it was messy. You can find a bottle of which hazel at any Walmart or Target. It&#x27;d be cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the smell of this and it feels so funny putting it on my face after using astringent that makes it feel clean and livened up.  I just tried it but would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed the texter of my skin. I have my mom and sister using it as well. I love it my skin is really sensitive and this feels really nice on it .</li>
            <li> This is not the product I intended to order as it is too drying.  The product I use is Humphrey.s Lilac Witch Hazel Skin Softening Facial Toner. which does not dry my skin.  I see now there is a big difference  The plain Witch Hazel is just that.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It cleans and refreshes without irriation. Will buy again but not here. I found another one cheaper at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> strong smell and high in alcohol content. prefer Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of refining my all natural skin care regime. I love this witch hazel, it&#x27;s just what it says it is and works great. I use it on acne that surfaces, bug bites, stings, scalp cleansing...you name it!</li>
            <li> Since I am taking yoga, I found a recipe to make a safe spray to use on the yoga mat. Using drops of different oils and the Witch Hazel, it makes a nice and clean smelling spray.</li>
            <li> I thought I detested the scent of witch hazel until I bought this brand, initially at Whole Foods, and then I reordered via Amazon. Really high quality and smells great.</li>
            <li> Since moving to a humid climate I&#x27;ve stopped using facial moisturizer and only use witch hazel.  I apply straight out of the shower to my face and my face has yet to dry out after using this for months and months.  Also useful on freshly shaved skin.</li>
            <li> Use Humphres Witch Hazel every day before I put anything else on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I think I look healthy and refreshed. I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> An amazing organic witch hazel that is very effective at relieving minor skin irritations like pesky itchy mosquito bites. It is safe for your dogs too. I&#x27;ve used it on my little dog when she has had dry itchy skin and it has given her relief. I use it also as a mild and inexpensive facial toner. And just look at that label...love it. That is worth the price of admission right there! Too cute not to keep it out in full view in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great for fixing that occasional nick from the razor.</li>
            <li> It has a different scent than the one I purchased in the pharmacy, I dont know if it is old or not but smelled different.</li>
            <li> You should have this as a staple in the house like salt and pepper.  Clean and conditions skin.  Great for the scalp.</li>
