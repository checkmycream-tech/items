            <li>SO HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE, THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER FIND ANOTHER BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>Wonderful parfum that I used many years ago.  </li>
            <li>In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work.</li>

            <li>Now I am delighted to know I can buy it online.&lt;br /&gt;Eileen</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a good choice,</li>

            <li>I love it too!</li>
            <li>I love this scent!</li>
            <li>Most perfumes make me nauseous after awhile, not this one!</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one since I did not know what it smelled like, but I liked the description.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, I guess, but it sure is not like it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Arpege is a classic and wonderful perfume.</li>
            <li>was a very strong smell almost  over powering.</li>
            <li>Imagine my happiness when I discovered that it is available on the internet.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is as suitable for the office as it would be after office hours.</li>
            <li>I had been researching fragrances from the 50&#x27;s and this was one of the most popular.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>However, I am glad that I found it and was able to try it out.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the ease of ordering this and the price was a selling point, too.</li>
            <li>I had enjoyed it for years.  </li>
            <li>The lovely scent would linger in the classroom, and I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to have it.</li>
            <li>I feel confident wearing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Arpege for many years.</li>
            <li>I used another scent for 25 years until it was no longer made and had to shop for and sniff many perfumes before I found Arpege Eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li>Love to keep it on hand.  </li>
            <li>Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris.</li>
            <li>The bottle is lovely, too.</li>
            <li>This Arpege by Lanvin does not smell like it used to many years ago.</li>
            <li>One of my signature perfumes from many years ago.  </li>
            <li>My Mother&#x27;s favorite .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a grown-up and want a sexy, sensual scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The smell has changed for sure.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and when I tell them it&#x27;s Arpege</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>She knows more about the product than I.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>love it, tks a million</li>
            <li>Arpege is one of my longtime favorite perfumes to wear.</li>
            <li>I paid under $40 for it online, and I used to pay over $80 when I was able to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with the quick transaction from the company.</li>
            <li>Thank you very nice and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good fragrance for women older, I have given to my mother and I love it.</li>
            <li>Light yet sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I am so glad it is still available.  </li>
            <li>I will always love the old perfumes that real chemist took years to develop into symphonies of wonderful scents.</li>
            <li>A gorgeous perfume straight from the Jazz Age to you.  </li>
            <li>It goes on strong but soon softens to a lovely, undescribable and lightly luscious veil of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am a huge love of Chanel #5, but do not like Chanel&#x27;s huge price tags.</li>
            <li>The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like what I remember, it is incredibly strong, and I never wear it.</li>
            <li>The price point is much more affordable than Chanel and it is nice  to try something new! -</li>
            <li>And what a super price!</li>
            <li>At first, it goes on very strong and I did not think I would like it b/c &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>and I honestly did not think this product was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I have been hoping that Arpege would become available again.  </li>
            <li>Great present for my mom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not possible to rate a scent that has proven itself to be one of the great perfumes of the world for over 50 years.  </li>
            <li>When the gift was opened, such a happy response.</li>
            <li>Sexy, light, compelling --</li>
            <li>The price is right, the packaging was safe</li>
            <li>This perfume was worn by my mother for a long time and I was delighted to be able to purchase it for her again.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t tell you how many years ago I first purchased Arpege</li>
            <li>over the years it has changed a bit the original scent using my mom in the 80s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the original, nothing at all, and besides that it doesn&#x27;t even have a pleasing fragrance of</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth if you buy this, I promise!  </li>
            <li>I was told the original formula is being discontinued.</li>
            <li>This is the original.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received didn&#x27;t look like the original I remember, and the fragrance lacked the flowery scent I recall from my youth.</li>
            <li>In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium.</li>
            <li>If you like overly sweet vanilla, you will like this version of Arpege for Women.</li>
            <li>If I paid significantly more from the Vermont Country Store, would I have received the real thing?</li>
            <li>While others tout other great fragrances, this has been my go to perfume for my special guy.  </li>
            <li>It is delightful, never overbearing, subtle and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rich, warm, spicy and sexy, this is a true classic old school perfume, so much more complex and fascinating than today&#x27;s watery fruity floral perfumes that smell like air freshners.</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived and it was very hot.</li>
            <li>original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately.</li>
            <li>worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>In October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Cool water, hot water, vinegar, needles, nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>So glad they still make these old perfumes.  </li>
            <li>The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.</li>
            <li>I was so excited, when I discovered that I could purchase Arpege perfume from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Arpege seems to have a reputation as an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume because so many of our Mom, Grandmas and Aunts had this on their dressing tables, but I encourage modern misses to give Arpege another sniff.</li>
            <li>It is a true classic.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>In case, you don&#x27;t get it - I really like this!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Although it was pricey for me, I saved up and bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>So glad it is back.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is first class and the atomizer wears well.</li>
            <li>World favorite last 70 years</li>
            <li>Wow, is it ever powerful!  </li>
            <li>Frequently derided as an &#x27;old lady&#x27; perfume, it would be better described as eternally feminine.</li>
            <li>lasts a long time, is recognizable, plus many people ask me what it is.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, but not nearly as long lasting as it use to be.</li>
            <li>I found this old fragrance that my mother wore in the fifties and she would let me wear on special occasions when I was in high</li>
            <li>I first discovered this fragrance in high school.</li>
            <li>This is a very dark and glamorous perfume, free of any frivolity, and should be worn only by the kind of person who can do it justice.  </li>
            <li>I really wonder how people get away with this.  </li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use to much or it will be almost overpowering.</li>
            <li>It may have been tweaked somewhat but seems just as good as the original--at least I believe so.</li>
            <li>But the bottle of Arpege I received from Amazon.com wasn&#x27;t as pictured (it was black, not clear), and the smell was different:  spicier without those wonderful flowery topnotes.  </li>
            <li>thinking that if it&#x27;s a knockoff it&#x27;s not going to be the same as the original, but I was hopeful anyway.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only thing that is like the original.  </li>
            <li>Not the same formula as the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only that person from time to time, but at least now you have a better idea of what it smells like than the marketing blurb that makes it sound fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li>Glad it is back and is the same product we remembered and missed so much.</li>
            <li>Not sickenly sweet or overly spicy, it seems to just linger enough and folks will ask you what scent you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li>But wait a few seconds and the fragrance starts to change and softens into a beautiful, lovely, soft and romantic slightly powdery floral (very similar to Chanel #5).  </li>
            <li>I never expected to like a perfume this much!</li>
            <li>If you long to experience the gentler times during the 50&#x27;s when fragrance could be identifiable unlike today&#x27;s scents that all basically smell the same, you&#x27;ll love Arpege.</li>
            <li>cutest new presentation, but</li>
            <li>HAS A CLASSIC SCENT THAT MATCHES MY NATURAL BODY SCENT.</li>
            <li>this is a reformulation, it is close enough to the original to bring back memories of a time of dreams, opportunities, and sense of adventure.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what happened to me after my last 3 purchases of this item.  </li>
            <li>That was the advertising slogan when I received my first bottle of Arpege for my 21st birthday in 1968.  </li>
            <li>My sweetheart first gave this to me decades ago as an anniversary present.  </li>
            <li>When I first ran out, I could only find it at pricey department stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After fifty years, the fragrance seems a little strong to me.</li>
            <li>I am so fed up with today&#x27;s fruity, sickeningly sweet scents -- it seems that every perfume smells exactly the same and they smell like they are made for little girls or teenagers.  </li>
            <li>While the picture shows a clear glass container, I received a container that&#x27;s ash-blue.</li>
            <li>Mature women always respond with, \\&quot;promise her anything...\\&quot;</li>
            <li>While cruising i have found it in ports far away from the US.</li>
            <li>Perfume smells old and rancid.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but evolves through various stages of fragrance as it lasts all day, like being in a mysterious garden.&lt;br /&gt;The black and gold bottle and matching box are beautiful as well, and exactly as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>The alleged \\&quot;powdery floral notes combining honeysuckle, jasmine, roses and orange blossoms\\&quot; came and went within a few minutes, but the finish (consisting of dark sandalwoods and that strongly chemical \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell more frequently associated with Youth Dew perfume) lasted ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>a little too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li>The new one&#x27;s all smell alike and actually stink like bug spray.</li>
            <li>There is no other fragrance that comes close for me.  </li>
            <li>whatever reason, I stopped using it some years later, but recently Arpege came back to mind as I -- evidently like some other reviewers on this site --</li>

            <li> I am a huge love of Chanel #5, but do not like Chanel&#x27;s huge price tags.</li>
            <li> The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like what I remember, it is incredibly strong, and I never wear it.</li>
            <li> The price point is much more affordable than Chanel and it is nice  to try something new! -</li>
            <li> And what a super price!</li>
            <li> At first, it goes on very strong and I did not think I would like it b/c &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li> and I honestly did not think this product was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have been hoping that Arpege would become available again.  </li>
            <li> Great present for my mom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not possible to rate a scent that has proven itself to be one of the great perfumes of the world for over 50 years.  </li>
            <li> When the gift was opened, such a happy response.</li>
            <li> Sexy, light, compelling --</li>
            <li> The price is right, the packaging was safe</li>
            <li> This perfume was worn by my mother for a long time and I was delighted to be able to purchase it for her again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t tell you how many years ago I first purchased Arpege</li>
            <li> over the years it has changed a bit the original scent using my mom in the 80s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the original, nothing at all, and besides that it doesn&#x27;t even have a pleasing fragrance of</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth if you buy this, I promise!  </li>
            <li> I was told the original formula is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the original.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received didn&#x27;t look like the original I remember, and the fragrance lacked the flowery scent I recall from my youth.</li>
            <li> In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium.</li>
            <li> If you like overly sweet vanilla, you will like this version of Arpege for Women.</li>
            <li> If I paid significantly more from the Vermont Country Store, would I have received the real thing?</li>
            <li> While others tout other great fragrances, this has been my go to perfume for my special guy.  </li>
            <li> It is delightful, never overbearing, subtle and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rich, warm, spicy and sexy, this is a true classic old school perfume, so much more complex and fascinating than today&#x27;s watery fruity floral perfumes that smell like air freshners.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived and it was very hot.</li>
            <li> original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately.</li>
            <li> worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> In October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cool water, hot water, vinegar, needles, nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> So glad they still make these old perfumes.  </li>
            <li> The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.</li>
            <li> I was so excited, when I discovered that I could purchase Arpege perfume from Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Arpege seems to have a reputation as an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume because so many of our Mom, Grandmas and Aunts had this on their dressing tables, but I encourage modern misses to give Arpege another sniff.</li>
            <li> It is a true classic.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> In case, you don&#x27;t get it - I really like this!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Although it was pricey for me, I saved up and bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> So glad it is back.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is first class and the atomizer wears well.</li>
            <li> World favorite last 70 years</li>
            <li> Wow, is it ever powerful!  </li>
            <li> Frequently derided as an &#x27;old lady&#x27; perfume, it would be better described as eternally feminine.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, is recognizable, plus many people ask me what it is.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, but not nearly as long lasting as it use to be.</li>
            <li> I found this old fragrance that my mother wore in the fifties and she would let me wear on special occasions when I was in high</li>
            <li> I first discovered this fragrance in high school.</li>
            <li> This is a very dark and glamorous perfume, free of any frivolity, and should be worn only by the kind of person who can do it justice.  </li>
            <li> I really wonder how people get away with this.  </li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use to much or it will be almost overpowering.</li>
            <li> It may have been tweaked somewhat but seems just as good as the original--at least I believe so.</li>
            <li> But the bottle of Arpege I received from Amazon.com wasn&#x27;t as pictured (it was black, not clear), and the smell was different:  spicier without those wonderful flowery topnotes.  </li>
            <li> thinking that if it&#x27;s a knockoff it&#x27;s not going to be the same as the original, but I was hopeful anyway.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only thing that is like the original.  </li>
            <li> Not the same formula as the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only that person from time to time, but at least now you have a better idea of what it smells like than the marketing blurb that makes it sound fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li> Glad it is back and is the same product we remembered and missed so much.</li>
            <li> Not sickenly sweet or overly spicy, it seems to just linger enough and folks will ask you what scent you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> But wait a few seconds and the fragrance starts to change and softens into a beautiful, lovely, soft and romantic slightly powdery floral (very similar to Chanel #5).  </li>
            <li> I never expected to like a perfume this much!</li>
            <li> If you long to experience the gentler times during the 50&#x27;s when fragrance could be identifiable unlike today&#x27;s scents that all basically smell the same, you&#x27;ll love Arpege.</li>
            <li> cutest new presentation, but</li>
            <li> HAS A CLASSIC SCENT THAT MATCHES MY NATURAL BODY SCENT.</li>
            <li> this is a reformulation, it is close enough to the original to bring back memories of a time of dreams, opportunities, and sense of adventure.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what happened to me after my last 3 purchases of this item.  </li>
            <li> That was the advertising slogan when I received my first bottle of Arpege for my 21st birthday in 1968.  </li>
            <li> My sweetheart first gave this to me decades ago as an anniversary present.  </li>
            <li> When I first ran out, I could only find it at pricey department stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After fifty years, the fragrance seems a little strong to me.</li>
            <li> I am so fed up with today&#x27;s fruity, sickeningly sweet scents -- it seems that every perfume smells exactly the same and they smell like they are made for little girls or teenagers.  </li>
            <li> While the picture shows a clear glass container, I received a container that&#x27;s ash-blue.</li>
            <li> Mature women always respond with, \\&quot;promise her anything...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> While cruising i have found it in ports far away from the US.</li>
            <li> Perfume smells old and rancid.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but evolves through various stages of fragrance as it lasts all day, like being in a mysterious garden.&lt;br /&gt;The black and gold bottle and matching box are beautiful as well, and exactly as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> The alleged \\&quot;powdery floral notes combining honeysuckle, jasmine, roses and orange blossoms\\&quot; came and went within a few minutes, but the finish (consisting of dark sandalwoods and that strongly chemical \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell more frequently associated with Youth Dew perfume) lasted ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li> a little too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> The new one&#x27;s all smell alike and actually stink like bug spray.</li>
            <li> There is no other fragrance that comes close for me.  </li>
            <li> whatever reason, I stopped using it some years later, but recently Arpege came back to mind as I -- evidently like some other reviewers on this site --</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not willing to take that risk.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone who is interested in a subtle perfume that does not over do it.</li>
            <li> Since as long as I can remember, my mother always wore Arpege.</li>
            <li> I will order it as long as it is being sold!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a sucker for historic products that I just had to have this, despite the fact that I&#x27;d never actually smelled it before.  </li>
            <li> Arpege is a fragrance that inspires confidence and soft, feminine sensuality without going overboard.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and delicate with a powdery fragrance.</li>
            <li> Entire waste of money</li>
            <li> Arpege is distinctive, but also very soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using Arpege, I don&#x27;t miss my other perfume at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also aggravating to know that I cannot return perfumes due to Amazon&#x27;s policy against returning flammable liquid.</li>
            <li> Over time other fragrances have pushed it to the background.</li>
            <li> Such a let down !!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several other well known fragrances (Chanel No 5, Joy, Narcissus Noir, etc), without mishap -- but Arpege remains a turkey.  </li>
            <li> Being too shy to ask directly, I tried all the testers in the stores until I found a match: Arpege!</li>
            <li> My mother wore this fragrance when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> A little costly, but the fragrance lasts,all day.</li>
            <li> Would you purchase a bottle of perfume or cologne knowing that 2/3 would be wasted?  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s wasted</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for quite a few years and on the days I&#x27;m wearing it</li>
            <li> Obviously, there is something wrong -- for even the cheapest of perfumes have nozzles that work.</li>
            <li> NOT overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been difficult to find in stores for a long time now</li>
            <li> I ordered it and could hardly wait for it to arrive all the while</li>
            <li> My Mom used to wear Arpege in her youth and confided that it was hard to find.</li>
            <li> If any reformulating was done it hasn&#x27;t hurt it, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed as the fragrance was not the same as years ago.</li>
            <li> have become annoyed with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; scents that resemble &amp;#34;air fresheners&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bug spray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It is not good nor bad.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I was so disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It should have been sent with cold packs.</li>
            <li> and it was originally very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.</li>

            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t recall the Arpege smell - but this seems different....maybe I am incorrect in saying this about the fragrance as memory does sometimes trick us.  But, the bottle is still as lovely on my table in my dressing room!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent!! I took a chance on this one since I did not know what it smelled like, but I liked the description. Love it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I always like going back in time when I can. I found this old fragrance that my mother wore in the fifties and she would let me wear on special occasions when I was in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fifty years, the fragrance seems a little strong to me. However, I am glad that I found it and was able to try it out. Thank you for bringing it back into my life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The product was beautifully packed and I was very satisfied with the quick transaction from the company.</li>
            <li> It is what it is - the eternal and forever fragrance. In case, you don&#x27;t get it - I really like this! LOL</li>
            <li> Have been using Arpege since my boyfriend gave it to me at 16 He is now my husband of 60 years. &amp;#34;Promise her anything but give her Arpege&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the ease of ordering this and the price was a selling point, too. My mother has worn this french perfume for years, though it&#x27;s become more difficult to find. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t tell you how many years ago I first purchased Arpege and I honestly did not think this product was the real deal.  I was beyond pleased that indeed.....it is!  It smells fantastic and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> cutest new presentation, but over the years it has changed a bit the original scent using my mom in the 80s. excellent quality.</li>
            <li> When I gave this to my mom, it made up for everything I&#x27;ve ever forgotten. It is her very favorite perfume and it is very difficult to come by. Now I can wear my \\&quot;Mom loves me best\\&quot; T-shirt again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have been hoping that Arpege would become available again.  I had enjoyed it for years.  There is no other fragrance that comes close for me.  Imagine my happiness when I discovered that it is available on the internet.  I ordered it and could hardly wait for it to arrive all the while thinking that if it&#x27;s a knockoff it&#x27;s not going to be the same as the original, but I was hopeful anyway.  When it arrived I was so disappointed to say the least.  It&#x27;s named Arpege but that&#x27;s the only thing that is like the original.  It&#x27;s nothing like the original, nothing at all, and besides that it doesn&#x27;t even have a pleasing fragrance of it&#x27;s own.  I really wonder how people get away with this.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> This perfume was worn by my mother for a long time and I was delighted to be able to purchase it for her again. It does smell nice, but not nearly as long lasting as it use to be. Nevertheless, I will continue to purchase it for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good fragrance for women older, I have given to my mother and I love it. A good price compared to others in its class.</li>
            <li> Arpege is a classic and wonderful perfume.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this fragrance in high school. Somebody in one of my classes wore it, perhaps the teacher, perhaps another student. The lovely scent would linger in the classroom, and I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to have it. Being too shy to ask directly, I tried all the testers in the stores until I found a match: Arpege! Although it was pricey for me, I saved up and bought my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, I stopped using it some years later, but recently Arpege came back to mind as I -- evidently like some other reviewers on this site -- have become annoyed with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; scents that resemble &amp;#34;air fresheners&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bug spray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;If this is a reformulation, it is close enough to the original to bring back memories of a time of dreams, opportunities, and sense of adventure. I feel confident wearing it. A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but evolves through various stages of fragrance as it lasts all day, like being in a mysterious garden.&lt;br /&gt;The black and gold bottle and matching box are beautiful as well, and exactly as shown in the photo. And what a super price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a sucker for historic products that I just had to have this, despite the fact that I&#x27;d never actually smelled it before.  Wow, is it ever powerful!  A dab on your wrist will last FOREVER, even through your daily ration of hand washings.  The alleged \\&quot;powdery floral notes combining honeysuckle, jasmine, roses and orange blossoms\\&quot; came and went within a few minutes, but the finish (consisting of dark sandalwoods and that strongly chemical \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell more frequently associated with Youth Dew perfume) lasted ALL DAY.  I know I&#x27;ll wake up tomorrow and still have it stuck to my wrist.  Heck, I know I&#x27;ll take a shower tomorrow and still have it follow me around from room to room.  You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth if you buy this, I promise!  This is a very dark and glamorous perfume, free of any frivolity, and should be worn only by the kind of person who can do it justice.  I&#x27;m only that person from time to time, but at least now you have a better idea of what it smells like than the marketing blurb that makes it sound fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Arpege for many years. What a wonderful scent.  But the bottle of Arpege I received from Amazon.com wasn&#x27;t as pictured (it was black, not clear), and the smell was different:  spicier without those wonderful flowery topnotes.  I wonder, did I receive a dud or has the Lanvin company changed the formula without the consumer&#x27;s permission??  Because the bottle has been opened, it isn&#x27;t returnable according the to Amazon.com rules.</li>
            <li> I used another scent for 25 years until it was no longer made and had to shop for and sniff many perfumes before I found Arpege Eau de Parfum. It is delightful, never overbearing, subtle and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Arpege, I don&#x27;t miss my other perfume at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EK&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This has been my Mom&#x27;s signature fragrance for over 30 years. Suits her perfectly. I was told the original formula is being discontinued. Getting conflicting info. This is the original.</li>
            <li> My Mom used to wear Arpege in her youth and confided that it was hard to find. NOT on eBay! just a click away.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU for making Mom happy for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Wonderful parfum that I used many years ago.  Love to keep it on hand.  I receive lots of compliments and inquires as to what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again to maintain my supply.</li>
            <li> Great present for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you keep it in the market</li>
            <li> lovely smell - great price</li>
            <li> Just did not match my memory  of the scent from 50 years ago when I was 21!!  Then again, nothing is the same from when I was 21, especially me!</li>
            <li> the Arpege  today is a reconstruction of the 1927 version. Hence the difference in fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk. The bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball. In October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This fragrance is as suitable for the office as it would be after office hours. Frequently derided as an &#x27;old lady&#x27; perfume, it would be better described as eternally feminine. It may have been tweaked somewhat but seems just as good as the original--at least I believe so. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This Arpege by Lanvin does not smell like it used to many years ago.</li>
            <li> One of my signature perfumes from many years ago.  If any reformulating was done it hasn&#x27;t hurt it, at least for me.  Regards, M</li>
            <li> Arpege seems to have a reputation as an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume because so many of our Mom, Grandmas and Aunts had this on their dressing tables, but I encourage modern misses to give Arpege another sniff. Rich, warm, spicy and sexy, this is a true classic old school perfume, so much more complex and fascinating than today&#x27;s watery fruity floral perfumes that smell like air freshners. Arpege reminds me of inscense. I am a huge love of Chanel #5, but do not like Chanel&#x27;s huge price tags. Arpege is a very similar type of scent, that is also affordable. Arpege is distinctive, but also very soft and subtle. LOVE MY ARPEGE!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This does not smell like what I remember, it is incredibly strong, and I never wear it.</li>
            <li> It is not possible to rate a scent that has proven itself to be one of the great perfumes of the world for over 50 years.  Just be happy it is here and luxuriate in it.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> amazon&#x27;s description of this item states that the ingredient is salicylic acid??&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember this perfume being made up of that but I&#x27;m not going to puchase it because of their description.</li>
            <li> While the picture shows a clear glass container, I received a container that&#x27;s ash-blue. It also smelled slightly different from the one I purchased before from a store. It&#x27;s also aggravating to know that I cannot return perfumes due to Amazon&#x27;s policy against returning flammable liquid.</li>
            <li> So glad it is back.  My wife used this from HS on and the product disappeared in the 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s.  Glad it is back and is the same product we remembered and missed so much.</li>
            <li> Would you purchase a bottle of perfume or cologne knowing that 2/3 would be wasted?  That is exactly what happened to me after my last 3 purchases of this item.  There is a design flaw in the bottle.  It clogs, and there is NOTHING you can do to get it to emit perfume. Cool water, hot water, vinegar, needles, nothing worked.  Obviously, there is something wrong -- for even the cheapest of perfumes have nozzles that work. I have purchased several other well known fragrances (Chanel No 5, Joy, Narcissus Noir, etc), without mishap -- but Arpege remains a turkey.  I wrote to the manufacturer... twice... they have not even bothered to respond.  Three strikes, you&#x27;re out!  Adios Arpege!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in Vancouver stores - Googled Amazon.com and there it was.  My wife&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> Sprayer not working after a while so it&#x27;s wasted</li>
            <li> ... but give her Arpege!  That was the advertising slogan when I received my first bottle of Arpege for my 21st birthday in 1968.  Yes, I am yet another granny who loves it.  It&#x27;s been difficult to find in stores for a long time now and it was originally very expensive.  But hooray for Amazon, I have never been without it!  Hopefully it will still be around for another 40 years so it can be my \\&quot;forever\\&quot; perfume.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this for 50 years,, never tire of the fragrance. Light yet sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite scent and a great price.</li>
            <li> Thank you very nice and fast delivery. My Mother&#x27;s favorite .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  Ever since I tried it, I just can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I am so fed up with today&#x27;s fruity, sickeningly sweet scents -- it seems that every perfume smells exactly the same and they smell like they are made for little girls or teenagers.  I&#x27;m a grown-up and want a sexy, sensual scent.  I have found just that in Arpege.  I had been researching fragrances from the 50&#x27;s and this was one of the most popular.  At first, it goes on very strong and I did not think I would like it b/c &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; immediately springs to mind!  But wait a few seconds and the fragrance starts to change and softens into a beautiful, lovely, soft and romantic slightly powdery floral (very similar to Chanel #5).  The price point is much more affordable than Chanel and it is nice  to try something new! - Arpege is a fragrance that inspires confidence and soft, feminine sensuality without going overboard.  I never expected to like a perfume this much!</li>
            <li> My mother wore this fragrance when I was a little girl. I wore it as a teenager. It is soft and delicate with a powdery fragrance. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have always used this perfume and it never disappoints.  I am so glad it is still available.  I will order it as long as it is being sold!</li>
            <li> was a very strong smell almost  over powering.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived on time</li>
            <li> a little too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> u know when you want to leave your &amp;#34;presence&amp;#34; around? this is the perfume to go. lasts a long time, is recognizable, plus many people ask me what it is. they love it! I love it too!</li>
            <li> Since as long as I can remember, my mother always wore Arpege. The price is right, the packaging was safe so no worries about breaking. If you or someone you know like this fragrance, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited, when I discovered that I could purchase Arpege perfume from Amazon at a reasonable price. The bottle I received didn&#x27;t look like the original I remember, and the fragrance lacked the flowery scent I recall from my youth. If you like overly sweet vanilla, you will like this version of Arpege for Women. I don&#x27;t! If I paid significantly more from the Vermont Country Store, would I have received the real thing? So far, I&#x27;m not willing to take that risk.</li>
            <li> Aspege has a romantic aroma that lasts along time while wearing it. I would like to recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed as the fragrance was not the same as years ago. Entire waste of money and I would suggest to anyone not to bother purchasing the Eau De Parfum !!! Such a let down !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I guess, but it sure is not like it used to be.  The smell has changed for sure.</li>
            <li> wife has been using arpege for years.  excellent perfume.  would recommend to anyone who is interested in a subtle perfume that does not over do it.</li>
            <li> If you long to experience the gentler times during the 50&#x27;s when fragrance could be identifiable unlike today&#x27;s scents that all basically smell the same, you&#x27;ll love Arpege. It goes on strong but soon softens to a lovely, undescribable and lightly luscious veil of fragrance. Not sickenly sweet or overly spicy, it seems to just linger enough and folks will ask you what scent you&#x27;re wearing. I get so many compliments and when I tell them it&#x27;s Arpege, some youngsters never heard of it. Mature women always respond with, \\&quot;promise her anything...\\&quot; I love Arpege and was so happy to find it. One catalog is selling this size for $99.00 do grab it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A gorgeous perfume straight from the Jazz Age to you.  Sexy, light, compelling -- NOT overwhelming.  Good to wear whatever age you are.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  So glad they still make these old perfumes.  The new one&#x27;s all smell alike and actually stink like bug spray. I will always love the old perfumes that real chemist took years to develop into symphonies of wonderful scents.</li>
            <li> I have used Arpege for the last 60 years. Over time other fragrances have pushed it to the background. While cruising i have found it in ports far away from the US. Now I am delighted to know I can buy it online.&lt;br /&gt;Eileen</li>
            <li> Ididnt care for the smell, but gave it to someone who does.</li>
            <li> A little costly, but the fragrance lasts,all day. Don&#x27;t use to much or it will be almost overpowering. Spray it on your ankles for best non-face fragrance.</li>
            <li> Well, It was nothing like the Arpeige I used years ago.  It is not good nor bad.  I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend of my wife. She knows more about the product than I. When the gift was opened, such a happy response. This turned out to be a good choice,</li>
            <li> Not the same formula as the original.</li>
            <li> I bought the spraiy and the tiny bottle of perfume. I love this scent! It is a true classic.I describe it as a blend of flowers, spice, and powder but I am no expert. I just love it.</li>
            <li> love it, tks a million</li>
            <li> Yummy, hubby loves when I wear this scent!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It makes me feel young and beautiful. Most perfumes make me nauseous after awhile, not this one!</li>
            <li> My sweetheart first gave this to me decades ago as an anniversary present.  When I first ran out, I could only find it at pricey department stores.  Was so amazed to see I could get it conveniently through Amazon, which arrived promptly and in good condition.  While others tout other great fragrances, this has been my go to perfume for my special guy.  The packaging is first class and the atomizer wears well.</li>
            <li> World favorite last 70 years</li>
            <li> THIS PARFUM WAS DISCONTINUED. IT&#x27;S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. HAS A CLASSIC SCENT THAT MATCHES MY NATURAL BODY SCENT. SO HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE, THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER FIND ANOTHER BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Arpege perfume  Package arrived on time.  The perfume arrived and it was very hot. This affected the smell of the product. I will not order perfume this way again. It should have been sent with cold packs. Perfume smells old and rancid. I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Arpege is one of my longtime favorite perfumes to wear. I&#x27;ve used it for quite a few years and on the days I&#x27;m wearing it I always get lots of compliments on the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this, she is 83, and has worn it for years. I can only find it online. I paid under $40 for it online, and I used to pay over $80 when I was able to find it in the stores.</li>
