            <li>Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li>It was a cheap plastic comb (not the Ace Tail Comb, not even a tail comb lol).</li>
            <li>Nice comb.</li>
            <li>I guess she liked it too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice comb for the price.</li>
            <li>does the job just fine which is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>It was very cheap</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love giving myself a wash and set</li>
            <li>and I love using this comb.</li>
            <li>Glad someone still sells it.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I opened a claim with Amazon and hopefully will be able to return the item and get a refund.</li>
            <li>I love this style comb and have used this style for many years.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see I could still buy it.</li>
            <li>very solid, if you have hair loss this is the best one you can use</li>
            <li>I love this comb.  </li>
            <li>but it is also great to make beautiful zic-zac&#x27;s or get a perfectly tight ponytail..</li>
            <li>As a hairstylist, I loved it from the first time I picked it up and even though my profession changed, I have continued to use it through all of the years since.  </li>
            <li>Its a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The comb I received was a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The tail is well-shaped and comfortable against my scalp, and the teeth a well-suited to both smoothing and teasing.</li>
            <li>This comb is what helps me get it done quickly and easily without snagging or breaking off my hair.</li>
            <li>I have lots of very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say really?</li>
            <li>Got it more because I needed a comb with a pointy end, works really well for parting hair.</li>
            <li>I find a comb with smaller (but more) bristles works better then this.</li>
            <li>My favorite new teasing comb.</li>
            <li>This little comb works great.  </li>
            <li>This has saved me hundreds of dollars at the beauty salon as I can do my own deep conditioning, wash and set and do it any time I want.</li>
            <li>A simple nice comb with a rat tail to help with my parts.</li>
            <li>Just hold up a section of hair, comb/tease the back side, and then smooth over the top, all with this comb.</li>
            <li>Exciting?</li>
            <li>It is the only kind of comb I use.</li>
            <li>I love using this for making my large high buns.</li>
            <li>these a the same good quality of the old ones i used to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>i have pretty course hair</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I like to tease it up a bit in the back / at the top /</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve checked that out first, oh well.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I do think I will probably get a teasing brush next though because I have a feeling I will get better results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this, used it, loved it, then it went missing.</li>
            <li>The price was right They were packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find such a good product in local stores anymore and have to order online.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a regular straight comb, but this design does a better job</li>
            <li>like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, easy to use, and the results last awhile.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, but upon opening it I found that instead of receiving an 8\\&quot; teasing comb with a tail I had gotten an all purpose, possibly 8\\&quot;, tail-less comb that does not include a teasing-toothed end.</li>
            <li>so much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes its plastic but its very sturdy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this comb my whole life.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain much.</li>
            <li>It has less rows of teeth than I thought it would (not the seller&#x27;s fault, just me not knowing better)</li>
            <li>a lot more tease for less effort...</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this particular style of comb for about a decade now ...</li>
            <li>I would give this product all five stars, but the shipping was extremely high.</li>
            <li>after misplacing my first one i had no problem ordering a second one!</li>
            <li>For fine or thinning hair - this comb works wonders for a little backcombing.  </li>
            <li>but is more or less the same - squared end instead of rounded</li>
            <li>Not really what I expecting it really does tease very well.  </li>
            <li>The receipt I received clearly says \\&quot;Ace Teasing Tail Comb 8\\</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it on Amazon after visiting the big 3 drug stores, Target and a few beauty stores.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the comb works really well and really gets my hair to stick up.</li>
            <li>This comb has been my favorite since the late 1960s when it was sold only in beauty supply stores and was the \\&quot;Ace #9</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an average small bristle on one end, large bristle on the other kind of comb and I can&#x27;t use that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I later found it among my 10 yr Old&#x27;s hair supplies.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re planning to order this item then I highly recommend that you purchase it from a seller other than Maitri Mega Mall.</li>
            <li>I have ultra thin fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have ultra thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i broke a few \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; off of my older comb</li>
            <li> It is by the same brand (Ace), but completely useless for me and an item that I could have easily bought for a dollar or two elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t plan to get anything else as long as these can be found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use the long end to separate my wet hair, run the piece of hair selected through the teeth of the comb</li>
            <li> Just as expected and promptly shipped</li>
            <li> They are hard rubber and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> And I hope to warn other Amazon buyers.</li>
            <li> My comb arrived super late, and when it arrived, it was the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Its a little flimsy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this review belongs in this area, but I see no option of leaving packaging feedback or seller feedback for loveotc.</li>
            <li> but it definitely works to tease my thin hair!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores - work well</li>
            <li> They are hard to find and when i find them I stock up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item from Maitri Mega Mall several days ago, in a desperate need to stock up on cosplay preparation supplies.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair</li>
            <li> seriously contemplating returning this item since it&#x27;s completely useless for wig styling.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing too complicated here.  </li>
            <li> so I know I didn&#x27;t purchase the wrong item by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not tease well at all</li>
            <li> these a the same good quality of the old ones i used to have.&lt;br /&gt;they make hair styling so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy this item again,&lt;br /&gt;as well as recommend this comb to others with confidence.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Does what I need it to. Very satisfied with this product. Five stars if I only have five to give.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i broke a few \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; off of my older comb and it took me forever to decide what could possibly replace it since i was so use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job just fine which is fantastic!! Its great and very easy to tease your hair but it is also great to make beautiful zic-zac&#x27;s or get a perfectly tight ponytail..:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes its plastic but its very sturdy and i know it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> This is a must have comb.  Used to have them in all of the drug stores.  Now - for some reason I cannot find them.  For fine or thinning hair - this comb works wonders for a little backcombing.  Glad I could find it on Amazon after visiting the big 3 drug stores, Target and a few beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I love giving myself a wash and set and I love using this comb. This comb is what helps me get it done quickly and easily without snagging or breaking off my hair. I follow what hairdressers do. I use the long end to separate my wet hair, run the piece of hair selected through the teeth of the comb and then I roll it and sit under the dryer. This has saved me hundreds of dollars at the beauty salon as I can do my own deep conditioning, wash and set and do it any time I want.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and when I saw the comb I didn&#x27;t think it would work on my hair and was very happy to see it works very well on my hair! Deff. Does its job.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  It was exactly what I needed.  The price was right They were packaged very well. The shipping time was great.   Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of comb for over 30 years...Can always depend on ACE combs.</li>
            <li> well if you would like to tease your hair, i suggest this ace teasing comb. i have pretty course hair and it works great. after misplacing my first one i had no problem ordering a second one! inexpensive and it works. can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This comb has been my favorite since the late 1960s when it was sold only in beauty supply stores and was the \\&quot;Ace #9 Teasing Comb\\&quot;.  As a hairstylist, I loved it from the first time I picked it up and even though my profession changed, I have continued to use it through all of the years since.  Now it is Goody Ace #62206 but is more or less the same - squared end instead of rounded but things change!  I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find such a good product in local stores anymore and have to order online.  This is the only comb for me - simply a must have.  Glad someone still sells it.</li>
            <li> Nice comb. What more is there to say really?</li>
            <li> Works well and I broke the end off so I can carry it in my purse as my back up!</li>
            <li> I find a comb with smaller (but more) bristles works better then this. Its a cheap plastic. It will still work if you dont want to spend alot on a good comb.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This is the perfect teasing comb.  This is my 2nd time buying this comb because it works -definitely is the best i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have ultra thin fine hair. I had purchased a teasing brush before this and it just made things look frizzy. I purchased this, used it, loved it, then it went missing. I later found it among my 10 yr Old&#x27;s hair supplies. I guess she liked it too. I bought another for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, easy to use, and the results last awhile.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores - work well</li>
            <li> I was expecting the Lady Ace that was made of rubber.  The comb I received was a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this comb my whole life. I&#x27;m so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Great comb. My hairdresser shoed us how to zig zag a part and this comb works perfectly. This comb came on time and packaged well. Thanks !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. A simple nice comb with a rat tail to help with my parts.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very fine, straight hair. This comb is perfect for styling my type of hair. The tail is well-shaped and comfortable against my scalp, and the teeth a well-suited to both smoothing and teasing. I have been purchasing this particular style of comb for about a decade now ... and I don&#x27;t plan to get anything else as long as these can be found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair and I like to tease it up a bit in the back / at the top / at the crown of my head for a bit of volume.  This little comb works great.  Nothing too complicated here.  Just hold up a section of hair, comb/tease the back side, and then smooth over the top, all with this comb.</li>
            <li> I used to use a regular straight comb, but this design does a better job and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb. Exciting? No. Does it do it&#x27;s job? Yes. Would I buy it again if I needed another? Yes. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> My favorite new teasing comb. Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this review belongs in this area, but I see no option of leaving packaging feedback or seller feedback for loveotc. And I hope to warn other Amazon buyers. My comb arrived super late, and when it arrived, it was the wrong item. It was a cheap plastic comb (not the Ace Tail Comb, not even a tail comb lol). I attempted to contact the seller with no response, and also took a peek at their feedback and noticed that they often scam buyers. I should&#x27;ve checked that out first, oh well. I opened a claim with Amazon and hopefully will be able to return the item and get a refund.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expecting it really does tease very well.  Nothing like the metal ones they no longer make.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect must have tool for your bathroom. I love using this for making my large high buns. It helps and makes the job easier.</li>
            <li> It has less rows of teeth than I thought it would (not the seller&#x27;s fault, just me not knowing better) but it definitely works to tease my thin hair! Arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> This is a nice comb for the price. Its a little flimsy but I don&#x27;t use it much. I do think I will probably get a teasing brush next though because I have a feeling I will get better results. (ie. a lot more tease for less effort...and hopefully tease that stays put longer)</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from Maitri Mega Mall several days ago, in a desperate need to stock up on cosplay preparation supplies. It arrived very quickly, but upon opening it I found that instead of receiving an 8\\&quot; teasing comb with a tail I had gotten an all purpose, possibly 8\\&quot;, tail-less comb that does not include a teasing-toothed end. It is by the same brand (Ace), but completely useless for me and an item that I could have easily bought for a dollar or two elsewhere. The receipt I received clearly says \\&quot;Ace Teasing Tail Comb 8\\&quot; * Black\\&quot; so I know I didn&#x27;t purchase the wrong item by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seriously contemplating returning this item since it&#x27;s completely useless for wig styling. It&#x27;s just an average small bristle on one end, large bristle on the other kind of comb and I can&#x27;t use that.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re planning to order this item then I highly recommend that you purchase it from a seller other than Maitri Mega Mall.</li>
            <li> I do not use this comb for teasing, altho I did at one time...back in the day....but the comb is excellent for styling and just...combing. And I have never found another brand to be as good. I was lucky to find these combs through Amazon and the seller provided excellent service.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and promptly shipped</li>
            <li> I love this style comb and have used this style for many years. I was so glad to see I could still buy it.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I love this comb! It works really great, and the way the teeth are lined is what helps give you the tease you want and are looking for.</li>
            <li> I would give this product all five stars, but the shipping was extremely high. I didn&#x27;t realize  this until I actually  bought it, but shipping was over twenty dollars. Other than that, the comb works really well and really gets my hair to stick up.</li>
            <li> greatest comb i ever used!  i hope they sold this in the smaller version. very solid, if you have hair loss this is the best one you can use</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  They are hard to find and when i find them I stock up.  They are hard rubber and last a long time.  I like having the teasing part built into the comb. It is the only kind of comb I use.</li>
            <li> Got it more because I needed a comb with a pointy end, works really well for parting hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. I used this and it worked but not as good as I  had hoped it would. It was very cheap so I can&#x27;t really complain much.</li>
