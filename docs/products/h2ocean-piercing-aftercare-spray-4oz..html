            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>The top was.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This product worked fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I used this product before and it worked better for me</li>
            <li>Caring for piercings can be time-consuming, but this spray allows you to clean your piercings effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>My belly button was swollen and was becoming infected.</li>
            <li>The product was so good for my new piercing until the top popped of a week into it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it on my awesome new piercing and my daughter&#x27;s newly pierced ears!</li>
            <li>H2Ocean works great for keeping your new or existing piercings clean.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will continue to use it just to keep my belly button clean.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I believe all H2Ocean products are pretty amazing, and the piercing aftercare is no exception.</li>
            <li>Spray is convenient and comfortable, no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>Most of These types of products aren&#x27;t worth buying.its a good idea to clean your ears however home made solutions are just as potent and effective and less costly ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (I spray it on the area and then soak a Qtip and clean the bar)</li>
            <li>and i ordered more right away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>It kept it clean and infection free and it helped it heal faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use regular sea salt water, but with how people are in a hurry a lot these days, sometimes you just need to do things quickly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and then some!</li>
            <li>I just clean it with q tips the times a day with the h2ocean</li>
            <li>My piercing is more sore now than it was before I began using the H2Ocean Spray, and to top it off, I have developed the dreaded nose ring bump.</li>
            <li>order this to clean my industrial piercing.</li>
            <li>helped clean and heal my ears after I gauged them</li>
            <li>Works well and keeps the area clean and sterile.  </li>
            <li>In a nutshell, this is such a great and easy to use product, that it&#x27;s the only thing I will use to keep my piercings clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I noticed a dent on the top of the tin, didn&#x27;t think too much of it</li>
            <li>Cool idea.</li>
            <li>I love this spray so much.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to do my first at home piercing!</li>
            <li>As a person who has had several new piercings, and have to soak in salt - this is a wonderful solution - quick, easy and NO mess!</li>
            <li>This product help reduce redness and keep my fresh piercing clean.</li>
            <li>This aftercare healed it up incredibly quickly and I&#x27;ve had no issues since.</li>

            <li>It shipped really quickly</li>
            <li>This product works really well and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>came like two days later, i would recommend this to everyone who feels like their piercing is getting infected this stuff clears it away quickly like magic!</li>
            <li>I just clean it with hot water on q tips and then the h2ocean.  </li>
            <li>that i wasted this amount of money on a great product</li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have a fresh piercing, please do your body a favor and get this.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I Had 2 microdermals done on my shoulder blades and with the help of H2Ocean its healing super fast!</li>
            <li>and it cleared up my infection right away.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to heal and keep your dermals clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, even purechase smaller size to carry with me.</li>
            <li>Overall, so great of a product that I just bought my second bottle of it.</li>
            <li>This product came first...</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, wondering what it could do that my antibacterial solution couldn&#x27;t, but I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li>The first week I began to use this spray</li>
            <li>I had assumed, since almost all the reviews were absolutely stellar for this product, that it would work miracles.</li>
            <li>I have to say this first</li>
            <li>Exactly what i said.</li>
            <li>I used this product and it&#x27;s helping my nose heal fast!  </li>
            <li>also good for just everyday cleaning.</li>
            <li>but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much</li>
            <li>but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much.</li>
            <li>I took the cap off of the bottle, the spray thing fell off, but easily popped back on.</li>
            <li>GET THE LARGE CAN...</li>
            <li>No infection or allergy issues, just irritated from overly large piercing studs.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>Help I just got it and really want this helix to heal pronto</li>
            <li>Now every piercing i get, i always have my H20 spray ready.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The product comes out like water, but you might want to spray twice a day, because you can use this product up fast.</li>
            <li>I ran out so went straight to Amazon and found it...</li>
            <li>much of a hassle for the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I know this is healing fast and</li>
            <li>I really feel like it helps the area heal faster.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>This worked really well for my belly button.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone&#x27;s piercing after care!</li>
            <li>It was also much cheaper from Body Candy than from the piercing place.</li>
            <li>Its take time ,but i do see it does really work</li>
            <li>I really just have it for when my gauged ears get irritated.</li>
            <li>If they ever went out of business I&#x27;d be very upset.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It healed so fast.</li>
            <li>My ears are also very sensitive to pretty much everything, and this spray allows me to wear earrings with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>It really has helped my piercing a lot better than other cleaners I have tried.</li>
            <li>I ordered a smaller can of this product originally and found it so helpful in aiding healing-</li>
            <li>I think this is a better product to use than Dial soap or any other bacterial soap that piercers recommend.</li>
            <li>I cleaned my ears properly and the tapers i used were clean</li>
            <li>I have a newer piercing &amp; only using this product to clean it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed something to clean my earlobes after stretching and this was highly recommended to me but after a week of use my ears had started to get irritated and red and would really hurt.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to waste a good portion of the product to get that nozzle to function properly.</li>
            <li>I was later introduced to H20 ocean by my piercer at \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; and it quickly healed my belly button.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For my significant other and he his very please</li>
            <li>This contains sea salt and pretty much the same thing as a sea salt bath for your piercing, but a spray version.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for any new piercings.</li>
            <li>but this for newly pierced ears, ears irritated by normal wear or injured ears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of my piercings until I got my right nostril pierced (already have my left)</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li>When i got my first piercing back in 7th grade i started to notice my body did not react well to piercings.</li>
            <li>I bought this for about $16 at Hot Topic and was told by a friend to try Amazon on my next purchase.</li>
            <li>, my package came early!</li>
            <li>Works great, have used on multiple piercings and they have all healed perfectly, no infections or issues at all.  </li>
            <li>and i took out my earrings to clean them and soon the irritation stopped after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>so i would not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive ears like myself.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a solid product that I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>Will this product work on helix piercing that is 1 year old?</li>
            <li>And it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>I learned that I need to press on the bottle to make a dent(quite easy since it&#x27;s not pressurized), and then proceed with pressing on the little blue thing.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>A day or so after using this, I noticed a huge amount of pus coming from my piercing, then no more swelling or redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t use it too many times in one day because it may dry up the skin surrounding the piercing, making movement of the jewelry a little painful.</li>
            <li>I have heard some people say this does not work for them, but considering the whole premise of this spray is healing through trace minerals, it would stand to reason that we all have different levels of these elements and so it would not work the same on everyone.</li>
            <li>My ears are very sensitive and i can only use the highest quality jewelry</li>
            <li>The only flaw: can does not last very long especially if you clean piercings 3x a day.</li>
            <li>bought it for my new belly piercing and it works like a charm it is healing up fast and it only been a few weeks since i started using it and it has cleared up an infection i had.</li>

            <li> I started using this spray and soaking 1x day with sea salt and after 2 weeks ears are much better.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> The top was.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I used this product before and it worked better for me</li>
            <li> Caring for piercings can be time-consuming, but this spray allows you to clean your piercings effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> My belly button was swollen and was becoming infected.</li>
            <li> The product was so good for my new piercing until the top popped of a week into it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it on my awesome new piercing and my daughter&#x27;s newly pierced ears!</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works great for keeping your new or existing piercings clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will continue to use it just to keep my belly button clean.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to use.</li>

            <li> Spray is convenient and comfortable, no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Most of These types of products aren&#x27;t worth buying.its a good idea to clean your ears however home made solutions are just as potent and effective and less costly ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (I spray it on the area and then soak a Qtip and clean the bar)</li>
            <li> and i ordered more right away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> It kept it clean and infection free and it helped it heal faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use regular sea salt water, but with how people are in a hurry a lot these days, sometimes you just need to do things quickly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and then some!</li>
            <li> I just clean it with q tips the times a day with the h2ocean</li>
            <li> My piercing is more sore now than it was before I began using the H2Ocean Spray, and to top it off, I have developed the dreaded nose ring bump.</li>

            <li> Works well and keeps the area clean and sterile.  </li>
            <li> In a nutshell, this is such a great and easy to use product, that it&#x27;s the only thing I will use to keep my piercings clean and healthy.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use, even purechase smaller size to carry with me.</li>
            <li> Overall, so great of a product that I just bought my second bottle of it.</li>
            <li> This product came first...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, wondering what it could do that my antibacterial solution couldn&#x27;t, but I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> The first week I began to use this spray</li>
            <li> I had assumed, since almost all the reviews were absolutely stellar for this product, that it would work miracles.</li>
            <li> I have to say this first</li>
            <li> Exactly what i said.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it&#x27;s helping my nose heal fast!  </li>
            <li> also good for just everyday cleaning.</li>
            <li> but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much</li>
            <li> but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much.</li>
            <li> I took the cap off of the bottle, the spray thing fell off, but easily popped back on.</li>
            <li> GET THE LARGE CAN...</li>
            <li> No infection or allergy issues, just irritated from overly large piercing studs.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> Help I just got it and really want this helix to heal pronto</li>
            <li> Now every piercing i get, i always have my H20 spray ready.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product comes out like water, but you might want to spray twice a day, because you can use this product up fast.</li>
            <li> I ran out so went straight to Amazon and found it...</li>
            <li> much of a hassle for the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I know this is healing fast and</li>
            <li> I really feel like it helps the area heal faster.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> This worked really well for my belly button.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone&#x27;s piercing after care!</li>
            <li> It was also much cheaper from Body Candy than from the piercing place.</li>
            <li> Its take time ,but i do see it does really work</li>
            <li> I really just have it for when my gauged ears get irritated.</li>
            <li> If they ever went out of business I&#x27;d be very upset.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It healed so fast.</li>
            <li> My ears are also very sensitive to pretty much everything, and this spray allows me to wear earrings with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> It really has helped my piercing a lot better than other cleaners I have tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered a smaller can of this product originally and found it so helpful in aiding healing-</li>
            <li> I think this is a better product to use than Dial soap or any other bacterial soap that piercers recommend.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my ears properly and the tapers i used were clean</li>
            <li> I have a newer piercing &amp; only using this product to clean it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed something to clean my earlobes after stretching and this was highly recommended to me but after a week of use my ears had started to get irritated and red and would really hurt.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to waste a good portion of the product to get that nozzle to function properly.</li>
            <li> I was later introduced to H20 ocean by my piercer at \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; and it quickly healed my belly button.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For my significant other and he his very please</li>
            <li> This contains sea salt and pretty much the same thing as a sea salt bath for your piercing, but a spray version.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for any new piercings.</li>
            <li> but this for newly pierced ears, ears irritated by normal wear or injured ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of my piercings until I got my right nostril pierced (already have my left)</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li> When i got my first piercing back in 7th grade i started to notice my body did not react well to piercings.</li>
            <li> I bought this for about $16 at Hot Topic and was told by a friend to try Amazon on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> , my package came early!</li>
            <li> Works great, have used on multiple piercings and they have all healed perfectly, no infections or issues at all.  </li>
            <li> and i took out my earrings to clean them and soon the irritation stopped after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> so i would not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive ears like myself.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a solid product that I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> Will this product work on helix piercing that is 1 year old?</li>
            <li> And it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I learned that I need to press on the bottle to make a dent(quite easy since it&#x27;s not pressurized), and then proceed with pressing on the little blue thing.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> A day or so after using this, I noticed a huge amount of pus coming from my piercing, then no more swelling or redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t use it too many times in one day because it may dry up the skin surrounding the piercing, making movement of the jewelry a little painful.</li>
            <li> I have heard some people say this does not work for them, but considering the whole premise of this spray is healing through trace minerals, it would stand to reason that we all have different levels of these elements and so it would not work the same on everyone.</li>
            <li> My ears are very sensitive and i can only use the highest quality jewelry</li>
            <li> The only flaw: can does not last very long especially if you clean piercings 3x a day.</li>
            <li> bought it for my new belly piercing and it works like a charm it is healing up fast and it only been a few weeks since i started using it and it has cleared up an infection i had.</li>
            <li> Last long also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent countless hours at the wound center at my local hospital.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a lot more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s only good for cleaning my carbarator horrible.</li>
            <li> i mean wow yucky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years and it is an extremely reliable product.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> However this product caused extreme itchiness, swelling, and redness on my daughter&#x27;s ears and face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to tell when the product is empty, but that&#x27;s probably the only downfall.</li>
            <li> About a week and a half after I got it done, I noticed some signs of infection.</li>
            <li> mine has been pierced less than a month.  </li>
            <li> My belly button has less soreness sibce</li>
            <li> I have done probably everything wrong with this piercing from touching it with dirty hands to sleeping on it and it has not been infected at all.  </li>
            <li> It helps eliminate the dried puss and helps alot in the healing process.</li>
            <li> A FEW WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> Only problem was it was broken.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> It really makes me mad</li>
            <li> thanks so much  &amp; sorry for the late review!</li>
            <li> I usually like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> or I am being lazy</li>
            <li> No more than 4 days</li>
            <li> THE SMALL RUNS OUT</li>
            <li> I had a small cut on my leg that was infected.</li>
            <li> And it really is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 4+ bottles</li>
            <li> and it became irritated due to my stupidity and impatience by changing the jewelry prematurely.</li>
            <li> the nozzle was broken</li>
            <li> my earrings that i have had for a couple years started irritating my ears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use this product to spray my ears every time my ears started irritating</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a faulty nozzle but that was frustrating seeing how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> But something went wrong, not sure what, and my ears got badly infected.</li>
            <li> (sounds weird</li>
            <li> H2ocean just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This time, I went to an actual piercer that used a needle instead of some spot in the mall where they used that awful gun.</li>
            <li> I have a weird industrial piercing.</li>
            <li> But I also use it on pimples, cuts, rashes.. anything wrong with my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product, though.</li>
            <li> Like it gets really painful and sore randomly even though I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years.</li>
            <li> The pain is not that bad any longer.</li>
            <li> it tastes bad but it still works in mouth</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the problem I had with this one is it would leak from the base when in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> if you want to avoid and infections or nasty bumps</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best product you can use for the after care of your piercings. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years and it is an extremely reliable product.</li>
            <li> I needed something to clean my earlobes after stretching and this was highly recommended to me but after a week of use my ears had started to get irritated and red and would really hurt. I cleaned my ears properly and the tapers i used were clean so it wasn&#x27;t anything i was doing that made my ears this sore. My ears are very sensitive and i can only use the highest quality jewelry so i would not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive ears like myself.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. Bought one from my piercer, and ordered this when I ran out. This was the same price and twice as big!</li>
            <li> After using a few different sprays, I found this one to be very soothing and non-drying.  The ONLY thing I was not a fan of is the nozzle.  I prefer the nozzles that you can put up into your nose for your piercing (sounds weird I know).. this one I have to sort of angle my head and the nozzle to line up.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a solid product that I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I usually like this product a lot. I have been buying this product for a while and the problem I had with this one is it would leak from the base when in use.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to heal and keep your dermals clean.  I keep one at home and another in my purse.  Great!!</li>
            <li> Works great, have used on multiple piercings and they have all healed perfectly, no infections or issues at all.  Spray is convenient and comfortable, no burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with a piercing kit to pierce my ears... I was so excited to do my first at home piercing! This product came first...I noticed a dent on the top of the tin, didn&#x27;t think too much of it, I had to wait for the piercing kit to come so I figured I was all set, I had everything I needed. The kit arrived yesterday about two weeks after the h2ocean spray arrived . To my discontent, yesterday, I found that the spray won&#x27;t even come out. Now I am stuck using my alcohol prep pads for my aftercare. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cleans my piercing like magic. I bought a 1.5oz bottle from the shop after I got my ears pierced and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about an infection. But the can only lasted 2-3 weeks and I ended up with an infection because I stopped cleaning it. I had to buy another can online that was 4oz and it cleared up my infection right away. The 4oz is much bigger and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Love H2ocean just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Most of These types of products aren&#x27;t worth buying.its a good idea to clean your ears however home made solutions are just as potent and effective and less costly ..</li>
            <li> Will this product work on helix piercing that is 1 year old? Help I just got it and really want this helix to heal pronto</li>
            <li> Best stuff to heal ANYTHING including piercings. I Had 2 microdermals done on my shoulder blades and with the help of H2Ocean its healing super fast!</li>
            <li> I believe all H2Ocean products are pretty amazing, and the piercing aftercare is no exception. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of my piercings until I got my right nostril pierced (already have my left) and it became irritated due to my stupidity and impatience by changing the jewelry prematurely. This aftercare healed it up incredibly quickly and I&#x27;ve had no issues since. I&#x27;ll always recommend any H2Ocean product, as I use their tattoo aftercare as well. Sure it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it and always at a much better price here on Amazon. If you&#x27;ve never tried H2Ocean on a tattoo or piercing, you should definitely give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My lobes love this stuff! 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing for body piercing!</li>
            <li> Worked well at healing the piercing, however, the nozzle gave me troubles. I ended up having to waste a good portion of the product to get that nozzle to function properly. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for that reason. Maybe it was a faulty nozzle but that was frustrating seeing how expensive it is. I wouldn&#x27;t risk purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my gf piercings won&#x27;t say where. It works helped her swelling and pain so she&#x27;s a happy girl.</li>
            <li> Cool idea. However this product caused extreme itchiness, swelling, and redness on my daughter&#x27;s ears and face.</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY sea salt spray to buy in the market. been using it for years. awesome for piercings.</li>
            <li> I have 10 piercings and they have all healed wonderfully with the H20 ocean spray. When i got my first piercing back in 7th grade i started to notice my body did not react well to piercings. My belly button was swollen and was becoming infected. I was later introduced to H20 ocean by my piercer at \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; and it quickly healed my belly button. It helps eliminate the dried puss and helps alot in the healing process. Now every piercing i get, i always have my H20 spray ready.</li>
            <li> I bought this for cleaning my belly button piercing and it works like a charm. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is nothing short of miraculous. I had my ears pierced when I was around 6 and thought it was the coolest thing ever. But something went wrong, not sure what, and my ears got badly infected. Now, almost 20 years later, I decided to try again. This time, I went to an actual piercer that used a needle instead of some spot in the mall where they used that awful gun. About a week and a half after I got it done, I noticed some signs of infection. After doing some research, I found this stuff. I was hesitant at first, wondering what it could do that my antibacterial solution couldn&#x27;t, but I ordered it anyway. A day or so after using this, I noticed a huge amount of pus coming from my piercing, then no more swelling or redness. Now, my ears look like they never had an infection. This spray will draw out an infection quickly and painlessly; it&#x27;s wonderful! My ears are also very sensitive to pretty much everything, and this spray allows me to wear earrings with no discomfort. Worth every penny, and then some!</li>
            <li> The product comes out like water, but you might want to spray twice a day, because you can use this product up fast. Once using it my irritation from the piercing ceased. It does give you the immediate results, but I recommended the Dr. Piercing swab packs and Provon Medicated Lotion Soap if you need extra care.</li>
            <li> Great. I had a piercing done and was given this product. When I am on the go and instead of doing sea salt or I am being lazy I use this. I ran out so went straight to Amazon and found it...Wahoo. great shipping time as well.</li>
            <li> The product is good it just wasnt helping my infection as well as i wanted it too but its a good product to buy it works for somepeople</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every once in a while, and haven&#x27;t gotten any infection yet, hoping it&#x27;ll stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging sucks. I think I used it twice when it came out in a spray/jet combination. The third time I tried to use it, the nozzle was clogged or something because nothing would come out. I have to take the nozzle off and press hard(while pointing downward toward my piercing) to let the product drip off of my fingers. Recently, about 50% of the time, nothing comes out at all. I learned that I need to press on the bottle to make a dent(quite easy since it&#x27;s not pressurized), and then proceed with pressing on the little blue thing.&lt;br /&gt;Too much of a hassle for the price. But then again it could have just been this one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The size it great, though. 4oz will probably last me a couple years before I run out.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> i use this on a belly piercing and a tragus piercing and wonderful item, promotes clean healing.Very easy to use, even purechase smaller size to carry with me.Actually cheaper through amazon.com than local stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this for about $16 at Hot Topic and was told by a friend to try Amazon on my next purchase. Found it here for a great price and it came really fast! No more than 4 days and it was already delivered. It lasts me about a month so $10 a month for this is just great. I will be purchasing my cleaner from here from now on :)</li>
            <li> As a person who has had several new piercings, and have to soak in salt - this is a wonderful solution - quick, easy and NO mess! I highly recommend this product. The vendor, Body Candy, delivered the merchandise in a timely fashion, packed well, and received in as pictured in the ad. Will use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> was very good, came very fast. Works well only needed to use it about five times, would use it again and will tell others about it!</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time. Which is a PLUS. The product itself is seriously AMAZING!! I was at risk of forming scar tissue by the piercing on my belly. There was a bump there and it just was not healing. The first week I began to use this spray I instantly seen results and now my piercing is healing perfectly :) I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can truly say this is an awesome product.  I have done probably everything wrong with this piercing from touching it with dirty hands to sleeping on it and it has not been infected at all.  I just clean it with q tips the times a day with the h2ocean and I have no problems at all.  I know this is healing fast and mine has been pierced less than a month.  I did the sea salt soaks prior  to this and I was sore alot. But this product has done wonders.  I just clean it with hot water on q tips and then the h2ocean.  NO problem.</li>
            <li> This H20cean Piercing Aftercare Spray 40z. is very good you can use this or regular sea salt. but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is prefect for the healing process just a quick spray 3-5 a day and your done. I really love it! I can&#x27;t wait to order more of it.</li>
            <li> I literally use this for all 6 of my piercings and I adore it!! My belly button has less soreness sibce ive been using it and my new ear piercings have been doing nicely!! Recoomend!!!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 sprays but 2 of them didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I always buy this stuff for my piercings. It&#x27;s great to use regular sea salt water, but with how people are in a hurry a lot these days, sometimes you just need to do things quickly. That&#x27;s what this good for; it takes seconds rather than minutes</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  It cleans, disinfects, and keeps my piercings well managed.  Never have to worry about infections when I use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I highly recommend it!!!! I really feel like it helps the area heal faster. The pain is not that bad any longer.</li>
            <li> I had assumed, since almost all the reviews were absolutely stellar for this product, that it would work miracles. Ah, not so. Not for me anyway. My piercing is more sore now than it was before I began using the H2Ocean Spray, and to top it off, I have developed the dreaded nose ring bump. Live and learn, I suppose. I had been in search of a quicker care regiment, but I&#x27;ll be going back to the 5 minute sea salt soaks that my piercer recommended. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product, though. It seems that for some people it works wonderfully. I&#x27;m just not one of those people!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend! Works like a charm for an infected piercing!</li>
            <li> I love love love H2Ocean, I have used it with all my piercings and it works wonders. All my piercings have healed quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> I  use this stuff all the time. It works really well and I have had no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> I recently got my belly button pierced and was concerned about the tenderness and redness that was around my piercing weeks later. This product help reduce redness and keep my fresh piercing clean. I swear it accelerated healing time. It&#x27;s great on sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t use it too many times in one day because it may dry up the skin surrounding the piercing, making movement of the jewelry a little painful. In a nutshell, this is such a great and easy to use product, that it&#x27;s the only thing I will use to keep my piercings clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I used this before on my tongue piercing worked great, purchased it again for my industrial and worked great. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a lot more bang for your buck. Still worth it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who has a piercing!!!&lt;br /&gt;It us awesome and easy to use. It helps the piercing heal faster!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any tatoos. It works and heals my earring soreness and takes the redness away pronto.  Great Great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has piercings and this worked wonders with cleaning her belly button ring and keeping it from getting infected.</li>
            <li> Caring for piercings can be time-consuming, but this spray allows you to clean your piercings effectively and efficiently. I would recommend spraying some of the solution on a Q-tip and cleaning them that way from time to time, especially if you wear make-up, use thicker creams, or use hair products. The only flaw: can does not last very long especially if you clean piercings 3x a day.</li>
            <li> Healed my belly piercing</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works great!! My belly button got infected and I used it for a week and the infection was gone!! I love this product and I will continue to use it just to keep my belly button clean.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I have a newer piercing &amp; only using this product to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;No redness or soreness ...my last piercing got infected and Drs told me to use&lt;br /&gt;Disinfecting stuff on it...never healed until I was on antibiotics for another reason.&lt;br /&gt;JUST USE THIS PRODUCT DAILY. GET THE LARGE CAN...THE SMALL RUNS OUT&lt;br /&gt;IN A FEW WEEKS.  Im an RN with lots of experience in wound care. This product&lt;br /&gt;Helps prevent infections without killing your own immune system off that you&lt;br /&gt;Need to heal properly!</li>
            <li> As others said, great for piercings!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> This worked really well for my belly button. It kept it clean and infection free and it helped it heal faster.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It shipped really quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it on my awesome new piercing and my daughter&#x27;s newly pierced ears!</li>
            <li> came like two days later, i would recommend this to everyone who feels like their piercing is getting infected this stuff clears it away quickly like magic! thanks so much  &amp; sorry for the late review!</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works great for keeping your new or existing piercings clean. I highly recommend this for anyone&#x27;s piercing after care!</li>
            <li> This H20cean Piercing Aftercare Spray 40z. is very good you can use this or regular sea salt. but this is good also the right amount comes not to little or to much.</li>
            <li> very good spray, it takes away any inflammation and cleans very well. also good for just everyday cleaning. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. It really has helped my piercing a lot better than other cleaners I have tried. It also arrived very quickly! Within 4 days! I recommend this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> GREAT for my nose piercing when I used it!</li>
            <li> This product works really well and is quick and easy to use. It was also much cheaper from Body Candy than from the piercing place.</li>
            <li> For my significant other and he his very please</li>
            <li> Loved it. I use this stuff on all my piercings and recommend it to everyone I know. If you have a fresh piercing, please do your body a favor and get this.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I was into the 5th week of healing and my ears became irritated. No infection or allergy issues, just irritated from overly large piercing studs. I started using this spray and soaking 1x day with sea salt and after 2 weeks ears are much better. I recommend no one use anything but this for newly pierced ears, ears irritated by normal wear or injured ears.</li>
            <li> The best thing you can by for you piercings honestly. I have my nose and my belly button. if you want to avoid and infections or nasty bumps you this religiously. Also good for helping infections if you&#x27;re not already using it</li>
            <li> I have to say this first but im the dummy that did it. I tryied to use it on my tongue peircing as i acidently tore it and eeeewww it tastes bad but it still works in mouth i mean wow yucky XD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my new belly piercing and it works like a charm it is healing up fast and it only been a few weeks since i started using it and it has cleared up an infection i had.</li>
            <li> I used it for my snake bites and it worked amazingly, you won&#x27;t regret buying this at all, its perfect product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this product for her healing ear and it was easy to use. Well worth it I would say</li>
            <li> Exactly what i said. nothing but problems when i bought this product, It&#x27;s only good for cleaning my carbarator horrible.</li>
            <li> I still re- order this to clean my industrial piercing. Great for any piercing.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this because I read many great reviews on it. Although I read a review about the can breaking, I thought &amp;#34;oh it won&#x27;t happen to me, it was just one person&amp;#34;, and bought it anyways. The product was so good for my new piercing until the top popped of a week into it. It really makes me mad that i wasted this amount of money on a great product but I can&#x27;t even use it anymore. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I ordered a smaller can of this product originally and found it so helpful in aiding healing- that I ordered a second, larger can for home use and kept the smaller can for travel.  I highly recommend this product for any new piercings.</li>
            <li> Love this! great for piercings</li>
            <li> I have used this since I started my piercing problem,which began like 7 years ago. I have heard some people say this does not work for them, but considering the whole premise of this spray is healing through trace minerals, it would stand to reason that we all have different levels of these elements and so it would not work the same on everyone.</li>
            <li> the nozzle was broken</li>
            <li> my earrings that i have had for a couple years started irritating my ears.  I&#x27;d use this product to spray my ears every time my ears started irritating and i took out my earrings to clean them and soon the irritation stopped after about a week and a half. guess this product isn&#x27;t just good for the ears, but cleaning your earrings as well. worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nose ring aftercare! It&#x27;s quality spray for a great price and got here super quick! I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I loooove this stuff. I have a weird industrial piercing. Like it gets really painful and sore randomly even though I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years. It gives me a lot of problems. But I just use H2ocean on it now every night and it keeps the soreness to a minimum. I probably woukve ripped my piercing out by now if I weren&#x27;t for this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Works like a charm. I recommend it for anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Only problem was it was broken. The top was.&lt;br /&gt;But it healed my piercings and that&#x27;s what I needed!</li>
            <li> Its take time ,but i do see it does really work</li>
            <li> An amazing product. I am a diabetic and any cut on my leg gets infected. I&#x27;ve spent countless hours at the wound center at my local hospital. I had a small cut on my leg that was infected. I heard about H2Ocean from a friend. After the third day my leg started healing! It ia an amazing product and I will use it for all my wounds!</li>
            <li> this product didnt do anything for me...felt like i was spraying tap water from my faucet...no umph to it at all!!!...i do not reccomend this product...my piercing looked and remained the same...dont waste your money</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic!  I had my nose peirced, and it felt like it might get infected.  I used this product and it&#x27;s helping my nose heal fast!  Buy this product to treat any piercings, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> My belly piercing was red and I was unsure why as I have been cleaning it with antibacterial soap and the likes 2-3x daily. It wasn&#x27;t infected, but it was still red, and it made me nervous as I didn&#x27;t want it to eventually become infected. I remembered my piercer told me about this product so I thought I&#x27;d try it out... and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;ve bought at least 4+ bottles and I will always come back to this product. The redness has disappeared and my piercing has healed perfectly. I think this is a better product to use than Dial soap or any other bacterial soap that piercers recommend. It&#x27;s easy to use (I spray it on the area and then soak a Qtip and clean the bar) and you can use it multiple times a day. It&#x27;s a little hard to tell when the product is empty, but that&#x27;s probably the only downfall. This contains sea salt and pretty much the same thing as a sea salt bath for your piercing, but a spray version.</li>
            <li> helped clean and heal my ears after I gauged them</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this product.  I have ordered it probably 3 times now.  Works well and keeps the area clean and sterile.  Last long also.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I bought it along with a piercing kit. I used this product after piercing my own belly button and after using this I haven&#x27;t had one infection. Overall, so great of a product that I just bought my second bottle of it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good. And it seems to be working so far. The bottle is bigger than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it four stars, however, because when I received the package, it was ripped. Who knows why bit could&#x27;ve been the mail mans fault.&lt;br /&gt;When I took the cap off of the bottle, the spray thing fell off, but easily popped back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. It really is amazing. It works on anything. Not just piercings. I really just have it for when my gauged ears get irritated. But I also use it on pimples, cuts, rashes.. anything wrong with my skin. And it really is unbelievable. If they ever went out of business I&#x27;d be very upset.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my package came early!</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing. I got both ears cartlidge pierced and they were red and sore after sleeping on them so I bought this after a week they were not red and no longer sore. I still use should I catch the earrings on anything or if I feel like it.</li>
            <li> Convenient, effective.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT MANY  TIMES AN WILL BUY MORE ,GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this spray so much. Used it on my lip ring and it cured the swelling. It healed so fast. I jusy got my eye brow pierced and i ordered more right away. A must have</li>
            <li> Great way to keep piercings clean! Works like a charm. Feels soothing and good, too.</li>
            <li> works great. doesnt burn and it helped heal my eyebrow ring when it got infected. would deff buy again if needed</li>
            <li> I used this product before and it worked better for me then a wound wash i had purchased. The infection went away</li>
    </ol>
