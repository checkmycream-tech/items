            <li> This conditioner significantly reduced the amount of breakage I usually get during detangling. It smells good and softens the hair which makes it more managable.</li>
            <li> great leave in conditioner, leaves hair soft and give it a shine. All you need is a little, because it may leave a white residue on hair. I used it on roller setting my hair have not tried yet when blowing drying. great product love Keracare.</li>
            <li> awesome product is very good my wife is now chossing to use it as well. some thing to take on vacation</li>
            <li> Provides great moisture and heat protection. I use it in conjunction with Keracare Shampoo and Humecto Cr√®me Conditioner. Leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, my hair will feel great!  For dry hair, I recommend Leaves hair super soft and very manageable. Great!!!</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair has really improved since using this leave in conditioner. So glad I found it. I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the conditioner. It keeps my hair soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> Love Keracare products!! Detangles, does what it says.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this leave-in! It makes my hair extremely soft and moisturized with a lot of movement. I have had 3 other people try this product and it does the same for them. I have to buy the large bottle because my friends come to my house to use mine when theirs run out (we can only find the very small bottle in the stores).</li>
            <li> the formula has changed.  it feels waxy and think vs. conditioner like. Not sure this product is legit. Will have to go to sally&#x27;s to get the type I&#x27;m used used with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this conditioner since a friend recommended it to me, and its about $8.00 more at the hair supply store for a 16oz size, So I was happy to see it on Amazon for only $20.00.</li>
            <li> I love this leave n cond. It leaves my hair so soft and healthy. I will continue to use. Keracare is a fantastic hair line.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. It leaves my hair soft, healthy looking and easy to comb. I will shampoo my hair with the keracare detangling hydration shampoo then apply this leave in conditioner. This leave in conditioner is all you need because it&#x27;s a 3 in 1 conditioner which can be waxy if using another conditioner after shampooing. This happen no matter if you wash out the conditioner and apply this leave in conditioner your hair will be waxy feeling. It a good product.....I recommend buying it</li>
            <li> I started using Keracare products 10 years ago.  I love the leave-in conditioner.  It has a great smell.</li>
