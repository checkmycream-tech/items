            <li>these are nice and pack well.</li>
            <li>This kind is wonderfully refreshing, and the towelettes are a nice size.</li>
            <li>So refreshing, love the smell!</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, and did not set off any skin reactions with my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I have introduced many to the brand and this product.</li>
            <li>I am buying more.</li>
            <li>Love them .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if burning means enzymes working?</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my skin is in better condition than when I started.</li>
            <li>(i like the nelson&#x27;s stuff better).</li>
            <li>but you are suppose to be able to leave it on to let the toner set it.</li>
            <li>and they get most of the job done, but</li>
            <li>also, they&#x27;re a lot drier than most wipes, which threw me off a lot.</li>
            <li>So everyone is right about the smell and what its good about taking off.</li>
            <li>I am very excited I tried this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Nice clean, not perfumie smell to it.</li>
            <li>They clean effectively.</li>
            <li>great product, easy, fast, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It feels nice clean fresh and smells fantastic would definitely buy again â™¥</li>
            <li>They do a great job at removing makeup and do not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but does not work very well on waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>smelled great, large size, and a decent count</li>
            <li>I have tried many other towelettes to remove makeup, and haven&#x27;t been happy with the feel or performance.</li>
            <li>Love this product very much and hope Alba never stops making them.</li>
            <li>I am changing my original review which is below...</li>
            <li>Gentle and great for my combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The seller is great, but the towelettes are to dry, they do not remove make up or even make you feel like you washed your face.</li>
            <li>Skin is clean and feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>These facial wipes are pleasant enough; they smell like pineapple and they feel good on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love what they DON&#x27;T have in them, ingredients-wise, and I love Alba products in general.</li>
            <li>I notice when I use these at night instead of doing my full routine</li>
            <li>Luckily I wiped my face before I hop in the shower so that rinsed away the sticky feeling</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the towellettes and the scent is subtle but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It may give me a burning sensation, but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of getting all my makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my combination skin at all, or leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok as a cleanser, but other products work better on my skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really fell like these clean all that well either.</li>
            <li>I hope this product keeps being available, and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is good with foundation but little more difficult with eye make-up</li>
            <li>I love alba beauty products and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li>On nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face, this is such an awesome alternative.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a convenient cleansing towelette to help me stick to a nighttime routine, I&#x27;ve never been really strict about taking all my makeup off before bed!</li>
            <li>Overall, 3. :)</li>
            <li>The Alba Natural 3-in-1 Clean Towellettes are divine.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t dry at all though, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been using these in the first place, they would probably be great for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great cleaning product with out irritating the your face.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and they do remove all make up.</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I like them better than the other brand of wipes that start with an &#x27;N.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I work out several times a week and use these wipes to clean off my sweat at the end of my workouts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was replacing a more expensive Clinique eye make up remover, and found that the Alba 3 in 1 are a much more economic substitute.</li>
            <li>If you do use face wipes, this brand should be at least near the very top of your list.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove mascara either, but it was waterproof mascara, so not too surprised there,</li>
            <li>They work well for my arms though, sounds weird, but they make my arms feel and look very nice and leave a great smell behind for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>These worked fairly well - I just felt they were a little dryer than usual.</li>
            <li>These are my go to for make up removed and fast cleanse after a long work day.</li>
            <li>Many of them have some kind of nasty fragrance, and I always need to wash off the stuff that stays on my face after using them.</li>
            <li>If you have dry and/or mature skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you have dry and/or mature skin</li>
            <li> I love the Alba line, but these wipes are disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I keep them in my gym bag, and as long as I reseal  them, the wipes stay moist.</li>
            <li> These remove makeup well and don&#x27;t leave anything behind other than clean skin.</li>
            <li> However, my face feels slightly sticky after use, and just not deep cleaned, although they DO NOT CAUSE BREAKOUTS.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase simply because of breakouts due to the fact that they don&#x27;t clean everything as it claims :(</li>
            <li> Although, after finished cleaning I noticed my face felt sticky... and well, not very clean.</li>
            <li> I hate feeling sticky so it is all about what you are focused more on I suppose.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s actually a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Have also found at Target in store, but they are usually out of stock.</li>
            <li> Does not remove mascara hardly at all</li>
            <li> Probably NOT a good product for anyone who is allergic to pineapple....</li>
            <li> It is especially disappointing as far as getting mascara and eyeliner off</li>
            <li> But, they leave a weird oily residue on my face</li>
            <li> Awful scent, not tropical at all...left my face sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not that good for the price...</li>
            <li> I love these! I have introduced many to the brand and this product. Cleans without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove makeup that well.</li>
            <li> this product feels amazing on my skin. It feels nice clean fresh and smells fantastic would definitely buy again â™¥</li>
            <li> I work out several times a week and use these wipes to clean off my sweat at the end of my workouts. I DO NOT like smells but these are not offensive. I cannot comment on the ability to remove make up since I use them for another purpose. The thickness is good. I can wipe my face and the wipe does not tear or rip. I keep them in my gym bag, and as long as I reseal  them, the wipes stay moist. I am buying more. I like them better than the other brand of wipes that start with an &#x27;N.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The wipes have a delicious smell that relaxes me but they don&#x27;t remove waterproof mascara or eyeliner. They do remove foundation wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love alba beauty products and this one is no different.  I love the texture of the towellettes and the scent is subtle but pleasant.  It removes all my makeup with ease.  I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> Great cleaning product with out irritating the your face. Nice clean, not perfumie smell to it. I use this camping.</li>
            <li> I love the Alba line, but these wipes are disappointing.  I&#x27;d have to use two of these to get all the makeup off of my face (and no, I don&#x27;t pancake it on).  It is especially disappointing as far as getting mascara and eyeliner off (I use a liquid eyeliner).</li>
            <li> These are only so-so for me.  Does not remove mascara hardly at all and I do not use waterproof.  I don&#x27;t really fell like these clean all that well either.</li>
            <li> These are great.  My face feels softer after using; I don&#x27;t experience any of the &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling that sometimes happens.  The scent is mild, and did not set off any skin reactions with my fair skin.  Probably NOT a good product for anyone who is allergic to pineapple....</li>
            <li> I saw these on Kathie Lee and Hoda and gave them a shot.  Love them .  On nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face, this is such an awesome alternative.  Great great product.  Have also found at Target in store, but they are usually out of stock.</li>
            <li> I am changing my original review which is below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these for a few weeks, my skin looks soooo much smoother. It may give me a burning sensation, but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original...&lt;br /&gt;Smells great but my skin burns after....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if burning means enzymes working? Skin looks good but won&#x27;t keep using.</li>
            <li> These are my go to for make up removed and fast cleanse after a long work day. I love the smell and feel. Also, they keep my skin tone nice with the fruit acids. Gentle and great for my combination, sensitive skin. I love this line!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin refreshed and smooth , it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are gentle and they do remove all make up. I wear waterproof mascara and eyeliner and these wipes can remove that. I have sensitive skin and was replacing a more expensive Clinique eye make up remover, and found that the Alba 3 in 1 are a much more economic substitute.</li>
            <li> These worked fairly well - I just felt they were a little dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> Good face cleaner when you don&#x27;t have time to wash with water. I wish they were wetter.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes!  They do a great job at removing makeup and do not dry out my face.</li>
            <li> These facial wipes are pleasant enough; they smell like pineapple and they feel good on your skin. However, my face feels slightly sticky after use, and just not deep cleaned, although they DO NOT CAUSE BREAKOUTS. I don&#x27;t use them to take off makeup (i need about 3 pounds of steel wool and some turpentine to do that job), but I use them on makeupless days to freshen up my oil prone face, and they do work well for that. I love what they DON&#x27;T have in them, ingredients-wise, and I love Alba products in general. If you do use face wipes, this brand should be at least near the very top of your list.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a convenient cleansing towelette to help me stick to a nighttime routine, I&#x27;ve never been really strict about taking all my makeup off before bed! I feel like I&#x27;ve struck gold with this product! It does a pretty good job of getting all my makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my combination skin at all, or leave an oily residue. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I feel like my skin is in better condition than when I started. I am very excited I tried this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> Awesome for quick freshen up!! Love them!!</li>
            <li> good for traveling as it doesn&#x27;t involve liquids &amp; i can take it in my carry-on. it&#x27;s ok as a cleanser, but other products work better on my skin (i like the nelson&#x27;s stuff better).</li>
            <li> These smell amazing! But, they leave a weird oily residue on my face that&#x27;s actually a little sticky. My skin isn&#x27;t dry at all though, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been using these in the first place, they would probably be great for people with dry skin. Didn&#x27;t remove mascara either, but it was waterproof mascara, so not too surprised there, haha... They work well for my arms though, sounds weird, but they make my arms feel and look very nice and leave a great smell behind for a few minutes. So for my face, like 2 stars, for my arms, 4 stars. Overall, 3. :)</li>
            <li> So everyone is right about the smell and what its good about taking off. It smells great and is good with foundation but little more difficult with eye make-up (you should use eye make-up remover anyways). I also felt a tingle while wiping that some might consider &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;. Although, after finished cleaning I noticed my face felt sticky... and well, not very clean. Luckily I wiped my face before I hop in the shower so that rinsed away the sticky feeling but you are suppose to be able to leave it on to let the toner set it. I hate feeling sticky so it is all about what you are focused more on I suppose.</li>
            <li> great product, easy, fast, clean and refreshing. I would definitely recommend this product, my kids like it as well. Smells good too</li>
            <li> Nice product, but does not work very well on waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> The seller is great, but the towelettes are to dry, they do not remove make up or even make you feel like you washed your face.</li>
            <li> The Alba Natural 3-in-1 Clean Towellettes are divine. Skin is clean and feels refreshed. Love this product very much and hope Alba never stops making them. If you have dry and/or mature skin this product if perfect for you.</li>
            <li> good and they get most of the job done, but I notice when I use these at night instead of doing my full routine i DO wake up with breakouts. also, they&#x27;re a lot drier than most wipes, which threw me off a lot. smelled great, large size, and a decent count but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase simply because of breakouts due to the fact that they don&#x27;t clean everything as it claims :(</li>
            <li> Awful scent, not tropical at all...left my face sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not use the remainder of them and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. This item is great. Works very well. Thank you for a nice transaction.</li>
            <li> So refreshing, love the smell! Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> These remove makeup well and don&#x27;t leave anything behind other than clean skin. I have tried many other towelettes to remove makeup, and haven&#x27;t been happy with the feel or performance. Many of them have some kind of nasty fragrance, and I always need to wash off the stuff that stays on my face after using them. This kind is wonderfully refreshing, and the towelettes are a nice size. I use towelettes to remove makeup because I don&#x27;t like the way makeup stays in washcloths. Another use for these towelettes is to remove makup from clothing before washing. I don&#x27;t use a lot of makup, but sometimes it rubs off on my collar. So I agree - I hope this product keeps being available, and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great on removing makeup. feel good on the skin.</li>
            <li> these are nice and pack well. They clean effectively. I have to use 2 to get rid of all of my mascara - but I do wear waterproof, so it is more difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> My wife uses Lancome Tonique Radiance and after trying this product she was still able to remove a remarkable amount of makeup with the Lancome product. It was good to try this product but I should of only bought one not two.</li>
