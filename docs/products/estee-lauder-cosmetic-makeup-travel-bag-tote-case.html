            <li> was a gift, the right color and design for a young adult. received exactly what was stated and pictured</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! It&#x27;s big, spacious, shiny, AND it&#x27;s PURPLE!!!xD. I like the snake skin theme on it :). I&#x27;ve been trying to look for a new, decent makeup bag, and this one caught my eye. I lost my old one in a travel luggage this summer with ALL my makeup :(. But alas, I am rising up again. I have halfway filled this with eyeliners, lipsticks, lipgloss, mascara, curling lash, you name it, and there&#x27;s still more room :D. It comes in handy as I used to just put all my makeup in my purse, and that was a bit of trouble :/. Now tho, thanks to this Estee Lauder makeup bag (and you can use it for anything else other than makeup) that came to my likes, I have no trouble at all anymore. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love my makeup bag! It&#x27;s small but fits soooo much stuff in it.</li>
            <li> Great color its very sturdy looks very expensive its also very spacious you won&#x27;t be able to carry it in your purse if its not at least medium sized, overall I love it</li>

            <li> This bag was very stiff.  It&#x27;s very hard to work with. I&#x27;m not going to use this bag. No wonder it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Shiny, and print just like shown in the picture ! A little smaller than I thought, but can hold all of my eye makeup nicely</li>
            <li> No complaints about this Makeup bag. It&#x27;s big enough for travel and it&#x27;s roomy enough for personal sanitation products. It gets the job done, It&#x27;s name brand, It&#x27;s a nice design, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very small, would be good for a larger purse, has a lot of room. It&#x27;s name brand,  practical, affordable and pretty. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It is so big...i love it! beatiful colors</li>
            <li> Nice to have a purple bag to go with my many purple ensembles.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves purple and this is a very nice trael makeup bag. Just the right size to fit in a handbag.</li>
            <li> i love this bag its perfect i thought it was going to b cheap but it wasnt i hold heavy stuff in it and it does wonderful holding my stuff in</li>
            <li> I purchased the Estee Lauder Purple Makeup and Brush Bag. Such a great cosmetic bag, and I love the color ! Delivery took a little longer than I expected though.</li>
            <li> I like this case. I use it to hold some of my waxing supplies. Plus purple and black are my two favorite colors so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t judge the size, and it was actually bigger than I needed, but that was my fault. I gave it to my daughter who carries one of those huge purses, and she loved it!</li>
            <li> not even close to the picture, but its still cute.</li>
            <li> I choose it because it said purple make up and brush bag. I thought it came with something besides just the bag. Which it does not. There wording is wrong. It is pretty, but I would not have bought it alone like it was. I thought I was getting something else. It is not small , but actually medium size and can fit quite a bit. It came in time  .</li>
            <li> It is large enough to fit all my makeup in.  Will not fit in a small purse as it is a large bag.</li>
            <li> When I looked at the pouch on the site I loved the color and the material. When I received it, I was very happy as it was the same as shown in the picture. I am using this for a couple of weeks now and I am loving it. I actually holds a lot of stuff and stays in its rectangular shape and stands well in my purse. Planning to buy a couple more to give it as gift.</li>
            <li> Its plastic... But it does the job</li>
            <li> love the color and its bigger than it looks i love the color Too!!! Im a name brand lover !</li>
            <li> bought this for sons girl friend who loves purple this is a nice bag ,holds a lot and this is pretty big this bag would work best with bigger hand bags perfect for her easy to clean just wipe with damp cloth .Zipper is not an issue works fine.Great price for Estee Lauder brand and seller is great arrived in just a few days!</li>
            <li> It was cute and my friend like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old niece and filled it with Make Up Essentials ....Brush , Eye Shadows , Blush , Lip Gloss , etc. It holds quite a bit , easy to keep clean and attractive . Nice product</li>
            <li> Nice size. Fits all my stuff in it with room to spare. Can find it in my purse with ease. Nice color too. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Go old school with Estée.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love the bag! Color,style unique the chicness . I can&#x27;t fit as much make up for a full application. Which includes liquid foundation, blush, eyebrow shadow, lipstick, bronzers, highlighters,concealers, even my eyelash curler and brushes.</li>
