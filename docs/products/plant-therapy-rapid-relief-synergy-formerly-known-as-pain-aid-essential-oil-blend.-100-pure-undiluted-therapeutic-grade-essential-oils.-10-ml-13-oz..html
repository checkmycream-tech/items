    <ol>
            <li>but once you dilute it, it blends perfectly with the Muscle Aid.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest</li>
            <li>but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Very happy I did!</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>I use this on my feet for my plantar fasciitis and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great blend for arthritis and muscle pain.</li>
            <li>It smells great (not too medicinal) and is so convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>This Pain Aid synergy is amazing!  </li>
            <li>They are a good company with great customer service.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>soothes aching joints, pleasant to the senses, helps me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep, recommend it also as a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I always buy things that have good reviews.</li>
            <li>am not a health nut, nor am I one to write  reviews or opinions for every product I use, but the way I used this product did me a world of good.  </li>
            <li>Nice blend with a great smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is almost &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have this as a very effective alternative.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I used it on my aching knuckles and it felt amazing.</li>
            <li>but it works nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of creams and patches for my Osteoarthritis pain in my hips, knees, and lower legs that have been moderately effective for the pain, but not cost effective for my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li>Instead of smelling like wintergreen, this oil smells a bit spicy and warms the skin gradually and quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending promptly and boxed very nicely!</li>
            <li>What a great and useful oil synergy!</li>
            <li>Many products don&#x27;t even have an effect at all, so I&#x27;m very satisfied that it worked even temporarily.  </li>
            <li>They shipped the product very quick and good service.</li>
            <li>you put peppermint and wintergreen on before it&#x27;s more amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue to order more. :)</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Not only is it very pleasantly scented, but it is effective.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff&lt;br</li>
            <li>After buying this oil I have since bought several more oils from plant therapy and have been very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this product instead of more drug therapy or knee replacement surgery.  </li>
            <li>We love this oil....</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my headaches and shoulders.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I think the scent is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>but it has made a fabulous difference in my life!</li>
            <li>I used this product and thought it might work since the smell was so potent.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all I got out of it - a potent smell.</li>
            <li>and I was able to obtain a restful nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better and better</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell so much that I made a body butter with this oil.  </li>
            <li>shipment arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it seems fine once diluted.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I am still pain free.</li>
            <li>My husband also had great results when he pulled his back.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price yet effective.</li>
            <li>Very rarely...</li>
            <li>I will be buying a couple more bottles mainly for my mom!</li>
            <li>Retired senior having tried many products, works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much like the Muscle-Aide, we love this one.</li>
            <li>you buy this product, be sure that you really like the smell of clove.</li>
            <li>The quality and customer service are great, and the prices are extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>Aid Synergy works well, as I feel the pain dissipating quickly</li>
            <li>I normally use Biofreeze as muscle rub, so I&#x27;m fine with a strong menthol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better yet, it lasted for several hours, even in the places I have the most chronic and tender pain</li>
            <li>It helps to calm the pain.</li>
            <li>Wintergreen can be a powerful pain reliever, but it works like Aspirin and can &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; the blood.</li>
            <li>I have some arthritic pain in my right thumb</li>
            <li>This small bottle does a great job, on pain from arthritis.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is pleasant, unlike Icy Hot and things like that that smell very chemical and linger on your clothing after use.</li>
            <li>What really made me take notice was how I slept through the night - the first night!</li>
            <li>This really works for me!  </li>
            <li>My first purchase did not include a carrier oil, but this time I&#x27;m getting the coconut oil as a carrier.  </li>
            <li>only 52 had many replacements already.</li>
            <li>This was my first plant theraphy oil I purchased.  </li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite blends of essential oils for joint pain.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li>BioFreeze is nice but after 20 minutes the icy hot feeling is worn off, the reality is that the pain hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li>The first application of Pain Aid was absolutely amazing, within 30 minutes of application the pulsing sharp pain in my hip was gone</li>
            <li>I bought this based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I first used a carrier oil but after that applied it straight to the skin</li>
            <li>If I continue to have such positive results, I believe you have a loyal customer for this product!</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li>And, with the surgery, there is a large percentage something will go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil, though it may seem a little strong for some people, just knowing this is an all natural product is reassuring.</li>
            <li>The Pain Aid is really just scented like cinnamon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had much luck with cinnamon oil in the bath.</li>
            <li>I really like this blend</li>
            <li>Like anything else, what works for one may not work for another, but I am very thankful for this and also the roll-</li>
            <li>This stuff really does help my arthritis joint pain.  </li>
            <li>I was sort of waiting for a warming effect, but instead got a very soothing cooling effect instead.</li>
            <li>I did not put a whole lot of faith in it working...</li>
            <li>I thought it might just be a fluke that I must not have punished it as much the day before.</li>
            <li>Mixing with the Copaiba really boosts the quickness and strength of this oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My family almost all carry a genetic blood disorder and must be careful about products that &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;, so none of us are able to use any blends that contain Wintergreen.</li>
            <li>It gets warm and within a few minutes I am feeling relief.  </li>
            <li>Well, unbelievably, this has helped me more than anything!  </li>
            <li>The smell of clove and other oils is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it turned out that it significantly helped his spouse&#x27;s pain and helped to gain flexibility in the affected muscles and joints, during his weekly sessions in physical therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I also practice yoga and meditation, I became familiar with the use of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I use this full strength (may be too intense for some because it should be diluted), and just rub it into my lower back, and hip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not long lasting, but I have not found many products that are.  </li>
            <li>This oil particularly has help me with my feet/achilles pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY Recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can go all day with shoes on and the pain so far is GONE!!</li>
            <li>I got this to compare between Young Living&#x27;s Panaway, and Edens Garden&#x27;s Muscle Relief and this did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>This oil is the only thing that calm his pains.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
            <li>Normally I would use Aspercreme and it would ease the pain, but I am trying to eliminate manmade chemicals from my body.</li>
            <li>The common scents that I use are: bergamont, patchouli, rose, lavender and citrus.</li>
            <li>So use this with caution and test out a small amount of diluted oil on the inside of your elbow to make sure the cinnamon oil does not cause any reaction.</li>
            <li>she tells me it works better for her back pain and arthritis than Icy Hot, Tiger Balm, Bio Freeze, or any other over the counter creams and ointments she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>I use this Pain-Aid EO mixed with Bay Laurel in a 1oz dropper bottle, to make a very concentrated synergy blend,using apricot or coconut carrier oils; I would say it&#x27;s nearly a 50/50 blend, meaning 25% Pain-Aid, 25% Bay Laurel and 50% carrier oil-  </li>
            <li>you can see his veins popping up and showing clearly.</li>
            <li>I will Stick with Eden&#x27;s Garden and Young Livioilsng oi</li>
            <li>she uses a few drops every night, massages into her hands, fingers and knuckles and is virtually pain free.</li>
            <li>This oil really helps with my deep aching pains.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse...and my back and shoulders get hurt almost very week at work in some way.  </li>
            <li>When he woke up this morning (typically he is even more stiff after sleeping whether or not he gets a massage), he had absolutely no knots in his shoulders, his back was more relaxed and the pain there</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it remained a very potent smell.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an almost immediate relief and though it doesn&#x27;t last forever, and during the long duration of up to 5hrs, there is some slight irritation vs pain, I love it.</li>
            <li>After starting a new workout routine, my shoulders were killing me.</li>
            <li>Bought it 3rd time so far.</li>
            <li>I especially like this blend as opposed to PanAway by Young Living since it does NOT contain Wintergreen.</li>
            <li>I am 65 yrs old vegetarian who avoids the use of medication as much as possible for my joint &amp; arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li>After cutting it down with my favorite unscented lotion, I applied it to my skin and within maybe an hour, I felt my sore joints starting to loosen up and the pain starting to get better.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer in essential oils from plants and this product seems to have the right blend.  </li>

            <li> it turned out that it significantly helped his spouse&#x27;s pain and helped to gain flexibility in the affected muscles and joints, during his weekly sessions in physical therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I also practice yoga and meditation, I became familiar with the use of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use this full strength (may be too intense for some because it should be diluted), and just rub it into my lower back, and hip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not long lasting, but I have not found many products that are.  </li>
            <li> This oil particularly has help me with my feet/achilles pain.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can go all day with shoes on and the pain so far is GONE!!</li>
            <li> I got this to compare between Young Living&#x27;s Panaway, and Edens Garden&#x27;s Muscle Relief and this did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> This oil is the only thing that calm his pains.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Normally I would use Aspercreme and it would ease the pain, but I am trying to eliminate manmade chemicals from my body.</li>
            <li> The common scents that I use are: bergamont, patchouli, rose, lavender and citrus.</li>
            <li> So use this with caution and test out a small amount of diluted oil on the inside of your elbow to make sure the cinnamon oil does not cause any reaction.</li>
            <li> she tells me it works better for her back pain and arthritis than Icy Hot, Tiger Balm, Bio Freeze, or any other over the counter creams and ointments she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I use this Pain-Aid EO mixed with Bay Laurel in a 1oz dropper bottle, to make a very concentrated synergy blend,using apricot or coconut carrier oils; I would say it&#x27;s nearly a 50/50 blend, meaning 25% Pain-Aid, 25% Bay Laurel and 50% carrier oil-  </li>
            <li> you can see his veins popping up and showing clearly.</li>
            <li> I will Stick with Eden&#x27;s Garden and Young Livioilsng oi</li>
            <li> she uses a few drops every night, massages into her hands, fingers and knuckles and is virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> This oil really helps with my deep aching pains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse...and my back and shoulders get hurt almost very week at work in some way.  </li>
            <li> When he woke up this morning (typically he is even more stiff after sleeping whether or not he gets a massage), he had absolutely no knots in his shoulders, his back was more relaxed and the pain there</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it remained a very potent smell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an almost immediate relief and though it doesn&#x27;t last forever, and during the long duration of up to 5hrs, there is some slight irritation vs pain, I love it.</li>
            <li> After starting a new workout routine, my shoulders were killing me.</li>
            <li> Bought it 3rd time so far.</li>
            <li> I especially like this blend as opposed to PanAway by Young Living since it does NOT contain Wintergreen.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old vegetarian who avoids the use of medication as much as possible for my joint &amp; arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> After cutting it down with my favorite unscented lotion, I applied it to my skin and within maybe an hour, I felt my sore joints starting to loosen up and the pain starting to get better.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in essential oils from plants and this product seems to have the right blend.  </li>
            <li> Basically, he will be needing surgery soon considering he hardly has any free movement due to the knots.</li>
            <li> My husband who normally scoffs at alternatives used your Pain Aid &amp; Muscle Aid for his lower back pain and is now a firm believer...</li>
            <li> This might not seem like long but when you are in enough pain you are grateful for a break!  </li>
            <li> I mixed it in a small bottle with coconut oil and applied to my hand, wrist, and newly arthritic thumb when I went to bed.</li>
            <li> Just used it plain so far it, it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This oil works instantly to allow me to bend my knee and put some weight on it without suffering extreme pain.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pain in my total body and I have tried other oils</li>
            <li> The smell was far less noticeable than any other pain spray or gel.</li>
            <li> I woke up feeling refreshed, with only a dull ache left in my shoulders.</li>
            <li> a few minutes later she said her shoulder wasn&#x27;t bothering her anymore!!!</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something for my nerve pain in my right big toe.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a way to add other lotions or anything else to it.</li>
            <li> I have already given away these items to two other friends and tell everyone how well this works.</li>
            <li> Especially considering how close I was to expensive medical testing, treatments, and possible untimely surgery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plant Therapy is my go-to brand after trying tons of other companies.</li>
            <li> At first skeptical when reading the review of your product, Pain Aid Synergy, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After searching for something to work to at least ease his pain, this works above and beyond.</li>
            <li> It uses peppermint, clove bud, bay laurel, black pepper, cinnamon, ginger, roman chamomile, juniper and thyme</li>
            <li> but make a mess.</li>
            <li> A little stiffness, but no pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put a few tablespoons of a carrier oil in a bottle and add about twelve drops of each oil.</li>
            <li> I was worried because it was so heavily scented</li>
            <li> so I put a few drops on her shoulder and</li>
            <li> I immediately disliked the scent, but thought it would fade.</li>
            <li> I used it as suggested, mixing with massage oil, and rubbing it on my very swollen and painful knee.  </li>
            <li> and I use this, diluted with either coconut or grapeseed oil, to take the pain away from sore muscles after a day of hiking or canoeing, and I&#x27;ve used it on the mornings when I&#x27;ve slept wrong and wake up with a sore neck or back.</li>
            <li> The length of time seems to vary but it usually lasts at least an hour.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I had to get up in the middle of the night to take a shower and change</li>
            <li> He has been living with it for a few years; the knots in his shoulders and back give him a really terrible headache where it&#x27;s to the point</li>
            <li> If you are looking to decrease muscle aches and pains which get worse with winter weather</li>
            <li> I was not impressed since I didn&#x27;t experience any relief.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Pain-Aid and Muscle-Aid synergies for my boyfriend who has horrible back and shoulder pain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother in law, he suffers from RA and loves this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant but others seem to like it</li>
            <li> I had muscle pain in my shoulder and neck from a bad sleeping position.</li>
            <li> it has a bad smell and don&#x27;t feel any pain relief at all.</li>
            <li> I have endured over a year of excruciating pain, horrific injections into my spine, unable to walk without a cane, and awake with pain all night.  </li>
            <li> This smells so bad I will not use it!</li>
            <li> Yes, I still hurt, but not that horrible, excruciating pain I had</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> I was not impressed since I didn&#x27;t experience any relief.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to decrease muscle aches and pains which get worse with winter weather then you may want to mix this with [[ASIN:B006OR6AZ2 Muscle Aid Synergy Essential Oil Blend. 10 ml (1/3 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend of: Wintergreen, Camphor and Pine)]]. The Pain Aid is really just scented like cinnamon but once you dilute it, it blends perfectly with the Muscle Aid. I put a few tablespoons of a carrier oil in a bottle and add about twelve drops of each oil. It seems to reduce muscle pain overnight if you use it in the evening. I&#x27;d not put either of these oil blends in a bath however. I&#x27;ve not had much luck with cinnamon oil in the bath. It stings. So use this with caution and test out a small amount of diluted oil on the inside of your elbow to make sure the cinnamon oil does not cause any reaction. It hasn&#x27;t for me. I was worried because it was so heavily scented but it seems fine once diluted. Do however use caution and wash your hands after using these essential oil blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it works nicely</li>
            <li> I really like this blend, I use it with my gua sha stones to work out the kinks in my legs. It smells fantastic. I mixed it with some vitamin E oil, eucalyptus oil and castor oil to help with the healing.</li>
            <li> I had muscle pain in my shoulder and neck from a bad sleeping position. Normally I would use Aspercreme and it would ease the pain, but I am trying to eliminate manmade chemicals from my body. I purchased this hoping it would be of use to myself and my family. Unfortuantely, it did not provide any relief to my should and neck. I would not buy this again for pain relief.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother in law, he suffers from RA and loves this product.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and penetrates the sore spots to bring relief.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;If you put peppermint and wintergreen on before it&#x27;s more amazing&lt;br /&gt;Good by itself.</li>
            <li> This really works for me!  I don&#x27;t know HOW it works but I am so glad I tried this!  I have degenerative disc disease and arthritis in my hip.  I have endured over a year of excruciating pain, horrific injections into my spine, unable to walk without a cane, and awake with pain all night.  Yes, I try everything and anything to try to get relief.  Well, unbelievably, this has helped me more than anything!  I use this full strength (may be too intense for some because it should be diluted), and just rub it into my lower back, and hip.  It gets warm and within a few minutes I am feeling relief.  I like the spicy smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  It helps me enough to get back to sleep.  Yes, I still hurt, but not that horrible, excruciating pain I had before I  tried this.  Like anything else, what works for one may not work for another, but I am very thankful for this and also the roll-on one I keep in my purse.  I will keep reordering this and hope never to run out!!</li>
            <li> This small bottle does a great job, on pain from arthritis. Retired senior having tried many products, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of joint pain pills (glucosamin, chondroitin, egg shell membrane, hyaluronic acid...), nothing helped me knee. This oil works instantly to allow me to bend my knee and put some weight on it without suffering extreme pain.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using something like this for my joint pain but after I used it several days I realized it did not help at all. Furthermore the oily odor remains on clothing.</li>
            <li> I mix mine with some lavender and apply to my sore joints with a roll-on bottle and notice relief of my pain start within minutes.</li>
            <li> This smells so bad I will not use it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product once. I don&#x27;t have a way to add other lotions or anything else to it. Just used it plain so far it, it&#x27;s working. Thanks for sending promptly and boxed very nicely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of creams and patches for my Osteoarthritis pain in my hips, knees, and lower legs that have been moderately effective for the pain, but not cost effective for my pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain Aid Synergy works well, as I feel the pain dissipating quickly and I like the &#x27;aroma therapy&#x27; of the essential oils.  My first purchase did not include a carrier oil, but this time I&#x27;m getting the coconut oil as a carrier.  If I continue to have such positive results, I believe you have a loyal customer for this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I order this because my daughter always has pain in her knee and ankles I ended up using it on my ankle and my moms shoulder before I used it on my daughter. Let me tell you I went for a run and when I came back my ankle started to ache I put a couple drops on and a couple minutes later it went away literally! I had no ache in my ankle anymore. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My mom has rheumatoid arthritis and she&#x27;s only 52 had many replacements already. She kept saying her shoulder was bothering her so I put a few drops on her shoulder and a few minutes later she said her shoulder wasn&#x27;t bothering her anymore!!! I am a believer. If you have any doubt just buy it. I always buy things that have good reviews. This product did and it also delivered! I will be buying a couple more bottles mainly for my mom! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first plant theraphy oil I purchased.  I bought it for my dad who has lots of leg pains.  I loved the smell so much that I made a body butter with this oil.  I have also made a roll on with carrier oil to have on hand for aches and pains.  After buying this oil I have since bought several more oils from plant therapy and have been very happy with all of them.  They are a good company with great customer service.</li>
            <li> I got this to compare between Young Living&#x27;s Panaway, and Edens Garden&#x27;s Muscle Relief and this did absolutely nothing but make a mess. I will Stick with Eden&#x27;s Garden and Young Livioilsng oi</li>
            <li> This stuff really does help my arthritis joint pain.  The length of time seems to vary but it usually lasts at least an hour. This might not seem like long but when you are in enough pain you are grateful for a break!  The smell is unpleasant but others seem to like it so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil, though it may seem a little strong for some people, just knowing this is an all natural product is reassuring. It also works well for the purpose intended. Once, our daughter had a migraine and I massaged this into her scalp for several minutes and the headache went away. Doesn&#x27;t leave the hair or scalp extra oily upon washing it out either like you would think an oil would.</li>
            <li> Bought it 3rd time so far. My dad had rheumatoid arthritis and hes not taking any prescription meds. . Very rarely... because of side effects.  This oil is the only thing that calm his pains.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
            <li> it has a bad smell and don&#x27;t feel any pain relief at all. They shipped the product very quick and good service.</li>
            <li> I have some arthritic pain in my right thumb joint and I put this oil on it and noticed an immediate effect.  It&#x27;s not long lasting, but I have not found many products that are.  Many products don&#x27;t even have an effect at all, so I&#x27;m very satisfied that it worked even temporarily.  I am a firm believer in essential oils from plants and this product seems to have the right blend.  It uses peppermint, clove bud, bay laurel, black pepper, cinnamon, ginger, roman chamomile, juniper and thyme</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product instead of more drug therapy or knee replacement surgery.  I used it as suggested, mixing with massage oil, and rubbing it on my very swollen and painful knee.  I wrapped the knee in an ace bandage and stayed off my feet for a day.  I did the same things the next day, and by the third day, I had no knee pain at all.  A little stiffness, but no pain.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a health nut, nor am I one to write  reviews or opinions for every product I use, but the way I used this product did me a world of good.  2 weeks later and I am still pain free.</li>
            <li> I used this mixed with hydrocortisone cream for an allergic rash and it made a world of difference. Just don&#x27;t used it undiluted or it will feel like your skin is on fire!</li>
            <li> Pain-Aid is a winner for my wife&#x27;s arthritic fingers.  It seems to be the only thing she can noticeably say helps alleviate her joint pains.  I use this Pain-Aid EO mixed with Bay Laurel in a 1oz dropper bottle, to make a very concentrated synergy blend,using apricot or coconut carrier oils; I would say it&#x27;s nearly a 50/50 blend, meaning 25% Pain-Aid, 25% Bay Laurel and 50% carrier oil-  she uses a few drops every night, massages into her hands, fingers and knuckles and is virtually pain free.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Pain-Aid and Muscle-Aid synergies for my boyfriend who has horrible back and shoulder pain. He has been living with it for a few years; the knots in his shoulders and back give him a really terrible headache where it&#x27;s to the point you can see his veins popping up and showing clearly. Basically, he will be needing surgery soon considering he hardly has any free movement due to the knots. And, with the surgery, there is a large percentage something will go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Pain-Aid to massage his shoulders and neck and the Muscle-Aid for his back last night. We also have some \\&quot;Eden&#x27;s Garden\\&quot; Peppermint oil I ordered a while back which i used on his temples. When he woke up this morning (typically he is even more stiff after sleeping whether or not he gets a massage), he had absolutely no knots in his shoulders, his back was more relaxed and the pain there almost gone, and his headache was lessen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching for something to work to at least ease his pain, this works above and beyond. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue to order more. :)</li>
            <li> Thank you. This products is packs a punch in releaving the soreness in my arthritic jaw joints. My husband also had great results when he pulled his back.</li>
            <li> Works wonders!!!!!!  I have a lot of pain in my total body and I have tried other oils but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li> We love this oil....I massage this oil, muscle aid oil and almond oil on my husband&#x27;s back, he has degenerative disk disease, and this relieves his pain for hours. I have already given away these items to two other friends and tell everyone how well this works.</li>
            <li> After starting a new workout routine, my shoulders were killing me. My hubby used a quarter sized glob of coconut oil and mixed in about 5 drops of this and massaged my shoulders and back. I was sort of waiting for a warming effect, but instead got a very soothing cooling effect instead. It was great. I woke up feeling refreshed, with only a dull ache left in my shoulders. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> soothes aching joints, pleasant to the senses, helps me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep, recommend it also as a fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite blends of essential oils for joint pain. Not only is it very pleasantly scented, but it is effective. I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my headaches and shoulders. Very happy I did! I would recommend this for those with headaches, muscle spasms, to knee and joint pain.</li>
            <li> Much like the Muscle-Aide, we love this one. In fact, this is my favorite. I have chronic plantar fasciitis in both feet as well as chronic achilles tendonitis in both feet, I also suffer from fibromyalgia and 4 cervical disc herniations. This oil particularly has help me with my feet/achilles pain. Sometimes I get several (up to about 5) hours of relief. There&#x27;s an almost immediate relief and though it doesn&#x27;t last forever, and during the long duration of up to 5hrs, there is some slight irritation vs pain, I love it. My husband also finds relief from the pain in his knee. Again, if you read my review in ref. to the muscle aid blend, I&#x27;m a believing skeptic and always cautious but I can&#x27;t deny it has been helping.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on my ankle and hands when they hurt from arthritis.  It helps to calm the pain.</li>
            <li> I applied this along with Muscle Aid to my husbands shoulder/knee/low back and he had relief from the chronic pain. I first used a carrier oil but after that applied it straight to the skin and it seemed stronger that way. I used it on my aching knuckles and it felt amazing. Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews. The scent is absolutely horrible. The smell of clove and other oils is overwhelming. It was so bad that I had to get up in the middle of the night to take a shower and change clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before. The common scents that I use are: bergamont, patchouli, rose, lavender and citrus. I normally use Biofreeze as muscle rub, so I&#x27;m fine with a strong menthol smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Pain Aid Synergy oil diluted in jojoba oil to massage on my calfs. I immediately disliked the scent, but thought it would fade. Unfortunately, it remained a very potent smell. It also didn&#x27;t work. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain relieving results (heat or cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this product, be sure that you really like the smell of clove.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and chronic pancreatitis. This oil really helps with my deep aching pains. Now if only I had a boyfriend to massage it on for me.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet for my plantar fasciitis and it works great.  Nice blend with a great smell.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something for my nerve pain in my right big toe.  I had nothing to lose but the pain.  I rubbed this around my toe and on the bottom of my foot in the a.m. and p.m..  Three days of use, and I can go all day with shoes on and the pain so far is GONE!!</li>
            <li> This is a great blend for arthritis and muscle pain. It is slightly different than the YL Pan Away blend and I think the scent is MUCH better. Instead of smelling like wintergreen, this oil smells a bit spicy and warms the skin gradually and quite nicely. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been nursing a recurrent wrist and hand pain for 2 months. In both my jobs and on our farm I am constantly re-aggravating the problem. BioFreeze is nice but after 20 minutes the icy hot feeling is worn off, the reality is that the pain hasn&#x27;t gone away. While on the internet looking for essential oils for home cleaning purposes I came across this Pain Aid Synergy. I did not put a whole lot of faith in it working...but why not try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment arrived very quickly. I mixed it in a small bottle with coconut oil and applied to my hand, wrist, and newly arthritic thumb when I went to bed. The smell was far less noticeable than any other pain spray or gel. What really made me take notice was how I slept through the night - the first night! The pain in my hand and wrist had been waking me up for several nights. I thought it might just be a fluke that I must not have punished it as much the day before. I applied that morning and again that evening. The second morning, I SWEAR I could not believe that the pain was GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about day 6 of using the Pain Aid Synergy. I only use it at night but it has made a fabulous difference in my life! Especially considering how close I was to expensive medical testing, treatments, and possible untimely surgery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this product and thought it might work since the smell was so potent. That&#x27;s about all I got out of it - a potent smell. No heat, no pain relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse...and my back and shoulders get hurt almost very week at work in some way.  I see a chiropractor every week, which helps, but I was still having to take ibuprofen on a daily basis, which worried me.  I am also a certified clinical aromatherapist...and yes, I could have made a blend up myself, but the reviews on this one caught my eye so I decided to try it.  This Pain Aid synergy is amazing!  It smells great (not too medicinal) and is so convenient to use.  I can carry it to work in my scrub pocket, and when I start to feel sore, I add just 2 or 3 drops to a squirt of &#x27;hospital&#x27; lotion and rub it into my back or shoulders....instant relief!  Thankyou, Thankyou, Thankyou!</li>
            <li> After cutting it down with my favorite unscented lotion, I applied it to my skin and within maybe an hour, I felt my sore joints starting to loosen up and the pain starting to get better. Better yet, it lasted for several hours, even in the places I have the most chronic and tender pain channels.&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended this by my cousin, who didn&#x27;t know anything about it and found it on Amazon, decided to give it a try and it turned out that it significantly helped his spouse&#x27;s pain and helped to gain flexibility in the affected muscles and joints, during his weekly sessions in physical therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended Pain Aid Synergy to a handful of friends and family, and I will continue to do so to anyone who asks!&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> What a great and useful oil synergy! I made my grandmother a salve using Pain-Aid and some Copaiba to &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; the effectiveness and she tells me it works better for her back pain and arthritis than Icy Hot, Tiger Balm, Bio Freeze, or any other over the counter creams and ointments she&#x27;s tried. Plus the smell is pleasant, unlike Icy Hot and things like that that smell very chemical and linger on your clothing after use. The smell is almost &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I use this, diluted with either coconut or grapeseed oil, to take the pain away from sore muscles after a day of hiking or canoeing, and I&#x27;ve used it on the mornings when I&#x27;ve slept wrong and wake up with a sore neck or back. You can feel it working almost immediately, and the pain doesn&#x27;t come back. One application and we&#x27;re good to go! Mixing with the Copaiba really boosts the quickness and strength of this oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy is my go-to brand after trying tons of other companies. The quality and customer service are great, and the prices are extremely affordable. I especially like this blend as opposed to PanAway by Young Living since it does NOT contain Wintergreen. Wintergreen can be a powerful pain reliever, but it works like Aspirin and can &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; the blood. My family almost all carry a genetic blood disorder and must be careful about products that &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;, so none of us are able to use any blends that contain Wintergreen. It&#x27;s nice to have this as a very effective alternative.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old vegetarian who avoids the use of medication as much as possible for my joint &amp; arthritis pain.  Since I also practice yoga and meditation, I became familiar with the use of essential oils. At first skeptical when reading the review of your product, Pain Aid Synergy, I decided to give it a try.  The first application of Pain Aid was absolutely amazing, within 30 minutes of application the pulsing sharp pain in my hip was gone and I was able to obtain a restful nights sleep.  I also ordered  your Muscle Aid with the same results for sore muscles after gardening, walking, etc.  My husband who normally scoffs at alternatives used your Pain Aid &amp; Muscle Aid for his lower back pain and is now a firm believer...when his back hurts he will immediately ask me to retrieve my Plant Therapy essential oils.  Thank you for your products are my final words.</li>
            <li> Pain Aid Synergy by Plant Therapy Essential Oils is quite comforting for my aching neck/shoulder area and also knees that have fluid build-up and bone-on-bone areas.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell. I have determined that this blend does help aching joints. It seems to work better and better the more I use it. Reasonable price yet effective.</li>
