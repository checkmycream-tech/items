            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>looks promising....not wise to judge this product yet since it supposedly takes many months for users to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s verry effective, just give it about a month to see any difference.</li>
            <li>This may be an amazing product for most people; however, I rated based on my own</li>
            <li>Thank is suitable for hair</li>
            <li>So for me, the real-deal is the most effective.  </li>

            <li>even my hair dresser said that my hair is more manageable ad thicker</li>
            <li>I have had no side effects except more hair.</li>
            <li>It might make you feel better using Rogaine</li>
            <li>hence you have more hair.  </li>
            <li>This works so much better than the Women&#x27;s Rogaine.</li>
            <li>I read that this can more effective but its  a huge hassle and dries your scalp out more than the foam.</li>
            <li>will help what you got, for most won&#x27;t regrow hair</li>
            <li>Ok, now the review is asking for 8 more words give me a break....</li>
            <li>So far, this product has done a good job holding the line between me having an attractive, full head of hair, and me having to spend almost ten-thousand dollars for hair transplant surgery.</li>
            <li>Solution is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I did not believe it would work, in 3 months, i noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>only reason I give this 4 stars, is that I have also used the FOAM version, and greatly prefer that.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day in the evening before bed, and have still gotten great results.  </li>
            <li>I started using the liquid because I read somewhere that it&#x27;s more effectively absorbed into the scalp compared to the foam.  </li>
            <li>Six months almost to the day I had a significant fail-out of hair</li>
            <li>Still waiting for significant results.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li>Not a lavish tropical jungle, but good enough.</li>
            <li>But overall if your hair was thinning like mine, and you want it to stop; this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 6 months and the results area incredibles, it really works, it&#x27;s a life time process</li>
            <li>This came very quickly, brand new, all sealed up in original box, just like you bought it from the store.</li>
            <li>Pretty pleased so far!</li>
            <li>It slides right off.</li>
            <li>Everything is all right, thanks!</li>
            <li>product at a better price than I pay locally.</li>
            <li>So the younger you begin using the better.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, but after taking it for 3 months I am very happy with the results I got.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hair fairly short, but started panicking when I noticed my hair thinning on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The first day just like before I applied the product.</li>
            <li>They are females, but use the mens product because they say it simply works better for them.</li>
            <li>I live with this gladly because dull hair is better than no hair!</li>
            <li>but the results are positive.</li>
            <li>Both of my friends say this product gets results and they have been using it for over 6 years now with positive results.</li>
            <li>I assume the foam may disperse slightly better but ruins any chance of keeping hair looking fresh and washed.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>My hair did grow, however, you must be very diligent about applying twice a day or</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery described as it was.</li>
            <li>but I actually really do.</li>
            <li>Believe me, it really works for me.</li>
            <li>or so I stop using it to see if I can see a difference, and I really do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though my hair is still thinning, it has been at a much slower pace than before.  </li>
            <li>Hair grew so much</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff really</li>
            <li>and their seals were not broken</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there are other better options though.</li>
            <li>And it seems to leave the hair less dry (compared to the foam, which ends up being spreaded on the hair also), since you&#x27;re able to use it more directly on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The topical rogaine  seems to last more than the foam one.</li>
            <li>Product is good but the box was broken</li>
            <li>It helps new hair regrow.</li>
            <li>Maybe too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>Made his hair thicken grow back fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li>Whole face goes red, swelling on the face and hives appeared on face that took a week to go away.</li>
            <li>I am a 61 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>I am a mature lady, under 65.</li>
            <li>It is only topical product that is useful and has gone through FDA approval cycle.</li>
            <li>Rogaine did not only stop my thinning hair, it actually made new one grow!!</li>
            <li>A little concerned about what this will do to my facial hair but maybe its worth it.</li>
            <li>made the mistake of buying a year&#x27;s supply right off the bat and now have a few bottles left.  </li>
            <li>The dropper helps you apply directly on the scalp while keeping hair dry</li>

            <li> The dropper helps you apply directly on the scalp while keeping hair dry</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half,  but don&#x27;t expect any sign of new hair on my thinning-to-bald spot until the four-month mark.  </li>
            <li> I take this along with biotin which makes my hair (and fingernails unfortunately) grow pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt like it was all alcohol and caused my my scalp to dry and itch.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinning or has lost a minimal amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Havent used it that long; seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> It does work for hair loss, but it leaves the hair somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and the dry scalp and itching went away.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for someone who is completely bald).</li>
            <li> If you are a man or women Try it, what do you have to loose?</li>
            <li> Used Rogaine for 8 years and it may have slowed down hair loss, but it definitely did not grow hair.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that my scalp became very dry using this product.  </li>
            <li> It has also made my hair thicker and has grown back a little hair that may have been lost or thinning.</li>
            <li> Second day I&#x27;ve lost a little of the shine.</li>
            <li> The doctor told me I was going to loose some hair; I think he meant a lot of hair!</li>
            <li> perhaps it was the supplier that shipped me an open box with the dripper missing,  </li>
            <li> I also had white patches of hair and missing patches of hair appear on my face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the hassle and pain to continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Did it convert a balding spot into a thick, lush, shinning head of hair over night?</li>
            <li> Although I find that to be maybe a little conservative, they are not far off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still have issues with it falling out after two years, but I ended up discontinuing using the rogaine and all of the other products that were recommended and decided to just not worry about it.  </li>
            <li> I guess the other con would be that I&#x27;m going to have to use this forever.  </li>
            <li> I should add that I&#x27;ve tried the generic K-brand and Lipogaine in the past</li>
            <li> Became light headed and felt just plain &#x27;weird&#x27; a few minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that Rogaine tends to dull the hair in the area of use.  </li>
            <li> it just slows down the process of the dying follicle.  </li>
            <li> and I typically have to wipe it to keep it from dripping down my face, and now hairs are growing in that area.</li>
            <li> I grew a very small amount of hair back and haven&#x27;t lost anymore.  </li>
            <li> After less than two weeks I already see baby hairs growing along my hairline.</li>
            <li> Since taking rogaine I have noticed regrowth and a lot less shedding of hair.  </li>
            <li> was causing the area where I applied it to dye black.  </li>
            <li> I also have a few small pimple like bumps in a few different places which I am assuming are little hairs trying to make their way out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone as much as four days, however it&#x27;s a little dirty from the environmental pollutants.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy so put it on a few hours before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I needed it or not I lost a little hair could have been stress</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I could go out with it on in the morning and pull that off.  </li>
            <li> I checked the small bottles (there are 3 of them)</li>
            <li> for your head game tight</li>
            <li> Must be used of at least 3-months to see the results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this corrupt company.</li>
            <li> So it does me no good.</li>
            <li> One even has to watch for it not touching face or ears, beccause if it does, (a very thin) &#x27;</li>
            <li> Sadly a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also way too expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> 3-4 wks out &amp; don&#x27;t see any results yet.  Maybe too early to tell.  Solution is easy to use.  Still hopeful.</li>
            <li> I have been using it several years and it works</li>
            <li> I have used Rogaine for years ......My dematologist did NOT want me to buy Woman&#x27;s Rogaine.  He feels that it is the men&#x27;s that works best on all.&lt;br /&gt;The package warns you, &amp;#34;only for men&amp;#34; but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t recieved  this Rogaine yet  but I&#x27;ve been  using the Rogaine for women  for 2 years and I have  so muich hair growth so that&#x27;s why I gave it  a 5 star. It  did take about 2 months and  you  use it  twice a day  Morning and  Evening.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and my dermatologist recommended I use the men&#x27;s version.  My hair did grow, however, you must be very diligent about applying twice a day or what you grew will fall out.  It did tend to make my hair look greasy and unclean.  My hair loss was eventually determined to be stress related and I still have issues with it falling out after two years, but I ended up discontinuing using the rogaine and all of the other products that were recommended and decided to just not worry about it.  It was just adding to my stress anyways.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t not order this item nor have i received it. Please remove from my account because I am not loosing my hair and I did not approve this purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping on time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and it&#x27;s already working! It actually works!</li>
            <li> Its hereditary that my hair was thining.  I saw my Dermotologist and he recommended I take Rogaine for men.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference within 4 months. The only problem it doesn&#x27;t work towards the hair line, only towards the crown of my head. I stIll apply towards the hairline in hopes that it will work. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for me...except it made my hair fall out faster. Zero hair regrowth results.</li>
            <li> Yes!! The best!! Rate star 5. Made his hair thicken grow back fast. He will recommend this  for sure. He loves it</li>
            <li> Product is good but the box was broken</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my son. And we all agree that there are definite signs of improvement in his hair. So we are all very happy with its results.  We will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I use Rogaine as a preventative measure since male pattern baldness runs in my family. So far, this product has done a good job holding the line between me having an attractive, full head of hair, and me having to spend almost ten-thousand dollars for hair transplant surgery. It has also made my hair thicker and has grown back a little hair that may have been lost or thinning. I love buying this product on amazon because it saves a lot of money. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinning or has lost a minimal amount of hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who is already fully bald. Thanks...</li>
            <li> Everything is all right, thanks!</li>
            <li> Learned my lesson when I thought i did not need this. Sadly a lifetime customer. It does work for me though. I&#x27;m grateful</li>
            <li> It is very nice producte and I wish to deal with this seller again. Best of luck for all</li>
            <li> Have not seen any effects yet. Don&#x27;t know what to say...I don&#x27;t know if there are other better options though.</li>
            <li> After a month I have not seen any growth.  Product has caused my scalp to produce excess dandruff.  Ask me again in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this article, is excellent and is of good quality and I recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li> Obviously each person will react differently, and results will vary, but with that being said Rogaine works for me! Did it convert a balding spot into a thick, lush, shinning head of hair over night? Not quite. Rogaine states that the product takes all of the 3-month supply to show any results. Although I find that to be maybe a little conservative, they are not far off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this 4 stars, is that I have also used the FOAM version, and greatly prefer that. The desired result will be identical, but the foam is easier to apply, and does not seem to leave the hair/head greasy like the topical solution tends to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give it a try, but go with the FOAM.</li>
            <li> I am a girl. And in spite of this I use this item, for men. It helps new hair regrow. And it tooks 3 month to see the results.. No side effect if you dont have any problems with your health.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, but the problem is I cant get anymore for this price. So it does me no good.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery described as it was. Recommended</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you still have hair. You wont be able to notice a difference. It slides right off.</li>
            <li> Female using this product based no dermatologist&#x27;s specific recommendation. A little concerned about what this will do to my facial hair but maybe its worth it. Didn&#x27;t think I would like the application but I actually really do. The dropper helps you apply directly on the scalp while keeping hair dry so you can go out immediately after using it. I assume the foam may disperse slightly better but ruins any chance of keeping hair looking fresh and washed. After less than two weeks I already see baby hairs growing along my hairline. Makes perfect sense because the rogaine tends to drip forward while I&#x27;m applying and I typically have to wipe it to keep it from dripping down my face, and now hairs are growing in that area. I also have a few small pimple like bumps in a few different places which I am assuming are little hairs trying to make their way out. Definitely going to continue use and hope for the best. Pretty pleased so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> Used many products but this one is The best hair and beard growth product in the market so far. Believe me, it really works for me.</li>
            <li> Thank is suitable for hair</li>
            <li> I have being using this product for almost 2-3 years and I can tell the difference even my hair dresser said that my hair is more manageable ad thicker</li>
            <li> hopeful this will work. looks promising....not wise to judge this product yet since it supposedly takes many months for users to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this but I have allergic reactions to it. Whole face goes red, swelling on the face and hives appeared on face that took a week to go away. When I called the company to return it, they didn&#x27;t ask why, offered no RMA # and just told me to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months. It says twice a day, but I have just been using it once in the evening. My hair is quite a bit thicker then when I started. I can see it in the mirror and can allso feel the difference . It is a little messy so put it on a few hours before bed. I have had no side effects except more hair. The unscented is very nice.</li>
            <li> Been using it for some time, even with shipping I saved almost 15 dollars. Works for me</li>
            <li> It might make you feel better using Rogaine but it does&#x27;nt work.</li>
            <li> Working good&lt;br /&gt; It is good</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Have been using it for years and once a year or so I stop using it to see if I can see a difference, and I really do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product at a better price than I pay locally.</li>
            <li> I am a 61 year old woman.  I have been using Rogaine 5% Minoxidil since 1998 on the recommendation of a dermatologist who specialized in women&#x27;s hair loss.  I use it once a day, at night.  I know it works because in June of 2000 I stopped using it thinking maybe it wasn&#x27;t&#x27; working.  Six months almost to the day I had a significant fail-out of hair just as the instructions said.  I began using it again and have not quit since.  Though my hair is still thinning, it has been at a much slower pace than before.  How it works was explained to me by the above mention dermatologist.  Rogaine does not regrow hair it just slows down the process of the dying follicle.  Each hair stays on your head longer hence you have more hair.  So the younger you begin using the better.  The only drawback is that Rogaine tends to dull the hair in the area of use.  Even if I wash my hair daily my bangs especially are duller than the rest of my hair.  I live with this gladly because dull hair is better than no hair!</li>
            <li> I got it like a month now but the result is nothing. My hair keep falling and it will be bald soon.</li>
            <li> It is only topical product that is useful and has gone through FDA approval cycle.It is not a cure but the results are positive.</li>
            <li> Hair grew so much I now have pony tail. Lost 10 lbs and hit the lottery same week I started rogaine.</li>
            <li> Probably it won&#x27;t work on 100% of the cases, but for me it did - after 2 or so months hair did actually cover some inhospitable sports on the back of my head. Not a lavish tropical jungle, but good enough.</li>
            <li> this brand is very good for hair recovery, specially if you have tinning hair. It&#x27;s verry effective, just give it about a month to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but after taking it for 3 months I am very happy with the results I got.  I keep my hair fairly short, but started panicking when I noticed my hair thinning on the top of my head.  (I was never bald, just thinning. So I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for someone who is completely bald). It got to the point that when I washed my hair my hands would have anywhere from 20 to 30 or so hairs.  Since taking rogaine I have noticed regrowth and a lot less shedding of hair.  I only use it once a day in the evening before bed, and have still gotten great results.  The only cons are that it looks greasy even with short hair and it makes your scalp flaky.  That&#x27;s why I only use it at night before bed.  I&#x27;m not sure how I could go out with it on in the morning and pull that off.  Also, started using a prescription shampoo for dandruff that has helped with my scalp flaking.  I guess the other con would be that I&#x27;m going to have to use this forever.  I was hesitant to buy it because of this fact, but it eventually just becomes part of your schedule like brushing your teeth or washing your face.  But overall if your hair was thinning like mine, and you want it to stop; this is a good alternative. I take this along with biotin which makes my hair (and fingernails unfortunately) grow pretty fast.  So if you want your hair to grow quicker, try taking biotin as well.</li>
            <li> It does work for hair loss, but it leaves the hair somewhat dry. Must be used of at least 3-months to see the results. The topical rogaine  seems to last more than the foam one. And it seems to leave the hair less dry (compared to the foam, which ends up being spreaded on the hair also), since you&#x27;re able to use it more directly on the scalp. I use the topical rogaine during the day and the foam at night.</li>
            <li> I did not believe it would work, in 3 months, i noticed a huge change. I recommend the product! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I am a mature lady, under 65. My hair is processed and I had surgery 21/2 years ago. The doctor told me I was going to loose some hair; I think he meant a lot of hair! My PCP recommended Rogaine for men. Thank goodness I found a solution. I started using Rogaine as soon as I received it in the mail, just as prescribed. From December 28th to present I have some fuzz in the bald spots. Some of the hair in this area is about 1 inch. I apply It to the scalp and rub it in. I don&#x27;t wash it out for a couple of days and continue using it each day as prescribed.  You may ask, what does you hair look like after you&#x27;ve applied Rogaine? Good question. The first day just like before I applied the product. Second day I&#x27;ve lost a little of the shine. I&#x27;ve gone as much as four days, however it&#x27;s a little dirty from the environmental pollutants. If you are a man or women Try it, what do you have to loose? IT&#x27;S NOT YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li> Did not seem to help.  Solution is rather oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than the Women&#x27;s Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Became light headed and felt just plain &#x27;weird&#x27; a few minutes after application.  The feeling didn&#x27;t go away even after a week of use.  Gave up.</li>
            <li> Love it ! fast shipping. Thankyou</li>
            <li> id just stick with the foam.  I read that this can more effective but its  a huge hassle and dries your scalp out more than the foam.</li>
            <li> will it work only time will tell but the product is the same you buy in stores so it should work</li>
            <li> Still waiting for significant results.</li>
            <li> my friend asked me to order this to keep his hair from falling out. but once he stop, he loss hair again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work&#x60;s but you need to use it twice daily for life to get and KEEP results.&lt;br /&gt;buying online is a lot cheaper, like 1/3 of pharmacy prices.</li>
            <li> Item was not as described.  Application differed from description.</li>
            <li> I m really happy with thé product...now i got my haïr back....and i recommande rogain to anyone whos loosing is haïr</li>
            <li> My brother in law bought and seems he likes it.</li>
            <li> It does work.  I grew a very small amount of hair back and haven&#x27;t lost anymore.  Been using about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> No hair grow up,bad quality</li>
            <li> Over the two/three year span I used this I saw no improvement or worsening of hair thickness.  This stuff is snake oil.  If you are going bald just let it happen.  This is just going to speed it up.  I stopped using this about 4-5 months ago and have seen no change in my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this corrupt company.</li>
            <li> perhaps it was the supplier that shipped me an open box with the dripper missing,  I checked the small bottles (there are 3 of them) and their seals were not broken so I decided I will use them; but the product felt very different from the Rogaine that I used to use a couple of years ago. It actually felt like it was all alcohol and caused my my scalp to dry and itch. I stopped using it and the dry scalp and itching went away.</li>
            <li> Havent used it that long; seems to be helping.Not sure if I needed it or not I lost a little hair could have been stress but it seems to be thicker.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 20 years and I still have hair!</li>
            <li> for your head game tight</li>
            <li> good seller would use again</li>
            <li> Rogaine did not only stop my thinning hair, it actually made new one grow!! One even has to watch for it not touching face or ears, beccause if it does, (a very thin) &#x27;unwanted&#x27; hair WILL grow there! My dermathologist prescribed it and warned me about this. I thought she was exaggerating. Well, she wasn&#x27;t!  It&#x27;s virtually odorless and doesn&#x27;t make hair look oily or unwashed. It gave me peace of mind and great joy!</li>
            <li> The Rogaine arrived in excellent condition.  As a hair regrowth stimulator, that remains to be seen.  I have been using it for about a month and a half,  but don&#x27;t expect any sign of new hair on my thinning-to-bald spot until the four-month mark.  As they say, &amp;#34;stay tuned&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> This may be an amazing product for most people; however, I rated based on my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about 8 months.  I noticed no difference in my hair growth or loss.  I did notice that my scalp became very dry using this product.  I had noticeable dandruff while using this product.  I also had white patches of hair and missing patches of hair appear on my face.  I also had noticeable chest pains almost daily which may have been a result of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of buying a year&#x27;s supply right off the bat and now have a few bottles left.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the hassle and pain to continue to use this product.  I&#x27;d rather be bald than have chronic dandruff and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since stopping Rogaine, the dandruff is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Rogaine Foam now.  It causes me no dandruff or chest pains.  I&#x27;ll see if I get any results.</li>
            <li> What can you say, it&#x27;s Rogaine and it somewhat helps fill it the spot.</li>
            <li> it  help this product... thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 6 months and the results area incredibles, it really works, it&#x27;s a life time process but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Pfizer make enough money off of their drugs that don&#x27;t work? Do not purchase this product. Carry on bald or balding</li>
            <li> This is helping my hairline thicken up.  I started using the liquid because I read somewhere that it&#x27;s more effectively absorbed into the scalp compared to the foam.  Also, I have brunette hair and the foam was causing the area where I applied it to dye black.  The liquid doesn&#x27;t affect my hair color whatsoever.  I should add that I&#x27;ve tried the generic K-brand and Lipogaine in the past and I noticed that when I was using those my hair started thinning out.  So for me, the real-deal is the most effective.  I will stick with what I know works.</li>
            <li> Hair grew back the next day.</li>
            <li> I buy this for 2 of my friends as gifts. They both have thinning hair, and this product has meant the world to them. They are females, but use the mens product because they say it simply works better for them. Both of my friends say this product gets results and they have been using it for over 6 years now with positive results. A great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Used Rogaine for 8 years and it may have slowed down hair loss, but it definitely did not grow hair.  I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also way too expensive.</li>
            <li> will help what you got, for most won&#x27;t regrow hair</li>
            <li> what can you say..... Put it on your head, and it works... Ok, now the review is asking for 8 more words give me a break....</li>
            <li> This came very quickly, brand new, all sealed up in original box, just like you bought it from the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month now, no results, and i have not seen any difference yet...</li>
