            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27; s best item among many sunblock that I have used</li>
            <li>I have tried many all zinc sunscreens in a quest for the best.</li>
            <li>) if you plan on sweating/swimming, it isn&#x27;t pleasant when it gets in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>In terms of sun protection, I think it does a good job.</li>
            <li>smell, rubs in well, good for all over body and face.</li>
            <li>Good stuff I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>As noted by some, both tubes had a fair amount of separated water which we squirted out.</li>
            <li>good smell.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind that for a good quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It also smells good.</li>
            <li>It really is good.  </li>
            <li>Good Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs well into the skin, and seems to do a good job in protecting against sun damage, plus softens skin.</li>
            <li>loved the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li>and it did a good job at protecting my skin.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>That alone is what makes this product popular and it does work as a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This is another great, safe and effective sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is our favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>WOuld buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>/&gt;3/29/2012 update:  Still our favorite sunscreen; won&#x27;t bother shopping around for alternatives this summer!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT NON-TOXIC SUNBLOCK THAT BLENDS EASILY,</li>
            <li>Smells great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Nice but discrete smell.</li>
            <li>I do like that it&#x27;s not greasy, but it also needs to be effective.</li>
            <li>WHO NEEDS AN EFFECTIVE BLOCK</li>
            <li>NICE SCENT TOO.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very effective.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this product before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>nice feel and consistency.</li>
            <li>, I feel that honest, effective reviews, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.</li>
            <li>nice smell, quite water resistance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen before and liked it</li>
            <li>The smell is a very mild and pleasant orange smell, not the chemical smells of some sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>better than most!</li>
            <li>Nice to see a company put some effort into creating a top notch product.</li>
            <li>not sticky; nice scent; lasts for hours and hours;  I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Not as light as non-nano zinc oxide sunscreens, but the price make this a good buy.</li>
            <li>With all the chemicals and toxins put into the products we buy, I try to research before for buying for myself and my family to find the healthiest and most effective products.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, after visiting their website (visit [...]), I was thrilled that I was purchasing from an independent company with excellent core values.     </li>
            <li>This worked very well for us, good sun protection when reapplied after swimming, good water resistance.</li>
            <li>Smells fine, feels fine, works fine, and best of all free of toxic chemicals (PABA, Parabens, Benzoate, Phthalates,</li>
            <li>Got it on sale - love that too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased a couple more tubes for the summer.</li>
            <li>I also love the shu uemura sunscreen, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the safety of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS IS THE BEST SUNBLOCK FOR THE ENTIRE BODY.</li>
            <li>I will buy more to get us thru the rest summer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.</li>
            <li>My child is 4yrs and is allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely repurchase one of the best 20% zinc oxide sunscreens!</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews.</li>
            <li>Received sunscreen just before travel to Europe (order process and delivery were OK).</li>
            <li>How many suncreens offer SPF 50</li>
            <li>And it tastes ok.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen, but was sent two defective tubes.  </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I started getting rashes from my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I like feeling safe</li>
            <li>However, the protection is better, I hope.</li>
            <li>This was better than another product (Elta MD) with these ingredients.</li>
            <li>But, we won&#x27;t get skin cancer from this time we went to Aruba.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I researched alternative sunscreens without oxybenzone and found this on EWGs website for safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>The expiration date on the sunscreen is 6 months from Jun 2012 which most sunscreen should have about 2 years shelf life.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product and I love everything about it, except it is NOT water resistant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway I love it</li>
            <li>most sunscreens sting, are overly perfumed, or cause me an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I re-applied more, liberally.</li>
            <li>you want to know more about sunscreen, you should look at the EWG website (search EWG sunscreen).  </li>
            <li>I love the thinkbaby version for my toddlers too.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this-</li>
            <li>so I feel it&#x27;s a safe option for me to use on my kids.  </li>
            <li>in very nicely without too much &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought it to protect my tattoo and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve found that sticks with me for a good while, plus it contains zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>It has protected me fine, no different than the Badger; I&#x27;m very happy with its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>so could more easily return for refund).</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and was intentional about lathering up a good bit before heading outside.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a pretty good job blocking the sun, but the scent is way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Rubbed on clear and is great.</li>
            <li>This works great for my sun sensitive</li>
            <li>The product itself takes some rubbing in, but I like the light citrus smell, and it works most of the time for me, although there are occasions when it does not.</li>
            <li>All natural, great sun protection, and it stays on in the water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as far as the product is concerned, its a great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>for a really good sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I put it on subscribe and save and plan on going through dozens on tubes this summer.</li>
            <li>love the fact that this product just sits on top of the skin (versus the other kind which goes into the bloodstream).&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to order sunscreen with an effective use span much longer than two months.</li>
            <li>... wipes on fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Stays put well when sweating, and has a very mild irritation if it gets in my eyes, unlike most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it goes on smooth, and more importantly, I did not get a burn.</li>
            <li>It goes on SO easy, even on squirmy kids.</li>
            <li>I can easily get close to two hours before I need to reapply when running-</li>
            <li>It smells good, doesn&#x27;t separate when it sits, and blends into the skin nicely -- doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue</li>
            <li>You can tell it provides a strong, protective barrier because the water beads up all over the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, rubs in pretty well</li>
            <li>I should have reapplied this sunscreen but didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to do so and it held up just fine.  </li>
            <li>a hint of citrus and super refreshing.</li>
            <li>It certainly lives up to its billing as water resistant and is effective at preventing sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I tested this one on a cloudless, bright sunshiny, 92 degree day for my 32 mile bike ride.</li>
            <li>So, it sits on top of the skin and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin creating all sorts of hormonal disruption.</li>
            <li>Free of all harmful chemicals, non-nano and water resistant for up to 80 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wish it could have been fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I was my face in the morning and use a light moisturizer once a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product for my whole family, so now I don&#x27;t have to buy separate sunscreens for kids and adults.</li>
            <li>It works really well and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a mineral based sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>light lemony (?)</li>
            <li>smell but light fragrances (orange for baby, lemon for sport)</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable  putting this on my kids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and happy with result.</li>
            <li>But this time I ordered 2 bottles and both were filled with a water like substance.</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It is a great physical sun blocker.</li>
            <li>Also, I have had numerous comments on my great tan.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not too greesy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li>Been ordering and using this brand for some time; was always very happy with it until last order; one tube turned out to be very watery/unusable.  </li>
            <li>SO far so good.</li>
            <li>The scent is a very very light citrus when you first apply but then the scent disappears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have normally loved it!!</li>
            <li>With all the debate surrounding chemicals in sunscreen, it&#x27;s nice to know that someone is putting forth the effort to make a sunscreen with the only undisputed safe ingredient (zinc oxide)</li>
            <li>THE MANUFACTURER  WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT AND EVEN ADD A FREE TUBE.</li>
            <li>Protection seems pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>The whole family is enjoying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Medium viscosity, rubs in well (but not as well if you have facial hair), smells good, works.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a fresh orange scent, not annoying or persistent.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has good protection and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I let it cool in my air-conditioned house, and tried to shake it and mash it up again.</li>
            <li>After shaking and trying to keep it in a cool place there was no helping it get to the correct consistency.</li>
            <li>I really like this better than the Badger sunscreen line.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in well, smells nice, and as far as I can tell it works.</li>
            <li>It stays on, and is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of chemicals like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.uct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li>Great for active people.</li>
            <li>I also like how it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because it ranked high on EWG&#x27;s list of safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Overall very pleased and I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that, with so many sunscreen products out there with harmful or suspect ingredients from a health standpoint, there are a few healthy choices like this one.  </li>
            <li>There are a few reviews that mention it didn&#x27;t protect from the sun, but I can testify that it worked beautifully on our kids.  </li>
            <li>my new favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of burn prevention but just to dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly, spreads nicely and, with a little rubbing in, disappears.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other brands that say they go on easily, this one really does, and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and feels really light on my skin (I even use it on my face).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the thinksport sunscreen for a few weeks now and it is great.</li>
            <li>I did use it on my face with great results, but broke out with acne in a few spots.</li>
            <li>and I developed more freckles the week I started using it).     </li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Works so well and is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I rarely give a one star to a product, but this one has earned it.  </li>
            <li>I was right, when I opened it</li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple and apparently the minimum one needs to create this great product.  </li>
            <li>This Livestrong is pretty easy to spread out (compared to the Badgers that is really thick) and smells really really pleasantly.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth application, rubs in well and has a nice slight citrus sent.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li>I look for natural products and was pleased to find positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am sure had I towled dried between each ride, I would have had to apply the sunscreen more often.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is easier to spray on something and rub in the liquid, but if you want to be safer with a physical sunscreen and avoid the harsh chemicals, this one is the best bet.</li>
            <li>It can not feel greasy or create shine on the face; must be all zinc and a high enough % of zinc to give a good ppd (a measure of uva screening, much the way spf measures protection for uvb).</li>
            <li>This is the best natural sunscreen I have come across so far: it goes on so easily, is not greasy and the white zinc rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, but it has a stronger smell than some other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more of it.  </li>
            <li>I moisturized more the next day, and applied the sunscreen again.</li>
            <li>I think I will keep use ThinkSport when I am outdoors for most of the day, on my body, but not as a daily sunscreen.    </li>
            <li>and he is outside in the sun at summer camp for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>(I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li>Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li>] works pretty well</li>
            <li>Sunblock can only do so much! :)</li>
            <li>The downside is that it&#x27;s pretty pasty</li>
            <li>Love the low hazard ratings it has on EWG.</li>
            <li>but if you rub it in better after 10 minutes of applying the white goes away.  </li>
            <li>I am upset about that, especially since I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ll be able to go through three of them at that rate.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all the harmful chemicals that most commercial sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>It is great for everyday use under make-up, especially since it is free of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I applied consistently throughout the day, as I was in and out of the water, but still burned.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!!</li>
            <li>I sustained a first degree sunBURN on the applied areas of my arms, shoulders, and neck.</li>
            <li>Who knew there was so much to know about sunscreen?!  </li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I called the company to find out why them make so many brands when all inside is the same...</li>
            <li>but it rubs in pretty well comparably.</li>
            <li>I just wish they sold it in bigger bottles! :)</li>
            <li>We used this sunscreen and for the first time on this trip (sixth trip), we did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li>I was only in the sun for an hour and a half and am incredibly sunburned.</li>
            <li>(that is full of chemicals) and had yet to be burned this year, until using this new Livestrong sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, unlike other brands.</li>
            <li>The transaction was fine, and I generally like this product</li>
            <li>One application, a good 25 minutes prior to sun exposure, and well rubbed in, lasted the entire 3.5 hours, despite the sweat.</li>
            <li>It spreads much easier than Badger, smells better, and rubs in easier without leaving a white haze on your face.</li>
            <li>After doing a little research and discovering that the 100+ aerosol Neutrogena sunscreen wasn&#x27;t very healthy for my skin or lungs, I came across Thinksport.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it is easy to apply, unlike the other low hazard sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product for the price, especially considering what other manufacturers are charging for mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I am pretty intense when it comes to sunscreen for my kids.  </li>
            <li>use it mostly for long bike</li>
            <li>I concluded the product would significantly provide more shielding from UV rays than similar sunscreens with a lesser rating.  </li>
            <li>It goes on slightly white, but absorbs very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on well, and becomes clear quickly.</li>
            <li>This product was filled with mostly water and a few chunks of sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars based on the many tubes that were as expected and will probably continue to order (unless that happens again) but be aware of the possibility of getting a tube that has gone to runny liquid and decide if you want to risk it.</li>
            <li>(I worded it neutrally like that) and about 4 reviewers said they smelled a strong citrus, so it&#x27;s not only me.  </li>
            <li>But it certainly does work when applied correctly</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a larger size, though, because we go thru it quickly!</li>
            <li>I switched to physical sunscreens a few years a go and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  </li>
            <li>As an ultra fair skinned, very active, outdoors-loving red-head, sunscreen is an area where I do not mess around.</li>
            <li>PROVIDES GREAT COVERAGE, AND LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S LIGHT ENOUGH FOR EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t want to throw this away, I just use it on my legs and arms for now to avoid having to smell the cream too much.</li>
            <li>I do not burn with it on, nor does my skin get much darker over the Summer.  </li>
            <li>sunscreen scores very well on those points for me.</li>
            <li>as much as others.</li>
            <li>We use thinkbaby/thinksport for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>:  You really have to rub it in and yes, it will sting if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I just dumped it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>It is very water resistant.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily for my tennis class, which is in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li>You really have to shower and scrub to remove it at the end of the day, because this stuff will stay on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I just try to buy it with deals as much as I can.</li>
            <li>My family of two and a baby used the whole tube up in a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stays on really well.  </li>
            <li>My son is very fair-skinned, and this sunscreen works so well on him.</li>
            <li>One of the tubes was over a year old (2/14 exp) and the second was only good for 2 1/2 months (9/15 exp).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always appreciated the help I&#x27;ve received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m in sunny Texas and not experiencing any problems with the old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is any better than no-ad or other cheaper sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Threw it in trash (was not going to carry it back to America) - bought new sunscreen at pharmacy which worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not surprising for a mineral based sunscreen though, and what&#x27;s more important is that it works.  </li>
            <li>It appears to give good sunscreen protection but does leave a slight white haze on your skin.  </li>
            <li>One ounce, or a shot glass full, is recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology.  </li>
            <li>It is very thick and requires much more time to produce a smooth coating, but it does work well</li>
            <li>The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  </li>
            <li>Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and simple.  </li>
            <li>It is not too pasty white, but it is a safe and highly-rated physical sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and while it does have an initial white cast, it settles down on my fair skin without being white, and leaves a satin finish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen for anyone who is concerned about not getting any UV sun damage.</li>
            <li>Bought four tubes and took them on vacation to the Caribbean where we had lots of sun and a high UV index each day.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>ewg gave this sunscreen high marks.  </li>
            <li>This may or may not mean something.  </li>
            <li>works maybe even a little better than think baby.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of info on there about sunscreen, much of it I was surprised to know.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is not the cheapest thing in the world and if you do not intend on heavy duty sun-baking you can settle on more affordable alternatives.</li>
            <li>and you get a lot for your money, but it leaves you most ghosted and does not protect quite as well for heavy exposure (in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens that we tested with zinc and titanium dioxides are heavy, this one is not.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like applying a thick paste to your skin.</li>
            <li>After extensive research on sunscreen this year, I decided on this one as it offers solid protection, easy to apply, and the white lotion gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>Even in Africa (where we live)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more on sunscreen this year than the last 5 years combined without increasing use.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little pasty at first but quickly dissipates after a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>If I put on too much Thinksport Livestrong Sunscreen and the zinc oxide makes my skin look ashy, I fix it by putting a little essential oil on top.</li>
            <li>in easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as the many other 50SPF lotions I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what happened, as it is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It does settle into fine lines on the face and neck slightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as white as many other mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I returned and got a refund, which was pretty simple.</li>
            <li>However, after I began running, I noticed that the Coppertone was not cutting it on \\&quot;long runs\\&quot; out in the sun on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In closing, I felt having been BURNED, not just once but twice - the first from the sun exposure and the second by the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had a different experience with this sunscreen than many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I did this recently before a trip to Mexico and purchased this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>We love that the active ingredients are safer than many other chemicals used in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>First clear liquid came out, then it was like chalky white paint.</li>
            <li>the consistency is a heavy cream that rubs in easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>zinc whiteness sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rated a 1 on the ewg website-It is on the less expensive side of great rated sunscreens-It has a moisturizing feel to it instead of the dry sandy feeling you get with a lot of sunscreens-It rubs in easier than a lot of it&#x27;s zinc oxide relatives-and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Finally tried Livestrong and got good sun protection and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away a star because it is a little pricey per ounce and because it&#x27;s so dry on application</li>
            <li>Found that you do really need to rub a solid layer into the skin as just a light layer will result in a slight sunburn, just a pinking of the skin.  </li>
            <li>They are all the SAME (same exact ingredients!).  </li>
            <li>This seems unacceptable, unless it was made clear to me before purchasing...which it was not.</li>
            <li>I received this sunscreen on the package it clearly says spf 30+, but the product description is SPF 50+ on the website.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the water, not even submerging myself completely, and after about 30 minutes of sitting outside</li>
            <li>I am on the tennis court between 11 am and 1 pm, and so far no burn.</li>
            <li>This was far from the case when I used the Thinksport sunscreen.    </li>
            <li>Not heavy or tacky...  </li>
            <li>It is non-irritating on the sensitive skin of my face.  </li>
            <li>I found that [[ASIN:B004RBZ9MM Coppertone Sunscreen Lotion, Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF, 6 oz.]</li>
            <li>Product was apparently old or out of date.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 6 month old.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely rub in and disappear, but it does the job and doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time in and near the ocean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to try goddess Garden&#x27;s [[ASIN:B002BPRTOC Kids Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 - 6 oz - Liquid]]</li>
            <li>This includes my 9 month old son who didn&#x27;t burn once.</li>
            <li>However, my kid&#x27;s sensitive skin did not react well to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived in a completely watery state.</li>
            <li>After using this for nearly a month, I still feel burnt.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has no harmful chemicals, absorbs completely</li>
            <li>The Badger took a bit longer to rub in and left me feeling greasy, while the Thinksport goes on MUCH easier and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as greasy.  </li>
            <li>Natural and I feel as though I can trust it on my kids.</li>
            <li>As others have warned, this product arrived separated into water and solids and was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>real blocks out the sun and last in the heat.  </li>
            <li>Love the texture, not too thick nor liquid.</li>
            <li>I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  </li>
            <li>The tube is small enough it fits nicely in most of my purses, so I always have it with me.  </li>
            <li>Although I prefer the smell and \\&quot;spreadability\\&quot; of this natural sunscreen compared to others I have tried, I had two major complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There will still be some white, but it certainly won&#x27;t leave you as paste white as the rest.</li>
            <li>I purchased four new bottles of different mineral sunscreens, (all exclusively zinc oxide).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed with this purchase because normally Thinksport has a great product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural sunscreens out there, but all failed me for one reason or another: Badger (too greasy, turns me purple), CA Baby (too expensive), Loving Naturals (doesn&#x27;t work, very greasy), Neutrogena Baby (harmful chemicals), and probably some others I can&#x27;t recall.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it looks like you have a slight ashy color, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth the protection.</li>
            <li>I discovered this sunscreen from the EWG ([...] ) after searching for hours for a sunblock that won&#x27;t cause me to grow tumors or be generally paranoid about cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have probably tried about ten of the best-performing options so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend a different type if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>can rub it in so that it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The one area I forgot to apply on my 2 year old&#x27;s legs was the ONLY area on ANY of us that burned.  </li>
            <li>(was using up a previous tube first before opening).  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve gone back to my old standby, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Broad Spectrum 45</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and can easily and unpleasantly smell a strong sharp citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or hot after being in the sun.</li>
            <li>This would mean a sunscreen that stays put without sweating off, no irritation or breakouts, white cast or settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li>The tube came and was filled with thin, clear liquid.</li>
            <li>Spreading thin layers once was enough for most of the summer&#x27;s days.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li>I recently was down in central America on a surf trip when I first used the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The nicest thing though by far is that with the Badger, that greasy feeling made me feel gross and unclean all day long, not so with the Thinksport.  </li>
            <li>Worked well for us used it only kids and they stayed unburnt - easy to apply reasonably priced - a small tube about half than the other \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; products</li>
            <li>There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  </li>
            <li>Both scored the ideal score of 1 with EWG, which means it has the least number of dangerous chemicals in its ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that if I haven&#x27;t shaved and have some stubble on my face, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it rubbed in completely in those areas, but that&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m normally clean-shaven.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice but discrete smell.</li>
            <li> I do like that it&#x27;s not greasy, but it also needs to be effective.</li>
            <li> WHO NEEDS AN EFFECTIVE BLOCK</li>
            <li> NICE SCENT TOO.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very effective.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this product before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> nice feel and consistency.</li>
            <li> , I feel that honest, effective reviews, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.</li>
            <li> nice smell, quite water resistance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen before and liked it</li>
            <li> The smell is a very mild and pleasant orange smell, not the chemical smells of some sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> better than most!</li>
            <li> Nice to see a company put some effort into creating a top notch product.</li>
            <li> not sticky; nice scent; lasts for hours and hours;  I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not as light as non-nano zinc oxide sunscreens, but the price make this a good buy.</li>
            <li> With all the chemicals and toxins put into the products we buy, I try to research before for buying for myself and my family to find the healthiest and most effective products.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, after visiting their website (visit [...]), I was thrilled that I was purchasing from an independent company with excellent core values.     </li>
            <li> This worked very well for us, good sun protection when reapplied after swimming, good water resistance.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, feels fine, works fine, and best of all free of toxic chemicals (PABA, Parabens, Benzoate, Phthalates,</li>
            <li> Got it on sale - love that too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a couple more tubes for the summer.</li>
            <li> I also love the shu uemura sunscreen, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the safety of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS IS THE BEST SUNBLOCK FOR THE ENTIRE BODY.</li>
            <li> I will buy more to get us thru the rest summer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.</li>
            <li> My child is 4yrs and is allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely repurchase one of the best 20% zinc oxide sunscreens!</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Received sunscreen just before travel to Europe (order process and delivery were OK).</li>
            <li> How many suncreens offer SPF 50</li>
            <li> And it tastes ok.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, but was sent two defective tubes.  </li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I started getting rashes from my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I like feeling safe</li>
            <li> However, the protection is better, I hope.</li>
            <li> This was better than another product (Elta MD) with these ingredients.</li>
            <li> But, we won&#x27;t get skin cancer from this time we went to Aruba.  :-)  </li>
            <li> I researched alternative sunscreens without oxybenzone and found this on EWGs website for safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> The expiration date on the sunscreen is 6 months from Jun 2012 which most sunscreen should have about 2 years shelf life.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I love everything about it, except it is NOT water resistant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Anyway I love it</li>
            <li> most sunscreens sting, are overly perfumed, or cause me an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I re-applied more, liberally.</li>
            <li> you want to know more about sunscreen, you should look at the EWG website (search EWG sunscreen).  </li>
            <li> I love the thinkbaby version for my toddlers too.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this-</li>
            <li> so I feel it&#x27;s a safe option for me to use on my kids.  </li>
            <li> in very nicely without too much &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought it to protect my tattoo and so far so good!  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve found that sticks with me for a good while, plus it contains zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> It has protected me fine, no different than the Badger; I&#x27;m very happy with its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> so could more easily return for refund).</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and was intentional about lathering up a good bit before heading outside.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a pretty good job blocking the sun, but the scent is way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Rubbed on clear and is great.</li>
            <li> This works great for my sun sensitive</li>
            <li> The product itself takes some rubbing in, but I like the light citrus smell, and it works most of the time for me, although there are occasions when it does not.</li>
            <li> All natural, great sun protection, and it stays on in the water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as far as the product is concerned, its a great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> for a really good sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I put it on subscribe and save and plan on going through dozens on tubes this summer.</li>
            <li> love the fact that this product just sits on top of the skin (versus the other kind which goes into the bloodstream).&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and feels great.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to order sunscreen with an effective use span much longer than two months.</li>
            <li> ... wipes on fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays put well when sweating, and has a very mild irritation if it gets in my eyes, unlike most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it goes on smooth, and more importantly, I did not get a burn.</li>
            <li> It goes on SO easy, even on squirmy kids.</li>
            <li> I can easily get close to two hours before I need to reapply when running-</li>
            <li> It smells good, doesn&#x27;t separate when it sits, and blends into the skin nicely -- doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue</li>
            <li> You can tell it provides a strong, protective barrier because the water beads up all over the skin.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, rubs in pretty well</li>
            <li> I should have reapplied this sunscreen but didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to do so and it held up just fine.  </li>
            <li> a hint of citrus and super refreshing.</li>
            <li> It certainly lives up to its billing as water resistant and is effective at preventing sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I tested this one on a cloudless, bright sunshiny, 92 degree day for my 32 mile bike ride.</li>
            <li> So, it sits on top of the skin and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin creating all sorts of hormonal disruption.</li>
            <li> Free of all harmful chemicals, non-nano and water resistant for up to 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish it could have been fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I was my face in the morning and use a light moisturizer once a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product for my whole family, so now I don&#x27;t have to buy separate sunscreens for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> It works really well and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a mineral based sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> light lemony (?)</li>
            <li> smell but light fragrances (orange for baby, lemon for sport)</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable  putting this on my kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and happy with result.</li>
            <li> But this time I ordered 2 bottles and both were filled with a water like substance.</li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> It is a great physical sun blocker.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had numerous comments on my great tan.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not too greesy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li> Been ordering and using this brand for some time; was always very happy with it until last order; one tube turned out to be very watery/unusable.  </li>
            <li> SO far so good.</li>
            <li> The scent is a very very light citrus when you first apply but then the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have normally loved it!!</li>
            <li> With all the debate surrounding chemicals in sunscreen, it&#x27;s nice to know that someone is putting forth the effort to make a sunscreen with the only undisputed safe ingredient (zinc oxide)</li>
            <li> THE MANUFACTURER  WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT AND EVEN ADD A FREE TUBE.</li>
            <li> Protection seems pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> The whole family is enjoying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Medium viscosity, rubs in well (but not as well if you have facial hair), smells good, works.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a fresh orange scent, not annoying or persistent.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has good protection and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I let it cool in my air-conditioned house, and tried to shake it and mash it up again.</li>
            <li> After shaking and trying to keep it in a cool place there was no helping it get to the correct consistency.</li>
            <li> I really like this better than the Badger sunscreen line.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in well, smells nice, and as far as I can tell it works.</li>
            <li> It stays on, and is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of chemicals like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.uct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li> Great for active people.</li>
            <li> I also like how it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it ranked high on EWG&#x27;s list of safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Overall very pleased and I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that, with so many sunscreen products out there with harmful or suspect ingredients from a health standpoint, there are a few healthy choices like this one.  </li>
            <li> There are a few reviews that mention it didn&#x27;t protect from the sun, but I can testify that it worked beautifully on our kids.  </li>
            <li> my new favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of burn prevention but just to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, spreads nicely and, with a little rubbing in, disappears.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other brands that say they go on easily, this one really does, and it smells good too.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and feels really light on my skin (I even use it on my face).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the thinksport sunscreen for a few weeks now and it is great.</li>
            <li> I did use it on my face with great results, but broke out with acne in a few spots.</li>
            <li> and I developed more freckles the week I started using it).     </li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works so well and is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I rarely give a one star to a product, but this one has earned it.  </li>
            <li> I was right, when I opened it</li>
            <li> The ingredients are simple and apparently the minimum one needs to create this great product.  </li>
            <li> This Livestrong is pretty easy to spread out (compared to the Badgers that is really thick) and smells really really pleasantly.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth application, rubs in well and has a nice slight citrus sent.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li> I look for natural products and was pleased to find positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am sure had I towled dried between each ride, I would have had to apply the sunscreen more often.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is easier to spray on something and rub in the liquid, but if you want to be safer with a physical sunscreen and avoid the harsh chemicals, this one is the best bet.</li>
            <li> It can not feel greasy or create shine on the face; must be all zinc and a high enough % of zinc to give a good ppd (a measure of uva screening, much the way spf measures protection for uvb).</li>
            <li> This is the best natural sunscreen I have come across so far: it goes on so easily, is not greasy and the white zinc rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, but it has a stronger smell than some other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more of it.  </li>
            <li> I moisturized more the next day, and applied the sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> I think I will keep use ThinkSport when I am outdoors for most of the day, on my body, but not as a daily sunscreen.    </li>
            <li> and he is outside in the sun at summer camp for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li> Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>
            <li> ] works pretty well</li>
            <li> Sunblock can only do so much! :)</li>
            <li> The downside is that it&#x27;s pretty pasty</li>
            <li> Love the low hazard ratings it has on EWG.</li>
            <li> but if you rub it in better after 10 minutes of applying the white goes away.  </li>
            <li> I am upset about that, especially since I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ll be able to go through three of them at that rate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all the harmful chemicals that most commercial sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> It is great for everyday use under make-up, especially since it is free of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I applied consistently throughout the day, as I was in and out of the water, but still burned.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!!</li>
            <li> I sustained a first degree sunBURN on the applied areas of my arms, shoulders, and neck.</li>
            <li> Who knew there was so much to know about sunscreen?!  </li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I called the company to find out why them make so many brands when all inside is the same...</li>
            <li> but it rubs in pretty well comparably.</li>
            <li> I just wish they sold it in bigger bottles! :)</li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen and for the first time on this trip (sixth trip), we did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li> I was only in the sun for an hour and a half and am incredibly sunburned.</li>
            <li> (that is full of chemicals) and had yet to be burned this year, until using this new Livestrong sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> The transaction was fine, and I generally like this product</li>
            <li> One application, a good 25 minutes prior to sun exposure, and well rubbed in, lasted the entire 3.5 hours, despite the sweat.</li>
            <li> It spreads much easier than Badger, smells better, and rubs in easier without leaving a white haze on your face.</li>
            <li> After doing a little research and discovering that the 100+ aerosol Neutrogena sunscreen wasn&#x27;t very healthy for my skin or lungs, I came across Thinksport.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and it is easy to apply, unlike the other low hazard sunscreens I have tried.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for the price, especially considering what other manufacturers are charging for mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am pretty intense when it comes to sunscreen for my kids.  </li>
            <li> use it mostly for long bike</li>
            <li> I concluded the product would significantly provide more shielding from UV rays than similar sunscreens with a lesser rating.  </li>
            <li> It goes on slightly white, but absorbs very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on well, and becomes clear quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was filled with mostly water and a few chunks of sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars based on the many tubes that were as expected and will probably continue to order (unless that happens again) but be aware of the possibility of getting a tube that has gone to runny liquid and decide if you want to risk it.</li>
            <li> (I worded it neutrally like that) and about 4 reviewers said they smelled a strong citrus, so it&#x27;s not only me.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly does work when applied correctly</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger size, though, because we go thru it quickly!</li>
            <li> I switched to physical sunscreens a few years a go and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  </li>
            <li> As an ultra fair skinned, very active, outdoors-loving red-head, sunscreen is an area where I do not mess around.</li>
            <li> PROVIDES GREAT COVERAGE, AND LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S LIGHT ENOUGH FOR EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to throw this away, I just use it on my legs and arms for now to avoid having to smell the cream too much.</li>
            <li> I do not burn with it on, nor does my skin get much darker over the Summer.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen scores very well on those points for me.</li>
            <li> as much as others.</li>
            <li> We use thinkbaby/thinksport for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> Really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> :  You really have to rub it in and yes, it will sting if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I just dumped it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> It is very water resistant.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily for my tennis class, which is in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> You really have to shower and scrub to remove it at the end of the day, because this stuff will stay on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I just try to buy it with deals as much as I can.</li>
            <li> My family of two and a baby used the whole tube up in a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stays on really well.  </li>
            <li> My son is very fair-skinned, and this sunscreen works so well on him.</li>
            <li> One of the tubes was over a year old (2/14 exp) and the second was only good for 2 1/2 months (9/15 exp).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always appreciated the help I&#x27;ve received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m in sunny Texas and not experiencing any problems with the old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is any better than no-ad or other cheaper sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Threw it in trash (was not going to carry it back to America) - bought new sunscreen at pharmacy which worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not surprising for a mineral based sunscreen though, and what&#x27;s more important is that it works.  </li>
            <li> It appears to give good sunscreen protection but does leave a slight white haze on your skin.  </li>
            <li> One ounce, or a shot glass full, is recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and requires much more time to produce a smooth coating, but it does work well</li>
            <li> The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  </li>
            <li> Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and simple.  </li>
            <li> It is not too pasty white, but it is a safe and highly-rated physical sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and while it does have an initial white cast, it settles down on my fair skin without being white, and leaves a satin finish.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen for anyone who is concerned about not getting any UV sun damage.</li>
            <li> Bought four tubes and took them on vacation to the Caribbean where we had lots of sun and a high UV index each day.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> ewg gave this sunscreen high marks.  </li>
            <li> This may or may not mean something.  </li>
            <li> works maybe even a little better than think baby.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of info on there about sunscreen, much of it I was surprised to know.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is not the cheapest thing in the world and if you do not intend on heavy duty sun-baking you can settle on more affordable alternatives.</li>
            <li> and you get a lot for your money, but it leaves you most ghosted and does not protect quite as well for heavy exposure (in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens that we tested with zinc and titanium dioxides are heavy, this one is not.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like applying a thick paste to your skin.</li>
            <li> After extensive research on sunscreen this year, I decided on this one as it offers solid protection, easy to apply, and the white lotion gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> Even in Africa (where we live)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more on sunscreen this year than the last 5 years combined without increasing use.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little pasty at first but quickly dissipates after a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> If I put on too much Thinksport Livestrong Sunscreen and the zinc oxide makes my skin look ashy, I fix it by putting a little essential oil on top.</li>
            <li> in easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as the many other 50SPF lotions I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, as it is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It does settle into fine lines on the face and neck slightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as white as many other mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I returned and got a refund, which was pretty simple.</li>
            <li> However, after I began running, I noticed that the Coppertone was not cutting it on \\&quot;long runs\\&quot; out in the sun on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In closing, I felt having been BURNED, not just once but twice - the first from the sun exposure and the second by the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had a different experience with this sunscreen than many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I did this recently before a trip to Mexico and purchased this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> We love that the active ingredients are safer than many other chemicals used in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> First clear liquid came out, then it was like chalky white paint.</li>
            <li> the consistency is a heavy cream that rubs in easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> zinc whiteness sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated a 1 on the ewg website-It is on the less expensive side of great rated sunscreens-It has a moisturizing feel to it instead of the dry sandy feeling you get with a lot of sunscreens-It rubs in easier than a lot of it&#x27;s zinc oxide relatives-and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Finally tried Livestrong and got good sun protection and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away a star because it is a little pricey per ounce and because it&#x27;s so dry on application</li>
            <li> Found that you do really need to rub a solid layer into the skin as just a light layer will result in a slight sunburn, just a pinking of the skin.  </li>
            <li> They are all the SAME (same exact ingredients!).  </li>
            <li> This seems unacceptable, unless it was made clear to me before purchasing...which it was not.</li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen on the package it clearly says spf 30+, but the product description is SPF 50+ on the website.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the water, not even submerging myself completely, and after about 30 minutes of sitting outside</li>
            <li> I am on the tennis court between 11 am and 1 pm, and so far no burn.</li>
            <li> This was far from the case when I used the Thinksport sunscreen.    </li>
            <li> Not heavy or tacky...  </li>
            <li> It is non-irritating on the sensitive skin of my face.  </li>
            <li> I found that [[ASIN:B004RBZ9MM Coppertone Sunscreen Lotion, Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF, 6 oz.]</li>
            <li> Product was apparently old or out of date.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 6 month old.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely rub in and disappear, but it does the job and doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in and near the ocean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to try goddess Garden&#x27;s [[ASIN:B002BPRTOC Kids Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 - 6 oz - Liquid]]</li>
            <li> This includes my 9 month old son who didn&#x27;t burn once.</li>
            <li> However, my kid&#x27;s sensitive skin did not react well to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived in a completely watery state.</li>
            <li> After using this for nearly a month, I still feel burnt.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has no harmful chemicals, absorbs completely</li>
            <li> The Badger took a bit longer to rub in and left me feeling greasy, while the Thinksport goes on MUCH easier and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as greasy.  </li>
            <li> Natural and I feel as though I can trust it on my kids.</li>
            <li> As others have warned, this product arrived separated into water and solids and was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> real blocks out the sun and last in the heat.  </li>
            <li> Love the texture, not too thick nor liquid.</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  </li>
            <li> The tube is small enough it fits nicely in most of my purses, so I always have it with me.  </li>
            <li> Although I prefer the smell and \\&quot;spreadability\\&quot; of this natural sunscreen compared to others I have tried, I had two major complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There will still be some white, but it certainly won&#x27;t leave you as paste white as the rest.</li>
            <li> I purchased four new bottles of different mineral sunscreens, (all exclusively zinc oxide).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this purchase because normally Thinksport has a great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural sunscreens out there, but all failed me for one reason or another: Badger (too greasy, turns me purple), CA Baby (too expensive), Loving Naturals (doesn&#x27;t work, very greasy), Neutrogena Baby (harmful chemicals), and probably some others I can&#x27;t recall.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it looks like you have a slight ashy color, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth the protection.</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen from the EWG ([...] ) after searching for hours for a sunblock that won&#x27;t cause me to grow tumors or be generally paranoid about cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have probably tried about ten of the best-performing options so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend a different type if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> can rub it in so that it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The one area I forgot to apply on my 2 year old&#x27;s legs was the ONLY area on ANY of us that burned.  </li>
            <li> (was using up a previous tube first before opening).  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve gone back to my old standby, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Broad Spectrum 45</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and can easily and unpleasantly smell a strong sharp citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or hot after being in the sun.</li>
            <li> This would mean a sunscreen that stays put without sweating off, no irritation or breakouts, white cast or settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li> The tube came and was filled with thin, clear liquid.</li>
            <li> Spreading thin layers once was enough for most of the summer&#x27;s days.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li> I recently was down in central America on a surf trip when I first used the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The nicest thing though by far is that with the Badger, that greasy feeling made me feel gross and unclean all day long, not so with the Thinksport.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for us used it only kids and they stayed unburnt - easy to apply reasonably priced - a small tube about half than the other \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; products</li>
            <li> There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  </li>
            <li> Both scored the ideal score of 1 with EWG, which means it has the least number of dangerous chemicals in its ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that if I haven&#x27;t shaved and have some stubble on my face, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it rubbed in completely in those areas, but that&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m normally clean-shaven.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is thin enough to spread evenly and thick enough to offer good coverage.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost, but it&#x27;s in the normal price range for natural products of this kind...and if we didn&#x27;t live in So Cali and go through gallons every summer, I wouldn&#x27;t be in the poorhouse just due to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients list, leaves a whiteish sheen that isn&#x27;t quite as bad as other zinc oxide-based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Well, it is worth the ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit of a smaller bottle and goes on pretty thick</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading a few reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this was a bad batch or a seller issue because my previous purchase was great.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old was not allowed to put sunscreen on his face due to allergies, but I tried this one out on him and he did not get a rash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ridiculously sun sensitive, I burn in 2-3 minutes in direct sun.  </li>
            <li> It does stick to hair pretty tightly, so where there&#x27;s hair, there&#x27;s a pale whiteness to go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> knew something was wrong when a heard a sloshing sound when I picked the bottle out of the package, as if liquid were inside.</li>
            <li> So I am using it on my face so I can smell it for long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it for a long, long</li>
            <li> It works on runs, and it worked for me all day long at a waterpark in Texas.  </li>
            <li> I never have to reapply it even on long kayak trips.</li>
            <li> We did &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; on this and used it all summer long.</li>
            <li> Spent several weeks in sunny Morocco with no exposure to water and often, but not always, twice a day applications.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product since I have pale, sensitive skin and get a reaction if I use chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other brands and still got rashes.</li>
            <li> When my husband put it on his face, well, it was a little embarrassing; there is a definite white film that does not blend in well, no matter what you do, esp where just barely-shaved whiskers are involved.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other way of getting BURNED further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that dont give the same protection as this.</li>
            <li> The skin was so dry that it gave a white-tish cast around my mouth, and T-zone.</li>
            <li> I also found the sunscreen stayed greasy feeling, never seeming to dry or &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> As an avid cyclist in a humid climate having something that protects my skin, without a bunch of chemicals, and that doesn&#x27;t just sweat away has been tough to find.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small 3 oz is.  </li>
            <li> The seller ships near outdated stock OR ships current stock manufactured with short expiration dates to promote ongoing purchases of an ineffective product.  </li>
            <li> Product was completely separated into a watery mess with small white chunks.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the week, I had developed some small pink blemishes across my cheekbones.    </li>
            <li> I had been using a chemical sunscreen and it was making my skin a little red.</li>
            <li> I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> A little white stays on the skin</li>
            <li> On active wet long days I reapplied to shoulders, chest and face.</li>
            <li> Very thick,  stays put,  doesnt sweat off very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is seriously the ONLY SPF 50 sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cake up your face, AND it isn&#x27;t full of most of the nasty chemicals you find in store-brand sunscreens.</li>
            <li> When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all.  </li>
            <li> Small sample sizes for reapplication while on long bike rides, and larger sizes for keeping at home</li>
            <li> It does leave a ghosty hue, but that is expected with non-nano zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m not absorbing toxins from the item that is supposed to protect me.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY ONE that works (fantastically - been using up a few expired bottles this summer</li>
            <li> 20% Zinc, non greasy, non sticky, NOT white, doesn&#x27;t stain cloths and does not feel like a heavy layer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water proof, I only applied it a few minutes before we got in.  </li>
            <li> In the past when I have been down in central America, I always felt that the other sunscreens only lasted about an hour</li>
            <li> Every other tube has always been as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, though, so it&#x27;s sort of hard to rub on.  </li>
            <li> I have started mixing it with some other lotion (that probably causes cancer)</li>
            <li> The citrus-y smell did not bother me, but it makes me question what other smells they were trying to cover with it.     </li>
            <li> The other two I use on my arms/legs.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this Livestrong sunscreen again, maybe not the other two.</li>
            <li> Also the consistency of this sunscreen is thinner and for that reason easier to spread on skin than some of the other ones that are mineral-based.  </li>
            <li> It almost fully rubs in - a bit of ghosting, but a small price to pay for avoiding sunburns and potential skin cancer.</li>
            <li> That is only three servings in this one small tube.  </li>
            <li> I even used in on my face and my nose didn&#x27;t even get pink!  </li>
            <li> Definitely purchase if looking for an everyday sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I cringe when I see other parents using the chemical-laden spray sunscreen on their kids.  </li>
            <li> I applied the correct amount, waited 30 minutes before going out in the sun and never got very wet.</li>
            <li> The ad referenced a protection factor of 50+ with Zinc Oxide 20% as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the active ingredient oxidizes and become inert promptly after manufacturing.  </li>
            <li> In the past, some of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried have been impossible to apply.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find, but here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;-great, non-toxic ingredient list (1 on EWG skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s our only complaint.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we did NOT get much of a tan in Aruba.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong item and very upset about it.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen arrived separated, and all that came out was either watery liquid or thick white paste.</li>
            <li> but that was like twelve bucks down the drain.</li>
            <li> Even using it down on my shin I can smell it.  </li>
            <li> Tube was full of water?! :(</li>
            <li> I am black (African-American) with caramel color skin.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a less toxic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reviewing sunscreens that have less chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> and we went through about half the tube.  </li>
            <li> He is not in the water but is very active and has not had a need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> This came to me a vile, liquid mess.  </li>
            <li> it is too thick for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the small packaging for the price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is hard to rub in at all, and it lasts for a long time!!</li>
            <li> still think this is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy for 3 oz.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is labeled as a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; sunscreen I use this on my little kids too (twins age 3, son age 4).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little getting used to using the zinc based stuff b/c</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick and does have a scent, but it will not &#x27;ghost&#x27; you (aka leave a white layer on your skin)</li>
            <li> It feels nice in the skin although it is a little boring to spread.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this stuff a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> stays on well, reapply every few hours</li>
            <li> for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and haven&#x27;t felt the need to try anything else</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product,  I have used it a few times on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was using Badger for a few years and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> We are going on a cruise in a few weeks and have bought their baby sunscreen for my grandchildern.</li>
            <li> bought ThinkSport for an outrageous price at Whole Foods since it has so much zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> When you compare efficacy and price, I think other sunscreens have a hard time beating this one.  </li>
            <li> this is a waste of money its so small not worth what they are asking for it!</li>
            <li> it was a little thick, but i rubbed it on with a little body lotion</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a little hard to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little thick and takes a some additional time to rub in compared to a chemical product.</li>
            <li> wish that they also made a lotion, because this is a little too thick and pasty, sometimes.</li>
            <li> Or it was the summer humidity and excessive air conditioning in my workplace that caused the flare ups.</li>
            <li> This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened there</li>
            <li> I have purchased Thinksport sunscreen in the past, but not specifically the Livestrong version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively small woman, Under 5 foot 4 inches, but my husband is 6&#x27; 6&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a 1 or a 2)</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to keep buying small 3 oz tubes.</li>
            <li> Its a small tube for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> My product is defective and probably not safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want to protect yourself from sun with a product that (my wife says) won&#x27;t give you cancer and also (I say) makes you itch like crazy (due to dry skin)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less expensive then other mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My first very unhappy purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> They have all left lots of &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; faces and I deal with crying from my kids about looking crazy.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try to avoid it, some of this stuff seems to get into my eyes when being washed off.  </li>
            <li> Seemed a bit expensive but for a sunscreen without all the &#x27;bad stuff&amp;#34; it seems worth it.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend (or at least bit and try while still home</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I ordered 3 of these in late June 2015 and they all EXPIRE in Sept. 2015.</li>
            <li> And at least amazon has it for 33% off.</li>
            <li> Iam sorry that I spent the money on two tubes.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> , this stuff is a bit thick for faces, so consider something like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is THICK &amp; does not come off well, as reviewers mention.</li>
            <li> I play tennis and needed some sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on my face.  </li>
            <li> Badger has a toothpaste consistency while Thinksport has a thick shampoo consistency.  </li>
            <li> Quiet disappointed since the expiration date shown on each tube is less than a year since I bought them while I can find out there in the store with expiration dates up to June 2016!</li>
            <li> quality, poor lot, not sure.....</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because it arrived completely separated.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s also a little difficult to apply--sort chalky.  </li>
            <li> lasts longer than less expensive brands which are too thin.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a slight whiteness, but really not that bad) and it works!  </li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is very thick</li>
            <li> The product comes out of the tube very thick and takes some effort to apply.  </li>
            <li> Also it does have a scent to it which is not really that bad</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the sunscreen, but it goes on thick, gooey and makes you look pasty and ill.  </li>
            <li> Seal on product was broken.</li>
            <li> Extremely annoyed.</li>
            <li> false advertisement on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> only sort of annoying part is that after heavy sweating, the whiteness comes out and beads on your skin, but at that point, i&#x27;m so disgusting anyway, that a little color of sunscreen doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on a little chalky, but if you don&#x27;t cake yourself in it, and take some time to rub it in, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just a bad batch from the manufacturer or counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a pearly sheen to your skin, which isn&#x27;t that noticeable, but is a little annoying to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had melonoma, so sunscreen is a must for me, however the idea of lathering chemicals on my body has always made me uncomfortable.  .  </li>
            <li> I have returned to using Ombrelle 30 spf and also the touch up stick, but I&#x27;m also skeptical of this product (as it is chemical based</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find a sun screen that stays on, this stuff does.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to find sun protection that outlasts runners sweat.</li>
            <li> How wrong I concluded.  </li>
            <li> Quite simply, this product did a terrible job protecting my nose</li>
            <li> really sorry I trusted Thinksport and didn&#x27;t bother to bring my Neutrogena overseas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, not a great seller - buy this somewhere else!</li>
            <li> Checked all my sunscreens at home and they were all so bad, so I went to research for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Others had a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad, rubs in well.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product and will not be wasting $$ on this again.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing after using it for 2 days that when I returned home with flaky skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently tossed all of my chemical sunscreens as a result of the EWG report from 2012. As an ultra fair skinned, very active, outdoors-loving red-head, sunscreen is an area where I do not mess around. I purchased four new bottles of different mineral sunscreens, (all exclusively zinc oxide). I tested this one on a cloudless, bright sunshiny, 92 degree day for my 32 mile bike ride. One application, a good 25 minutes prior to sun exposure, and well rubbed in, lasted the entire 3.5 hours, despite the sweat. Definitely a great product for the price, especially considering what other manufacturers are charging for mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the only sunscreen I allow my children to use.  It is the same product as &amp;#34;ThinkBaby&amp;#34;.  Both scored the ideal score of 1 with EWG, which means it has the least number of dangerous chemicals in its ingredients.  It goes on slightly white, but absorbs very, very quickly.  The white helps them know what parts of their face or body hasn&#x27;t been covered, yet, so it doesn&#x27;t concern me.  The smell is a very mild and pleasant orange smell, not the chemical smells of some sunscreens.  This is a physical sunscreen, not a chemical one.  So, it sits on top of the skin and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin creating all sorts of hormonal disruption.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product on the Dr. Oz show.  Had never heard of &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunscreen (versus the &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; sunscreens).&lt;br /&gt;and love the fact that this product just sits on top of the skin (versus the other kind which goes into the bloodstream).&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and feels great.  Will definitely purchase more of it.  Got it on sale - love that too.</li>
            <li> This product goes on well, and becomes clear quickly. It stays on, and is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of chemicals like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural sunscreen I have come across so far: it goes on so easily, is not greasy and the white zinc rubs in nicely. You don&#x27;t notice that you&#x27;re wearing it! Love the texture, not too thick nor liquid. Nice but discrete smell. The whole family is enjoying this sunscreen. Free of all harmful chemicals, non-nano and water resistant for up to 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works great and feels good on my skin. I had been using a chemical sunscreen and it was making my skin a little red. This stuff seems to work well in a beach environment and while sweating. It is a little thick and takes a some additional time to rub in compared to a chemical product. Also it does have a scent to it which is not really that bad but you can definitely smell it.  Overall very pleased and I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> If you want to protect yourself from sun with a product that (my wife says) won&#x27;t give you cancer and also (I say) makes you itch like crazy (due to dry skin), this is a great product. Well, it&#x27;s also a little difficult to apply--sort chalky.  I have started mixing it with some other lotion (that probably causes cancer) when applying so I&#x27;m not laying awake at night trying to reach that itch on my back.  That said, it does block the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had melonoma, so sunscreen is a must for me, however the idea of lathering chemicals on my body has always made me uncomfortable.  .  I bought this sunscreen because it ranked high on EWG&#x27;s list of safe sunscreens.  I love it!  It smells nice, rubs in pretty well (there&#x27;s a slight whiteness, but really not that bad) and it works!  The tube is small enough it fits nicely in most of my purses, so I always have it with me.  I&#x27;ve already purchased a couple more tubes for the summer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen. Once I learned about mineral based sunscreens and looking up EWG&#x27;s 2011 sunscreen guide, I decided to give this brand a try. Furthermore, after visiting their website (visit [...]), I was thrilled that I was purchasing from an independent company with excellent core values.     The texture of this sunscreen is excellent. It does leave a bit of a white cast if you don&#x27;t rub thoroughly. I wish it could have been fragrance free. The citrus-y smell did not bother me, but it makes me question what other smells they were trying to cover with it.     It was very disappointing after using it for 2 days that when I returned home with flaky skin. The skin was so dry that it gave a white-tish cast around my mouth, and T-zone. I&#x27;ve never had that happen to me before. I moisturized more the next day, and applied the sunscreen again. By the end of the week, I had developed some small pink blemishes across my cheekbones.    I should mention that I have excellent skin. I was my face in the morning and use a light moisturizer once a day. So perhaps changing my daily routine agitated my skin. Or it was the summer humidity and excessive air conditioning in my workplace that caused the flare ups. In terms of sun protection, I think it does a good job. My skin didn&#x27;t feel tight or hot after being in the sun. I think I will keep use ThinkSport when I am outdoors for most of the day, on my body, but not as a daily sunscreen.    It&#x27;s been two weeks, and I stopped using this sunscreen to let my skin settle. I have returned to using Ombrelle 30 spf and also the touch up stick, but I&#x27;m also skeptical of this product (as it is chemical based and I developed more freckles the week I started using it).     I used to use La Roche Posay 60 (for 3 years) until I read about the EWG guidelines. I might have to return to this product, as I never had any issues with it. I also love the shu uemura sunscreen, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the safety of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this stuff a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m THRILLED!  I use it on a daily basis, but I also put it to the sweat test: hiking in the desert, running at the beach, and skiing in the mountains and it works wonderfully in all conditions. It absorbs fast and feels really light on my skin (I even use it on my face). It smells great too...a hint of citrus and super refreshing. With all the debate surrounding chemicals in sunscreen, it&#x27;s nice to know that someone is putting forth the effort to make a sunscreen with the only undisputed safe ingredient (zinc oxide) and it&#x27;s actually a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the thinksport sunscreen for a few weeks now and it is great. As an avid cyclist in a humid climate having something that protects my skin, without a bunch of chemicals, and that doesn&#x27;t just sweat away has been tough to find. thinksport met the challenge! Nice to see a company put some effort into creating a top notch product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen after seeing that it had a great rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website. I was looking for a sunscreen without a bunch of harmful chemicals that isn&#x27;t greasy. I applied the correct amount, waited 30 minutes before going out in the sun and never got very wet. I was only in the sun for an hour and a half and am incredibly sunburned. I have been using up the last bit of my Neutrogena sunscreen from last year (that is full of chemicals) and had yet to be burned this year, until using this new Livestrong sunscreen. I do like that it&#x27;s not greasy, but it also needs to be effective. The search continues...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of sunscreens on EWG&#x27;s website. Checked all my sunscreens at home and they were all so bad, so I went to research for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; sunscreen. I am a tennis player and in the California sun a lot. I found 3 with the low hazard rating (1) and \\&quot;good\\&quot; to \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; protection. This Livestrong, another one by Thinksport (Thinkbaby) and Badger&#x27;s. They all leave white layer on you, because of the Zinc. This Livestrong is pretty easy to spread out (compared to the Badgers that is really thick) and smells really really pleasantly. So I am using it on my face so I can smell it for long time. The other two I use on my arms/legs. I will purchase this Livestrong sunscreen again, maybe not the other two. Protection seems pretty good so far. I am on the tennis court between 11 am and 1 pm, and so far no burn.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both like the coverage this sunscreen provides without being greasy or sticky.  Wish it came in a larger size, though, because we go thru it quickly!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT NON-TOXIC SUNBLOCK THAT BLENDS EASILY, PROVIDES GREAT COVERAGE, AND LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND. BOUGHT SOME FOR MY DAUGHTER, WHO NEEDS AN EFFECTIVE BLOCK THAT&#x27;S LIGHT ENOUGH FOR EVERY DAY. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST SUNBLOCK FOR THE ENTIRE BODY. NICE SCENT TOO.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a low hazard rating in the Environmental Working Group sunscreen guide. It has a nice smell and it is easy to apply, unlike the other low hazard sunscreens I have tried. It will make your skin look white if you don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. It&#x27;s a nice product for my whole family, so now I don&#x27;t have to buy separate sunscreens for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> I recently was down in central America on a surf trip when I first used the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen. Not only did the sunscreen prevent me from getting sunburned while I was surfing out in the water for 2-3 hours per surf session, but I did not feel as though I had to re-apply the sunscreen while in the water. In the past when I have been down in central America, I always felt that the other sunscreens only lasted about an hour before I felt the sun starting to get to me. This was far from the case when I used the Thinksport sunscreen.    I highly recommend the Thinksport Livestrong sunscreen for anyone who is concerned about not getting any UV sun damage. Whether if you are a surfer, beachgoer, or for any outdoor activity, Thinksport is essential.       [[ASIN:B004WO9RJA thinksport LIVESTRONG sunscreen, SPF 30 +, 3oz]]</li>
            <li> It works really well and smells nice.  It&#x27;s pretty thick, though, so it&#x27;s sort of hard to rub on.  It also leaves a pearly sheen to your skin, which isn&#x27;t that noticeable, but is a little annoying to me.  It&#x27;s not surprising for a mineral based sunscreen though, and what&#x27;s more important is that it works.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This sunblock leaves a very white film on the skin and requires thorough rubbing to dissolve it. It seems to do a pretty good job blocking the sun, but the scent is way too strong for me. I have a headache if I apply the cream on my face or neck area. The scent is unbearable and it smells like synthetic fragrance. I wish it came with an unscented formula. Since I don&#x27;t want to throw this away, I just use it on my legs and arms for now to avoid having to smell the cream too much.</li>
            <li> Purchased this sunscreen based on review by EWG.  I have a child and did not want to use a sunscreen with ingredients that have a potential to affect hormones.  This is a mineral based sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is fragrance free.  We put it on in the morning and he is outside in the sun at summer camp for most of the day.  He is not in the water but is very active and has not had a need to reapply.  I&#x27;ve used it myself and it&#x27;s really nice.  I will buy more to get us thru the rest summer.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading about it on website regarding sunscreens. light lemony (?) smell, rubs in well, good for all over body and face. Would buy this again in a heartbeat. Used Mustela on face for touch ups. Held up well in the ocean water.</li>
            <li> I never had the opportunity to try it because I requested a refund for both tubes. One of the tubes was over a year old (2/14 exp) and the second was only good for 2 1/2 months (9/15 exp). Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit expensive but for a sunscreen without all the &#x27;bad stuff&amp;#34; it seems worth it.  Rubbed on clear and is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone on three-hour bike rides in 90+ heat and sun without getting burnt.  I should have reapplied this sunscreen but didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to do so and it held up just fine.  I like that it&#x27;s zinc-based instead of chemical.  I use it also on my face without issue.  Do not put it above your eyes (forehead) if you plan on sweating/swimming, it isn&#x27;t pleasant when it gets in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, spreads nicely and, with a little rubbing in, disappears.  It does stick to hair pretty tightly, so where there&#x27;s hair, there&#x27;s a pale whiteness to go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinksport sort of disappears on you, you don&#x27;t notice it.  This is a big plus when exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I switched to physical sunscreens a few years a go and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very effective.  I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.) since using this brand.&lt;br /&gt;-Good water resistance.  This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof.  Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all.  To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  This is a big problem I have with a lot of physical sunscreens.  The texture of this stuff is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes, car, belongings, etc&lt;br /&gt;-Non-nano zinc.  This may or may not mean something.  Nano particles are much, much smaller than non-nano particles.  There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed. (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.) Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not good on dry skin.  I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell.  There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  This is one of the more expensive physical sunscreen brands we&#x27;ve tried.  It is worth it and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  Also price Thinkbaby sunscreen before you buy.  We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  Now, we just buy whichever is cheaper at the time of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in, but still time consuming.  As I stated, this brand is the easiest to rub in of all physical sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried but, still, don&#x27;t expect miracles.  If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  There is still room for improvement but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.uct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.

            <li> Not heavy or tacky...  I use it all over, from face to feet.  It is non-irritating on the sensitive skin of my face.  I am black (African-American) with caramel color skin.  On a Likert Scale, with 5 being Wesley Snipes and 1 being Halle Berry, my skin color is a 2.  If I put on too much Thinksport Livestrong Sunscreen and the zinc oxide makes my skin look ashy, I fix it by putting a little essential oil on top. The ingredients are simple and apparently the minimum one needs to create this great product.  I wear it (and a hat) when I go power walking or shopping.  I do not burn with it on, nor does my skin get much darker over the Summer.  Years ago I used to have to change my lipstick color from a Winter hue to a Summer color because I got darker (went from 2 to 3) in the summertime.  Now I do not have that problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that, with so many sunscreen products out there with harmful or suspect ingredients from a health standpoint, there are a few healthy choices like this one.  Also the consistency of this sunscreen is thinner and for that reason easier to spread on skin than some of the other ones that are mineral-based.  I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> I received this today, 5/3/2015, and the expiration date printed on the tube says  07/15. I should be able to order sunscreen with an effective use span much longer than two months.</li>
            <li> Medium viscosity, rubs in well (but not as well if you have facial hair), smells good, works.  Good stuff I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, but it has a stronger smell than some other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried. That&#x27;s our only complaint. But it works well and was a great price! :)</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am pretty intense when it comes to sunscreen for my kids.  I read the EWG sunscreen report a couple of years ago and bought Thinksport as one of several highly-rated sunscreens I wanted to try.  I have probably tried about ten of the best-performing options so far and this is by far my favorite.  When you compare efficacy and price, I think other sunscreens have a hard time beating this one.  Bought four tubes and took them on vacation to the Caribbean where we had lots of sun and a high UV index each day.  Not once did the kids get burnt.  Keep in mind that we did reapplication of the sunscreen per the instructions every couple of hours, but that is how all product should be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely try this and see how it works for you.  It almost fully rubs in - a bit of ghosting, but a small price to pay for avoiding sunburns and potential skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;This time, however, the tubes I received were &amp;#34;liquified&amp;#34; and watery -- somehow the zinc paste separated from the liquid ingredients&lt;br /&gt;and upon opening, water came out.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality, poor lot, not sure.....</li>
            <li> This worked very well for us, good sun protection when reapplied after swimming, good water resistance. As noted by some, both tubes had a fair amount of separated water which we squirted out. Did not effect protection but might have made it thicker to apply.</li>
            <li> good smell. not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I use  this on my face before make up.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27; s best item among many sunblock that I have used</li>
            <li> best &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.  not sticky; nice scent; lasts for hours and hours;  I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This product was filled with mostly water and a few chunks of sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It smells good, doesn&#x27;t separate when it sits, and blends into the skin nicely -- doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue... wipes on fairly easily.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that they also made a lotion, because this is a little too thick and pasty, sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen on my child for over 2 years now. My child is 4yrs and is allergic to most sunscreens. This one is the best, uses non-nano product, non-toxic ingredients, does a great job of blocking the sun, and does not cause any rash. the consistency is a heavy cream that rubs in easily into the skin.  I recommend this to all my friends with kids, especially those with skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen arrived separated, and all that came out was either watery liquid or thick white paste. Shaking didn&#x27;t recombine the ingredients.  Not sure what happened, as it is my favorite sunscreen. Had to return.</li>
            <li> I have tried many all zinc sunscreens in a quest for the best. This would mean a sunscreen that stays put without sweating off, no irritation or breakouts, white cast or settling into fine lines. It can not feel greasy or create shine on the face; must be all zinc and a high enough % of zinc to give a good ppd (a measure of uva screening, much the way spf measures protection for uvb). Also, it has to be affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen scores very well on those points for me. It is easy to apply and while it does have an initial white cast, it settles down on my fair skin without being white, and leaves a satin finish. Once it&#x27;s on, you forget it- there is no coated greasy feeling on the skin. It does settle into fine lines on the face and neck slightly. It doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes. The fragrance is a fresh orange scent, not annoying or persistent. This is a great value and I would definitely repurchase one of the best 20% zinc oxide sunscreens!</li>
            <li> I discovered this sunscreen from the EWG ([...] ) after searching for hours for a sunblock that won&#x27;t cause me to grow tumors or be generally paranoid about cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this is the best you will get. This sunscreen is very thick and does have a scent, but it will not &#x27;ghost&#x27; you (aka leave a white layer on your skin) as much as others. I wear this hiking and when I go to the beach and I have not burned yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not the cheapest thing in the world and if you do not intend on heavy duty sun-baking you can settle on more affordable alternatives. I found that [[ASIN:B004RBZ9MM Coppertone Sunscreen Lotion, Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF, 6 oz.]] works pretty well and you get a lot for your money, but it leaves you most ghosted and does not protect quite as well for heavy exposure (in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this stuff is a bit thick for faces, so consider something like [[ASIN:B00396OTJ0 Elta MD UV Facial SPF 30+ 4 oz.]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And wear a hat and cover yourself up whenever you can. Sunblock can only do so much! :)</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews. This sunscreen has good protection and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again. It is a bit of a smaller bottle and goes on pretty thick but I don&#x27;t mind that for a good quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The product had separated, fluid from the cream.  Product was apparently old or out of date.</li>
            <li> We use thinkbaby/thinksport for the whole family.  The only con is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find, but here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;-great, non-toxic ingredient list (1 on EWG skin deep database)&lt;br /&gt;-no sunburns here in SoCal&lt;br /&gt;-rubs in very nicely without too much &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; appearance&lt;br /&gt;-great smell but light fragrances (orange for baby, lemon for sport)</li>
            <li> Great ingredients list, leaves a whiteish sheen that isn&#x27;t quite as bad as other zinc oxide-based sunscreens. Not as light as non-nano zinc oxide sunscreens, but the price make this a good buy. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> Received sunscreen just before travel to Europe (order process and delivery were OK). When I attempted to use the sunscreen I found it to be defective. First clear liquid came out, then it was like chalky white paint. I attempted to shake it thinking it had separated. Tried to apply it on face and it was like a white foundation that would not blend / absorb into skin. Wiped off with towel and lots of soap and water. Threw it in trash (was not going to carry it back to America) - bought new sunscreen at pharmacy which worked fine.  Was contacted by seller to leave product review - so here it was.  Would not recommend (or at least bit and try while still home so could more easily return for refund).</li>
            <li> Been ordering and using this brand for some time; was always very happy with it until last order; one tube turned out to be very watery/unusable.  Didn&#x27;t open it and discover in time to return (was using up a previous tube first before opening).  Every other tube has always been as expected.  Not sure what happened there but that was like twelve bucks down the drain. I gave 4 stars based on the many tubes that were as expected and will probably continue to order (unless that happens again) but be aware of the possibility of getting a tube that has gone to runny liquid and decide if you want to risk it.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a less toxic sunscreen. This works great for my sun sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as the many other 50SPF lotions I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays put well when sweating, and has a very mild irritation if it gets in my eyes, unlike most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild citrus scent smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and simple.  How many suncreens offer SPF 50+?  That alone is what makes this product popular and it does work as a good sunscreen.  The downside is that it&#x27;s pretty pasty and it takes a while to rub this stuff so that it dissolves into your skin.  You might find you need to add some lotion or moisturizer like I did to deal with these downsides.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reviewing sunscreens that have less chemicals in them. My neighbor recommended it to me also. I bought it for my 6 month old.  My 6 year old was not allowed to put sunscreen on his face due to allergies, but I tried this one out on him and he did not get a rash! It made me very happy.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the sunscreen, but it goes on thick, gooey and makes you look pasty and ill.  When you sweat, you start to have white patches as the sunscreen seems to leach out of your skin.  Not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunblocks from EWG&#x27;s lists.  They have all left lots of &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; faces and I deal with crying from my kids about looking crazy.  This rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave you as white as the others.  There will still be some white, but it certainly won&#x27;t leave you as paste white as the rest.</li>
            <li> works maybe even a little better than think baby.  stays on well, reapply every few hours seems to be enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run when you sweat or get in your eyes. Great for active people. It doesn&#x27;t completely rub in and disappear, but it does the job and doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A TERRIFIC PRODUCT FOR PREVENTING SUNBURNS.  UNFORTUNATELY  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT  STORED PROPERLY AND IT WAS  UNUSABLE.  THE MANUFACTURER  WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT AND EVEN ADD A FREE TUBE. DEFINITELY  A STORAGE PROBLEM</li>
            <li> This is our favorite sunscreen! Love the low hazard ratings it has on EWG. I feel comfortable  putting this on my kids. It has a smooth application, rubs in well and has a nice slight citrus sent. WOuld buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> This probably is the best sunscreen I ever used. It feels nice in the skin although it is a little boring to spread. I had no sunburns in the days I used this sunscreen. And it tastes ok.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, but was sent two defective tubes.  Both had separated into oily liquid and solid parts.  I tried shaking, but this did not remedy the problem.  I am really disappointed with this purchase because normally Thinksport has a great product.</li>
            <li> Works quite well.  Needs a bit of rubbing in to lose the white.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and happy with result.</li>
            <li> Was seperated when arrived. Tryed to shake it to mix it but would only come out liquid.  Not sure if it was product or shipping to hot. Returned. Really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in and near the ocean. Difficult to find a sun screen that stays on, this stuff does. Great protection.</li>
            <li> the expire date is 07/15</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small 3 oz is.  One ounce, or a shot glass full, is recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology.  That is only three servings in this one small tube.  Not to mention wearing a swimsuit will require more.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it goes on smooth, and more importantly, I did not get a burn. It does leave a ghosty hue, but that is expected with non-nano zinc oxide.  If you don&#x27;t want that, you&#x27;ll have to go with a chemical like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or something else, it&#x27;s the nature of the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think this is a little pricey and I&#x27;m going to try goddess Garden&#x27;s [[ASIN:B002BPRTOC Kids Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 - 6 oz - Liquid]] next time.  You can get a larger tube for a slightly smaller price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various sports sunscreens for years. A couple of years ago I started getting rashes from my favorite sunscreen. I tried several other brands and still got rashes. Finally tried Livestrong and got good sun protection and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away a star because it is a little pricey per ounce and because it&#x27;s so dry on application that it&#x27;s a little hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the sun protection lasts throughout some 4-5 hour SoCal summertime rides.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and requires much more time to produce a smooth coating, but it does work well and I like feeling safe that I&#x27;m not absorbing toxins from the item that is supposed to protect me.</li>
            <li> Just used this sunscreen while on a family vacation in Hawaii and i&#x27;m happy to say that none of us got burned. This includes my 9 month old son who didn&#x27;t burn once. We love that the active ingredients are safer than many other chemicals used in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It certainly lives up to its billing as water resistant and is effective at preventing sunburn.  However, my kid&#x27;s sensitive skin did not react well to this sunscreen.  I&#x27;d recommend a different type if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Stays on when your running and sweating! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> physical sunscreen that sort-of rubs in.  better than most!</li>
            <li> Kind of like applying a thick paste to your skin. However, the protection is better, I hope. Top of the line uncomfortable sun protection.</li>
            <li> A little white stays on the skin but if you rub it in better after 10 minutes of applying the white goes away.  It&#x27;s not as white as many other mineral sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The transaction was fine, and I generally like this product HOWEVER, I ordered 3 of these in late June 2015 and they all EXPIRE in Sept. 2015. This seems unacceptable, unless it was made clear to me before purchasing...which it was not. I am upset about that, especially since I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ll be able to go through three of them at that rate. The last time I ordered these from amazon, the expiration date was about 2 years into the future. The product itself takes some rubbing in, but I like the light citrus smell, and it works most of the time for me, although there are occasions when it does not.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a completely watery state. I shook it and squeezed it. I let it cool in my air-conditioned house, and tried to shake it and mash it up again. It is just like shaking up a liquid. I did not open it, and returned it instead.</li>
            <li> The tube came and was filled with thin, clear liquid. Almost water. I suppose I received a defective tube!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because it arrived completely separated. Shaking it was no help. I returned and got a refund, which was pretty simple. I have purchased Thinksport sunscreen in the past, but not specifically the Livestrong version. I&#x27;m hoping this was a bad batch or a seller issue because my previous purchase was great.</li>
            <li> I am a sun bunny! I used this while kayaking and swimming all summer. Spreading thin layers once was enough for most of the summer&#x27;s days. On active wet long days I reapplied to shoulders, chest and face. My friends comment on my whiteness so it must work. I switched from the Mountain stuff... This is thicker and works comparably.</li>
            <li> Worked well for us used it only kids and they stayed unburnt - easy to apply reasonably priced - a small tube about half than the other \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; products</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I have pale, sensitive skin and get a reaction if I use chemical sunscreens.  I&#x27;ve tried different mineral brands and used to use Coppertone Kids SPF 50 with no worries on a daily basis.  However, after I began running, I noticed that the Coppertone was not cutting it on \\&quot;long runs\\&quot; out in the sun on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought ThinkSport for an outrageous price at Whole Foods since it has so much zinc oxide.  Well, it is worth the ridiculous price.  It works on runs, and it worked for me all day long at a waterpark in Texas.  I even used in on my face and my nose didn&#x27;t even get pink!  That is unheard of!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  You really have to rub it in and yes, it will sting if it gets in your eyes.  But it works.  And at least amazon has it for 33% off.</li>
            <li> Provides all day coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner and it is difficult to find sun protection that outlasts runners sweat. This one does. Good product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B004CDRUOA thinksport LIVESTRONG sunscreen SPF 30+, 3 ounces]] for a few weeks. Smells fine, feels fine, works fine, and best of all free of toxic chemicals (PABA, Parabens, Benzoate, Phthalates, BPA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/29/2012 update:  Still our favorite sunscreen; won&#x27;t bother shopping around for alternatives this summer!</li>
            <li> After doing a little research and discovering that the 100+ aerosol Neutrogena sunscreen wasn&#x27;t very healthy for my skin or lungs, I came across Thinksport.  It is a little pricy for 3 oz.  I&#x27;m a relatively small woman, Under 5 foot 4 inches, but my husband is 6&#x27; 6&amp;#34;.  A day at a water park with two applications each and we went through about half the tube.  Found that you do really need to rub a solid layer into the skin as just a light layer will result in a slight sunburn, just a pinking of the skin.  But it certainly does work when applied correctly and I had no problems with getting in and out of the water repeatedly and having it wear off.  I am sure had I towled dried between each ride, I would have had to apply the sunscreen more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have normally loved it!! But this time I ordered 2 bottles and both were filled with a water like substance. NOT SUNBLOCK!!!</li>
            <li> This came to me a vile, liquid mess.  I am guessing my tube was defective.  I just dumped it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> This was better than another product (Elta MD) with these ingredients. It is THICK &amp; does not come off well, as reviewers mention. When my husband put it on his face, well, it was a little embarrassing; there is a definite white film that does not blend in well, no matter what you do, esp where just barely-shaved whiskers are involved. Needless to say, we did NOT get much of a tan in Aruba. But, we won&#x27;t get skin cancer from this time we went to Aruba.  :-)  It really is a great product if you don&#x27;t want to get tan. At all.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is one of the &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t have all the harmful chemicals that most commercial sunscreens do. Even though it is labeled as a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; sunscreen I use this on my little kids too (twins age 3, son age 4). My husband and I use this on our kayaking trips too. It is very water resistant. I never have to reapply it even on long kayak trips. We go to our neighborhood pool a lot too.  No sunburns ever. This is my holy grail sunscreen. I am on my 3rd tube. The scent is a very very light citrus when you first apply but then the scent disappears. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this is a waste of money its so small not worth what they are asking for it! Its a rip off and amazon makes you buy somthing else just to order it!</li>
            <li> I researched alternative sunscreens without oxybenzone and found this on EWGs website for safe sunscreens.  I use this primarily for my tennis class, which is in the middle of the day.  I apply 15-30 minutes before class to let it absorb properly into my skin.  After using this for nearly a month, I still feel burnt.  The product comes out of the tube very thick and takes some effort to apply.  Also, it makes my face all pasty white.  OH well, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> It is so dense that you are gonna end up always having one or two white spots on the skin.</li>
            <li> Saw this on the EWG website as being one of the best.  It really is good.  It is light and not greasy at all.  It also has no smell.  I would highly recommend.  We did &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; on this and used it all summer long.</li>
            <li> Not one burn since I began using this sunscreen, and I am living in the tropics and spending a lot of time in the ocean on a surfboard. I am very happy with the results of this product! All natural, great sun protection, and it stays on in the water.</li>
            <li> My first very unhappy purchase from Amazon. I received this sunscreen on the package it clearly says spf 30+, but the product description is SPF 50+ on the website. The expiration date on the sunscreen is 6 months from Jun 2012 which most sunscreen should have about 2 years shelf life. I got the wrong item and very upset about it. Now I have to deal with finding a box to return it and make a trip to the post office. I decided just to stuck with it. false advertisement on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Did not protect form the sun</li>
            <li> ewg gave this sunscreen high marks.  I play tennis and needed some sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on my face.  SO far so good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.  The texture and the smell are perfect.  VERY low (1) on EWG skin deep toxin level.  If you are wondering if it works, YES it does.  Works so well and is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I love everything about it, except it is NOT water resistant. It is great for everyday use under make-up, especially since it is free of toxic ingredients. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and absorbs quickly. However, as soon as I went swimming I could see the sunscreen running off my skin. I applied consistently throughout the day, as I was in and out of the water, but still burned. Definitely purchase if looking for an everyday sunscreen!</li>
            <li> it is too thick for my dry skin.  It leaves a white residue on my skin. It does a good job of burn prevention but just to dry.  Iam sorry that I spent the money on two tubes.</li>
            <li> After extensive research on sunscreen this year, I decided on this one as it offers solid protection, easy to apply, and the white lotion gets absorbed. Pleasant smell.  The only negative is the small packaging for the price.  I&#x27;ve spent more on sunscreen this year than the last 5 years combined without increasing use.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the ONLY SPF 50 sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cake up your face, AND it isn&#x27;t full of most of the nasty chemicals you find in store-brand sunscreens. I absolutely love it. I use it in the water surfing too and it works great.</li>
            <li> Smells great and easy to apply. You really have to shower and scrub to remove it at the end of the day, because this stuff will stay on your skin. It is a great physical sun blocker.</li>
            <li> The date on the bottle was not expired yet the consistency was watery. After shaking and trying to keep it in a cool place there was no helping it get to the correct consistency. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and it worked great. This arrived in an unusable state. All watery.&lt;br /&gt;I shook it--let it settle in the house for days. It is unusable. I plan to return it--big pain!!</li>
            <li> Product was completely separated into a watery mess with small white chunks.  No amount of shaking or kneading would bring the solution back together.  Not sure if this is just a bad batch from the manufacturer or counterfeit.  Returned ASAP.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural sunscreens out there, but all failed me for one reason or another: Badger (too greasy, turns me purple), CA Baby (too expensive), Loving Naturals (doesn&#x27;t work, very greasy), Neutrogena Baby (harmful chemicals), and probably some others I can&#x27;t recall. This is the ONLY ONE that works (fantastically - been using up a few expired bottles this summer and it&#x27;s still kicking the sun&#x27;s butt), it is the ONLY ONE that is NOT GREASY at all and actually absorbs into the skin. It is a pleasure to use it. It goes on SO easy, even on squirmy kids. And to know that it&#x27;s made from safer ingredients (EWG didn&#x27;t review this year so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a 1 or a 2) makes me very happy. My only complaint is the cost, but it&#x27;s in the normal price range for natural products of this kind...and if we didn&#x27;t live in So Cali and go through gallons every summer, I wouldn&#x27;t be in the poorhouse just due to sunscreen. But that&#x27;s the price we pay for daily beach visits! Anyway I love it and I just try to buy it with deals as much as I can. HIGHLY recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ridiculously sun sensitive, I burn in 2-3 minutes in direct sun.  I also experience hives (solar urticaria) and this is the ONLY sunscreen that protects from both.  I wore it in Hawaii and did not get ANY color (always my goal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions and follow them, especially about waiting for 15 minutes before going in the sun.</li>
            <li> The ad referenced a protection factor of 50+ with Zinc Oxide 20% as the active ingredient. I concluded the product would significantly provide more shielding from UV rays than similar sunscreens with a lesser rating.  How wrong I concluded.  I sustained a first degree sunBURN on the applied areas of my arms, shoulders, and neck. Additionally, the product (ordered June 21) was delivered June 27 with the stamped expiration date of 9/15.  Brick-and-mortar stores selling lower-rated sunscreen factors have a longer shelf life than the rated products.  Two thoughts immediately came to mind.  The seller ships near outdated stock OR ships current stock manufactured with short expiration dates to promote ongoing purchases of an ineffective product.  Perhaps, the active ingredient oxidizes and become inert promptly after manufacturing.  In closing, I felt having been BURNED, not just once but twice - the first from the sun exposure and the second by the purchase.  I can&#x27;t think of any other way of getting BURNED further.</li>
            <li> A car wash can&#x27;t even take this off your face.&lt;br /&gt;Mychelle has perhaps the best sun block and their sun block is organic..</li>
            <li> nice feel and consistency. works. zinc whiteness sinks in quickly. most sunscreens sting, are overly perfumed, or cause me an allergic reaction. this is perfect. lasts longer than less expensive brands which are too thin.</li>
            <li> I rarely give a one star to a product, but this one has earned it.  Spent several weeks in sunny Morocco with no exposure to water and often, but not always, twice a day applications.  I have rosacea and my nose tends to get very red, eventually blood vessels start to show and I have to spend $400 at the laser specialist&#x27;s office to remove them.  Quite simply, this product did a terrible job protecting my nose so I&#x27;ve gone back to my old standby, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Broad Spectrum 45+.  Right now I&#x27;m in sunny Texas and not experiencing any problems with the old standby.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sorry I trusted Thinksport and didn&#x27;t bother to bring my Neutrogena overseas.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading a few reviews. I look for natural products and was pleased to find positive reviews. Although I prefer the smell and \\&quot;spreadability\\&quot; of this natural sunscreen compared to others I have tried, I had two major complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) My family of two and a baby used the whole tube up in a day. Definitely not enough to last through our vacation and ended up buying the chemical-laden junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I am fair skinned and was intentional about lathering up a good bit before heading outside. I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the water, not even submerging myself completely, and after about 30 minutes of sitting outside I felt like I was burning. I re-applied more, liberally. But I still had a sunburn. My husband was also baffled as he also used the product and was burned very badly. I am so disappointed with this product and will not be wasting $$ on this again.</li>
            <li> This is another great, safe and effective sunscreen product.  I like that it has no harmful chemicals, absorbs completely so I don&#x27;t have the white, pasty look and that the sale of ThinkSport supports Livestrong for the fight against cancer.</li>
            <li> In the past, some of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried have been impossible to apply.  Others had a bad smell.  This sunscreen is thin enough to spread evenly and thick enough to offer good coverage.  Our family of five used it for our week at the beach and it was perfect for our needs.</li>
            <li> I really like this better than the Badger sunscreen line.  Badger has a toothpaste consistency while Thinksport has a thick shampoo consistency.  The Badger took a bit longer to rub in and left me feeling greasy, while the Thinksport goes on MUCH easier and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling as greasy.  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I haven&#x27;t shaved and have some stubble on my face, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it rubbed in completely in those areas, but that&#x27;s fine since I&#x27;m normally clean-shaven.  It has protected me fine, no different than the Badger; I&#x27;m very happy with its effectiveness.  The nicest thing though by far is that with the Badger, that greasy feeling made me feel gross and unclean all day long, not so with the Thinksport.  It&#x27;s also listed as a recommended sunscreen on the EWG website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing... I&#x27;ve noticed that at the end of the day when I take a shower, if I&#x27;ve applied sunscreen that morning to my face, then my eyes start to sting.  No matter how hard I try to avoid it, some of this stuff seems to get into my eyes when being washed off.  I&#x27;ve done enough controls to know it&#x27;s not the soap or shampoo that&#x27;s stinging my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know more about sunscreen, you should look at the EWG website (search EWG sunscreen).  There&#x27;s a lot of info on there about sunscreen, much of it I was surprised to know.  Who knew there was so much to know about sunscreen?!  It&#x27;s very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I&#x27;ve always appreciated the help I&#x27;ve received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I&#x27;ll do what I can to fix it.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of different types of zinc based sunscreens and checked against the EWG ratings.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best that I found.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and haven&#x27;t felt the need to try anything else since.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly for long bike rides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to using the zinc based stuff b/c it&#x27;s thicker.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a little chalky, but if you don&#x27;t cake yourself in it, and take some time to rub it in, it&#x27;s not that bad. Actually, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;You can rub it in so that it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  Sometimes it looks like you have a slight ashy color, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth the protection. and the scent is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sort of annoying part is that after heavy sweating, the whiteness comes out and beads on your skin, but at that point, i&#x27;m so disgusting anyway, that a little color of sunscreen doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on really well.  After being out all day with it on, i still have to scrub it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been burned while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it came in some different sizes.  Small sample sizes for reapplication while on long bike rides, and larger sizes for keeping at home so i don&#x27;t have to keep buying small 3 oz tubes.</li>
            <li> I love it! I bought it to protect my tattoo and so far so good!  Great protection.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that dont give the same protection as this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad, rubs in well. not greasy. great safety rating on EWG website. my new favorite sunscreen. I love the thinkbaby version for my toddlers too.</li>
            <li> Great protection. Not too greasy, blends well. Has a nice smell, unlike other brands. Natural and I feel as though I can trust it on my kids. I&#x27;m SOLD on this!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is pretty good. It rubs in well, smells nice, and as far as I can tell it works. It&#x27;s also less expensive then other mineral sunscreens. I wish the tube was larger, though.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other brands that say they go on easily, this one really does, and it smells good too.  It is not too pasty white, but it is a safe and highly-rated physical sunscreen.  I cringe when I see other parents using the chemical-laden spray sunscreen on their kids.  Yes, it is easier to spray on something and rub in the liquid, but if you want to be safer with a physical sunscreen and avoid the harsh chemicals, this one is the best bet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is any better than no-ad or other cheaper sunscreen. Its a small tube for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen for athletes and anyone who sweats a lot!  I am an ultrarunner and spend a lot of time outside running in the sun, which is problematic because I&#x27;m always sweating out my sunscreen.  This is the first I&#x27;ve found that sticks with me for a good while, plus it contains zinc oxide.  It goes on a little pasty at first but quickly dissipates after a minute or so.  I can easily get close to two hours before I need to reapply when running- would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> nice smell, quite water resistance.</li>
            <li> I had a different experience with this sunscreen than many other reviewers.  I have a sensitive nose and can easily and unpleasantly smell a strong sharp citrus fragrance.  I submitted a question whether there was any scent (I worded it neutrally like that) and about 4 reviewers said they smelled a strong citrus, so it&#x27;s not only me.  Even using it down on my shin I can smell it.  Ugh.  I also found the sunscreen stayed greasy feeling, never seeming to dry or &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.  I gave it to someone I met at Yosemite who didn&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought Thinksport, Thinkbaby, and Livestrong and tested them. They are all the SAME (same exact ingredients!).  I called the company to find out why them make so many brands when all inside is the same... didn&#x27;t reach anyone, left a message, lets see if they call me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as the product is concerned, its a great sunscreen.  20% Zinc, non greasy, non sticky, NOT white, doesn&#x27;t stain cloths and does not feel like a heavy layer on the skin.  Does not stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me its a great every day sunscreen.  Of course, that said, I also stay in the shade, wear sunglasses, hat, etc. etc. and avoid prime sun times.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product,  I have used it a few times on my face.  It appears to give good sunscreen protection but does leave a slight white haze on your skin.  Will probably just use around the yard or when I am not headed out somewhere.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff and it&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ll put on our toddler.  It&#x27;s very effective and lasts great through sweat and water play.  Even in Africa (where we live) this has stood the test! It does leave a bit of a &#x27;ghosty&#x27; effect b/c of the zinc but it rubs in pretty well comparably.</li>
            <li> As others have warned, this product arrived separated into water and solids and was completely unusable. Trying to return now.</li>
            <li> Good Sunscreen.  Very thick,  stays put,  doesnt sweat off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just dont put it on your face.  instant breakout.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into the skin, and seems to do a good job in protecting against sun damage, plus softens skin.</li>
            <li> Quiet disappointed since the expiration date shown on each tube is less than a year since I bought them while I can find out there in the store with expiration dates up to June 2016!</li>
            <li> real blocks out the sun and last in the heat.  it does contain zinc so after a workout you may have to use a towel to remove whats left</li>
            <li> I was using Badger for a few years and decided to give this a try. It spreads much easier than Badger, smells better, and rubs in easier without leaving a white haze on your face.</li>
            <li> for a really good sunscreen it&#x27;s pretty light weight.  Most sunscreens that we tested with zinc and titanium dioxides are heavy, this one is not.  We&#x27;ll be getting on the regular delivery.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this-It&#x27;s rated a 1 on the ewg website-It is on the less expensive side of great rated sunscreens-It has a moisturizing feel to it instead of the dry sandy feeling you get with a lot of sunscreens-It rubs in easier than a lot of it&#x27;s zinc oxide relatives-and I love the scent.  I have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Seal on product was broken. Tube was full of water?! :(</li>
            <li> This scored a 2 on the EWG list (I think) so I feel it&#x27;s a safe option for me to use on my kids.  There are a few reviews that mention it didn&#x27;t protect from the sun, but I can testify that it worked beautifully on our kids.  The one area I forgot to apply on my 2 year old&#x27;s legs was the ONLY area on ANY of us that burned.  We were in our pool for about 90 minutes on a sunny day.  It&#x27;s water proof, I only applied it a few minutes before we got in.  Yes, you&#x27;re supposed to wait 20 minutes before getting in the water, but even so, it did the job.  Loved it so much that I put it on subscribe and save and plan on going through dozens on tubes this summer.</li>
            <li> My son is very fair-skinned, and this sunscreen works so well on him. You can tell it provides a strong, protective barrier because the water beads up all over the skin. I don&#x27;t think it is hard to rub in at all, and it lasts for a long time!! I just wish they sold it in bigger bottles! :)</li>
            <li> loved the smell and the protection. it was a little thick, but i rubbed it on with a little body lotion and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Extremely annoyed. I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen before and liked it, I didn&#x27;t order it from this seller though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself I would recommend. But NOT this seller. My product is defective and probably not safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew something was wrong when a heard a sloshing sound when I picked the bottle out of the package, as if liquid were inside. I was right, when I opened it liquid leaked everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, not a great seller - buy this somewhere else!</li>
            <li> With all the chemicals and toxins put into the products we buy, I try to research before for buying for myself and my family to find the healthiest and most effective products. I did this recently before a trip to Mexico and purchased this product for the first time. We used this sunscreen and for the first time on this trip (sixth trip), we did not get sunburned. Also, I have had numerous comments on my great tan. We are going on a cruise in a few weeks and have bought their baby sunscreen for my grandchildern. I only wish there was a face version. I did use it on my face with great results, but broke out with acne in a few spots.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not too greesy. Used at the beach and it did a good job at protecting my skin.</li>
