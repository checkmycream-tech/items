            <li>[...]  I&#x27;m happy I bought it for $[..].</li>
            <li>I believe that it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>The disks work great.</li>
            <li>Knew they had a great reputation.</li>
            <li>It is a Great Manicure Kit, BUT what can you spect from the price?</li>
            <li>It is good have for emergencies,</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s ok with me, I don&#x27;t want to injure myself.</li>
            <li>They both love it, the two of them like feet</li>
            <li>Both of them love it alot.</li>
            <li>Could use alittle more power but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works ok but it definately doesn&#x27;t deliver \\&quot;professional\\&quot; results.</li>
            <li>The other utensiles are perfect for getting rid of that problematic \\&quot;office pencil</li>
            <li>Both times it worked fabulously, thus the 2 star rating.</li>
            <li>Things are only a great price if they work.</li>
            <li>She seems very pleased with the manicure set as far as I know</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 10 year old daughter &amp; I think it was her favorite Christmas gift!</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my nails which needs to be much gentler than feet.</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that the individual heads from the old unit fit the new one.  </li>
            <li>OK for $20 Bucks, but NOT for me anymore, I am planning to get a better machine in the near future from a price of $120.00 like Pedi Nova III Nail Care System</li>
            <li>but the pads from the mfr so you are now trashing the environment by throwing away a product that has still new parts -- just the primary one won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable, rechargable and has several head tips.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and better quality and functionality than I expected!</li>
            <li>Second, I take great care of my things -- I owned this for a few months and used it twice.</li>
            <li>Who wants to file away too much skin creating a problem?</li>
            <li>This is for gentle, spa-like treatments that are not meant to cause damage for over-use.  </li>
            <li>However, the power of it could be stronger in order to really do quicker filing.  </li>
            <li>line, I bought it because I had other products from Homedics and was pleased.</li>
            <li>Three of them feld Off the Main Power tool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a little tough to hold perfectly still if you have real nails</li>
            <li>First, if you are ready to do your nails and forgot to charge this thing 16 hours prior (not an exaggeration folks, it&#x27;s in the instruction book), then you must wait or head to the nearest salon.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy one of the other better rated products (and avoid Homedics products in the future).</li>
            <li>I totally disagree with the first reviewer of this product.</li>
            <li>Even the lightest touch of a fingertip to this item made the spinning motion completely stop.</li>
            <li>- I always end up shaping the tips with a regular file after I am done, but otherwise I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but upon applying them to the use they were intended was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I did not have this product for 2 months when it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>I made arrangements to return it back, but would have had to pay an additional $9 to send it back on top of the $25 I&#x27;d already wasted.  </li>
            <li>This may be ok for childrens nail but useless for adult nails and definately not toenails or acrylics.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, so yes sometimes it slows down on the heavier sanding pieces</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Even the lightest touch of a fingertip to this item made the spinning motion completely stop. Unusable item; returned for refund.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the item that I had for several years(it finally burned out).  The great thing is that the individual heads from the old unit fit the new one.  I have already told friends where to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This may be ok for childrens nail but useless for adult nails and definately not toenails or acrylics.  It slow to a complete stop with MINIMAL pressure placed and charge last only briefly.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to my Mother, which is just what she wanted and she says it works great!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. It is gentle, so yes sometimes it slows down on the heavier sanding pieces, that&#x27;s ok with me, I don&#x27;t want to injure myself. I mostly use it for my nails which needs to be much gentler than feet. It works for what I need, I got replacement parts for $[..]including shipping at:   [...]  I&#x27;m happy I bought it for $[..].</li>
            <li> I gave this gift to my mum and my boyfriends mum. They both love it, the two of them like feet and my mum always use to be asking me and my sis to come give her a pedicure and medicure which we hated to do, now that she has this she can do it for herself and does it all the time. Both of them love it alot. I believe that it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> batteries not strong enough to do the job, nail file is too harsh, and tips are to large. used twice, not satisfied with the results.  B Gibson</li>
            <li> First, if you are ready to do your nails and forgot to charge this thing 16 hours prior (not an exaggeration folks, it&#x27;s in the instruction book), then you must wait or head to the nearest salon.     Second, I take great care of my things -- I owned this for a few months and used it twice. Both times it worked fabulously, thus the 2 star rating. The third time, it totally wouldn&#x27;t charge and there was no power at all - even with the electrical adapter plugged into the device and the LED indicator showing it was charging the unit.     Unfortunately, you cannot buy replacement parts for anything but the pads from the mfr so you are now trashing the environment by throwing away a product that has still new parts -- just the primary one won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m going to buy one of the other better rated products (and avoid Homedics products in the future). Things are only a great price if they work. This one disappoints.</li>
            <li> I really like this little kit - especially for my cuticles and rough patches on the edges of the nails.  Its a little tough to hold perfectly still if you have real nails - I always end up shaping the tips with a regular file after I am done, but otherwise I really like it.  Well worth the money and better quality and functionality than I expected!</li>
            <li> Major waste of money!!  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Has no power.  When you attempt to perform any of the tasks one would expect the product to complete, i.e. \\&quot;filing\\&quot;, the unit slows down so much, or actually comes to a complete stop, that it is useless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Simply wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for in a product.  The attachments were not well constructed and I actually injured myself attempting to utilize the attachments.  The buffer (which is what I bought this for) does not buff at all.  Was not satisfied and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazon has this items listed in a 2nd place - the UPC is the same but it&#x27;s only $14.99&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001709LF2 Homedics MAN-150 Style Spa Plus Rechargeable 10 Piece Manicure System with 8 Attachments]]</li>
            <li> I totally disagree with the first reviewer of this product. Of course it will slow down when you apply too much pressure, and Thank God! Who wants to file away too much skin creating a problem? It&#x27;s a safety feature! The disks work great. I was a little skeptical seeing that they were not what I was used to (sandpaper) but upon applying them to the use they were intended was pleasantly surprised. No more \\&quot;summer heels\\&quot;, and no more dry looking tootsies. And the disks don&#x27;t wear out!!! The other utensiles are perfect for getting rid of that problematic \\&quot;office pencil callous\\&quot; one finds on the resting finger. But, again, no pressure! This is for gentle, spa-like treatments that are not meant to cause damage for over-use.  &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I bought it because I had other products from Homedics and was pleased. Knew they had a great reputation. Buy it - You&#x27;ll Like It!!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  I did not have this product for 2 months when it stopped working completely.  The appliance would stop working when applying the least amount of pressure.  Total waste!</li>
            <li> It is a Great Manicure Kit, BUT what can you spect from the price? It is good have for emergencies, BUT...when you apply a little preasure it will Stop and the attachments...Three of them feld Off the Main Power tool!&lt;br /&gt;It OK for $20 Bucks, but NOT for me anymore, I am planning to get a better machine in the near future from a price of $120.00 like Pedi Nova III Nail Care System and I saw it on Amazon. com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.A. Saint Louis, MO</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. Could use alittle more power but gets the job done. Works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a Christmas Gift for my sister . She seems very pleased with the manicure set as far as I know</li>
            <li> I received the HoMedics Manicure system and found it to be an absolute waste of money.  The motor didn&#x27;t work at all.  I made arrangements to return it back, but would have had to pay an additional $9 to send it back on top of the $25 I&#x27;d already wasted.  I do not recommend this product, nor do I recommend purchasing items from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I purchased the kit.  It&#x27;s adorable, rechargable and has several head tips.  However, the power of it could be stronger in order to really do quicker filing.  I&#x27;m a long time user of such equipment.  Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I got this product a couple of years ago.  My only complaint is it never held a charge very long.  I did follow directions on how long to charge it etc.  It works ok but it definately doesn&#x27;t deliver \\&quot;professional\\&quot; results.</li>
            <li> Used a couple of times and the unit stopped working. Keep your receipt so you can return it. With the current cost of mailing it is not worth sending it back to the company</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 10 year old daughter &amp; I think it was her favorite Christmas gift!</li>
