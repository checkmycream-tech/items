            <li>I love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I have no idea what the top review is talking about</li>
            <li>I am used to wearing Burberry London and more spicy/musk/woods scent.</li>
            <li>I wear this one the most throughout the week.</li>
            <li>although I would bet most would prefer to wear in summer</li>
            <li>I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li>Nice smelling clean crisp cologne for a good price</li>
            <li>It is a lovely rather light scent with a hint of citirus.  </li>
            <li>In this case, the fragance is really fresh, kind of citric and has nothing to do with the Halloween look that the bootle has.</li>
            <li>This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality ....</li>
            <li>Ck Shock is definitely unique and I am glad I purchased (there are some purchases I leave with the feeling</li>
            <li>Good scent and depending on the person, it can be a little strong, but the product itself is good.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they cll this stuff light, light</li>
            <li>but I think the best phase for it is a few hours after you spray.</li>
            <li>The buy is fantastic at just slighly over $30 and at the time of this review, free shipping is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap price and the scent sounded like it would be interesting, but to put it simply, this cologne does not smell good.  </li>
            <li>So i bought it and it drives the ladies wild for my D.  Good luck dudes.</li>
            <li>But then, surprisingly, the second time that I tried this on was amazing, the smell was sweet, sporty, colorful, youthful, playful...</li>
            <li>Blows the original ck one out the water.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it has a clean, crisp, strong (but not overpowering) fragrance that suit me just fine.</li>
            <li>Shock lasts the day and is refreshing - kind of like Red Bull or 5-hour energy for the nose..!!  </li>
            <li>There seems to be a hint of vanilla smell to it which adds the sweet smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though for the price, i consider it worth it, as reapplication is cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought I might as well try this product because the reviews looked good and it was only $20.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my husband, very clean mild scent he loves it so much he ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very perfume, but let me very comfortable.my friends said I got a nice perfume</li>
            <li>a type of a mild vanilla/spicy smell which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how this cologne can get SO many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, shipped as expected in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great unexpected remarks from the ladies which is also a plus!</li>
            <li>sits humbly on the skin,projection lasts about 4 hours but longevity is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product that is really worth the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got just the right body.  </li>
            <li>the price is so right.</li>
            <li>It never really occurred to me that maybe I should try to be more trendy and try some new scents.</li>
            <li>Other than it being just a pleasant smell, I judge cologne mostly on one simple criteria:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are colognes that seem to last until the next day (Joop is a great example).  </li>
            <li>The initial spray is ok and you get the idea</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it also last most of the day</li>
            <li>this one is by far my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long-lasting, very unique smelling, and, surprisingly, relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>A very nice and long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>So many are too sweet or too sharp or citrus smelling and give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I have received more positive comments when wearing this cologne than any other one I wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am being asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing very often, ladies like it.</li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Try it out, I think you will like it very well.</li>
            <li>I recomend this perfume for a 30 years old men not too fresh</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to re apply it much.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it lasts forever, at least 10 hours, with a good 6 foot siliage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one seems to last a fair amount of time but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the staying power I expected after going through a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Indeed, Shock was what I experienced when I first tested this product in store, it was kinda annoying and overwhelming somewhat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a value-priced cologne that has impact and attributes that pleasantly surprised me when I first wore it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the regular CK One give you an opinion of the CK One Shock for men, because they are really quite different and in my opinion the shock for men smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, no issues, husband loves it, comes with spray top not pictured.</li>
            <li>That may not sound appealing to some, but it is not to be discounted.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this scent, and the women at the office I work at have made several positive comments about my change in cologne.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting and unique scent.</li>
            <li>It may very well become my &amp;#34;signature cologne&amp;#34; and replace my current one:</li>
            <li>This product completely fullfilled all my expectations.</li>
            <li>and/or perhaps early fall.  </li>
            <li>So much so that sometimes he puts a little too much on and gags me when the smell.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to the guys out there that want something new to wear and</li>
            <li>A very mature yummy scent that last for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a sharp scent.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not as this was the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It is headache inducing even in small amounts and the smell is not great either I don&#x27;t know how to describe it clearly but it does not smell good at all.</li>
            <li>The scent becomes subtle and smooth.</li>
            <li>I personally like the scent and ditched my old cologne entirely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Drakkar, Preferred Stock and Polo for many years until I recently read a comment about these being somewhat outdated in these day&#x27;s and times.</li>
            <li>For the record, I am not a young man - to me it doesn&#x27;t seem too youthful for my age group, however, can see it being of appeal to the young as well.</li>
            <li>It seems to die down a bit too much after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>the longevity is above average - lasting, albeit barely, a whole work day.  </li>

            <li> Arrived quickly, no issues, husband loves it, comes with spray top not pictured.</li>
            <li> That may not sound appealing to some, but it is not to be discounted.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent, and the women at the office I work at have made several positive comments about my change in cologne.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting and unique scent.</li>
            <li> It may very well become my &amp;#34;signature cologne&amp;#34; and replace my current one:</li>
            <li> This product completely fullfilled all my expectations.</li>
            <li> and/or perhaps early fall.  </li>
            <li> So much so that sometimes he puts a little too much on and gags me when the smell.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to the guys out there that want something new to wear and</li>
            <li> A very mature yummy scent that last for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a sharp scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not as this was the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It is headache inducing even in small amounts and the smell is not great either I don&#x27;t know how to describe it clearly but it does not smell good at all.</li>
            <li> The scent becomes subtle and smooth.</li>
            <li> I personally like the scent and ditched my old cologne entirely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Drakkar, Preferred Stock and Polo for many years until I recently read a comment about these being somewhat outdated in these day&#x27;s and times.</li>
            <li> For the record, I am not a young man - to me it doesn&#x27;t seem too youthful for my age group, however, can see it being of appeal to the young as well.</li>
            <li> It seems to die down a bit too much after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> the longevity is above average - lasting, albeit barely, a whole work day.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; is above average with some compliments from the ladies and</li>
            <li> it is long lasting, i totally recommend it too..</li>
            <li> In addition to the usual spray areas (neck and wrists), I have started spraying a couple of dashes on my undershirt - during the day, with certain movements, I will get a whiff of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, so you can use it with all the confidence.</li>
            <li> I recommend using at night, has freshness remains for a long time by the skin and clothing</li>
            <li> [so long as they get to me before it wears</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it every single time I wear it.</li>
            <li> it is not, deep yes, not light.</li>
            <li> You can mix it with other CK products  to create diferent fragances.</li>
            <li> I really felt disappointed, not bad, but not a really good smell.</li>
            <li> and i figured he is 65 years old and weak.  </li>
            <li> power of this one I would rate at around 4-6hrs MAX which is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Price wasn&#x27;t bad either at around $40 for a 3.4oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spices with lots of tobacco and a little sweetness that some poeple pick up and others dont.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for a man who doesn&#x27;t like a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> After spending lots of wasted money on different colognes that I hated, I received a sample of this and really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll risk it again.</li>
            <li> I got the after a small sample at tjmaxx.</li>
            <li> This is all of those listed plus a small hint of citrus or something.</li>
            <li> I have gone on over 275 dates this past year.....</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously, this is why &amp;#34;Shock&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t perform well on the market.  </li>
            <li> While you can still smell it, its rather faint and often hard to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff has a secret formula....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to describing the way it smells, but it is unappealing</li>
            <li> , this is by far the worst cologne I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> My moms told me her bf got mad compliments on it</li>

            <li> I get complements whenever i where this scent. It&#x27;s spices with lots of tobacco and a little sweetness that some poeple pick up and others dont. well, whenever i where this to work, woman always remark on how good it smells, and thats from accross the room too. Oh yeah, it lasts forever, at least 10 hours, with a good 6 foot siliage.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they cll this stuff light, light it is not, deep yes, not light. I go for the 6ounce bottle and see myself always having it in stock.</li>
            <li> I have received more positive comments when wearing this cologne than any other one I wear. It has, so I was told, an &amp;#34;intoxicating&amp;#34; scent to it. It&#x27;s long-lasting, very unique smelling, and, surprisingly, relatively inexpensive. It&#x27;s a value-priced cologne that has impact and attributes that pleasantly surprised me when I first wore it. It may very well become my &amp;#34;signature cologne&amp;#34; and replace my current one: D&amp;G The One - Gentleman (another very good cologne, in my opinion). Colognes,of course, are subjective - one man&#x27;s &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; may be another man&#x27;s &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34;. All I can say is that it has a clean, crisp, strong (but not overpowering) fragrance that suit me just fine. For the record, I am not a young man - to me it doesn&#x27;t seem too youthful for my age group, however, can see it being of appeal to the young as well. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Good scent. I&#x27;am being asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing very often, ladies like it. I will get it again when run out.</li>
            <li> Gotta tell you...I&#x27;ve been a CK fan for over a decade.  This smells a bit like putting coconut butter on you, and throwing dashes of vanilla cake mixed with pumpkin pie.  I mean, seriously, this is why &amp;#34;Shock&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t perform well on the market.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to my standard CK &amp;#34;One&amp;#34;....  This is decidedly not &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; as another reviewer posted...</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf and it smells so good. A very mature yummy scent that last for hours. You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to have a great cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling clean crisp cologne for a good price</li>
            <li> I bought CK One Shock for a birthday present for my husband.  It is a lovely rather light scent with a hint of citirus.  We both like it.  I would recommend it for a man who doesn&#x27;t like a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  It arrived on time, and packaged well.  No complaints from me.  Would order again as a gift.</li>
            <li> Great smell, shipped as expected in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great unexpected remarks from the ladies which is also a plus!</li>
            <li> This has a very good smell to it. The initial spray is ok and you get the idea but I think the best phase for it is a few hours after you spray. The scent becomes subtle and smooth. It&#x27;s certainly not a sharp scent. There seems to be a hint of vanilla smell to it which adds the sweet smell. This would be a good cologne to wear with a suit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Rich aroma for a good price. I recommend using at night, has freshness remains for a long time by the skin and clothing</li>
            <li> I use is today and its awesome...love the smell and how it smell on me too. My mom, sister love it too.</li>
            <li> very well. I like it. haha&lt;br /&gt;not very perfume, but let me very comfortable.my friends said I got a nice perfume</li>
            <li> I really felt disappointed, not bad, but not a really good smell. It&#x27;s. Just one more product to forget and never buy it again</li>
            <li> Other than it being just a pleasant smell, I judge cologne mostly on one simple criteria:  Can people still smell it 2 hours after I put it on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are colognes that seem to last until the next day (Joop is a great example).  This one seems to last a fair amount of time but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the staying power I expected after going through a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;ck B&amp;#34; was still their best of all time, and I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle of this particular ck fragrance, but this one is nice when you&#x27;re just looking for a short-term change of scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Drakkar, Preferred Stock and Polo for many years until I recently read a comment about these being somewhat outdated in these day&#x27;s and times. It never really occurred to me that maybe I should try to be more trendy and try some new scents. After spending lots of wasted money on different colognes that I hated, I received a sample of this and really like it a lot. It has a very nice scent. Don&#x27;t let the regular CK One give you an opinion of the CK One Shock for men, because they are really quite different and in my opinion the shock for men smells a lot better. I would definitely recommend this to the guys out there that want something new to wear and the compliments I get from the women tell me I&#x27;m not alone in my opinion of this.  Try it out, I think you will like it very well. They also have the CK One Shock Street version and its great too.</li>
            <li> I recomend this perfume for a 30 years old men not too fresh not too old LOL smells nice d</li>
            <li> This fragrance is awesome,  lasts all day, and smells great.  Calvin Klein is the best.  The best cologne for men on the market mates.</li>
            <li> This is as is many of Calvin&#x27;s colognes the most favorite of mine.  It&#x27;s got just the right body.  So many are too sweet or too sharp or citrus smelling and give me a headache.  I only wish I could find another like it to wear off and on.  I get compliments on it every single time I wear it.</li>
            <li> great scent. excellent product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great smell and the price is so right. I will def be buying this again. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells good and is inexpensive so I use it almost every day.  You can mix it with other CK products  to create diferent fragances.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting and unique scent. sits humbly on the skin,projection lasts about 4 hours but longevity is great. Could smell it on my skin 12 hours later after 4 sprays.</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> Indeed, Shock was what I experienced when I first tested this product in store, it was kinda annoying and overwhelming somewhat. But then, surprisingly, the second time that I tried this on was amazing, the smell was sweet, sporty, colorful, youthful, playful...you got the point. I think this would suit men up to their 30s. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my second. Good scent and depending on the person, it can be a little strong, but the product itself is good. Will buy again when I finish this one</li>
            <li> have bought lots of cologne over the years. this one is by far my new favorite. it also last most of the day so I don&#x27;t have to re apply it much. will be buying much more of this product</li>
            <li> CK one shock is a great scent. I found it at a TJ Maxx store on sale. The scent itself is a kind-of spicy, fruity-fresh smell. It also lasts a good while, totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> I bought it yesterday, and it is a great perfume, i chose it because it has a different scent, and it smells really good, girls love it and it is long lasting, i totally recommend it too..</li>
            <li> My son loved this cologne  it sat perfectly&lt;br /&gt;On his skin , loved it will purchase  again and again... Thank you</li>
            <li> This product completely fullfilled all my expectations. Smells really good and noticeable but in a good and soft way. It&#x27;s long lasting, so you can use it with all the confidence. I am one of those who try to guess the fragance by the parfume bottle. In this case, the fragance is really fresh, kind of citric and has nothing to do with the Halloween look that the bootle has. It&#x27;s a product that is really worth the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and you cannot beat the price</li>
            <li> Love the scent. My favorite.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely amazing. I get a lot of compliments [so long as they get to me before it wears off]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted the issue is longevity. It seems to die down a bit too much after about 30 minutes. While you can still smell it, its rather faint and often hard to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though for the price, i consider it worth it, as reapplication is cheap.</li>
            <li> Man does this stuff smell great. Blows the original ck one out the water. I get compliments all the time when I&#x27;m wearing it. You will not regret it I promise you.</li>
            <li> Smells great...  The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; connected to the sprayer was GONE.  Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not as this was the first time I used it. Not sure I&#x27;ll risk it again.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman and love the scent of chocolate, slap this on your man.  It&#x27;s like a magnet pulling you towards the neck.</li>
            <li> I got the after a small sample at tjmaxx. I love this fragrance and I would buy it again in fact I will get it again</li>
            <li> I thought I might as well try this product because the reviews looked good and it was only $20. I have no idea what the top review is talking about I smell no citrus at all, this is by far the worst cologne I have ever bought. It is headache inducing even in small amounts and the smell is not great either I don&#x27;t know how to describe it clearly but it does not smell good at all. Honestly axe and old spice body sprays smell better than this, which says a lot about this product because those sprays are subpar at best.</li>
            <li> A very nice and long lasting fragrance. I get a lot of compliments with this</li>
            <li> I took a shot on this cologne and have been happy since. I am used to wearing Burberry London and more spicy/musk/woods scent. This is all of those listed plus a small hint of citrus or something. Definite buy</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my husband, very clean mild scent he loves it so much he ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I like it too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne on me as well. I wear this one the most throughout the week. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must purchase... Ck Shock is definitely unique and I am glad I purchased (there are some purchases I leave with the feeling, \\&quot;why did I buy this cologne?\\&quot;).  It provides opening notes of musk and pepper and settles into a chocolate tobacco mix.  That may not sound appealing to some, but it is not to be discounted.  The \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; is above average with some compliments from the ladies and the longevity is above average - lasting, albeit barely, a whole work day.  In addition to the usual spray areas (neck and wrists), I have started spraying a couple of dashes on my undershirt - during the day, with certain movements, I will get a whiff of the fragrance.  Shock lasts the day and is refreshing - kind of like Red Bull or 5-hour energy for the nose..!!  The buy is fantastic at just slighly over $30 and at the time of this review, free shipping is a bonus.  The bottle is \\&quot;cooly\\&quot; (if I may coin that word) designed and a great conversation piece.  I would have no problem wearing Shock anytime of year or any occasion, although I would bet most would prefer to wear in summer and/or perhaps early fall.  Go for it.  4.3 stars out of 5.  Enthusiasm moves the world...</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein shock has  changed my life... since I got this........the ladies can&#x27;t stop coming for me.....I&#x27;m not a ladies man.......this stuff has a secret formula.... that attracts the ladies.....I have gone on over 275 dates this past year.....I owe it all to Calvin Klein shock!!!!!! I went from zero to hero!!!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how this cologne can get SO many positive reviews.  It&#x27;s a cheap price and the scent sounded like it would be interesting, but to put it simply, this cologne does not smell good.  I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to describing the way it smells, but it is unappealing and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s similar to Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent, and the women at the office I work at have made several positive comments about my change in cologne. I personally like the scent and ditched my old cologne entirely.</li>
            <li> Very nice, just as described.  Would definitely order it again. Arrived quickly, no issues, husband loves it, comes with spray top not pictured.</li>
            <li> My moms told me her bf got mad compliments on it and i figured he is 65 years old and weak.  So i bought it and it drives the ladies wild for my D.  Good luck dudes.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I am always asked what I am wearing, and I am more than happy to tell. The packaging was good and this arrived on time.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this cologne</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne I have ever bought, and to think that I stumbled upon it is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my husband loves it. So much so that sometimes he puts a little too much on and gags me when the smell. Overall a nice scent.</li>
            <li> CK ONE SHOCK for Men is a very good smelling Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;got a type of a mild vanilla/spicy smell which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power of this one I would rate at around 4-6hrs MAX which is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Price wasn&#x27;t bad either at around $40 for a 3.4oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;You can use this Cologne as a Splash-On ...or it comes with a Spray Cap Also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon !!!</li>
            <li> este producto llego en buenas condiciones y en un aceptable tiempo, el producto llego bien, es&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recomendado al 100 %</li>
