            <li>The company was great; I received the perfume quickly.</li>

            <li>Have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Its very upsetting as i love love love her perfume</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth a try if you have problems wearing most scents.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how good it smelled even while working out at the gym.  </li>
            <li>In fact, when it&#x27;s hot and I start sweating, this scent seems to shine more.  </li>
            <li>So, I have a love at first smell story with this perfume.</li>
            <li>She was SO excited that she got it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It took a while before item was available but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too floral or sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Eva, by Eva Longoria, is a wonderful, feminine, and delicate perfume with staying power.</li>
            <li>The scent did calm down over time, and I liked it better, but still didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, is light and soft.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fit, this perfume is exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li>This parfum is clean and fresh with a touch of crisp floral added.</li>
            <li>this is a soft smell that i am able to take.</li>
            <li>scent though is pretty amazing, it isn&#x27;t too heavy and not too light that it is unnoticeable, the smell is basically going to MATTER depending on your body&#x27;s pH</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ok but not enough.</li>
            <li>I sampled this product over a year ago and loved it, but was not able to find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>If I wear it away from my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My mom absolutely loves this perfume.</li>
            <li>When I finally thought to look it up on Amazon I was thrilled, especially when I discovered how affordable the product was.</li>
            <li>and they had the same experience, but liked it enough to keep it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different than the over the top sweet fragrances that seem to be everywhere now.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more when I bought this perfume.</li>
            <li>I put this on one morning for the first time around 8:30am within ten minutes I could no longer smell it.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd bottle, the first one my husband bought it for me.</li>
            <li>I just assumed that because some people think they can mask their odors by using fruity scents and it comes off really revolting, especially for people like me with a lower threshold for odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My young son even said, \\&quot;mom, what is that smell?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It smells like a fresh green plant.  </li>

            <li> I sampled this product over a year ago and loved it, but was not able to find it anywhere. When I finally thought to look it up on Amazon I was thrilled, especially when I discovered how affordable the product was. However I was disappointed once I put the scent on. It did not smell the same as the sample. As a matter of fact, for the first half hour i wore it, it smelled awful (it was very strong and overpowering). The scent did calm down over time, and I liked it better, but still didn&#x27;t love it. I ended up giving  it to someone else and they had the same experience, but liked it enough to keep it. Maybe I had a bad or old bottle, but I won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> The company was great; I received the perfume quickly. I just didn&#x27;t care for the scent but wanted to try it because I read that she had it created because she has allergies as I do.  If I wear it away from my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.  Try it, you may like it more than I do and it&#x27;s worth a try if you have problems wearing most scents.</li>
            <li> A lovely, unassuming scent.  I was surprised by how good it smelled even while working out at the gym.  In fact, when it&#x27;s hot and I start sweating, this scent seems to shine more.  A very feminine, playful scent that seems to be the perfect blend of fresh/ floral/ citrus.</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday last year and it smells very awesome. Granted the packaging was pretty sucky, like the roll on small bottle&#x27;s little ball (that keeps it rolling) fell out during the first few times I used it. I received a gift set so I got the roll on, the spray bottle and the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent though is pretty amazing, it isn&#x27;t too heavy and not too light that it is unnoticeable, the smell is basically going to MATTER depending on your body&#x27;s pH though, I would assume if you are acidic (which I am not) the smell would mix up or something. I just assumed that because some people think they can mask their odors by using fruity scents and it comes off really revolting, especially for people like me with a lower threshold for odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest testing it out by visiting the cosmetic counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fairly light-ish like Clinique Happy.</li>
            <li> This stinks.  It smells like a fresh green plant.  I ordered it and returned it.  I tried to like it, but I couldn&#x27;t.  My young son even said, \\&quot;mom, what is that smell?\\&quot;  He hated it too.</li>
            <li> It took a while before item was available but worth the wait. I have had numerous compliments and when I share the price that I paid people have been amazed. I definately will order fragrance from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This parfum is clean and fresh with a touch of crisp floral added. It is a good one. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. It&#x27;s a little different than the over the top sweet fragrances that seem to be everywhere now. Great price, too. Get used to people paying you compliments on what parfum you are wearing.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more when I bought this perfume. It depends of everyone&#x27;s pH, it&#x27;s ok but not enough. I would like to have another one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my perfume. I even received a 15% discount for my next purchase and some perfume samples. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Very good.  Deleverd on time and in good condition.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I wanted this because Eva happens to be my name as well.It smells great and lasts pretty long. It&#x27;s not too floral or sweet smelling. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I adore Eva Parfum! This is my everyday scent and I get soooo many compliments! Nice floral scent! I will purchase her fragerance until they stop making it!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this fragrance the smell was okay but it has no lasting power. I put this on one morning for the first time around 8:30am within ten minutes I could no longer smell it. I try to wear it twice don&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;m surprise that Eva Longoria would have her name attached to something that don&#x27;t seem to measure up to her . I can&#x27;t imagine her wearing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> So, I have a love at first smell story with this perfume. I smelled it in a magazine and I&#x27;m not the type of person who buys things just cuz they are in a magazine... but I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the page. So, I went out and bought it (from Macy&#x27;s, I think) the more I used it the more I loved it. It has the perfect combo of a citrus, floral, and fresh scents. I love it. So glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> Eva, by Eva Longoria, is a wonderful, feminine, and delicate perfume with staying power. Not overpowering, but not one of the perfumes that disappears after an hour. Have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Loved it will make purchase again</li>
            <li> Great price.  Fast delivery. This is my favorite perfume and I get compliments daily on it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample if this scent in a package of another fragrance I ordered. I loved this scent but could not locate it in any stores in my area. This will remain one of my favorites that I&#x27;ll reorder once it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> The perfume is watered down or very old. Its very upsetting as i love love love her perfume n this one does not smell up to par.</li>
            <li> this is one of the few perfumes that my gf can wear as i have fragrance allergies.  this is a soft smell that i am able to take.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same bottle sold in stores before for twice the amount, I like the scent, you should know the scent if you buy online, it&#x27;s like complaining shoes you got online don&#x27;t fit, this perfume is exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this perfume, it was a great price! very satisfied with it i would a will buy from them again</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle, the first one my husband bought it for me. I love the scent, is light and soft. And it seems to last all day and night. I recommend it to the ladies...</li>
            <li> My mom absolutely loves this perfume. She was SO excited that she got it for Christmas. I even like it! It smells amazing.</li>
