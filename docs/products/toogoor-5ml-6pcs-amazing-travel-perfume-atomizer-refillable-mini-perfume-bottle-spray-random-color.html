            <li>Very good value.  </li>
            <li>They are great for travel perfume.</li>
            <li>Also great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Would make great gifts too.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with these, have already received tons of compliments on how cute they are.</li>
            <li>Cute!</li>
            <li>Great color, fantastic spray distribution, and no leaks.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect way to give samples of new body sprays!  </li>
            <li>For the price the quality seems to be good though, easy to fill</li>
            <li>These are great and the price was right.</li>
            <li>These are really cute and perfect to fill with your favorite perfume-you do have to mist it into the atomizer (which is not a problem if you have steady hands).  </li>
            <li>Pleased to get these.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two sets and shipping has been outstanding, will definetly buy more.</li>
            <li>amazing price and also pretty!!</li>
            <li>The top of the inside glass vile unscrews for easy filling.  </li>
            <li>Cute, but cheap</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and at only about $1.00 each, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better giveaway.</li>
            <li>The window in the atomizer makes it easy to know when to refill.</li>
            <li>Loved the set.went back for 3 more sets.</li>
            <li>Spray action is good.</li>
            <li>I filled one with perfume and the other with DIY hot flash spray which worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>They did reimburse me for the two, but they should have only shipped good ones, as I wanted 6 and not 4.</li>
            <li>over all, pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to distinguish different fragrances by the color of the atomizer...</li>
            <li>What you can do is use the sprays for example from bath and body works open the top and pour spray into it</li>
            <li>They are fairly easy to get apart and put back together.  </li>
            <li>Nicely constructed and just the right size for carrying in a small bag.  </li>
            <li>I received  them fairly fast.</li>
            <li>These are cute little sprayers.  </li>
            <li>They Look like they do in the pictures for the most part but the colors were more random than I realized; they&#x27;re not the same colors in the picture at all.</li>
            <li>I tried to pair the colours with the original bottles of perfume and when the atomizer is not in my purse I just stand it up next to the big bottle.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to fill; the mouth on the inner glass vial is wide enough to use a straw for filling from a larger source.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the product are exactly as prescribed.</li>

            <li> Loved the set.went back for 3 more sets. It didn&#x27;t take as long as the estimated time stated.</li>
            <li> over all, pretty cheap. Cute, but cheap</li>
            <li> Difficult to open. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5. Other than that, the product are exactly as prescribed.</li>
            <li> I gave these as gifts with perfume in them.  Cute!</li>
            <li> Pleased to get these. They are great for travel perfume. I like that they are different colors  so I  can take a couple of different ones on a trip.  Considering they came from China I received  them fairly fast.</li>
            <li> Greatest atomizers for the price and performance. Great color, fantastic spray distribution, and no leaks. I use these for my cologne samples that don&#x27;t have a sprayer. Also great for traveling. I have ordered two sets and shipping has been outstanding, will definetly buy more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting six different colors but what I received was one silver and five black. I would have preferred different colors so I could assign a color to a specific perfume. For the price the quality seems to be good though, easy to fill and it doesn&#x27;t seem like they will leak.</li>
            <li> These are cute little sprayers.  They are fairly easy to get apart and put back together.  The top of the inside glass vile unscrews for easy filling.  Spray action is good.</li>
            <li> Great little product.  I filled one with perfume and the other with DIY hot flash spray which worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> amazing price and also pretty!!</li>
            <li> One of the six was defective.  And another one had a dent.  They did reimburse me for the two, but they should have only shipped good ones, as I wanted 6 and not 4.</li>
            <li> I like the functionality and ease of use of the refillable atomizers.  However, there may be some quality control issues as a couple of the glass portions inside the protective metal casing is damaged.</li>
            <li> 3 of them leak. They look really nice too bad they leak.</li>
            <li> They Look like they do in the pictures for the most part but the colors were more random than I realized; they&#x27;re not the same colors in the picture at all.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these, have already received tons of compliments on how cute they are. Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed and just the right size for carrying in a small bag.  Would make great gifts too.  Very good value.  thanks!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, they don&#x27;t come in different colors.  I got 5 of the same color... black.  I was hoping to be able to distinguish different fragrances by the color of the atomizer... nope.  Because of that, I haven&#x27;t used them.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> These are really cute and perfect to fill with your favorite perfume-you do have to mist it into the atomizer (which is not a problem if you have steady hands).  I do wish you could pick the colours but you do get 6 different colours.  The picture shows green and I got silver instead..... I tried to pair the colours with the original bottles of perfume and when the atomizer is not in my purse I just stand it up next to the big bottle.  The window in the atomizer makes it easy to know when to refill.</li>
            <li> These are great and the price was right. They are nicer than the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets of these to use as gifts for an Avon party.  They are a perfect way to give samples of new body sprays!  They are easy to fill; the mouth on the inner glass vial is wide enough to use a straw for filling from a larger source.  They are beautiful and at only about $1.00 each, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better giveaway.</li>
            <li> This is not the mini bottles that you attach to your perfume to have it transferred. What you can do is use the sprays for example from bath and body works open the top and pour spray into it but It doesn&#x27;t attach or anything!</li>
