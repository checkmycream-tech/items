    <ol>
            <li>Very good value!</li>
            <li>I will no longer be searching for the ideal eye cream because this is it.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>per wife, great product</li>
            <li>Not as good as Strivectin eye serum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I figure since the wrinkle remover works so well, the eye cream must be just as good.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>This company makes great products and I am so glad I found them</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>NuVectin eye cream is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks and the results are very good so far.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I will see  more improvement.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to submit reviews, but I&#x27;m compelled to write something about this product because it is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>but because I liked the Advanced Wrinkle reducer I thought I would give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my eyes look more rested, brighter.</li>
            <li>I started using the Advanced Wrinkle Reducer and could not believe how much better my skin felt</li>
            <li>The fine wrinkles around my eyes have softened.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I was right.</li>
            <li>because I have tried much more expensive eye creams, and cheaper eye creams, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t expect miracles here, I don&#x27;t see a grand difference in the product from the normal one that I was using before.</li>
            <li>but several of my friends have made comments on how much better my skin looks!</li>
            <li>I tried a few drugstore brands but those did not leave my skin feeling that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, so you can put it right on your eyelid as well as around your eye, and even use it as an eye makeup remover (maybe not for mascara - haven&#x27;t tried that).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily and love it.  </li>
            <li>As I said in my review of NuVectin Advanced Wrinkle Reducer - I have always used StiVectin SD and been happy with the results but was on the search for something that was not as expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on potions and creams, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>NuVectin is gentle and does not bother my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>And very affordable.</li>
            <li>NuVectin eye cream is so gentle, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li>Every time I buy it and start using it again, I can&#x27;t believe how much better my eyes look (much less puffy and haggard).  </li>
            <li>and now I can get my Starbucks a little more often with the money I am saving </li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The corners of my eyes are very sensitive and prone to tearing.</li>
            <li>I recommend Oz Natural eye serum.</li>
            <li>have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have never found products this reasonably priced that make such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is half the cost of a similar product I used to purchase at fine make up counters.</li>
            <li>After turning 60 (yikes!), I became really self conscious about my crows&#x27; feet and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Over the past few years I have noticed more crow’s feet appearing and was hoping this product would stop them from progressing.  </li>
            <li>My eyes look so much younger and vibrant and the dark circles that we beginning to form</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as good as Strivectin eye serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks and the results are very good so far. It has reduced the bags under my eyes by at least 50%.  Good product!</li>
            <li> Quality moisturizing cream for skin around the eyes. My eyes are very sensitive. NuVectin is gentle and does not bother my eyes at all. This cream is half the cost of a similar product I used to purchase at fine make up counters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. Works on dark circles!!  And very affordable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever stop using this cream.  Every time I buy it and start using it again, I can&#x27;t believe how much better my eyes look (much less puffy and haggard).  It says it takes a couple weeks to work, but I see a difference within a day.  It&#x27;s very gentle, so you can put it right on your eyelid as well as around your eye, and even use it as an eye makeup remover (maybe not for mascara - haven&#x27;t tried that).  The only thing I was disappointed in is that the price has doubled from the last time I bought it.  I bought it anyway though . . . . because I have tried much more expensive eye creams, and cheaper eye creams, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily and love it.  I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous changes in my eye area, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this and hopefully I will see  more improvement.</li>
            <li> Not impressed........ Did not see any improvement over 3 weeks. I recommend Oz Natural eye serum. That&#x27;s all I have to say......</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to submit reviews, but I&#x27;m compelled to write something about this product because it is outstanding.  It started smoothing wrinkles and improving the texture of the skin after the 3rd day of use.  I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on potions and creams, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.  I will no longer be searching for the ideal eye cream because this is it.</li>
            <li> NuVectin eye cream is absolutely amazing. I love it! The corners of my eyes are very sensitive and prone to tearing. NuVectin eye cream is so gentle, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks now and am starting to see some real benefits - dark circles gone&lt;br /&gt;and skin seems tighter and thicker....will continue with this product. Very good value!</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t expect miracles here, I don&#x27;t see a grand difference in the product from the normal one that I was using before.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change whatsoever. I should have spent the extra money &amp; gotten the Strivectin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using the Advanced Wrinkle Reducer and could not believe how much better my skin felt so I decided to add the eye cream to my regimen.  Over the past few years I have noticed more crow’s feet appearing and was hoping this product would stop them from progressing.  So far I have noticed a little bit of improvement (its only been 2 weeks) but several of my friends have made comments on how much better my skin looks!</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of NuVectin Advanced Wrinkle Reducer - I have always used StiVectin SD and been happy with the results but was on the search for something that was not as expensive.  I tried a few drugstore brands but those did not leave my skin feeling that great. So after searching on Amazon and reading some claims that this was similar to StiVectin I gave it a shot and I am very pleased with the results and now I can get my Starbucks a little more often with the money I am saving </li>
            <li> I have never used an eye cream but because I liked the Advanced Wrinkle reducer I thought I would give this a shot.  In only a few short weeks I can’t believe the results or that it has taken me this long to use a product like this!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I don&#x27;t see drastic changes. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months now day and night. I see slight changes.</li>
            <li> per wife, great product</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream after trying NuVectin&#x27;s Wrinkle Remover. I figure since the wrinkle remover works so well, the eye cream must be just as good. I am pleased to say that I was right. Before using this cream, I would have to apply concealer under my eyes every morning, but after using this for just two months, concealer is no longer necessary. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After turning 60 (yikes!), I became really self conscious about my crows&#x27; feet and dark circles.  I also have bad allergies and my eyes often look puffy and tired.  I have used NuVectin Eye Cream for 3 months and I feel like my eyes look more rested, brighter. Like another reviewer,  I am finding that I don&#x27;t need my concealer and I don&#x27;t have to stick cucumber slices on my eyes to get rid of the puffiness!  The fine wrinkles around my eyes have softened.  I am going to keep using this and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This company makes great products and I am so glad I found them and so is my pocket book. My eyes look so much younger and vibrant and the dark circles that we beginning to form have nearly disappeared. I have never found products this reasonably priced that make such a difference in my skin.</li>
