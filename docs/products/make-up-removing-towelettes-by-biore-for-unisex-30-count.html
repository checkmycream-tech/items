            <li>makes your face feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product for my very sensitive skin!love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon as it is not sold in stores in Florida</li>
            <li>I love them, they leave my skin really clean, i use alot of make Up and with this towels</li>
            <li>These are my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I got these free alongside another Biore purchase, so I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>Now I know why they were free to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to using toilettes, but I tried this one out, well because it was free.  </li>
            <li>i feel really easy and fast to clean my face, yes its kind of hard with the eye area, but still its the best make up remover.</li>
            <li>This way the customer can be sure they get exactly what they ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very clean and fresh, but that is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li>I love them, however; they remove my make-up (better than other towelletes I&#x27;ve tried) and smell nice.     </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, as it&#x27;s my 1st makeup removing wipes, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>There are many other more gentle, effective make up removers and towelettes out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried these for the first time and they do work!</li>
            <li>It took off Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Waterproof mascara with no stinging.  </li>
            <li>The texture is nice and it&#x27;s moist enough, however the biggest downside for me is that it BURNS around my eyes - really stings!</li>
            <li>I decided to try them again the subsequent day and experienced the very same burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick service...very much appreciated.</li>
            <li>They are very gentle and we like the Biore brand.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>I use a second one to be sure all traces of makeup are gone.</li>
            <li>irritated my skin so much</li>
            <li>and it is enough to clean my face</li>
            <li>And it is easy to get dry.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are extremely rough and have a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It was most disappointing since it claimed to remove eye makeup and mascara even better than other brands, so one would think it would also be safe and painless to use for eye makeup.</li>
            <li>So I am hoping that the manufacturer just changed the packaging, if that is the case then the photo needs to be updated to reflect the new packaging.</li>
            <li>Completely removes the makeup, dirt and oil!</li>
            <li>Biore towelettes have a surprisingly rough nobby texture (like cheap rough TP) which combined with the astringent-like liquid is just too much for the face.</li>
            <li>I do not have overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use the first one a lot, rinse a third time if necessary.</li>

            <li> I use the first one a lot, rinse a third time if necessary.</li>
            <li> They not only looked very old but were all dried up and were no longer&lt;br /&gt;able to be used as they were completely dry.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective to remove makeup completely.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for sensitive facial skin or eyes, but in order to use them up, I&#x27;ll use them on my feet.</li>
            <li> I would have thought, especially given they are made to \\&quot;remove makeup\\&quot; that they wouldn&#x27;t be so drying or harsh, given eye make up etc...</li>
            <li> and after i used them my eyes were pink.</li>
            <li> Although they eventually remove makeup, the necessary repetitive scrubbing with such a harsh chemical-latent towelette leaves your skin tender, red, dried out, and stinging.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that they sting my face</li>
            <li> I cut them in half</li>
            <li> I found these wipes to be way too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> For quite a few minutes after using it, my eyes are still tearing up and the skin around keeps burning.</li>
            <li> that there is little to no fragrance, hard to find in this worldover saturated with odors, often toxic.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable, especially on eyes.</li>
            <li> She uses them to take off eye makeup and sometimes to cleanse her face if she&#x27;s too tired to wash it.</li>
            <li> The liquid stings my eyes badly.</li>
            <li> These came and I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got these free alongside another Biore purchase, so I decided to give them a try. Now I know why they were free to try. These towelettes are extremely rough and have a strong chemical smell. Although they eventually remove makeup, the necessary repetitive scrubbing with such a harsh chemical-latent towelette leaves your skin tender, red, dried out, and stinging. I would have thought, especially given they are made to \\&quot;remove makeup\\&quot; that they wouldn&#x27;t be so drying or harsh, given eye make up etc...I would not recommend these to anyone, regardless of skin type. There are many other more gentle, effective make up removers and towelettes out there.</li>
            <li> Biore towelettes have a surprisingly rough nobby texture (like cheap rough TP) which combined with the astringent-like liquid is just too much for the face. The liquid stings my eyes badly. Not a good product for sensitive facial skin or eyes, but in order to use them up, I&#x27;ll use them on my feet. The fragrance is very clean and fresh, but that is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my Biore strips box.    I&#x27;m not used to using toilettes, but I tried this one out, well because it was free.  It worked pretty well for me.  It took off Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Waterproof mascara with no stinging.  I didn&#x27;t have to scrape my eyes at all.  My face felt better afterwards; there was no stinging at all.  And I loved the smell   :)</li>
            <li> I found these wipes to be way too harsh on my skin.  They caused such a burning sensation all over my face that I had to re-wash my face with a different cleanser to stop the stinging.  I decided to try them again the subsequent day and experienced the very same burning sensation.  Safe to say that I won&#x27;t be using up the rest of the package.  I do not have overly sensitive skin.  I did not find them to be extremely effective in removing makeup either.</li>
            <li> makes your face feel nice and clean.  I cut them in half and it is enough to clean my face</li>
            <li> These came and I was very disappointed.  They not only looked very old but were all dried up and were no longer&lt;br /&gt;able to be used as they were completely dry.  Will not purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Completely removes the makeup, dirt and oil! I love this!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for my very sensitive skin!love that there is little to no fragrance, hard to find in this worldover saturated with odors, often toxic.</li>
            <li> However, I was used to the package looking like the package pictured here. However, when I received the item the packaging was white and does not look like this. So I am hoping that the manufacturer just changed the packaging, if that is the case then the photo needs to be updated to reflect the new packaging. This way the customer can be sure they get exactly what they ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like to use these makeup wipes when I am in a pinch. They smell nice and clean well and are great for cleaning makeup off clothes should you accidentally get some on your shirt or robe.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable, especially on eyes. Not very effective to remove makeup completely. And it is easy to get dry.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like facial towelettes, then you probably won&#x27;t like these. I love them, however; they remove my make-up (better than other towelletes I&#x27;ve tried) and smell nice.     I put moisturizer on after I use them to avoid dryness, which is what I do after I wash my face with soap and water as well. With this regimen, I&#x27;ve had no skin problems.</li>
            <li> I thought i was buying a good product loved it for that afact that it irriated my eyes and after i used them my eyes were pink.</li>
            <li> I love them, they leave my skin really clean, i use alot of make Up and with this towels i feel really easy and fast to clean my face, yes its kind of hard with the eye area, but still its the best make up remover.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on magazine reviews and fellow amazon customer reviews.  The towelettes remove the make up better than Boots cosmetic ones.  The only negative for me is that they sting my face and I immediately have to rinse my face with water after using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these for the first time and they do work! The texture is nice and it&#x27;s moist enough, however the biggest downside for me is that it BURNS around my eyes - really stings! For quite a few minutes after using it, my eyes are still tearing up and the skin around keeps burning. I really wanted to love this product, as it&#x27;s my 1st makeup removing wipes, but I just can&#x27;t. It was most disappointing since it claimed to remove eye makeup and mascara even better than other brands, so one would think it would also be safe and painless to use for eye makeup. Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of the pack</li>
            <li> wife says this item is a must for makeup removal and is a standard on her makeup table. cost is a plus</li>
            <li> I used this while I was in San Salvador and love it...Smells nice and does the job of removing makeup cleanly!  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon as it is not sold in stores in Florida that I know of.  Thank you for the quick service...very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting off your makeup and is easy on the skin.  I always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> It definitely contains alcohol. irritated my skin so much</li>
            <li> Bought these for my teenage daughter. She uses them to take off eye makeup and sometimes to cleanse her face if she&#x27;s too tired to wash it. They are very gentle and we like the Biore brand.</li>
            <li> There are great when you are in a hurry and just want to wash your face.  No fuss and kind to skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for along time. They&#x27;re not carried here in my town anymore so I order online. When taking off makeup I use one, to wipe the heaviest makeup off my face then rinse it and wash again. I use a second one to be sure all traces of makeup are gone. I use the first one a lot, rinse a third time if necessary. They&#x27;ve never bothered my skin and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better to take care of makeup!  These are my absolute favorite!</li>
    </ol>
