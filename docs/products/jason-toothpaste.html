            <li>Jason is a great brand to buy from.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for years, and am really happy that I can now buy it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This has a great cinnamon, but not overly powering flavor.</li>
            <li>Great flavor.  </li>
            <li>This is a strong flavor but if you use the pea sized amount it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon and Spearmint go surprisingly well together.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste fills the bill and tastes good.</li>
            <li>so I feel very safe having my family use it.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I decided on this brand, and flavor.</li>
            <li>The taste is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a bite which would have been nice to counter the chalky/clay like taste.</li>
            <li>you like the taste of cinnamon, you&#x27;ll love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>However, it takes a bit of getting used to as it is more frothy than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>and I love the cinnamon mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the Jason products and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>Kids love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>no gleaming knock-your-eyes-out bright smile or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s just toothpaste and how can one bestow love on toothpaste?</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamon taste......</li>
            <li>There are no harmful ingredients in this toothpaste, if you have a sensitivity to toothpaste Sodium Laurel Sulfate, you will love this toothpaste</li>
            <li>But since I will be flying on a plane soon, I decided to order some, as it&#x27;s more convenient packing a tube, than a jar.</li>
            <li>I also had a burning sensation all over the top of my tongue.</li>
            <li>I was in misery for about three days, barely able to eat, swallow or speak.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste...</li>
            <li>it tastes good, cleans well and leaves fresh breath...</li>
            <li>Refreshing but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and it makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s SLS free and fluoride free!</li>
            <li>Also Leave my teeth very clean,  smooth and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>If you worry about flrouride (it&#x27;s a poison), and want great taste in a natural toothpaste, then this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this for a many couple reasons with a ultrasonic toothbrush it does not turn into some type of crest foam fest in your mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does brighten teeth effectively while keeping mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li>What better reason to purchase this animal friendly product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY mildly cinnamon-</li>
            <li>to it at all - wonderfully mild!</li>
            <li>All natural, no fluoride,  good taste</li>
            <li>The next morning I noticed a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel dental visit clean</li>
            <li>your teeth feel so clean.....</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but I really wish it was more cinnamon-y.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth fresh and clean feeling without the aftertaste.</li>
            <li>The boys in the family are super susceptible to canker sores(don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Generally, I make my own toothpaste</li>
            <li>Super minty fresh with hint of cinnamon flavor.  </li>
            <li>after me... &amp;#34;I&#x27;m worth it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.</li>
            <li>so fresh.....</li>
            <li>No artificial sweeteners</li>
            <li>I really like how clean my mouth feels after brushing my teeth with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>After searching for a natural toothpaste, I was becoming discouraged.</li>
            <li>Why support companies that make products that are unhealthy when you can buy products that do a body good? :)</li>
            <li>I am not kidding when I say I love this paste for several reasons, they avoid using animal by-products, synthetic colors or fragrance, and harmful chemicals in all their products.</li>
            <li>I love Powersmile toothpastes, and especially this flavor.</li>
            <li>that said the prior incarnation was fuller than most tubes of tp</li>
            <li>At first, I did not attribute this problem to the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>it works and is not poison as are major marketed junk out there, &amp;#34;tastes great but less filling&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this, just a little dab and it foams up nice.</li>
            <li>and my husband really likes the way this one tastes</li>
            <li>(gee, thanks).  </li>
            <li>You should really buy this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth have become a lot more sensitive in the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little goopy/gummy (perhaps it&#x27;s this particular batch), but effective in whitening as much as a toothpaste can.</li>
            <li>much better taste than other Jason toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t our bodies worth the extra cash?</li>
            <li>I wondered if it could be this new cinnamon toothpaste I had purchased.</li>
            <li>With Jasons, you know you are putting natural products in your mouth, and I always have a really white smile.  </li>
            <li>We were all very surprised when we tried Jason Powersmile.</li>
            <li>The texture is slightly different from other toothpastes, but I love that there is no fluoride in it.</li>
            <li>- it is a little bit thicker than other toothpastes but you can just use less paste and more water:)</li>
            <li>This product is all natural</li>
            <li>We returned them and ordered the Nutrismile variant which is our old standby.</li>
            <li>I like Jason products a lot, this is free of chemicals and harsh abrasives.</li>
            <li>For years I suffered from canker sores, getting one or more at least a couple times a month.  </li>
            <li>Works well on sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Beware to those who are sometimes sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>One of the VERY FEW products on the market sodium lauryl sulphate free.</li>
            <li>Unlike other natural dental products, Jason products really work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since eliminating toothpastes containing SLS (Sodium Laurel Sulphate), I get very few canker sores (maybe 1 every couple months) and they are remarkably milder than before and last only a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only gave this item four stars because I feel that JASON should have used xylitol as a natural sweetener to make up for its lack of fluoride.  </li>
            <li>Instead, they used stevia which is also a natural sweetener, but it does not have the same benefits for strengthening tooth enamel and fighting cavities.  </li>

            <li> My thinking was that we would be resolved to using either one that does not leave your mouth feeling fresh or one that tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> Have used it for months without getting bored.</li>
            <li> The worst ones would last upwards of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We hated this, and this came as a shock as we are Jason</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is all natural so I feel very safe having my family use it.  The taste is amazing.  Unlike other natural dental products, Jason products really work.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re still waiting to finish the last tube of Jason toothpaste that we bought, but we bought this before and my husband really likes the way this one tastes</li>
            <li> PRO: One of the VERY FEW products on the market sodium lauryl sulphate free. For example, Toms of Maine HAS SLS, although they claim they get it from coconut oil (gee, thanks).  The boys in the family are super susceptible to canker sores(don&#x27;t know why the girls aren&#x27;t affected).   Did a little research and SLS is a common problem/cause.   Now we are down to 2-6 a sores year that you don&#x27;t notice, versus constant mouth fulls that make it difficult to eat.  Thank GOD.    CON: My teeth have become a lot more sensitive in the last 2 years.  Could be age, or could be lack of floride in this product according to my dentist.   Have begun using a floride paste in the evening on occasion to try to balance things out.</li>
            <li> Product awesome. Each box was torn up however. Sealed in package, so I didn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t our bodies worth the extra cash? Why support companies that make products that are unhealthy when you can buy products that do a body good? :)&lt;br /&gt;Repeat after me... &amp;#34;I&#x27;m worth it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent. Now treat your body good!&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping.</li>
            <li> Best tasting toothpaste ever!  Super minty fresh with hint of cinnamon flavor.  I am not kidding when I say I love this paste for several reasons, they avoid using animal by-products, synthetic colors or fragrance, and harmful chemicals in all their products. Additionally, they do not engage in any animal testing in the development of our products.  What better reason to purchase this animal friendly product.</li>

            <li> Good toothpaste.  Kids love it.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing &amp; foams great!</li>
            <li> powersmile tastes great - it is a little bit thicker than other toothpastes but you can just use less paste and more water:)</li>
            <li> I love Powersmile toothpastes, and especially this flavor. It&#x27;s a little goopy/gummy (perhaps it&#x27;s this particular batch), but effective in whitening as much as a toothpaste can.</li>
            <li> LOVE...LOVE...LOVE!!!!  Excellent product!!!  Cleans and whitens, just as advertised!</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste but, after all, it is just toothpaste and I can&#x27;t find any glowing terms to describe it.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference .... no gleaming knock-your-eyes-out bright smile or anything like that.  It is a serviceable product and doesn&#x27;t contain any yucky stuff, so that&#x27;s a good thing!  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s just toothpaste and how can one bestow love on toothpaste?</li>
            <li> Have used it for months without getting bored. No fluorine and the taste is great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does brighten teeth effectively while keeping mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I love the cinnamon taste......so fresh.....not overpowering.....stays with you for awhile.....your teeth feel so clean.....I will never use another natural toothpaste other than this one.</li>
            <li> All the kids give this toothpaste thumbs up. Great taste and texture! Will buy again. Love that it&#x27;s SLS free and fluoride free!</li>
            <li> There are no harmful ingredients in this toothpaste, if you have a sensitivity to toothpaste Sodium Laurel Sulfate, you will love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I like Jason products a lot, this is free of chemicals and harsh abrasives. Don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this, just a little dab and it foams up nice. Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This product is great because 1)It does not have any harmful parabans or sulfates 2) No artificial sweeteners 3)The price is great for the quality 4) Cinnamon and Spearmint go surprisingly well together. You should really buy this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> much better taste than other Jason toothpaste brands. Cleans teeth, and I have no mouth issues since started using product.</li>
            <li> Generally, I make my own toothpaste so I know what ingredients I am putting inside of my body. But since I will be flying on a plane soon, I decided to order some, as it&#x27;s more convenient packing a tube, than a jar. I am very glad I decided on this brand, and flavor. All natural, no fluoride,  good taste and it makes your mouth feel very clean. Jason is a great brand to buy from.</li>
            <li> This is a strong flavor but if you use the pea sized amount it is awesome.  My goto toothpaste !</li>
            <li> I started to use it, and in one week I had blisters all over my mouth . I asked from my husband to try it and after 4 days he develop blisters also in his mouth.  Do your self a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS product.</li>
            <li> The new packaging and seems to have less in the tube? that said the prior incarnation was fuller than most tubes of tp I have ever bought. it works and is not poison as are major marketed junk out there, &amp;#34;tastes great but less filling&amp;#34; oh I am terrible..</li>
            <li> For years I suffered from canker sores, getting one or more at least a couple times a month.  The worst ones would last upwards of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since eliminating toothpastes containing SLS (Sodium Laurel Sulphate), I get very few canker sores (maybe 1 every couple months) and they are remarkably milder than before and last only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of Jason (and Burt&#x27;s Bees) toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor is individual taste (pun intended), but I will say the cinnamon is subtle and doesn&#x27;t have any bite (another pun?) to it at all - wonderfully mild!</li>
            <li> Was trying to reduce the amount of fluoride my family and I were taking in. This toothpaste fills the bill and tastes good. It is now the only toothpaste we use.</li>
            <li> I gave it away, i bought it, told my dentist that i am using it, she said get a toothpaste that has floride</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for years, and am really happy that I can now buy it from Amazon.  With Jasons, you know you are putting natural products in your mouth, and I always have a really white smile.  Go Jasons!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling clean. The texture is slightly different from other toothpastes, but I love that there is no fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> This has a great cinnamon, but not overly powering flavor. I enjoy this for a many couple reasons with a ultrasonic toothbrush it does not turn into some type of crest foam fest in your mouth. Also Leave my teeth very clean,  smooth and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> Works well on sensitive teeth. Not overpoweringly cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my mouth feels after brushing my teeth with this toothpaste. It&#x27;s VERY mildly cinnamon- I was expecting more of a bite which would have been nice to counter the chalky/clay like taste. I would give it 5 stars, but I really wish it was more cinnamon-y.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste for about two weeks, I noticed a sore on the side of my tongue. I also had a burning sensation all over the top of my tongue. At first, I did not attribute this problem to the toothpaste. I was in misery for about three days, barely able to eat, swallow or speak. There was actually a white sticky coating all over my tongue. I finally remembered hearing about someone who had a similar experience after using a toothpaste (not this brand). I wondered if it could be this new cinnamon toothpaste I had purchased. One night I brushed my teeth with nothing but water. The next morning I noticed a remarkable improvement. It does not seem to bother my husband as of yet. Beware to those who are sometimes sensitive to products. This one might cause a problem for you.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste... it tastes good, cleans well and leaves fresh breath... I&#x27;ve tried a few flavors and based on the value and taste we tend to keep ordering this flavor in the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Great flavor.  Refreshing but not overpowering.  Leaves your mouth fresh and clean feeling without the aftertaste. That&#x27;s all she wrote.  (Why is there a word requirement on reviews?)</li>
