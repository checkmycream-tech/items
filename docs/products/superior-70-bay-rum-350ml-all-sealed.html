            <li>Great for bug bites.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great bay rum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years with awesome results!</li>
            <li>It has a naturally clean feeling upon application, and it smells great!</li>

            <li>Definitely nice after a shave.</li>
            <li>A very nice, light bay rum reminders of going to the barbershop with my father and grandfather.</li>
            <li>Recived this order 2 days early then advised great service, great product.</li>
            <li>At 65% alcohol I wonder if most folks wear this or drink it?  </li>
            <li>I find that most people complain about Pinaud Clubman Bay Rum burning a lot and</li>
            <li>If you know anything about that product it would be interesting to hear about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I use this as an aftershave and love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>Not an every-day scent, but really nice on special occasions.</li>
            <li>for a long time and this about the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Superior 70 and Dominica are some of the most natural bay rums you can buy.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you don&#x27;t like Aqua Velva or Old Spice that this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>Great fro after I have had my marine high and tight haircut where they have shaved my head to the skin, works very well at preventing skin issues, goes on freesia and clean and smells great too.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of trial and error to find it; some of the others I tried were too flowery or sweet.</li>
            <li>Both of the women I&#x27;m dating love how I smell when I wear it, and really, that&#x27;s all I can ask for in an aftershave/cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells different than the Dominica Bay Rum I&#x27;ve been using, but good.</li>
            <li>It has more of a clove/spice scent, whereas most other bay rum I&#x27;ve had has been more of a citrus/sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is very natural, very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last too long, but what lingers is perfect.</li>
            <li>This bay rum is good, but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>This was NOT a problem with the Superior 70 that I had previously used........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several Bay Rum aftershaves, this one is fantastic in the way it soothes the skin &amp; has a very mild, pure bay rum scent.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>No fancy packaging but also not expensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s less than $2.50 a bottle, pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Product is fine itself, but I bought this as an aftershave and the scent has a very short life.  </li>
            <li>Besides it being a big hit of nostalgia, I also enjoy it because it&#x27;s noticeable without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It also really does not have any burn.</li>
            <li>Not particularly long lasting but refreshing after a shave.</li>
            <li>Puerto Rico Distilling Co. who makes Superior 70 also makes something called Baluarte Alcoholado in the same bottle but with a red label and red cap.</li>
            <li>When I opened this particular bottle, instead of Bay Rum, it reeked of plastic.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a good deal as it&#x27;s what a lot of other other bay rums are priced at</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the scent is old timey or set in a certain decade as it just smells natural and not overbearing in any way.</li>
            <li>I do find that the price here is very high in comparison to how much the actual cost of the product is elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This is a classic Bay Rum aftershave like grand-dad used to use, and reminds me of the barber shops my Dad took me to when I was young.</li>
            <li>The product is great, only the price is wrong.</li>
            <li>and you probably won&#x27;t notice it much after putting it on and walking around for a short while.</li>
            <li>the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on Superior 70 usually say there is little to no burn.</li>
            <li>The bay rum category is pretty endless</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is not equipped with any kind of &amp;#34;modulation&amp;#34; (just an open neck), so dispensing is difficult.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it somewhere else due to the fact that for the same price you will get twice as much product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not for me and unlike any bay rum I&#x27;ve come across. Smelled like disinfectant. Not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Product is fine itself, but I bought this as an aftershave and the scent has a very short life.  Works well enough, but just not something I&#x27;d jump to buy again.</li>
            <li> When I opened this particular bottle, instead of Bay Rum, it reeked of plastic.  Obviously the plastic from the bottle had leached into the alcohol.  This was NOT a problem with the Superior 70 that I had previously used........</li>
            <li> This is the Bay Rum that is closest to the scent that my father used to wear when I was a child. It took a bit of trial and error to find it; some of the others I tried were too flowery or sweet. Besides it being a big hit of nostalgia, I also enjoy it because it&#x27;s noticeable without being overpowering. Not an every-day scent, but really nice on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Bay Rum aftershaves, this one is fantastic in the way it soothes the skin &amp; has a very mild, pure bay rum scent.

            <li> Recived this order 2 days early then advised great service, great product. I am a bay rum&lt;br /&gt;User for a long time and this about the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This is a classic Bay Rum aftershave like grand-dad used to use, and reminds me of the barber shops my Dad took me to when I was young. Both of the women I&#x27;m dating love how I smell when I wear it, and really, that&#x27;s all I can ask for in an aftershave/cologne. To get that at such a low price conspired to the over-priced &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; fragrances is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best bay rum on the market. I use it as an aftershave, and it surpasses all other aftershaves I have previously used. It has a naturally clean feeling upon application, and it smells great!</li>

            <li> Great fro after I have had my marine high and tight haircut where they have shaved my head to the skin, works very well at preventing skin issues, goes on freesia and clean and smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is the finest traditional &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; I have used in the last 20 years. Superb product that exceeds all expectations!</li>
            <li> This product is great for itchy skin.  Great for bug bites.  I would not buy it here however as the price is about $2.50 a bottle at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> This bay rum is good, but not quite what I expected. It has more of a clove/spice scent, whereas most other bay rum I&#x27;ve had has been more of a citrus/sweet scent.</li>
            <li> At 65% alcohol I wonder if most folks wear this or drink it?  Not enough bay rum scent for my taste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong buying this Bay Rum. If you get it at Walgreens it&#x27;s less than $2.50 a bottle, pretty amazing. I bought mine locally about 10 miles away in a Spanish part of town. I wouldnt have driven that far just for a bottle of aftershave if I wasn&#x27;t crazy about bay rum. If you buy it retail online for $4-$12 it&#x27;s still a good deal as it&#x27;s what a lot of other other bay rums are priced at and it&#x27;s a great bay rum. The smell is very natural, very light. Smells like the tropics. It also really does not have any burn. I find that most people complain about Pinaud Clubman Bay Rum burning a lot and the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on Superior 70 usually say there is little to no burn. I can&#x27;t say the scent is old timey or set in a certain decade as it just smells natural and not overbearing in any way. It&#x27;s pretty light and you probably won&#x27;t notice it much after putting it on and walking around for a short while. I suppose if you don&#x27;t like Aqua Velva or Old Spice that this would be a good choice. Superior 70 and Dominica are some of the most natural bay rums you can buy. The bay rum category is pretty endless so if you like this or don&#x27;t like this you can always move on to another one. Overall, for $2.50 -$12 it&#x27;s a great product. Definitely nice after a shave. Puerto Rico Distilling Co. who makes Superior 70 also makes something called Baluarte Alcoholado in the same bottle but with a red label and red cap. If you know anything about that product it would be interesting to hear about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like bay rum I&#x27;ve made two Listmania Bay Rum lists if you want to check them out. About 50 bay rums are listed.</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than promised and it is as advertised</li>
            <li> A very nice, light bay rum reminders of going to the barbershop with my father and grandfather.</li>
            <li> Smells different than the Dominica Bay Rum I&#x27;ve been using, but good. Can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is supposed to be. Not particularly long lasting but refreshing after a shave. No fancy packaging but also not expensive.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic! I have used this product for many years with awesome results! I do find that the price here is very high in comparison to how much the actual cost of the product is elsewhere. I would recommend buying it somewhere else due to the fact that for the same price you will get twice as much product.</li>
            <li> The product is great, only the price is wrong. the size I purchase is overpriced</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave and love the smell of it.  I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a customer of mine. So I decided to give it a try. This product does work!!! I have severe lower back problems. I applied this product on my back and almost instantly my back pain was gone. This product gives me temperary relief where I can sleep at night.</li>
