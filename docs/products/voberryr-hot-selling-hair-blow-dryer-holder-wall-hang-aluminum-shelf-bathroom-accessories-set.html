            <li> Very creative and stores nicely!</li>
            <li> It came in relatively quickly but the attachment for the wall was broken so I had to figure out a different way to anchor it to my wall. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty and does its job well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Fits my dryer perfectly and looks really neat.</li>
            <li> My kids love to knock my blow dryer into the sink and with this thing they&#x27;re unable to reach it. I give it four stars only because it doesn&#x27;t really fit my blow dryer very well. I have the shorter style so it doesn&#x27;t sit perfectly in there. I would buy it again though. I would like it better if the back was wider so i could wrap the cord though.</li>
            <li> great fast delivery so glad that I got it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions and does not stay flush against the wall</li>
            <li> Easy to install. Very great product high quality, low priced too .</li>
