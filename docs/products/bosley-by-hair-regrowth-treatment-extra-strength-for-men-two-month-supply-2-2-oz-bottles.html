            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Quick, efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works, and I saw new hair growth in about three weeks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it will work for you or not, however it was worth a try for me and again it was a lot cheaper buying for this site and</li>
            <li>Does not say results happen right away.</li>
            <li>With its easy application and no fuss no muss system, I find it to be better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great but not sure about using it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>so I bought this on amazon in hopes of growing my hair line back and after purchasing it I read more of the reviews and don&#x27;t even wanna risk it on my heart</li>
            <li>or because I stopped being consistent with the treatment.</li>
            <li>exactly the product I ordered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so may need more time to state results yet the back of my&lt;br /&gt;head seems a little more full.</li>
            <li>I can see that it helped  but not as much as I see on a tv</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the deliver was fast like always.....</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work on my classic horseshoe balding spots.  </li>
            <li>Probably from high alcohol content.  </li>
            <li>It works and just in 1 month, I can see some new hair....</li>
            <li>After six months there I see far fewer hairs in the sink and tub, and there is also new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my son and in a month I notice little fine hair started showing.  </li>
            <li>Hi, recently, the top of my scalp has become visibly thinner to the point where a little bald patch is beginning to appear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and my hair started falling out a year ago.</li>
            <li>Product both met and exceeded my expectations thus far.</li>
            <li>The item was priced well, shipment came in early and shipment came in as advertised.</li>
            <li>I thought the dropping would cease completely.</li>
            <li>So far I have used as directed.</li>
            <li>I am 32 now and hope to keep my hair until I reach 40 or at least until something better comes on the market.</li>
            <li>It took about a month for my hair to completely grow back, but even after the first use I could see it was starting to work.</li>
            <li>We have a 7 year old yellow lab</li>

            <li> We have a 7 year old yellow lab</li>
            <li> Still using product but observing some new growth in areas which were previously bald and not having any hair to see</li>
            <li> In fairness, some hair growth was evident, but the down sides were not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that you need to use this every single day</li>
            <li> I did it by the book with no results except for dry, flaky dandruff scalp.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to try it out and compare to another brand, I think I&#x27;ll go back to my previous one.</li>
            <li> A few hair still drop on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Try to keep it away from your eyebrows and apply on wet hair.</li>
            <li> All three together worked extremely well for me</li>
            <li> It gives me itchiness and dandruff a lot in the morning, it may works for the other not for me.</li>
            <li> but at least I kept what I have left.</li>
            <li> After trying out some other topical products I really wasn&#x27;t seeing the changes I&#x27;d been hoping for and was feeling frustrated.</li>
            <li> less than half the cost of the Rogaine foam and same&lt;br</li>
            <li> im in half of the period and my hair is regrowth</li>
            <li> stopped using the product for little over two months and a lot has fallen out.</li>
            <li> Using this product for a little over 2 months have not seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t see that thin spot on the back of my head  that used to be there.</li>
            <li> Hair is already looking thicker, after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously everyday and have NOT see any result at all</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY AND KEEP USING IT!</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the hair gel I use</li>
            <li> Just infomercial scam, don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps hairline</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and can see what appears to be ingrown hairs in the thinning areas and can see small hairs pushing through.</li>
            <li> Gonna continue using for at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> Hair Regrowth by Bosley was bought by me for my boyfriend who suffers from male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> In fact I was at a benefit and someone took a picture behind me of the crowd and when I looked at the picture  </li>
            <li> Except applicator was broken.</li>
            <li> Never experienced any side effects.</li>
            <li> It looks like a used product, not happy at all.</li>
            <li> useless product , very hard to apply in fact</li>
            <li> weird and dangerous staff, did not work for me, at least not as supposed to...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> I plan and stopping the treatment cold turkey in order to see if it falls out again.</li>
            <li> What I didn’t realize was that I was tackling the problem the wrong way!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Product produced terrible scalp itch, scaling and sores.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I see some improvements</li>
            <li> Freaking sweetness this time around!</li>
            <li> Great Product And Fast Shipping, Thanks!</li>
            <li> this product it is great, it does not each and hair is growing all over the top of my head</li>
            <li> my husband has been using these drops for about a year now. he doesn&#x27;t have a full head of hair, but it is fuller than it was when he started using it. he&#x27;s been quite satisfied with it, and has reordered twice now.</li>
            <li> Very good minoxidil scalp solution for your hair loss problem that can have an awesome effect if taken in combination with an &#x27;inside&#x27; product that targets the causes of hair loss in young male adults. I&#x27;m 27 years old and my hair started falling out a year ago. After trying out some other topical products I really wasn&#x27;t seeing the changes I&#x27;d been hoping for and was feeling frustrated. What I didn’t realize was that I was tackling the problem the wrong way!! Basically, in order to STOP hair loss, you need to target the problem from the outside AND Inside. My current daily regimen consists of two doses of HairGain formula (90 caps) and and one to two (scalp applications) of BOSLEY Extra strength for Men. Anyways, this is a killer combination of two great products that in my case have stopped the progression of hair loss.</li>
            <li> Product both met and exceeded my expectations thus far. The item was priced well, shipment came in early and shipment came in as advertised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my fiancés hair growth at all.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and just as shown!</li>
            <li> Hi, recently, the top of my scalp has become visibly thinner to the point where a little bald patch is beginning to appear.&lt;br /&gt;I know its a chance im taking using this product, as it may not work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I have not used this product before. I just purchased it and am waiting on delivery.&lt;br /&gt;My question is- how do you use and apply? And for how long?&lt;br /&gt;Cant seem to find directions on it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
            <li> I am 33 and I began thinning in the front at around age 27. The product says specifically that it may not work for thinning in the front, but I tried it anyways (thinking I had nothing else to lose..). To my surprise, there was a noticeable effect after only a month. After six months there I see far fewer hairs in the sink and tub, and there is also new hair growth. I should note that: I only use it once a day and I also use it along with the Bosley shampoo and conditioner. All three together worked extremely well for me and I am much extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this hair treatment product. I have been using it for two months and I can already see a difference. .</li>
            <li> YES I HAVE ALWAYS USED NUTRA IONIC FOR THINNING HAIR AND ITS HELPED! RETIRED HAIRDRESSER AND I THOUGH THIS MIGHT BE BETTER BUT U HAVE TO USE IT EVERYDAY AND KEEP USING IT! NOT A PROBLEM! WE WILL SEE?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from Cosco Brand minoxidil  Hair People.You can&#x27;t go wrong either way. twice a day always people.</li>
            <li> so I bought this on amazon in hopes of growing my hair line back and after purchasing it I read more of the reviews and don&#x27;t even wanna risk it on my heart seeing that I have a irregular heart beat..</li>
            <li> The Good-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and oh boy does it work. I was thinning on the front and in the bald sport area. I would say that 70% of the hair loss returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad-&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the product for little over two months and a lot has fallen out. Not sure if its the hair gel I use or because I stopped being consistent with the treatment. I would put it on in the AM and not the PM. I now ran out of the treatment but not the shampoo, conditioner &amp; the pre-gel product (foam stuff). That alone does not work for me without accompanying it with the treatment. I&#x27;m going to try it again to see if the hair loss returns. I plan and stopping the treatment cold turkey in order to see if it falls out again. This stuff is great but not sure about using it for the rest of my life. I rather shave it off......I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TBC</li>
            <li> I can see that it helped  but not as much as I see on a tv</li>
            <li> We have a 7 year old yellow lab and I have tried everything to help with the shedding.  This product is by far the best option we have found.  It has done wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with Capillogain so I don&#x27;t know which product is working or if they both are but I seem to have thicker hair on top. Can&#x27;t say the bald spots and receding hairline are improving... yet.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp. But everybody&#x27;s bodies completely different. You may have better luck</li>
            <li> Oily and to time consuming</li>
            <li> Using this product for a little over 2 months have not seen any results yet. Gonna continue using for at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my classic horseshoe balding spots.  Idk bout vertex but it doesn&#x27;t work for the corners at sll</li>
            <li> Great product! Odorless and non-greasy.  Works very well. This product will improve hair growth if used as directed. Pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Heven&#x27;t seen any changes, and have been using it for several months now. Just wanted to try it out and compare to another brand, I think I&#x27;ll go back to my previous one.</li>
            <li> Hair Regrowth by Bosley was bought by me for my boyfriend who suffers from male pattern baldness. Hair loss has stopped. Only downside is that you need to use this every single day otherwise you start loosing hair again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t produce results yet. waiting to see if it does what it says it will. Does not say results happen right away.</li>
            <li> i am using this product a month now. I hope i see some improvements and it works effectively. A few hair still drop on a daily basis. I thought the dropping would cease completely.Or do i have to continue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the liquid and would prefer it in a foam. Yet this&lt;br /&gt;is less than half the cost of the Rogaine foam and same&lt;br /&gt;ingredient so I figured Id&#x27; try it. It&#x27;s not bad. No scent and&lt;br /&gt;is exactly the product I ordered. It&#x27;s only been two weeks&lt;br /&gt;so may need more time to state results yet the back of my&lt;br /&gt;head seems a little more full.</li>
            <li> It is not what I need.It is for the back of your head.I use the Shampoo and conditioner,from Bosley,I thought there was a step  three.</li>
            <li> Just infomercial scam, don&#x27;t waste you money!</li>
            <li> The items arrived quickly and the price was really great.  Love it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have use the product for years!!</li>
            <li> Use it every night noticing hair growing in on crown. Not sure if it helps hairline but I see a noticeable difference in length and density.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works, and I saw new hair growth in about three weeks. In fact I was at a benefit and someone took a picture behind me of the crowd and when I looked at the picture  I couldn’t see that thin spot on the back of my head  that used to be there.</li>
            <li> We returned this item because I purchased it for my husbands thinning hair and when we received it the directions stated not to use to treat thinning hair,,,?</li>
            <li> i orded this product for my husband with in a week i could see thicker healther hair i was amazed. It has now been a month and i can not explain how happy i am with this product best money spent</li>
            <li> So far I have used as directed. Hair is already looking thicker, after just a few days. Will continue to use to see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. It does nothing but  itchy scalp, makes it wrinkle. It Makes me lose my hairs so I stopped using it. I wish I could return them &amp; get my money back.</li>
            <li> Did not work. I did it by the book with no results except for dry, flaky dandruff scalp. The bottles were also only 2 months from expiring, possibly low potency?</li>
            <li> weird and dangerous staff, did not work for me, at least not as supposed to...</li>
            <li> It gives me itchiness and dandruff a lot in the morning, it may works for the other not for me.</li>
            <li> Gave this product a try, however it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used as RX for over 6 months.  This order was made because it was cheaper to buy on this site.  I can&#x27;t say if it will work for you or not, however it was worth a try for me and again it was a lot cheaper buying for this site and the deliver was fast like always.....Thank you..</li>
            <li> Great Product!! it works</li>
            <li> On time delivery, product works.  Except applicator was broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son and in a month I notice little fine hair started showing.  He said he noticed that too and plans to continue using the product.  He said he notice that the rest of his hair got thicker.  I&#x27;m going to purchase the treatment for women because of my age my hair is thinning.  I&#x27;ll follow-up with a review.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.  Nice delivery.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my husband, no results.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Quick, efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> im in half of the period and my hair is regrowth</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work my hair still look the same didn&#x27;t grow nothing</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a month or so now and haven&#x27;t seen any effects. It does say may take up to two to three months to see results so fingers still crossed.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I used it religiously everyday and have NOT see any result at all i dont think this works at all</li>
            <li> It works and just in 1 month, I can see some new hair.... I would keep this product for life.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and can see what appears to be ingrown hairs in the thinning areas and can see small hairs pushing through. We use this product along with Bosley Revive Starter Pack for Visibly Thinning Hair and rub his head every night with A&amp;D ointment to get circulation and A&amp;D is a good healing product as well. I would say it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Still using product but observing some new growth in areas which were previously bald and not having any hair to see</li>
            <li> With its easy application and no fuss no muss system, I find it to be better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> useless product , very hard to apply in fact it doesn&#x27;t even apply well . when you drop the liquid on your head its start flowing all over your head and doesn&#x27;t apply well on the bald spots , so of it doesn&#x27;t apply well . and since it doesn&#x27;t apply well then definitely it can&#x27;t produce any results.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it since may 2014 , its start of august and believe me no change whatsoever !</li>
            <li> It makes my hair grow longer, thicker and fuller. My friends noticed a big difference when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> For men only but still good we used it for husband instead</li>
            <li> Product produced terrible scalp itch, scaling and sores.  Probably from high alcohol content.  Presume all such products would do this to me.  Took couple of weeks to resolve problem after stopping application.  In fairness, some hair growth was evident, but the down sides were not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Great product husband loves it, and it really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bosley %5 for about 18 months. It didn&#x27;t seem to help me regrow my hair but at least I kept what I have left. Once your hair is gone it&#x27;s gone forever. But using this product helps me keep what I already have. I used it twice a day and kept my hair short, but now I only use it once a day. Try to keep it away from your eyebrows and apply on wet hair. Never experienced any side effects. I am 32 now and hope to keep my hair until I reach 40 or at least until something better comes on the market.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. Product arrived with no seals and it not even full to the top. It looks like a used product, not happy at all. Returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying I don&#x27;t write reviews. I&#x27;m writing this review because bosley hair re-growth treatment exceeded my expectations. It took about a month for my hair to completely grow back, but even after the first use I could see it was starting to work. Very simply put this stuff works.</li>
