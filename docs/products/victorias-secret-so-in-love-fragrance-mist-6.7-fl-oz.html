            <li>SO IN LOVE IS AN DELICATE SOFT SEXY LIGHT SCENT, IT LINGERS</li>
            <li>This body mist seems like it has too much alcohol smell in it.</li>

            <li>i love this so much, wish that it wasn&#x27;t discontinued, cause it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like the original at all and is, at best, a terrible knock off.</li>
            <li>The smell is so lady like and soft</li>
            <li>The spray didn&#x27;t stay had to use it more often was do disappointed that I have to use it more often even with the lotion our doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li>The product smells terrific and makes the skin feel soft, and is exactily as the seller described it.</li>

            <li> SO IN LOVE IS AN DELICATE SOFT SEXY LIGHT SCENT, IT LINGERS ALL DAY ON YOUR SKIN AND IM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE.  I DIDNT EXPECT THIS MIST TO BE SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually too big on sprays from Victoria&#x27;s Secret because a lot smells too heavy and too strong. This is the complete opposite from what I thought. Firstly, the bottle is so pretty, it&#x27;s plastic but from a distance is looks like glass. It&#x27;s a pull off top not a screw off kind. This spray has a very sexy feel to it. It has a flowery citrus smell. It smells just like Squeeze by Lilly Pulitzer. I highly recommend it. Oh and I saw on the bottom of the bottle that it was originally $27.00! I saved a lot by buying it from SaleAll. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the sweet scent it leaves. You probably don&#x27;t even need to use the perfume afer putting this on :)</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, is nice a subtle, is fresh and crisp is not overpowering at all. I still could smell it after 3 o 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Awesome smells beautiful</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH!!!! I was so excited when I found this cologne. One of my absolute favorites!!!!! I get so many compliments on this scent. Victoria&#x27;s Secret never has it anymore.</li>
            <li> Came On time...if not Early! Wonderful scent for everyday working. It is sweet but also strong and sexy. It smells really good . BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Soft, subtle scent but smells amazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing on!! &#x3D;) I could wear this everyday.  Just purchased the body wash as well.</li>
            <li> So upset when VS discontinued this product.  Had some lotion left over and wanted the spray bc it stays with you all day.  Great product, excellent ship time.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this fragrance. It does not smell like the original at all and is, at best, a terrible knock off.</li>
            <li> The spray didn&#x27;t stay had to use it more often was do disappointed that I have to use it more often even with the lotion our doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> I my so happy thank you</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents from Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I get lots of compliments everytime I use it :)</li>
            <li> As a love of VS perfumes, I found this perfume to be a light floral fruity sensual scent. It is a great scent for a night out on the town and stays with you. It is a mist but stays with you like a perfume. I was really impressed. Would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It looked like the real fragrance but it was a fake the smell wasent as strong as the real so in love bottle.  Plus the real bottle is like glass material and when I received this bottle it was plastic.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift for mother. I&#x27;m happy I did. She loves this fragrance!  I was very pleased the item shipping time was do fast.</li>
