            <li>MY HAIR IS BRIGHT, MY COLOR LASTS LONGER...</li>
            <li>WEN is a great product and this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried and loved the Vanilla Mint and Fig cleansers.</li>
            <li>It smells like a flower garden blooming and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>its smells good  </li>
            <li>I have tried this product and loved it</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>I have always loved the way my hair looks and feels after use.</li>
            <li>Good for men or women.</li>
            <li>I received this seasonal version of Wen cleansing conditioner yesterday and although I haven&#x27;t used it yet, it smells very-very good.</li>
            <li>Not as fragrant as I had hoped, but a good product.</li>
            <li>loved the way my hair felt after using it.  </li>
            <li>floral without being tres flores, it&#x27;s so light and wonderful.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and my hair looks good and feels silky.  </li>
            <li>The pros: it smells really good and makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Good for part time</li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and like everyone else said -- it does smell really good.</li>
            <li>and I thought that was as good as it got.</li>
            <li>My scalp used to be fairly oily after a day or two</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s good to mix it up now and then.  </li>
            <li>but if she loves this product it must be good.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>if the products were not so good</li>
            <li>But good for the price.</li>
            <li>This gives me &#x27;good hair&#x27; days every day.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about it</li>

            <li>I have used a number of Wen products, and the classics seem to be the best (Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner and styling cr&amp;egrave;me).  </li>
            <li>The improvements they have made are outstanding and leads me to believe that Chaz does listen to what his users say, and makes efforts to improve his products, and I like that and am most impressed..</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Favorite Wen formula- so happy to find it here.  </li>

            <li>So many compliments , even from my hair stylist !</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>I am IN LOVE with this!</li>
            <li>Love WEN products!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This scent is phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so amazing when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Wen is amazing.  </li>
            <li>They both smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Then a friend of mine bought it and was thrilled.</li>
            <li>If I had money to burn, I&#x27;d buy it again, it did smell nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice experience.</li>
            <li>Nice for hair.</li>
            <li>And WEN products really do make your hair awesome!</li>
            <li>fragrance is really nice, just what I would expect it to be.  </li>
            <li>This is nice</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Wen and I can honestly say I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was mortified cuz I really liked the product</li>
            <li>I just keep my one bottle of wen handy.</li>
            <li>but it is nice.</li>
            <li>It was always a problem getting it to style nice.  </li>
            <li>My daughter bought me some Wen for Mother&#x27;s Day to try, and I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li>Not so much), and this one works great for me!</li>
            <li>It gives an Icey/Hot sensation to your scalp and during my shower it kind of burns my eyes and makes my nose itch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for one time per week at most.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time about how nice my hair smells.</li>
            <li>this stuff works nicely.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled when I saw that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>But my hair turned out so nice after I styled it.</li>
            <li>The gardenia is a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Now that was kind of cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicely balanced...</li>
            <li>love love Wen doesn&#x27;t matter which one it is they are all great products.</li>
            <li>I was told by many firends about it and it really is as good as I was told.  </li>
            <li>nice  </li>
            <li>(I coupon- spending this kind of money on hair products goes against my frugal principles, but</li>
            <li>Good product  love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner in a nice smelling package</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo nice not having to shampoo then condition every day.</li>
            <li>oh, your hair smells so good.\\&quot; and they always tell me how nice it looks.</li>
            <li>The cucumber, the gardenia, and the tea tree and the sweet almond mint are great for my medium length and texture.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, works great.</li>
            <li>hair was also very easily tangled</li>
            <li>Very strongly scented.</li>
            <li>I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and Lavender scents much better.</li>
            <li>So far, this one is best.</li>
            <li>This one, however, seems like one of the more nicely balanced ones for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel wonderful and so soft</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>WEN is by far the best thing my hair has ever come across!  </li>
            <li>I am 66 with color treated, thinning &amp; very fine hair texture.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and curly.</li>
            <li>My hair is to between my shoulder blades and very fine.</li>
            <li>My grand kids were impressed too that this old lady orders her hair cleaner/conditioner</li>
            <li>Very light lemon rosemary vanillabean; none of the scents distinct but a very nice combination.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many upscale haircare products, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li>I liked this product, it really works great</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time, the itch is gone  and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks was great.</li>
            <li>At first it was a great product.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is full and shiny and looks so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I think fragrance is very important in a hair product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have very fine, color processed hair that is only at its best when I use the WEN products.</li>
            <li>Impulse buy.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine quasi wavy not the sexy kind</li>
            <li>I am a huge believer in Wen cleansing conditioner!</li>
            <li>What do you have to lose except more hair.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>This would be better if the price was lower.</li>
            <li>Even the curly girl method washing with coconut Sauve conditioner is better than this.</li>
            <li>It did NOT do that for me, but of course I made sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li>I made sure to get all of the product out of my roots and off my scalp.</li>
            <li>Much better icing on Amazon</li>
            <li>Im asking for more of this from Santa this year.</li>
            <li>This scent smells amazing and my hair feels wonderfully light.</li>
            <li>love the smell and the tingle it gives my scalp</li>
            <li>love the product,way overpriced.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>, WEN.\\&quot;  I thought Ok I&#x27;ve seen it advertised plenty of times.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the almond mint either.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item as a gift and was able to try it myself.</li>
            <li>I love gardenia</li>
            <li>Have had many of problems with perms , hair sprays and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Instead of sucking the stuff up into the straw, it just creates a hole so you have to move the straw around to get more slushie.  </li>
            <li>I love the wen cleansing conditioner I use it by</li>
            <li>I had been using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Then I just grab two more pumps and spread it over the rest of my hair and then comb it all through with a pic comb &amp; let it sit while I do the rest of my showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was like a conditioner but didn&#x27;t make my hair any better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This scent is the most enticing of all of the WEN products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I surely didn&#x27;t anticipate I&#x27;d quickly love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving time, money AND my hair is better than ever</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product and my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent of the Wen hair care line.</li>
            <li>Love to use this as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker, softer and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>product acts much more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviewers raved about this scent; it wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I am almost stockpiling it as to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>I love wen hair products.</li>

            <li>remarks on how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like also that my hair when it dries feel more &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34;, not flying al over the place.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely, though.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>And just love Wen all together.</li>
            <li>I was able to find what I needed on Amazon without having to deal with a monthly membership that makes you buy 3 or more products at a time to get a discount.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I Love wen.</li>
            <li>I feel in love with it as soon as I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to wash my hair and let it air</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>THEN I RINSE AND ADD MORE PRODUCT UNTIL FOAMS UP AND RINSE.  </li>
            <li>THE MORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>THE BETTER</li>
            <li>i love every WEN product I&#x27;ve ever bought &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t have any static in my hair when I solely used this.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but I found that my hair is a bit more frizzy unless I use more pumps.</li>
            <li>no matter how many pumps I use.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower tomorrow :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, shiner, more definition, and the tangles melt away.</li>
            <li>it seems okay</li>
            <li>If it gets better I will update this review</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to foam up like most shampoo products do.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more..</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>But study the different scents and styles and see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li>I was even able to put a nickel-sized amount on my hair as a leave-in with no problems.</li>
            <li>I thankfully have not had any issues :)</li>
            <li>I love being able to get what I want when I want it.  </li>

            <li>it works much better when you use it twice a week maximum without washing in between.</li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled better, but the scent does not linger at all</li>

            <li>Love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter and at first thought hey this is nice!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I tried to correct this by making sure I rinsed thoroughly</li>

            <li>It is my favorite Wen scent</li>
            <li>some seasonal and this one my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are listed so you can make choices.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t follow instruction on a bottle , take pumps as many as you need for your hair</li>
            <li>i love wen.</li>
            <li>they love it too.</li>
            <li>the styling cream is everyones favorite too.</li>
            <li>i love them all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better, I tried this fabulous scent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Even my stylist said my hair is in better condition now than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Its boucy, healthy - doesnt frizz or break off like before.  </li>
            <li>For me it rinsed nice and clean.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed pretty good even though the smell wasn&#x27;t really pleasant.</li>
            <li>and my head is so itchy, and smells like special shampoo (like maybe the kind you use to get rid of lice or dandruff or something)</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean and looks shiny after using these conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product at a friends house and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Excited to get to use it!  </li>
            <li>They were perfect for my dry over-processed hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After a full month of washing my color treated hair, it&#x27;s much softer, has a beautiful shine and my color has held.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with Wen so far!</li>
            <li>I am an avid fan of Wen,  Always looking for new scents - this one is great!  </li>
            <li>The ultra BEST shampoo ever for those who have dry colored hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is so great even air drying, and my natural waves curl</li>
            <li>The Gardenia Green Tea and Lavender gave me the most body so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love Wen!!!!</li>
            <li>My mother in law bought me some lavender Wen to try because she loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>one smells very feminine because of the Gardenia but its awfully good on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great packaging.  </li>
            <li>and now i am in complete insecurity phase (did that cute guy from engineering see me scratch my smelly head!?!?)</li>
            <li>It costs more but worth it !</li>
            <li>I just cant say enough good things about Wen products!</li>
            <li>it &#x27;s clean more when its bubble</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i wished chad work on the shampoo that clean the hair better than what he had</li>
            <li>Love this green tea smells great !!</li>
            <li>plus was it was easy to return and</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>&quot; i can get over the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Could be too strong for some.</li>
            <li>This WEN smells SOO good, it is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Summer mango coconut is great in the summer time, but I think that would get old month after month and wouldn&#x27;t fit in certain seasons.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d love to try winter mint, but cannot afford that one!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, very satisfied</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair that tangles easily this is the Wen for you.</li>
            <li>i followed the directions once more and used the full amount of suggested pumps</li>
            <li>I cleanse with it, rinse with cool water and put one more pump as a leave in--as Wen does not get rid of frizz</li>
            <li>fresh as spring time  with a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner gives me a clean, light, healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really fine, I live in adry climate and my daughter says she has never seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li>It might work for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium fine hair, but a lot of it, and highlights.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it .  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I use curling iron every day.</li>
            <li>but this one is just fine</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It leaves my smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>Leave me hair super smooth, and frizzless!</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the smell of this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>She has tried every shampoo available.</li>
            <li>I think its Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and I like the way it smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the Gardenia Tea to see if I liked it as much as I do the Lavender.  </li>
            <li>it does make your hair smooth and shinny.  </li>
            <li>When I last saw my stylist, &amp; before she knew I used Wen, she commented about how great my hair looked &amp; told me to keep doing what I was doing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to recommend it only because then the supply will be lower for me to get LOL.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling silky and tangle free.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE ALL FANTASTIC ON MY HAIR...</li>
            <li>Scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but they are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is extremely light.</li>
            <li>This has a light, floral scent with a bit if exoticness to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write another review on the 613 once I start using it on my own hair tomorrow since my head is really itching...</li>
            <li>Gardenia Green Tea is the best for me!</li>
            <li>I have to look for products that say weightless on them, The mint one made my hair feel really light and still had body.</li>
            <li>Always buy this scent when it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>I try to use the Wen Gluten free products when I can.</li>
            <li>I have used every product on my hair to get a sleek frizz free look to my chin length</li>
            <li>The Spring Gardenia Green Tea has a wonderful springy smell.</li>
            <li>I only used 8 pumps each washing, at most, and had good results.  </li>
            <li>, I love this product it makes my hair fuller and really makes it shine and look healthy too.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old loved the smell too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is perfect, a rich floral arrangement softened by the lightness of green tea.</li>
            <li>I use a Chi blow dryer and I use a flat iron on my bangs...and  my style stays all day and looks great on day two as well.</li>
            <li>I use my regular highly humdifying shampoo and conditioner on Mondays and use Wen on Fridays and my hair is doing great!</li>
            <li>I only use 2 full pumps and it works great...</li>
            <li>Works very nice on straight, normal hair.</li>
            <li>I was do excited to try this</li>
            <li>Use more if you feel it necessary, the more the better.</li>
            <li>brought the Original</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Almond Mint (original) &#x3D;</li>
            <li>first of all I love Wen cleansing products.  </li>
            <li>this one is supposed to smell like gardenia because it smells like the original scent.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try Wen.</li>
            <li>It is so light and leaves my curly hair bouncy, full and glossy.  </li>
            <li>excellent product you have never used anything like this before a little pricey but well worth the investment buy it now</li>
            <li>I was terrified this scent would be too flowery, but it was clean and fresh smelling instead!</li>
            <li>This was the first time for me using the Wen product and was very excited to try them.</li>
            <li>And it stays clean for days.  </li>
            <li>but it never felt clean.</li>
            <li>I never feel like my hair or my scalp isn&#x27;t clean and hair color lasts longer with Wen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe it would clean my hair, but it does.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Wen cleansing conditioners, but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Followed directions listed on product and my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li>Product works and keeps my hair clean and without the frizz.</li>
            <li>Hair does not feel clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>Have tried several scents this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair clean, conditioned, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I miss  that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>clean  hair-</li>
            <li>this is great for color treated hair or dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Wen Almond Mint, and haven&#x27;t liked some of the other scents or the way my hair feels, but this one works very well for me and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I use the low suds solution twice a week &amp; my hair stays clean, always smells good &amp; is softer than I can recall it being in years even without the application of heat.</li>
            <li>My straight hair has more body and swing and feels so clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect not too strong or not too weak.</li>
            <li>The fig, I&#x27;ve heard is best for thick course hair....</li>
            <li>color stays true.</li>
            <li>Love WEN products, appreciate the availability on line &amp; reasonable price and shipping.</li>
            <li>Although really made for all hair types, I found some favorites I felt just did a better job at managing my hair or the shine factor, but they all work GREAT!and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly not over impressed with this product</li>
            <li>The pomegranate formula, which is my absolute favorite, does not leave the waxy and greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to smell gardenia as it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely the most moisturizing of the three,</li>
            <li>while i have yet to receive my recent order of the gardenia version i expect it will be just as good as both cucumber aloe and mango</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I&#x27;m going back to my nexus pro-mend.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>If I use any more then that about, it will feel as if I have too much conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>love the smell and this really makes my hair super</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other comparable cleansing conditioners and they are okay, better than the soap on the hair,  but Wen is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It just smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I disagree as it leaves my hair super oily.</li>
            <li>I love being able to try the different scents without entering into a contract.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic not to mention the soft scent of gardenia that lingers in your hair after rinsing, but not overpowering that it will interfer with your favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Next best results for the same reasons.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel silky smooth but not dried out -- that&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
            <li>I am not brand loyal</li>
            <li>it is nothing more than a regular conditioner.and they charge you more for reordering the product without your permission.</li>
            <li>Smelled great but my after a month of use, scalp breakouts and my hair got super weighed down and oily.</li>
            <li>It smells so light and so pretty</li>
            <li>When I first bought Wen, years ago, my hair looked fabulous after using it.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite fragrance but the same great hair care all the same.</li>
            <li>Best Results, no frizz, soft, manageable, and I only need 5 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li>Not an everwhelming sweet vanilla, the lemon gives it a crisp clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I love wen, so I wanted to try a new scent.</li>
            <li>I love the new fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have broken hairs or split ends and my hair is beautifully conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but will stick to the lavender one instead since this one is only a special that no longer is available.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this product, it makes my hair soft, clean, and moisturized, it also has a nice floral scent, I still don&#x27;t know which one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried a WEN product, I highly recommend any of the scents!!!</li>
            <li>Then I very quickly get the top of my head under the shower to add just a little water and massage my scalp/roots some more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one is by far my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally kind to my hair, I wash it once a week, very very rarely blow dry and never straighten or curl.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available to do that.</li>
            <li>wen is amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li>Really cleans hair with no lather, all while leaving it smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My reactive skin remains calm when I use this.</li>
            <li>than it became dried out not too happy about that</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really sily smooth.  </li>
            <li>There really is nothing like WEN and this scent is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is pricey for a hair product, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt contain any chemicals or additives like SLS,sodium laurenth sulfate,which strips the hair,which you dont want to do,this actualy buids up the hairs natural ingredients, and your hair feels 100 percent better too.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the way Wen cleansing conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable every day.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find your money will be spent on products that are more satisfying.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair has more volume and really takes hair care to the next level.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price considering</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of perfume, flowery, fresh, spring-ish.</li>
            <li>like the WEN products because I can actually wake up in the morning with my hair looking as nice as it did before I went to bed even if I toss and turn while sleeping.</li>
            <li>Nice to not have to order the entire kit.</li>
            <li>I have to say it smells the best of all I have tired.  </li>
            <li>Some may wonder if Wen is even worth bothering over.</li>
            <li>Wen was so fresh and fragrant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really one of the cleaner Wen products that really moisturizes at an appropriate level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much worth</li>
            <li>I like it a great deal,  but so far my hair is not amazingly different or salon-esque.</li>
            <li>actually, I haven&#x27;t met a WEN cleansing product that I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li>Adore the fresh and flowery sent.</li>
            <li>and I am loving my hair finally!</li>
            <li>This product cleans your hair nicely without leaving it coarse or drying it.</li>
            <li>BUT HIS HAIR IS GROWING BACK NICELY..</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a super cool product, there are some Wen formulas more suited for different hair types.  </li>
            <li>To me it has an overwhelming menthol smell with a floral undertone, I think it would be better the other way around.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of the Spring Gardenia &amp; Green Tea is very nice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is OK but in between one needs to use regular shampoo because it does not get the scalp clean.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>Great seller, item got here fast and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but the way my hair feels after using it is not as good as other versions of WEN.</li>
            <li>This product WILL work for you, just try to find the right one that works.</li>
            <li>and I must say my nose went right on vacation to the Hawai&#x27;ian islands.  </li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t the right formula for my hair.</li>
            <li>I also thought this might be cheaper than the higher quality Moroccan oil I frequently buy for perhaps more around 42$.</li>
            <li>At first it made my hair feel wonderful and replenished and barely a week into using and hair went through a greasy stage as my hair is fine and this a thick product that does not lather.  </li>
            <li>I used Dr. Woods on my hair and it felt so clean and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The Spring Gardenia Green Tea smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I have bought several different scents, this one is by far the best</li>
            <li>I love Wen have been using it for nearly 2 years now, maybe more actually.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall, but can not continually use it, and IT only.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>liked it very much but too much money for me to use regularly.  </li>
            <li>if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this!</li>
            <li>if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this!</li>
            <li>Expected more for the price!</li>
            <li>Be sure to work it in and through your hair, and be sure to rinse for at least a full minute.  </li>
            <li>There are a few types of Wen that seem to work better than others (the Fig is fantastic, but the Sweet Almond Mint?</li>
            <li>Shasasipping was very fast...</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic and we will never go back to our original hair products again.</li>
            <li>And my hair looks healthly, full bodied and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and subtle - more of a grassy floral than medicinal.  </li>
            <li>, It left my hair manageable and was super easy to use being a multi tasking product.</li>
            <li>;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Wen and what a difference it has made to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought the big size assuming I would love.</li>
            <li>and when i got it in the mail the first thing i noticed was the smell.</li>
            <li>so i used it the first time and didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair</li>
            <li>and so i really needed to wash out my grimey hair!)</li>
            <li>and when it dries it gives me awesome curls that loosen into waves (I have middle of the back blonde</li>
            <li>error.and scraggly, smells funny, itches, and it still looks so greasy.</li>
            <li>I used the product for the first time.</li>
            <li>After the first use just use WEN and nothing else.</li>
            <li>Just saving that much time is worth it.</li>
            <li>Just my 2nd week using it so hoping my hair will start to respond better.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my Moroccan, much better.  </li>
            <li>I first started using Wen my hair started getting greasy around day 4-5</li>
            <li>First of all, the amount of product recommended in the directions is ludicrous.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair frizz free and full of body that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I use shampoo first (any will do, even just using baking soda for my roots to soak up scalp oils).</li>
            <li>However, I can imagine if I had thick hair, it would be a great product.</li>
            <li>i have coarse, curly hair that is unmanageable &amp; more than not, frizzy.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no weird bed head.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>and now not only can I but my hair looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read many of these reviews, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gathered by now that the different scents yield different results.</li>
            <li>Started with the Winter Vanilla Mint first, and used it 3 times.</li>
            <li>I think the winter mint will be my favorite so that only means they will discontinue it, that always happens to me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>Never gets that oily feeling first day afternoon.</li>
            <li>Cleansing Conditioner was exactly as described,</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as written</li>
            <li>However, there is NO  discernable gardenia smell to this so most likely</li>
            <li>Since I first started using the Wen products, I haven&#x27;t stopped.  </li>
            <li>The texture is a bit different from the orange blossom (which smells much better) and the almond mint ones that I have.</li>
            <li>almost too much so!</li>
            <li>Works like the other WEN cleansing conditioners and I love it!</li>
            <li>i have used various wen hair cleansers for well more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>The lavender is perfect for my hair, the gardenia left my hair feeling heavy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for someone with drier, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks wen!</li>
            <li>first off i started out using as directed, but no one needs that much ever!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!   </li>
            <li>and then I just rinse it out more ( no big deal)...</li>
            <li>It seems more like a regular conditioner</li>
            <li>Good conditioner but not for Everyday use.</li>
            <li>Even super cheap shampoo, such as Herbal essence or White Rain work better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, particularly my roots.</li>
            <li>Living in a high humidity climate, it&#x27;s great for keeping the frizz at bay and is a great base for styling.</li>
            <li>First I did not get the minty clean feeling after rinsing out the cleanser, nor did I feel my hair was as soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This bottle came packed in it&#x27;s own WEN product box, which is not how other sellers send it.  </li>
            <li>it smells like a nap in the late morning of a perfect spring saturday snuggled in clean sheets with the curtains gently blowing in the breeze and the sound of a small brook tinkling by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this through amazon because i was really wanting to keep my natural hair chemical free.</li>
            <li>but after several uses, I have never had more dry, static, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and soft, without needing conditioner.</li>
            <li>, I previously would have tangles no matter what I did and even combing my hair was challenging, it is now much more manageable, resists breaking, is soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially when your hair has developed it&#x27;s own way of doing things over the years as mine</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair so healthy that it seems like it grows longer simply because it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Wen product so far (I&#x27;ve also used the fig &amp; the lavender).</li>
            <li>Although my hair seemed shinier at first &amp; had a definite reduction in frizz, it didn&#x27;t really seem to be helping make my hair more pliable and my ends still seemed dry most of the time.</li>
            <li>A little more volume but the most noticeable was how soft it</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the WEN products, but this one seems to be heavier and makes my hair less shiny and full.</li>
            <li>Now she has nothing but positive things to say (and she can&#x27;t justify pushing products and services on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my long hair every 3 days, sometimes more often.  </li>
            <li>The Spring Gardenia Green Tea scent is light and fresh (light floral and minty).</li>
            <li>The smell is so enticingly serene and uplifting, I love the smell of my hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews on the Wen line and wanted to try myself, loved being able to get it through Amazon, seems people either loved it or hated it, there were no in betweeners!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal hair, then this product will most likely make it greasy after repeated use.</li>
            <li>Clipped it up and rinsed well with cool water (till it felt squeaky clean), then blew dry.</li>
            <li>I especially like how easily it rinses out.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to try this fragrance since Gardenia can be such a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>So keep that in mind when you order if you suffer from certain allergies.</li>
            <li>Caused my scalp to develop cyst like large pimples.</li>
            <li>While I can get my hair to look pretty good by leaving some in, I hate the way it feels: someone else described her hair as feeling like lamb&#x27;s wool and that&#x27;s as good a descriptor as any.</li>
            <li>While I can get my hair to look pretty good by leaving some in, I hate the way it feels: someone else described her hair as feeling like lamb&#x27;s wool and that&#x27;s as good a descriptor as any.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more economical than shampoo because you use less.</li>
            <li>for the packaging, it worked fine until I got to the very last two or three applications, which turned out to be about 1/5 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Spring Gardenia is the icing on the cake as it smells so wonderful!Going back to regular shampoo, even the newer ones that are sulpher free, is not an option!!</li>
            <li>and now they have employed marketing brilliance and created seasonal \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; -- those of us with limited attention spans are very excited to be using the mango cocoanut</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this one really helps bring body and bounce to them!!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, curly hair, and I noticed that the Gardenia Green Tea works the BEST!</li>
            <li>but I was expecting it to make my hair a little more smooth then soft</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, if it would be nice and not too fake smelling.  </li>
            <li>much of a fan of Wen; I&#x27;m not so much of a fan on their price.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about any WEN products so far.</li>
            <li>I love Wen Cleansing Conditioner and love their seasonal scents, especially Gardenia Green Tea.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But after about 5 or 6 straight days of using just Wen, my hair felt like it needed a break.  </li>
            <li>This really needs to be in a squeeze bottle that you can set upside-down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair never feels greasy and it does look much healthier, shinier and stronger.  </li>
            <li>Truly, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but it really does work</li>
            <li>no matter how much product I put in</li>
            <li>Just go straight for the Ouidad.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it leaves my hair shiny and feeling conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Seems gentle on my dyed hair also.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use quite as much as recommended (I do about 16 pumps for just below</li>
            <li>That has a really yummy smell.  </li>
            <li>, it smells really</li>
            <li>Chaz Dean is a real hairdresser for over 20 years, he formulated this  andam soooooooooo thankful.  </li>
            <li>Wanted soo much to believe the infomercial</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate, to me, doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>So much healthier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in how much hair I shed.</li>
            <li>But the real miracle came when I straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>With my straight hair, it has movement</li>
            <li>but you have to use so much it does not seem to be very cost efficient.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I expected more..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in fragrances</li>
            <li>I am a devoted WEN user, but  after two or three uses this formula makes my strands feel very waxy.  </li>
            <li>Your money will be spent better elsewhere.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>will say that you really have to commit to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>However, just a note, it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy it from the Wen store online.</li>
            <li>and i have seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It was too much.  </li>
            <li>I will NEVER pay that much for any hair care product again.</li>
            <li>Have to use so much</li>
            <li>but some1 told me the real wen has logo on bottom of</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t seem to need as much.</li>
            <li>Used it because my friends recommended it but for me, it was too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t matter how  much you rinse</li>
            <li>THANKS WEN..</li>
            <li>i give thanks to wen.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much volume now.</li>
            <li>I would not follow the directions of how much to use though..</li>
            <li>Love the different scents that this shampoo offers.</li>
            <li>love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li>, the fragrance on the Spring Gardenia Green Tea is nice.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost all of the different scents, and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>This one smells so sweet and definitely gets me ready for spring!</li>
            <li>I think if you have frizzy or thick hair it would be good.</li>
            <li>NEED TO MAKE SURE USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT, ADD A LITTLE WATER AND LET SIT ON HAIR UNTIL YOU ARE DONE WASHING.</li>
            <li>Also, ordering directly from the website was significantly cheaper, as they send you a ton of extra products to try plus their current shampoos are more like 32$ and not 38$. Ordering from the website</li>
            <li>Also, I find I spend less and get better quality- who knew ;)</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, shiny, and bouncy for up to 4 days without having to wash it again (even with daily trips to the gym).</li>
            <li>We simply need to clean any dirt from our hair.</li>
            <li>perfect for my thin flyaway grey hair.</li>
            <li>Gripping and squeezing all the way down from scalp to ends Ive found removed too much residual and can damage hair.</li>
            <li>Baking soda and apple cider vinegar are far from the only no poo solutions out there for different hair types, its much better worth it than WEN.</li>
            <li>It will however open your sinuses right up!  </li>
            <li>It was OK, but just not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily think that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually just a bottle and a separate pump, but this seller had the bottle in it&#x27;s own display box which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it could just be a psychological thing to need to feel the suds if I know my hair&#x27;s full of sweat and ocean water, etc.  </li>
            <li>Definitely on the stronger side- if you prefer a lighter scent, the Sweet Almont Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Essential for shiny full hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but the first time for the Gardenia Green Tea, and it&#x27;s not as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true WEN girl, though I have started looking for cheaper products that are similar.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I have used several other hair cleansers before, but this one smells so good and leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very humid environment as well.</li>
            <li>hair felt dry, I will stick to Loreal for 6.00 which is sulfate free also.</li>
            <li>it does err, it errs on the more moisturizing side than less like the Aloe/Cucumber one tends to do.  </li>
            <li>so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun.</li>
            <li>so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use my regular color-treated shampoo and perhaps more conditioner if necessary.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to a different cleansing conditioner from another company &amp; I like it much better.</li>
            <li>The smell of the spring gardenia green tea is light and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>this could quickly become a standard for me.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY OILY HAIR AND VERY SENSITIVE SKIN...</li>
            <li>So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li>every two weeks can really put a dent in a person&#x27;s cash flow... and cash is definitely something I do not have right now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li>First couple days were fine, but after two days, my hair just felt too heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fairly unruly hair and have never used a product that made my hair shiny and manageable until now.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it used to feel like straw, but conditioner weighed it down too much.  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful but it does leave my hair feeling a little heavy, especially between washes.</li>
            <li>It smelled nicely but really it was like using a heavy conditioner only.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it my husband was amazed and said it was worth every penny we spent on it.</li>
            <li>Very shiny and soft...</li>
            <li>However, both of those formulas are great whereas the Winter Mint seems way over-the-top too moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a fine job of cleansing my hair but can&#x27;t really justify the price since I can get a cleansing conditioner that does just as well and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the gardenia green tea product.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes me 3 hours for me to straighten my curly hair</li>
            <li>I do not mind that it does not suds because there is a reason for that,but am not sure if it really leaves my hair in better condition.</li>
            <li>and it does better using Wen products that do NOT have the harsh foaming agents.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; thick consistency.</li>
            <li>After following the instructions I found that while my hair was super soft, it always looked greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li>This left it frizzy and dry, and it noticeably breaking more after two uses this week.</li>
            <li>But when my hair is dry, I don&#x27;t want it to smell anything but sweet and fragrant..</li>
            <li>however this is a new fragrance for me</li>
            <li>I feel bad for all the rest of the people who paid good money for this cheap quality copy cat and got ripped off without even knowing it.</li>
            <li>have to say, again, I spent less time styling, my hair looks great, and I can&#x27;t wait till my next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Now I alternate daily between the WEN conditioner and a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The Gardenia Green Tea is my favorite fragrance so far....</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>A little more costly than direct from WEN  but didn&#x27;t have to sign up for direct ship</li>
            <li>I think because my hair is very fine that it is too heavy-makes it dull.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how SOFT it is!  </li>
            <li>Bought this even though it had some pretty low reviews.</li>
            <li>She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage.</li>
            <li>, i didn&#x27;t like the product then but wasn&#x27;t willing to throw it away, so i tossed it in the back of the closet</li>
            <li>and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always with WEN, my hair is soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year &amp; been able to grow my hair longer than in the past because it&#x27;s staying healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rinse out well and your hair will be so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used twice so far and cannot believe the immediate effects of this product!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s alot better than the daily to every other day</li>
            <li>Give it a try the traditional way first.</li>
            <li>I also have psoriasis in places on my scalp and just using this product made the psoriasis go buck wild!</li>
            <li>I am throwing out my old shampoos and conditioners!</li>
            <li>I also use this for my Morky dog and it makes her hair so soft!</li>
            <li>was really surprised that this product exceed my expectations!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I followed the instructions and left some in as leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have used several Wen products but this one does exactly what it shows in the TV advertissements.  </li>
            <li>We usually only use the pomegranate, this is the first time we changed scents and we LOVE this Spring Gardenia Green Tea!  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be wash your hair the first time with your old shampoo, rinse your hair well, then apply WEN to your wet clean hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick curly hair which right now is waist length, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps the frizz at bay and gives my curls a more noticiable definition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes you hair feel soft and new.</li>
            <li>I like the product although my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with regular shampoo, am re-reading the directions again and possibly I did not follow them completely</li>
            <li>Once I shampooed and conditioned normally, just once, I was ready to go back to Wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t lather quite well unless I washed my hair first.</li>
            <li>(It stopped falling out) and it was also very soft, not it&#x27;s natural frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>So for me, Wen calms my hair down significantly and makes it look like it was handled by a professional every day!</li>
            <li>It is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for people with thick hair, but I have fine, long hair (to mid-back)</li>
            <li>I saw no difference in Wen than any other product out there that promises full body.</li>
            <li>I have tried this every which way: using more, using less, mixing with another shampoo, only as a conditioner,etc.</li>
            <li>Now I am 73 and finally have something that makes my hair feel great and no itchy scalp or dry flakes on my dark colored clothes!!!  </li>
            <li>I am a big Wen fan and Gardenia and Green Tea is my new favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Wen felt good in the shower but left my hair dry, kinda stiff and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very floral and feminine and gives my very dry hair a much needed moisture boost.</li>
            <li>Hard to get used to no lather and to many pumps to do the job.</li>
            <li>ran out to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and bought a bottle of argan oil to put in my dry hair to tame the frizz and make it shiney, a hydrating hair mask to use once a week, and a really good deep conditioner for after i shampoo.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended the latter two to my friends with thick and/or hard to manage hair, and they have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I had also purchased the lavender shampoo directly from the Wen website.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>With my old shampoo and contioner it would take me any were from thirty minutes to a hour to comb my hair out after washing it</li>
            <li>Completely FROZEN and separated when thawed.</li>
            <li>I am 50 ish lady with professionally color treated shoulder length hair .</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a quality shampoo and conditioner recommended by a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>I have completely discontinued my use of shampoo altogether.</li>
            <li>it really does last you a while and nothing else beats it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Its by far my favourite Wen Cleansing Conditioner</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair and I will not purchase WEN products in the future.</li>
            <li>My curls are fuller &amp; smoother &amp; my straight styles last longer.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to perfumes and have no problems with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I received my order yesterday and immediately noticed a difference as the 16oz bottle was a different size than my REAL Wen 16oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I found the font was a tad different, the back labeling had differences and sure enough the ingredients were different.  </li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft after using WEN products.</li>
            <li>My hair needs moisture, I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, like Hispanic women, but not Hispanic, my hair needs moisture and this product didn&#x27;t supply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i also have sensitive skin, and some hair products cause me to break out at the hairline.  </li>
            <li>Even after really massaging the roots and rinsing multiple times.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t imagine putting this stuff straight on my face, especially the eyes!  </li>
            <li>BUT KNOW IT WILL MADE MY HAIR SHINY AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>Her hair has never been so shinny and soft</li>
            <li>I have only used it once though so will try it again because I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>and I like the soft feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li>I like these WEN cleansing conditioners that are free of the heavy oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m from the old school reasoning</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has really made my hair softer and shinier after 4-5 bleach and dye sessions in the last year, which I am so thankful for because my split ends are out of control.</li>
            <li>I guess it does make my hair soft though, so I&#x27;ll just use it as a conditioner and hold my nose while I use it, because at $30 a bottle now I feel like I have to use it even though I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I never heard of this fragrance before...</li>
            <li>I have  noticed a marked difference and have reduced washing to two times weekly.</li>
            <li>We do NOT need to strip the natural oils from our hair and then replace them.</li>
            <li>The smell is natural NOT perfume which I like.</li>
            <li>Wen makes my hair so soft, it keeps my curls bouncy all day.</li>
            <li>Honestly you might as well go the no poo style and just rinse your hair daily with green tea you make at home, with added essential oils or whatever you prefer.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that only requires washing once a week but with wen I have to wash more often and don&#x27;t notice enough of an improvement to make it worth it.</li>
            <li>I left a more detailed review on the lavender bottle...basically this product is a waste of money that will leave your hair oily and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, just expensive.</li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t need to use quite as many pumps as recommended for my medium longish thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I will warn though when they say use a certain amount of pumps - try less first.</li>
            <li>The gardenia &amp; the green tea scent mixed together is a very unique scent.</li>
            <li>Like all the other WEN products this does not fail the test, it makes me hair feel a lot more alive, and it keeps the pink dye in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li>The gardenia on the other hand made it feel heavy, and kind of greasey.</li>
            <li>My hair is very nice for about 12 hours, and then begins to look dirty and oily.</li>
            <li>First of all, recommended amount to use is ten pumps worth of this stuff, followed directions and saw absolutely no improvement in my overall hair condition.  </li>
            <li>At first it made my curly very dry hair soft.</li>
            <li>Its great marketing, mad product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works fr other people, it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me</li>
            <li>The product is heavy and you dont feel your hair is clean.</li>
            <li>Would not buy this particular item again, but I like Wen overall.</li>
            <li>Are you aware there are numerous reports of women with similar experiences?  </li>
            <li>Love the new scent, Spring Gardenia Green Tea!!!</li>
            <li>over all it leaves my hair very heavy and sticky, which is disappointing considering i have heard great things about this product, and I have reduced the use i put in my hair down drastically; and i make sure to wash it out very well after every use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>There is no other product that works as well!</li>
            <li>Rinse for as long till it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy of really slippery--</li>
            <li>I usually use Loreal for color treated hair that is sulphate free.</li>
            <li>The standard sweet almond mint and any of the other &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34</li>
            <li>As always, I got exactly what I wanted and expected with my purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, fine, naturally wavy, and dyed.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and cut short with longer pieces in front, so it is ridiculous to slather so much on.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, somewhat fine and color treated/highlighted and without WEN it&#x27;s very dry and brittle despite regular use of conditioning treatments and masks.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has made it possible for me to try new scents and formulas and not get stuck with it.</li>
            <li>It is really cold and dry out (November) and it seems to be getting better, but it also recommends using way more than I was using as my hair is short.</li>
            <li>I use less pumps than recommended (6-7 pumps total; I clean with 3-3.5 pumps, rinse, then use another 3 pumps that I leave on while bathing and rinse off at the end).  </li>
            <li>and i had not been home long enough to use it consistently and recommend it or not.  </li>
            <li>And instead putting another pump on my hair after rinsing, I simply take my comb which has some left on it after combing through in the shower and work it through my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I have short hair blonde hair, I am familiar with how much and how to use Wen, but I was not satisfied with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried the sweet almond mint a while ago and after several washes my hair felt weighed down.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self with no other shampoo or anything</li>
            <li>I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a major difference</li>
            <li>I read the review about the soft water versus hard water results and I have to say we have hard well water and the Wen works good for me.  </li>
            <li>If anyone wants to know if it works for black, natural hair, I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s the truth!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and this product left it feeling very weighed down and heavy.  </li>
            <li>It was still a great product and did its job, but the smell was so bad to me</li>
            <li>Left my hair not as soft as the others.</li>
            <li>and I can barely smell it even in the shower while using</li>
            <li>I also add some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH on the dryer parts of my hair before blow-drying to give extra</li>
            <li>While this didn&#x27;t work any worse than my $3 drugstore shampoo and conditioner, I also didn&#x27;t see it work any better.</li>
            <li>,expensive won&#x27;t buy this kind again, looking for alternative</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything better or worse than Nioxin or Axe</li>
            <li>When the shampoo is used there are no suds, weird but effective.</li>
            <li>there are too many steps to the process &#x3D; not happy</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous for my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend splitting your pumps up in half, cleansing your scalp and roots first lathering vigorously with your finger pads till you can work it into your roots, then rinse not let it sit.</li>
            <li>I adjusted to the suds&#x27;less creamy feel after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>My hair had changed from normal to too dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is no longer dry and is now normal again.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but not sure if this product is any better than other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my 3 yr old daughter who has loose natural curls.  </li>
            <li>The key is the combing then don&#x27;t rinse it out completely, just a bit and gently squeeze hair of excess water WITHOUT SLIDING HANDS DOWN HAIR.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it had to do with the dry climate I live in or what,</li>
            <li>I have dry course frizzy hair and live in South Fl.</li>
            <li>I love to do dramatic color...</li>
            <li>I am a natural curly African American woman and I can say with pride I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl!</li>
            <li>My hair is never dry..</li>
            <li>Yes, I do have to use hairspray at the end to tame those little frizzies, but I love the feel of Wen when I&#x27;m cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li>From past reviews, you know I am an avid WEN lover!</li>
            <li>I am satisified enough to try other scents and I am very particular about my hair products.</li>
            <li>also make a plain green tea which is more neutral.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d get a little bit of a deal since it&#x27;s really not that much cheaper than the REAL Wen.  </li>
            <li>Too bad it&#x27;s not limited edition, even though pretty much all of the formulas are the same with the scents being the unique factor.</li>
            <li>Then use the other half pumps, and work it into the entirety of you hair till it lathers up nice and let sit in your hair as long as you can (5-10 minutes while you shave your legs or do other bathing steps).</li>
            <li>This was one of my favorite Wens so far, I have very thick, long hair, (think mixed chicks), and Wen is the only thing I use now, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I have to comment on the smell of the Spring Gardenia Green Tea.  </li>
            <li>I used to use multiple produts in the shower, multiple products on my wet hair and then more products on my dry hair in order to try and tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li>If your find that using WEN exclusively isn&#x27;t working for your hair type I highly recommend using it every other day and seeing if that works.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair does not hold as much water with the WEN so drying time is cut in half</li>
            <li>First of all I have long hair (down to my waist</li>
            <li>I have a short style, where it&#x27;s longer in the front, but not long by any means.  </li>
            <li>It was about triple the amount that normally comes out when I wash my hair with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and naturally oily skin - which can be a blessing in the dry climate I live in but makes it impossible to skip a shampoo without my hair feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, straight hair down to the top of my bra and my hair always feels heavy, so</li>
            <li>I have very dry, frizzy hair naturally.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair, so this was a big concern of mine.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it was not worth the cost.</li>
            <li>If you have hair that is difficult to work with wen makes such a huge difference!</li>

            <li> MY HAIR IS BRIGHT, MY COLOR LASTS LONGER...</li>
            <li> WEN is a great product and this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried and loved the Vanilla Mint and Fig cleansers.</li>
            <li> It smells like a flower garden blooming and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> its smells good  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product and loved it</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> I have always loved the way my hair looks and feels after use.</li>
            <li> Good for men or women.</li>
            <li> I received this seasonal version of Wen cleansing conditioner yesterday and although I haven&#x27;t used it yet, it smells very-very good.</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as I had hoped, but a good product.</li>
            <li> loved the way my hair felt after using it.  </li>
            <li> floral without being tres flores, it&#x27;s so light and wonderful.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and my hair looks good and feels silky.  </li>
            <li> The pros: it smells really good and makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Good for part time</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and like everyone else said -- it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> and I thought that was as good as it got.</li>
            <li> My scalp used to be fairly oily after a day or two</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s good to mix it up now and then.  </li>
            <li> but if she loves this product it must be good.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> if the products were not so good</li>
            <li> But good for the price.</li>
            <li> This gives me &#x27;good hair&#x27; days every day.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about it</li>
            <li> HE SMELL GOOD</li>

            <li> I have used a number of Wen products, and the classics seem to be the best (Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner and styling cr&amp;egrave;me).  </li>
            <li> The improvements they have made are outstanding and leads me to believe that Chaz does listen to what his users say, and makes efforts to improve his products, and I like that and am most impressed..</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Favorite Wen formula- so happy to find it here.  </li>

            <li> I am IN LOVE with this!</li>
            <li> Love WEN products!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> This scent is phenomenal!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so amazing when I use this.  </li>
            <li> Wen is amazing.  </li>
            <li> They both smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Then a friend of mine bought it and was thrilled.</li>
            <li> If I had money to burn, I&#x27;d buy it again, it did smell nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice experience.</li>
            <li> Nice for hair.</li>
            <li> And WEN products really do make your hair awesome!</li>
            <li> fragrance is really nice, just what I would expect it to be.  </li>
            <li> This is nice</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wen and I can honestly say I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was mortified cuz I really liked the product</li>
            <li> I just keep my one bottle of wen handy.</li>
            <li> but it is nice.</li>
            <li> It was always a problem getting it to style nice.  </li>
            <li> My daughter bought me some Wen for Mother&#x27;s Day to try, and I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li> Not so much), and this one works great for me!</li>
            <li> It gives an Icey/Hot sensation to your scalp and during my shower it kind of burns my eyes and makes my nose itch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for one time per week at most.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time about how nice my hair smells.</li>
            <li> this stuff works nicely.</li>
            <li> So I was thrilled when I saw that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> But my hair turned out so nice after I styled it.</li>
            <li> The gardenia is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Now that was kind of cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nicely balanced...</li>
            <li> love love Wen doesn&#x27;t matter which one it is they are all great products.</li>
            <li> I was told by many firends about it and it really is as good as I was told.  </li>
            <li> nice  </li>
            <li> (I coupon- spending this kind of money on hair products goes against my frugal principles, but</li>
            <li> Good product  love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner in a nice smelling package</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo nice not having to shampoo then condition every day.</li>
            <li> oh, your hair smells so good.\\&quot; and they always tell me how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> The cucumber, the gardenia, and the tea tree and the sweet almond mint are great for my medium length and texture.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works great.</li>
            <li> hair was also very easily tangled</li>
            <li> Very strongly scented.</li>
            <li> I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and Lavender scents much better.</li>
            <li> So far, this one is best.</li>
            <li> This one, however, seems like one of the more nicely balanced ones for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel wonderful and so soft</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> WEN is by far the best thing my hair has ever come across!  </li>
            <li> I am 66 with color treated, thinning &amp; very fine hair texture.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and curly.</li>
            <li> My hair is to between my shoulder blades and very fine.</li>
            <li> My grand kids were impressed too that this old lady orders her hair cleaner/conditioner</li>
            <li> Very light lemon rosemary vanillabean; none of the scents distinct but a very nice combination.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many upscale haircare products, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it really works great</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time, the itch is gone  and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks was great.</li>
            <li> At first it was a great product.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is full and shiny and looks so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> I think fragrance is very important in a hair product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have very fine, color processed hair that is only at its best when I use the WEN products.</li>
            <li> Impulse buy.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine quasi wavy not the sexy kind</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in Wen cleansing conditioner!</li>
            <li> What do you have to lose except more hair.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> This would be better if the price was lower.</li>
            <li> Even the curly girl method washing with coconut Sauve conditioner is better than this.</li>
            <li> It did NOT do that for me, but of course I made sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li> I made sure to get all of the product out of my roots and off my scalp.</li>
            <li> Much better icing on Amazon</li>
            <li> Im asking for more of this from Santa this year.</li>
            <li> This scent smells amazing and my hair feels wonderfully light.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the tingle it gives my scalp</li>
            <li> love the product,way overpriced.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> , WEN.\\&quot;  I thought Ok I&#x27;ve seen it advertised plenty of times.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the almond mint either.  </li>
            <li> I have fallen in love.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift and was able to try it myself.</li>
            <li> I love gardenia</li>
            <li> Have had many of problems with perms , hair sprays and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Instead of sucking the stuff up into the straw, it just creates a hole so you have to move the straw around to get more slushie.  </li>
            <li> I love the wen cleansing conditioner I use it by</li>
            <li> I had been using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner, which I love.  </li>
            <li> Then I just grab two more pumps and spread it over the rest of my hair and then comb it all through with a pic comb &amp; let it sit while I do the rest of my showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was like a conditioner but didn&#x27;t make my hair any better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This scent is the most enticing of all of the WEN products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I surely didn&#x27;t anticipate I&#x27;d quickly love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving time, money AND my hair is better than ever</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product and my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of the Wen hair care line.</li>
            <li> Love to use this as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, softer and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> product acts much more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviewers raved about this scent; it wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I am almost stockpiling it as to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> I love wen hair products.</li>

            <li> remarks on how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I like also that my hair when it dries feel more &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34;, not flying al over the place.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely, though.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love WEN products and I would say this has become a favorite of mine for this summer.  </li>

            <li> I love WEN products.  </li>
            <li> It just was ok.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels so much better after using Wen.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> my wife and daughter love this product..</li>
            <li> I LOVE Gardenia and thought I would love this as well</li>
            <li> and I love that It&#x27;s both a shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy now .</li>

            <li> Love this smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> And just love Wen all together.</li>
            <li> I was able to find what I needed on Amazon without having to deal with a monthly membership that makes you buy 3 or more products at a time to get a discount.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I Love wen.</li>
            <li> I feel in love with it as soon as I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to wash my hair and let it air</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> THEN I RINSE AND ADD MORE PRODUCT UNTIL FOAMS UP AND RINSE.  </li>
            <li> THE MORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> THE BETTER</li>
            <li> i love every WEN product I&#x27;ve ever bought &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have any static in my hair when I solely used this.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but I found that my hair is a bit more frizzy unless I use more pumps.</li>
            <li> no matter how many pumps I use.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower tomorrow :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, shiner, more definition, and the tangles melt away.</li>
            <li> it seems okay</li>
            <li> If it gets better I will update this review</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to foam up like most shampoo products do.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more..</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> But study the different scents and styles and see which one is best for you.</li>
            <li> I was even able to put a nickel-sized amount on my hair as a leave-in with no problems.</li>
            <li> I thankfully have not had any issues :)</li>
            <li> I love being able to get what I want when I want it.  </li>

            <li> Mango Coconut is ok..</li>
            <li> just ok.  </li>
            <li> it works much better when you use it twice a week maximum without washing in between.</li>
            <li> I just wish it smelled better, but the scent does not linger at all</li>
            <li> love WEN cleansing conditioner and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.</li>

            <li> I *love* wen cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This smell is phenomenal-</li>
            <li> and it was better.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and for some reason, it is a bit lighter in feel than the others.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and at first thought hey this is nice!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I tried to correct this by making sure I rinsed thoroughly</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it because I always wondered what the hype was all about.  </li>

            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite Wen scent</li>
            <li> some seasonal and this one my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are listed so you can make choices.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t follow instruction on a bottle , take pumps as many as you need for your hair</li>
            <li> i love wen.</li>
            <li> they love it too.</li>
            <li> the styling cream is everyones favorite too.</li>
            <li> i love them all.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better, I tried this fabulous scent!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Even my stylist said my hair is in better condition now than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Its boucy, healthy - doesnt frizz or break off like before.  </li>
            <li> For me it rinsed nice and clean.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed pretty good even though the smell wasn&#x27;t really pleasant.</li>
            <li> and my head is so itchy, and smells like special shampoo (like maybe the kind you use to get rid of lice or dandruff or something)</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean and looks shiny after using these conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at a friends house and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Excited to get to use it!  </li>
            <li> They were perfect for my dry over-processed hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a full month of washing my color treated hair, it&#x27;s much softer, has a beautiful shine and my color has held.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with Wen so far!</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of Wen,  Always looking for new scents - this one is great!  </li>
            <li> The ultra BEST shampoo ever for those who have dry colored hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is so great even air drying, and my natural waves curl</li>
            <li> The Gardenia Green Tea and Lavender gave me the most body so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love Wen!!!!</li>
            <li> My mother in law bought me some lavender Wen to try because she loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> one smells very feminine because of the Gardenia but its awfully good on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great packaging.  </li>
            <li> and now i am in complete insecurity phase (did that cute guy from engineering see me scratch my smelly head!?!?)</li>
            <li> It costs more but worth it !</li>
            <li> I just cant say enough good things about Wen products!</li>
            <li> it &#x27;s clean more when its bubble</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i wished chad work on the shampoo that clean the hair better than what he had</li>
            <li> Love this green tea smells great !!</li>
            <li> plus was it was easy to return and</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> &quot; i can get over the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Could be too strong for some.</li>
            <li> This WEN smells SOO good, it is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Summer mango coconut is great in the summer time, but I think that would get old month after month and wouldn&#x27;t fit in certain seasons.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d love to try winter mint, but cannot afford that one!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, very satisfied</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that tangles easily this is the Wen for you.</li>
            <li> i followed the directions once more and used the full amount of suggested pumps</li>
            <li> I cleanse with it, rinse with cool water and put one more pump as a leave in--as Wen does not get rid of frizz</li>
            <li> fresh as spring time  with a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner gives me a clean, light, healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really fine, I live in adry climate and my daughter says she has never seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> It might work for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium fine hair, but a lot of it, and highlights.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it .  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I use curling iron every day.</li>
            <li> but this one is just fine</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It leaves my smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Leave me hair super smooth, and frizzless!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell of this Shampoo.</li>
            <li> She has tried every shampoo available.</li>
            <li> I think its Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and I like the way it smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the Gardenia Tea to see if I liked it as much as I do the Lavender.  </li>
            <li> it does make your hair smooth and shinny.  </li>
            <li> When I last saw my stylist, &amp; before she knew I used Wen, she commented about how great my hair looked &amp; told me to keep doing what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to recommend it only because then the supply will be lower for me to get LOL.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling silky and tangle free.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE ALL FANTASTIC ON MY HAIR...</li>
            <li> Scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but they are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is extremely light.</li>
            <li> This has a light, floral scent with a bit if exoticness to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write another review on the 613 once I start using it on my own hair tomorrow since my head is really itching...</li>
            <li> Gardenia Green Tea is the best for me!</li>
            <li> I have to look for products that say weightless on them, The mint one made my hair feel really light and still had body.</li>
            <li> Always buy this scent when it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> I try to use the Wen Gluten free products when I can.</li>
            <li> I have used every product on my hair to get a sleek frizz free look to my chin length</li>
            <li> The Spring Gardenia Green Tea has a wonderful springy smell.</li>
            <li> I only used 8 pumps each washing, at most, and had good results.  </li>
            <li> , I love this product it makes my hair fuller and really makes it shine and look healthy too.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old loved the smell too.  </li>
            <li> The scent is perfect, a rich floral arrangement softened by the lightness of green tea.</li>
            <li> I use a Chi blow dryer and I use a flat iron on my bangs...and  my style stays all day and looks great on day two as well.</li>
            <li> I use my regular highly humdifying shampoo and conditioner on Mondays and use Wen on Fridays and my hair is doing great!</li>
            <li> I only use 2 full pumps and it works great...</li>
            <li> Works very nice on straight, normal hair.</li>
            <li> I was do excited to try this</li>
            <li> Use more if you feel it necessary, the more the better.</li>
            <li> brought the Original</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Almond Mint (original) &#x3D;</li>
            <li> first of all I love Wen cleansing products.  </li>
            <li> this one is supposed to smell like gardenia because it smells like the original scent.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Wen.</li>
            <li> It is so light and leaves my curly hair bouncy, full and glossy.  </li>
            <li> excellent product you have never used anything like this before a little pricey but well worth the investment buy it now</li>
            <li> I was terrified this scent would be too flowery, but it was clean and fresh smelling instead!</li>
            <li> This was the first time for me using the Wen product and was very excited to try them.</li>
            <li> And it stays clean for days.  </li>
            <li> but it never felt clean.</li>
            <li> I never feel like my hair or my scalp isn&#x27;t clean and hair color lasts longer with Wen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would clean my hair, but it does.  </li>
            <li> I love all the Wen cleansing conditioners, but so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Followed directions listed on product and my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li> Product works and keeps my hair clean and without the frizz.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Have tried several scents this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair clean, conditioned, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I miss  that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> clean  hair-</li>
            <li> this is great for color treated hair or dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Wen Almond Mint, and haven&#x27;t liked some of the other scents or the way my hair feels, but this one works very well for me and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I use the low suds solution twice a week &amp; my hair stays clean, always smells good &amp; is softer than I can recall it being in years even without the application of heat.</li>
            <li> My straight hair has more body and swing and feels so clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect not too strong or not too weak.</li>
            <li> The fig, I&#x27;ve heard is best for thick course hair....</li>
            <li> color stays true.</li>
            <li> Love WEN products, appreciate the availability on line &amp; reasonable price and shipping.</li>
            <li> Although really made for all hair types, I found some favorites I felt just did a better job at managing my hair or the shine factor, but they all work GREAT!and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not over impressed with this product</li>
            <li> The pomegranate formula, which is my absolute favorite, does not leave the waxy and greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping to smell gardenia as it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> and it is absolutely the most moisturizing of the three,</li>
            <li> while i have yet to receive my recent order of the gardenia version i expect it will be just as good as both cucumber aloe and mango</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I&#x27;m going back to my nexus pro-mend.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> If I use any more then that about, it will feel as if I have too much conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> love the smell and this really makes my hair super</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other comparable cleansing conditioners and they are okay, better than the soap on the hair,  but Wen is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It just smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I disagree as it leaves my hair super oily.</li>
            <li> I love being able to try the different scents without entering into a contract.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic not to mention the soft scent of gardenia that lingers in your hair after rinsing, but not overpowering that it will interfer with your favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Next best results for the same reasons.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel silky smooth but not dried out -- that&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
            <li> I am not brand loyal</li>
            <li> it is nothing more than a regular conditioner.and they charge you more for reordering the product without your permission.</li>
            <li> Smelled great but my after a month of use, scalp breakouts and my hair got super weighed down and oily.</li>
            <li> It smells so light and so pretty</li>
            <li> When I first bought Wen, years ago, my hair looked fabulous after using it.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite fragrance but the same great hair care all the same.</li>
            <li> Best Results, no frizz, soft, manageable, and I only need 5 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Not an everwhelming sweet vanilla, the lemon gives it a crisp clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love wen, so I wanted to try a new scent.</li>
            <li> I love the new fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have broken hairs or split ends and my hair is beautifully conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but will stick to the lavender one instead since this one is only a special that no longer is available.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product, it makes my hair soft, clean, and moisturized, it also has a nice floral scent, I still don&#x27;t know which one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a WEN product, I highly recommend any of the scents!!!</li>
            <li> Then I very quickly get the top of my head under the shower to add just a little water and massage my scalp/roots some more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one is by far my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally kind to my hair, I wash it once a week, very very rarely blow dry and never straighten or curl.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available to do that.</li>
            <li> wen is amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li> Really cleans hair with no lather, all while leaving it smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My reactive skin remains calm when I use this.</li>
            <li> than it became dried out not too happy about that</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really sily smooth.  </li>
            <li> There really is nothing like WEN and this scent is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is pricey for a hair product, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt contain any chemicals or additives like SLS,sodium laurenth sulfate,which strips the hair,which you dont want to do,this actualy buids up the hairs natural ingredients, and your hair feels 100 percent better too.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the way Wen cleansing conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable every day.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find your money will be spent on products that are more satisfying.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair has more volume and really takes hair care to the next level.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price considering</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of perfume, flowery, fresh, spring-ish.</li>
            <li> like the WEN products because I can actually wake up in the morning with my hair looking as nice as it did before I went to bed even if I toss and turn while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have to order the entire kit.</li>
            <li> I have to say it smells the best of all I have tired.  </li>
            <li> Some may wonder if Wen is even worth bothering over.</li>
            <li> Wen was so fresh and fragrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really one of the cleaner Wen products that really moisturizes at an appropriate level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much worth</li>
            <li> I like it a great deal,  but so far my hair is not amazingly different or salon-esque.</li>
            <li> actually, I haven&#x27;t met a WEN cleansing product that I haven&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li> Adore the fresh and flowery sent.</li>
            <li> and I am loving my hair finally!</li>
            <li> This product cleans your hair nicely without leaving it coarse or drying it.</li>
            <li> BUT HIS HAIR IS GROWING BACK NICELY..</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a super cool product, there are some Wen formulas more suited for different hair types.  </li>
            <li> To me it has an overwhelming menthol smell with a floral undertone, I think it would be better the other way around.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of the Spring Gardenia &amp; Green Tea is very nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is OK but in between one needs to use regular shampoo because it does not get the scalp clean.  </li>
            <li> This particular scent is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> Great seller, item got here fast and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but the way my hair feels after using it is not as good as other versions of WEN.</li>
            <li> This product WILL work for you, just try to find the right one that works.</li>
            <li> and I must say my nose went right on vacation to the Hawai&#x27;ian islands.  </li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t the right formula for my hair.</li>
            <li> I also thought this might be cheaper than the higher quality Moroccan oil I frequently buy for perhaps more around 42$.</li>
            <li> At first it made my hair feel wonderful and replenished and barely a week into using and hair went through a greasy stage as my hair is fine and this a thick product that does not lather.  </li>
            <li> I used Dr. Woods on my hair and it felt so clean and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The Spring Gardenia Green Tea smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I have bought several different scents, this one is by far the best</li>
            <li> I love Wen have been using it for nearly 2 years now, maybe more actually.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall, but can not continually use it, and IT only.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> liked it very much but too much money for me to use regularly.  </li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this!</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this!</li>
            <li> Expected more for the price!</li>
            <li> Be sure to work it in and through your hair, and be sure to rinse for at least a full minute.  </li>
            <li> There are a few types of Wen that seem to work better than others (the Fig is fantastic, but the Sweet Almond Mint?</li>
            <li> Shasasipping was very fast...</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and we will never go back to our original hair products again.</li>
            <li> And my hair looks healthly, full bodied and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and subtle - more of a grassy floral than medicinal.  </li>
            <li> , It left my hair manageable and was super easy to use being a multi tasking product.</li>
            <li> ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Wen and what a difference it has made to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the big size assuming I would love.</li>
            <li> and when i got it in the mail the first thing i noticed was the smell.</li>
            <li> so i used it the first time and didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair</li>
            <li> and so i really needed to wash out my grimey hair!)</li>
            <li> and when it dries it gives me awesome curls that loosen into waves (I have middle of the back blonde</li>
            <li> error.and scraggly, smells funny, itches, and it still looks so greasy.</li>
            <li> I used the product for the first time.</li>
            <li> After the first use just use WEN and nothing else.</li>
            <li> Just saving that much time is worth it.</li>
            <li> Just my 2nd week using it so hoping my hair will start to respond better.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my Moroccan, much better.  </li>
            <li> I first started using Wen my hair started getting greasy around day 4-5</li>
            <li> First of all, the amount of product recommended in the directions is ludicrous.</li>
            <li> Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair frizz free and full of body that last all day.  </li>
            <li> I use shampoo first (any will do, even just using baking soda for my roots to soak up scalp oils).</li>
            <li> However, I can imagine if I had thick hair, it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> i have coarse, curly hair that is unmanageable &amp; more than not, frizzy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no weird bed head.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> and now not only can I but my hair looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read many of these reviews, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gathered by now that the different scents yield different results.</li>
            <li> Started with the Winter Vanilla Mint first, and used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> I think the winter mint will be my favorite so that only means they will discontinue it, that always happens to me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> Never gets that oily feeling first day afternoon.</li>
            <li> Cleansing Conditioner was exactly as described,</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as written</li>
            <li> However, there is NO  discernable gardenia smell to this so most likely</li>
            <li> Since I first started using the Wen products, I haven&#x27;t stopped.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a bit different from the orange blossom (which smells much better) and the almond mint ones that I have.</li>
            <li> almost too much so!</li>
            <li> Works like the other WEN cleansing conditioners and I love it!</li>
            <li> i have used various wen hair cleansers for well more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The lavender is perfect for my hair, the gardenia left my hair feeling heavy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for someone with drier, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks wen!</li>
            <li> first off i started out using as directed, but no one needs that much ever!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!   </li>
            <li> and then I just rinse it out more ( no big deal)...</li>
            <li> It seems more like a regular conditioner</li>
            <li> Good conditioner but not for Everyday use.</li>
            <li> Even super cheap shampoo, such as Herbal essence or White Rain work better for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, particularly my roots.</li>
            <li> Living in a high humidity climate, it&#x27;s great for keeping the frizz at bay and is a great base for styling.</li>
            <li> First I did not get the minty clean feeling after rinsing out the cleanser, nor did I feel my hair was as soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This bottle came packed in it&#x27;s own WEN product box, which is not how other sellers send it.  </li>
            <li> it smells like a nap in the late morning of a perfect spring saturday snuggled in clean sheets with the curtains gently blowing in the breeze and the sound of a small brook tinkling by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this through amazon because i was really wanting to keep my natural hair chemical free.</li>
            <li> but after several uses, I have never had more dry, static, fly-away hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and soft, without needing conditioner.</li>
            <li> , I previously would have tangles no matter what I did and even combing my hair was challenging, it is now much more manageable, resists breaking, is soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when your hair has developed it&#x27;s own way of doing things over the years as mine</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair so healthy that it seems like it grows longer simply because it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Wen product so far (I&#x27;ve also used the fig &amp; the lavender).</li>
            <li> Although my hair seemed shinier at first &amp; had a definite reduction in frizz, it didn&#x27;t really seem to be helping make my hair more pliable and my ends still seemed dry most of the time.</li>
            <li> A little more volume but the most noticeable was how soft it</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the WEN products, but this one seems to be heavier and makes my hair less shiny and full.</li>
            <li> Now she has nothing but positive things to say (and she can&#x27;t justify pushing products and services on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my long hair every 3 days, sometimes more often.  </li>
            <li> The Spring Gardenia Green Tea scent is light and fresh (light floral and minty).</li>
            <li> The smell is so enticingly serene and uplifting, I love the smell of my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on the Wen line and wanted to try myself, loved being able to get it through Amazon, seems people either loved it or hated it, there were no in betweeners!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal hair, then this product will most likely make it greasy after repeated use.</li>
            <li> Clipped it up and rinsed well with cool water (till it felt squeaky clean), then blew dry.</li>
            <li> I especially like how easily it rinses out.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this fragrance since Gardenia can be such a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> So keep that in mind when you order if you suffer from certain allergies.</li>
            <li> Caused my scalp to develop cyst like large pimples.</li>
            <li> While I can get my hair to look pretty good by leaving some in, I hate the way it feels: someone else described her hair as feeling like lamb&#x27;s wool and that&#x27;s as good a descriptor as any.</li>
            <li> While I can get my hair to look pretty good by leaving some in, I hate the way it feels: someone else described her hair as feeling like lamb&#x27;s wool and that&#x27;s as good a descriptor as any.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more economical than shampoo because you use less.</li>
            <li> for the packaging, it worked fine until I got to the very last two or three applications, which turned out to be about 1/5 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Spring Gardenia is the icing on the cake as it smells so wonderful!Going back to regular shampoo, even the newer ones that are sulpher free, is not an option!!</li>
            <li> and now they have employed marketing brilliance and created seasonal \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; -- those of us with limited attention spans are very excited to be using the mango cocoanut</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this one really helps bring body and bounce to them!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, curly hair, and I noticed that the Gardenia Green Tea works the BEST!</li>
            <li> but I was expecting it to make my hair a little more smooth then soft</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, if it would be nice and not too fake smelling.  </li>
            <li> much of a fan of Wen; I&#x27;m not so much of a fan on their price.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about any WEN products so far.</li>
            <li> I love Wen Cleansing Conditioner and love their seasonal scents, especially Gardenia Green Tea.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But after about 5 or 6 straight days of using just Wen, my hair felt like it needed a break.  </li>
            <li> This really needs to be in a squeeze bottle that you can set upside-down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair never feels greasy and it does look much healthier, shinier and stronger.  </li>
            <li> Truly, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> but it really does work</li>
            <li> no matter how much product I put in</li>
            <li> Just go straight for the Ouidad.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it leaves my hair shiny and feeling conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Seems gentle on my dyed hair also.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use quite as much as recommended (I do about 16 pumps for just below</li>
            <li> That has a really yummy smell.  </li>
            <li> , it smells really</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean is a real hairdresser for over 20 years, he formulated this  andam soooooooooo thankful.  </li>
            <li> Wanted soo much to believe the infomercial</li>
            <li> The Pomegranate, to me, doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> So much healthier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in how much hair I shed.</li>
            <li> But the real miracle came when I straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> With my straight hair, it has movement</li>
            <li> but you have to use so much it does not seem to be very cost efficient.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I expected more..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in fragrances</li>
            <li> I am a devoted WEN user, but  after two or three uses this formula makes my strands feel very waxy.  </li>
            <li> Your money will be spent better elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> will say that you really have to commit to it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> However, just a note, it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy it from the Wen store online.</li>
            <li> and i have seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It was too much.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER pay that much for any hair care product again.</li>
            <li> Have to use so much</li>
            <li> but some1 told me the real wen has logo on bottom of</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t seem to need as much.</li>
            <li> Used it because my friends recommended it but for me, it was too much for my hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t matter how  much you rinse</li>
            <li> THANKS WEN..</li>
            <li> i give thanks to wen.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much volume now.</li>
            <li> I would not follow the directions of how much to use though..</li>
            <li> Love the different scents that this shampoo offers.</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li> , the fragrance on the Spring Gardenia Green Tea is nice.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the different scents, and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> This one smells so sweet and definitely gets me ready for spring!</li>
            <li> I think if you have frizzy or thick hair it would be good.</li>
            <li> NEED TO MAKE SURE USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT, ADD A LITTLE WATER AND LET SIT ON HAIR UNTIL YOU ARE DONE WASHING.</li>
            <li> Also, ordering directly from the website was significantly cheaper, as they send you a ton of extra products to try plus their current shampoos are more like 32$ and not 38$. Ordering from the website</li>
            <li> Also, I find I spend less and get better quality- who knew ;)</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, shiny, and bouncy for up to 4 days without having to wash it again (even with daily trips to the gym).</li>
            <li> We simply need to clean any dirt from our hair.</li>
            <li> perfect for my thin flyaway grey hair.</li>
            <li> Gripping and squeezing all the way down from scalp to ends Ive found removed too much residual and can damage hair.</li>
            <li> Baking soda and apple cider vinegar are far from the only no poo solutions out there for different hair types, its much better worth it than WEN.</li>
            <li> It will however open your sinuses right up!  </li>
            <li> It was OK, but just not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily think that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually just a bottle and a separate pump, but this seller had the bottle in it&#x27;s own display box which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it could just be a psychological thing to need to feel the suds if I know my hair&#x27;s full of sweat and ocean water, etc.  </li>
            <li> Definitely on the stronger side- if you prefer a lighter scent, the Sweet Almont Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Essential for shiny full hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but the first time for the Gardenia Green Tea, and it&#x27;s not as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true WEN girl, though I have started looking for cheaper products that are similar.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I have used several other hair cleansers before, but this one smells so good and leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very humid environment as well.</li>
            <li> hair felt dry, I will stick to Loreal for 6.00 which is sulfate free also.</li>
            <li> it does err, it errs on the more moisturizing side than less like the Aloe/Cucumber one tends to do.  </li>
            <li> so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun.</li>
            <li> so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use my regular color-treated shampoo and perhaps more conditioner if necessary.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a different cleansing conditioner from another company &amp; I like it much better.</li>
            <li> The smell of the spring gardenia green tea is light and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> this could quickly become a standard for me.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY OILY HAIR AND VERY SENSITIVE SKIN...</li>
            <li> So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li> every two weeks can really put a dent in a person&#x27;s cash flow... and cash is definitely something I do not have right now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li> First couple days were fine, but after two days, my hair just felt too heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fairly unruly hair and have never used a product that made my hair shiny and manageable until now.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and it used to feel like straw, but conditioner weighed it down too much.  </li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but it does leave my hair feeling a little heavy, especially between washes.</li>
            <li> It smelled nicely but really it was like using a heavy conditioner only.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my husband was amazed and said it was worth every penny we spent on it.</li>
            <li> Very shiny and soft...</li>
            <li> However, both of those formulas are great whereas the Winter Mint seems way over-the-top too moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a fine job of cleansing my hair but can&#x27;t really justify the price since I can get a cleansing conditioner that does just as well and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the gardenia green tea product.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes me 3 hours for me to straighten my curly hair</li>
            <li> I do not mind that it does not suds because there is a reason for that,but am not sure if it really leaves my hair in better condition.</li>
            <li> and it does better using Wen products that do NOT have the harsh foaming agents.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; thick consistency.</li>
            <li> After following the instructions I found that while my hair was super soft, it always looked greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li> This left it frizzy and dry, and it noticeably breaking more after two uses this week.</li>
            <li> But when my hair is dry, I don&#x27;t want it to smell anything but sweet and fragrant..</li>
            <li> however this is a new fragrance for me</li>
            <li> I feel bad for all the rest of the people who paid good money for this cheap quality copy cat and got ripped off without even knowing it.</li>
            <li> have to say, again, I spent less time styling, my hair looks great, and I can&#x27;t wait till my next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Now I alternate daily between the WEN conditioner and a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The Gardenia Green Tea is my favorite fragrance so far....</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> A little more costly than direct from WEN  but didn&#x27;t have to sign up for direct ship</li>
            <li> I think because my hair is very fine that it is too heavy-makes it dull.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how SOFT it is!  </li>
            <li> Bought this even though it had some pretty low reviews.</li>
            <li> She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> , i didn&#x27;t like the product then but wasn&#x27;t willing to throw it away, so i tossed it in the back of the closet</li>
            <li> and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always with WEN, my hair is soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year &amp; been able to grow my hair longer than in the past because it&#x27;s staying healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinse out well and your hair will be so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice so far and cannot believe the immediate effects of this product!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s alot better than the daily to every other day</li>
            <li> Give it a try the traditional way first.</li>
            <li> I also have psoriasis in places on my scalp and just using this product made the psoriasis go buck wild!</li>
            <li> I am throwing out my old shampoos and conditioners!</li>
            <li> I also use this for my Morky dog and it makes her hair so soft!</li>
            <li> was really surprised that this product exceed my expectations!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I followed the instructions and left some in as leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have used several Wen products but this one does exactly what it shows in the TV advertissements.  </li>
            <li> We usually only use the pomegranate, this is the first time we changed scents and we LOVE this Spring Gardenia Green Tea!  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be wash your hair the first time with your old shampoo, rinse your hair well, then apply WEN to your wet clean hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair which right now is waist length, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps the frizz at bay and gives my curls a more noticiable definition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes you hair feel soft and new.</li>
            <li> I like the product although my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with regular shampoo, am re-reading the directions again and possibly I did not follow them completely</li>
            <li> Once I shampooed and conditioned normally, just once, I was ready to go back to Wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t lather quite well unless I washed my hair first.</li>
            <li> (It stopped falling out) and it was also very soft, not it&#x27;s natural frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> So for me, Wen calms my hair down significantly and makes it look like it was handled by a professional every day!</li>
            <li> It is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for people with thick hair, but I have fine, long hair (to mid-back)</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in Wen than any other product out there that promises full body.</li>
            <li> I have tried this every which way: using more, using less, mixing with another shampoo, only as a conditioner,etc.</li>
            <li> Now I am 73 and finally have something that makes my hair feel great and no itchy scalp or dry flakes on my dark colored clothes!!!  </li>
            <li> I am a big Wen fan and Gardenia and Green Tea is my new favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Wen felt good in the shower but left my hair dry, kinda stiff and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very floral and feminine and gives my very dry hair a much needed moisture boost.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to no lather and to many pumps to do the job.</li>
            <li> ran out to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and bought a bottle of argan oil to put in my dry hair to tame the frizz and make it shiney, a hydrating hair mask to use once a week, and a really good deep conditioner for after i shampoo.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended the latter two to my friends with thick and/or hard to manage hair, and they have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I had also purchased the lavender shampoo directly from the Wen website.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> With my old shampoo and contioner it would take me any were from thirty minutes to a hour to comb my hair out after washing it</li>
            <li> Completely FROZEN and separated when thawed.</li>
            <li> I am 50 ish lady with professionally color treated shoulder length hair .</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a quality shampoo and conditioner recommended by a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> I have completely discontinued my use of shampoo altogether.</li>
            <li> it really does last you a while and nothing else beats it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Its by far my favourite Wen Cleansing Conditioner</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair and I will not purchase WEN products in the future.</li>
            <li> My curls are fuller &amp; smoother &amp; my straight styles last longer.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to perfumes and have no problems with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I received my order yesterday and immediately noticed a difference as the 16oz bottle was a different size than my REAL Wen 16oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I found the font was a tad different, the back labeling had differences and sure enough the ingredients were different.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always so soft after using WEN products.</li>
            <li> My hair needs moisture, I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, like Hispanic women, but not Hispanic, my hair needs moisture and this product didn&#x27;t supply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i also have sensitive skin, and some hair products cause me to break out at the hairline.  </li>
            <li> Even after really massaging the roots and rinsing multiple times.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t imagine putting this stuff straight on my face, especially the eyes!  </li>
            <li> BUT KNOW IT WILL MADE MY HAIR SHINY AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> Her hair has never been so shinny and soft</li>
            <li> I have only used it once though so will try it again because I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> and I like the soft feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li> I like these WEN cleansing conditioners that are free of the heavy oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m from the old school reasoning</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has really made my hair softer and shinier after 4-5 bleach and dye sessions in the last year, which I am so thankful for because my split ends are out of control.</li>
            <li> I guess it does make my hair soft though, so I&#x27;ll just use it as a conditioner and hold my nose while I use it, because at $30 a bottle now I feel like I have to use it even though I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I never heard of this fragrance before...</li>
            <li> I have  noticed a marked difference and have reduced washing to two times weekly.</li>
            <li> We do NOT need to strip the natural oils from our hair and then replace them.</li>
            <li> The smell is natural NOT perfume which I like.</li>
            <li> Wen makes my hair so soft, it keeps my curls bouncy all day.</li>
            <li> Honestly you might as well go the no poo style and just rinse your hair daily with green tea you make at home, with added essential oils or whatever you prefer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that only requires washing once a week but with wen I have to wash more often and don&#x27;t notice enough of an improvement to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> I left a more detailed review on the lavender bottle...basically this product is a waste of money that will leave your hair oily and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, just expensive.</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t need to use quite as many pumps as recommended for my medium longish thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I will warn though when they say use a certain amount of pumps - try less first.</li>
            <li> The gardenia &amp; the green tea scent mixed together is a very unique scent.</li>
            <li> Like all the other WEN products this does not fail the test, it makes me hair feel a lot more alive, and it keeps the pink dye in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> The gardenia on the other hand made it feel heavy, and kind of greasey.</li>
            <li> My hair is very nice for about 12 hours, and then begins to look dirty and oily.</li>
            <li> First of all, recommended amount to use is ten pumps worth of this stuff, followed directions and saw absolutely no improvement in my overall hair condition.  </li>
            <li> At first it made my curly very dry hair soft.</li>
            <li> Its great marketing, mad product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works fr other people, it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me</li>
            <li> The product is heavy and you dont feel your hair is clean.</li>
            <li> Would not buy this particular item again, but I like Wen overall.</li>
            <li> Are you aware there are numerous reports of women with similar experiences?  </li>
            <li> Love the new scent, Spring Gardenia Green Tea!!!</li>
            <li> over all it leaves my hair very heavy and sticky, which is disappointing considering i have heard great things about this product, and I have reduced the use i put in my hair down drastically; and i make sure to wash it out very well after every use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> There is no other product that works as well!</li>
            <li> Rinse for as long till it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy of really slippery--</li>
            <li> I usually use Loreal for color treated hair that is sulphate free.</li>
            <li> The standard sweet almond mint and any of the other &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34</li>
            <li> As always, I got exactly what I wanted and expected with my purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, fine, naturally wavy, and dyed.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and cut short with longer pieces in front, so it is ridiculous to slather so much on.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, somewhat fine and color treated/highlighted and without WEN it&#x27;s very dry and brittle despite regular use of conditioning treatments and masks.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has made it possible for me to try new scents and formulas and not get stuck with it.</li>
            <li> It is really cold and dry out (November) and it seems to be getting better, but it also recommends using way more than I was using as my hair is short.</li>
            <li> I use less pumps than recommended (6-7 pumps total; I clean with 3-3.5 pumps, rinse, then use another 3 pumps that I leave on while bathing and rinse off at the end).  </li>
            <li> and i had not been home long enough to use it consistently and recommend it or not.  </li>
            <li> And instead putting another pump on my hair after rinsing, I simply take my comb which has some left on it after combing through in the shower and work it through my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I have short hair blonde hair, I am familiar with how much and how to use Wen, but I was not satisfied with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried the sweet almond mint a while ago and after several washes my hair felt weighed down.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self with no other shampoo or anything</li>
            <li> I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a major difference</li>
            <li> I read the review about the soft water versus hard water results and I have to say we have hard well water and the Wen works good for me.  </li>
            <li> If anyone wants to know if it works for black, natural hair, I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s the truth!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this product left it feeling very weighed down and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was still a great product and did its job, but the smell was so bad to me</li>
            <li> Left my hair not as soft as the others.</li>
            <li> and I can barely smell it even in the shower while using</li>
            <li> I also add some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH on the dryer parts of my hair before blow-drying to give extra</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t work any worse than my $3 drugstore shampoo and conditioner, I also didn&#x27;t see it work any better.</li>
            <li> ,expensive won&#x27;t buy this kind again, looking for alternative</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything better or worse than Nioxin or Axe</li>
            <li> When the shampoo is used there are no suds, weird but effective.</li>
            <li> there are too many steps to the process &#x3D; not happy</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous for my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend splitting your pumps up in half, cleansing your scalp and roots first lathering vigorously with your finger pads till you can work it into your roots, then rinse not let it sit.</li>
            <li> I adjusted to the suds&#x27;less creamy feel after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> My hair had changed from normal to too dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and is now normal again.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but not sure if this product is any better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my 3 yr old daughter who has loose natural curls.  </li>
            <li> The key is the combing then don&#x27;t rinse it out completely, just a bit and gently squeeze hair of excess water WITHOUT SLIDING HANDS DOWN HAIR.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it had to do with the dry climate I live in or what,</li>
            <li> I have dry course frizzy hair and live in South Fl.</li>
            <li> I love to do dramatic color...</li>
            <li> I am a natural curly African American woman and I can say with pride I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl!</li>
            <li> My hair is never dry..</li>
            <li> Yes, I do have to use hairspray at the end to tame those little frizzies, but I love the feel of Wen when I&#x27;m cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li> From past reviews, you know I am an avid WEN lover!</li>
            <li> I am satisified enough to try other scents and I am very particular about my hair products.</li>
            <li> also make a plain green tea which is more neutral.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d get a little bit of a deal since it&#x27;s really not that much cheaper than the REAL Wen.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not limited edition, even though pretty much all of the formulas are the same with the scents being the unique factor.</li>
            <li> Then use the other half pumps, and work it into the entirety of you hair till it lathers up nice and let sit in your hair as long as you can (5-10 minutes while you shave your legs or do other bathing steps).</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite Wens so far, I have very thick, long hair, (think mixed chicks), and Wen is the only thing I use now, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I have to comment on the smell of the Spring Gardenia Green Tea.  </li>
            <li> I used to use multiple produts in the shower, multiple products on my wet hair and then more products on my dry hair in order to try and tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> If your find that using WEN exclusively isn&#x27;t working for your hair type I highly recommend using it every other day and seeing if that works.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair does not hold as much water with the WEN so drying time is cut in half</li>
            <li> First of all I have long hair (down to my waist</li>
            <li> I have a short style, where it&#x27;s longer in the front, but not long by any means.  </li>
            <li> It was about triple the amount that normally comes out when I wash my hair with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and naturally oily skin - which can be a blessing in the dry climate I live in but makes it impossible to skip a shampoo without my hair feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair down to the top of my bra and my hair always feels heavy, so</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair naturally.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair, so this was a big concern of mine.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it was not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is difficult to work with wen makes such a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t rinse it long enough and my hair felt heavy and flat.  </li>
            <li> I am partial to the lighter scents without the heavy oils since my hair is easily weighed down.</li>
            <li> I live in New Mexico and the hard water kills your hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, baby fine hair and</li>
            <li> There is a class action lawsuit due to this harming people.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I ever had was that the smell is a little strong (like eucalyptus or someting) for my taste, the gardenia version of this product is the answer to my prayers.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well enough if you leave it on long enough and rinse it long enough.  </li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t scorching your hair with a blow dryer and flat iron.</li>

            <li> I have long color treated hair that I straighten daily.</li>
            <li> But some of you might think it&#x27;s lasting me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Not only does this work wonders on my hair, but helps manage the dry scalp I&#x27;ve had since moving to a desert climate.</li>
            <li> It feels greasy and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> If I leave some in after rinsing, it is too greasy but dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> *r rinsing, it is too greasy but dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry hair</li>
            <li> I had dry, lightly coarse hair and the texture of my har has improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> A lot of people think you have to use too much, but if it cuts down the number of times you have to shampoo, it comes out to a lot less per shampoo than you would think.</li>
            <li> i undo my bun and my hair is nothing but a mess; its limp and scraggly, smells funny, itches, and it still looks so greasy.</li>
            <li> When used properly, The only other product I need is hair spray and my hair is medium long in length and layerd.</li>
            <li> Not right for my hair type no body ,limp scent goes away fast</li>
            <li> Secondly, the product left my hair flat and with less body.</li>
            <li> i had been scratching at my head all morning long</li>
            <li> I was not sure which fragrance, as I know my hair texture would normally require the Fig fragrance</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to arrive once ordered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy on the floral, nor on the green tea.</li>
            <li> , I have long hair</li>
            <li> Wide tooth comb only.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Wen products and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair long and with Wen</li>
            <li> the price an goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i have long hair</li>
            <li> i wash my hair and towel dry, comb it with a wide tooth comb toss it in a low bun and run out the door for work (I work in data entry)</li>
            <li> I purchased he Rasberry mint hoping for the same results with different scent, however my hair felt dryer and less mangeable.</li>
            <li> Next time I will add just a drop or two of my &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo to the WEN and see if that will take care of the slight buildup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ended up switching back to my old shampoo just to feel clean again and to stop the painful bumps.</li>
            <li> Wen is a little expensive than your normal hair products,but worth it because it doesnt damage the hair,scalp like everything else on the market..</li>
            <li> For me personally; due to contaminated water in my area, etc...I don&#x27;t think this product had a chance to work properly.</li>
            <li> It is very different than any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner part works wonders on my oily dry hair type, but you do have to use a lot, so you can have some sort of lather.</li>
            <li> It tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d started using products recommended by my hairdresser for dry- color treated hair...</li>
            <li> ,my was really really dry after using it , not going to try again</li>
            <li> Not to mention my have lots of problems with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> She used to complain that my hair was too dry and damaged and that I shouldn&#x27;t keep getting it highlighted.  </li>
            <li> However, after washing with shampoo, even if I follow with conditioner, my hair feels dry like straw</li>
            <li> I blow dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I have to use Moroccan oil as well before I dry my hair to make it look</li>
            <li> My hairs is not so dry or frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair feeling kinda dry and brittle</li>
            <li> dry-</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling really dry from coloring</li>
            <li> So, if you have really dry hair, then you might benefit from using this.</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry like a broom.</li>
            <li> Controls my frizz and dry ends.  </li>
            <li> It can be expensive having to test different scents, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I add about a nickel sized dollop of Pantene Shampoo to 5 pumps of the conditioner for a single treatment.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry hair that I wash, dry and curl every day.  </li>
            <li> Far too heavy due to the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that did not give me drastic reactions but still had a itchy and flakey condition going on....much worse as I got older.  </li>
            <li> My hair is healthier and the product does not weigh down my hair because it only keeps what it needs when you rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> Second, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry or frizzy!</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t shampoo my hair daily.</li>
            <li> that gives you an entire litre for less than this price for a counterfeit product sold here.</li>
            <li> I sometimes add a half pump to the middle-to-ends of the back of my hair; not to roots.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still only half way through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my regular shampoo and conditioner and no more Wen for me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if your hair is very dry</li>
            <li> So I have a big glob of congealed mess and</li>
            <li> Some are just,well a little to earthy, a little too natural if that can make any sense.</li>
            <li> I am also starting to use a little of the cleansing conditioner as leave in conditioner and that is working so well, smoothing my hair, controlling frizz and providing shine</li>
            <li> little different because it does not  suds&lt;br /&gt;but  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical for sure, but I hardly had to put any time into styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll let it grown long!!!</li>
            <li> this FAKE one did not have wen sketched into the actual bottom like the REAL one did.  </li>
            <li> I believe the negative results that users experience is the consequence of either not using enough WEN or not rinsing thoroughly enough.</li>
            <li> Was curious what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li> WHILE ON HAIR AND WET.</li>
            <li> I was curious, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so brittle that when I combed it while it was wet, I was unknowingly snapping off hairs close to my hairline at about 2-5 inches from the scalp.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks my head is starting to itch...</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t purchase the Gardenia Green Tea again, especially now that my head is itching.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this, Spring Gardenia Green Tea and the Winter Vanilla Mint at the same time.</li>
            <li> PLUS, I stopped brushing my hair wet.</li>
            <li> So for any of you ladies who may be thinning, stop brushing your hair wet.</li>
            <li> The Wen shampoo/conditioner works as expected.</li>
            <li> and I can detect only the faintest hint of green tea.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have shared that...now it&#x27;ll be harder to find.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps the hair dirty so if you used it few times and then toy use real shampoo you will see how much dirt comes out from your heir.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m caucasian with nearly waist length, thick and wavy hair).</li>
            <li> , now it only takes me an hour and a half!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the mango scent but read another reviewer that said the Gardenia scent actually weighed her hair down less.  </li>
            <li> - you know, when you get down to the last little bit of your shake or slushie and the straw doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> - my hair may feel slightly less dry than before (maybe?).  </li>
            <li> have thick, never dyed, long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> but I do like the scent very much, it does make my hair less prone to static (mine gets really bad in cold winter weather) vs. regular shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> ... let me just say that 16 oz of this stuff would last me less than a week if i washed my hair everyday (</li>
            <li> what a waste, and given that it is super expensive  </li>
            <li> So I suppose I can now order the other two fragrances without fear.&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li> The pump stopped working altogether, due to what I will call the Slushie Effect</li>
            <li> and it has made my hair look and feel way healthier then any other shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners that I have tried</li>
            <li> some of the other ones have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its pretty expensive too for all the hype.  </li>
            <li> With WEN I don&#x27;t bother with other hair treatments and my hair stylist</li>
            <li> Not like the other seasonal conditioners.  </li>
            <li> As my other review of WEN</li>
            <li> so my usual routine was to wash daily.</li>
            <li> Heavier than other Wen conditioners...</li>
            <li> This has a sharp, almost household-cleaner-scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll contunue use and expand to other WEN products.</li>
            <li> my massive container of cucumber aloe is missing me!  </li>
            <li> I DONOT like ordering from Wen because it it&#x27;s a contract deal where they auto ship every month, and they include about 5 other products I don&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day...</li>
            <li> Soft and coarse at the same time &#x3D; weird!</li>
            <li> Soft and coarse at the same time &#x3D; weird!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago when I was complaining about my hair being dry where it&#x27;s highlighted blond, and friend said \\&quot;I have one word for you</li>
            <li> ; fragrances have such an awful medicinal smell that I won&#x27;t use them no matter how nice the product is.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist because I was having trouble with dry , itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> the ends are a little dry but the scalp is so oily it literally looks like i haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a month!</li>
            <li> the ends are a little dry but the scalp is so oily it literally looks like i haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a month!</li>
            <li> LITTLE DOG HAS VERY DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly, thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> $60.00/ month for shampoo- positively no way!</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> Especially because we have really hard water living in the city that we go through water softeners like babies go through bottles</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people complained about how it left their hair oily and with a residue like texture.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair &amp; use on average one 16 oz bottle every 8 to 10 weeks...</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> You have to use soooo much of the Wen, and it is quite expensive that I haven&#x27;t used it exclusively yet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to help relieve itching but not worth the price</li>
            <li> I wet my hair &amp; get 4-5 pumps and spread it evenly over the hair around my scalp and spend a few minutes massaging it into the roots.</li>
            <li> I love and hate this product.  </li>
            <li> My friend has thick curly hair which is opposite of mine and her hair after using wen.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, mid length hair.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product and after speaking with several other family members and friends; they too were not real impressed.</li>
            <li> Squeeze at scalp release, move down lower and squeeze... continue.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the time in the shower too since it is cleansing and conditioning in one product.</li>
            <li> This time it hasnt gotten that weighed down feeling</li>
            <li> I had to amend my review, taking it from 4 stars down to 3.</li>
            <li> but, it does make your hair a lot softer, and it moisturizes it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> i mean nobody needs up to 20 pumps per wash and nobody needs to do it a second time.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little thicker then the other shampoos...</li>
            <li> I use other Wen cleansing conditioners as well, I try one fragrance at a time, then the next time a differnt one, I used to buy the expensive shampoos and conditioners, I wont go back to them.  </li>
            <li> No more dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> Too heavy due to the almond oil.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cheaper however, since the Moroccan oil is so concentrated, you use significantly less of it.</li>
            <li> My hair appeared dirty sooner and was not nearly as soft as it is normally with my Dove shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but with WEN it takes five minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick, wavy hair, and after a few uses I could tell it wasn&#x27;t as frizzed out as it would be when using regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I plan on finishing the bottle and hoping my hair gets softer, less frizzy, and whatever else the infomercial proclaims.</li>
            <li> It just smells like gardenia &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that slightly medicinal smell &amp; tingly quality</li>
            <li> My hairdresser visits are about half what they were.</li>
            <li> so maybe that is why I need to use less.</li>
            <li> Product actually made my hair feel coarse which was a bit weird.</li>
            <li> The scent wore off, but kept my less washable.</li>
            <li> In the end I have slightly modified the product.</li>
            <li> After using WEN my hair has less breakage.  </li>
            <li> and I have less shed hair in my brush.</li>
            <li> I tried it again with less</li>
            <li> so then my bun is a mess</li>
            <li> Two pumps at first and then rub&lt;br /&gt;it in like crazy til you feel you scalp</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my long thick hair and who would use 20 to 30 pumps like the bottle states.....</li>
            <li> I find it a bit heavy on my hair, so I use less than recommended.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and 16oz doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly and was getting way too dry</li>
            <li> I typically have oily hair -scalp and the green tea has balanced that out.  </li>
            <li> This does not clean like the Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> SO FROM HIS WAST DOWN, IT WAS THIN AND SHORT, AND WAST UP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still just a little hesitant about the price though, because if I use the recommended amount of pumps for my hair, I go through 32oz a month...</li>
            <li> and it has a little bit of a cooling feeling when you use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little greasy after I use this product.</li>
            <li> These products are a little pricey</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of trying this product.</li>
            <li> But in the end it works no better than other products ive used.</li>
            <li> Just wish the scent was little stronger.</li>
            <li> It too has a little of the menthol scent but nothing like the Gardenia Green Tea.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s only if I feel like my hair is really dirty from a recent workout or something.  </li>
            <li> I also do not believe it to be a knock-off, just since it&#x27;s missing WEN from the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> So I opted for the spring gardenia green tea, I do like gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> 16 pumps of cleansing conditioner would&#x27;ve been overkill and a waste of cash.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Hair is sticky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> but after a few months I&#x27;d have to change to another product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle age bi-racial woman with thin hair</li>
            <li> When I use what they suggest my hair is way to heavy and can not style.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been buying WEN cleansing conditioners for a few years now</li>
            <li> I will also wash with shampoo a few times a week and then use this as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wash everyday</li>
            <li> Heavy weighted product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Gardenia Green Tea &#x3D;</li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t wash her hair everyday like adults do.  </li>
            <li> I got the dead ends trimmed when I began using Wen</li>
            <li> Since I hate to toss the gardenia because it&#x27;s so expensive, I mix it with the pomegranate to help cut back on the waxiness, and it does work better that way.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 16oz bottle of Spring Gardenia Green Tea Cleansing Conditioner a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I used it all and then bought this one, the Gardenia Green Tea.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was cleansing my hair with a heavy cream rinse.</li>
            <li> No residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this will be a year round product as I will be purchasing it again and again.</li>
            <li> but for me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Somehow I just never got around to trying it until a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was an everyday choice instead of seasonal.</li>
            <li> I used it for two months and just made my hair too heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy on hair</li>
            <li> very sad, because I really wanted to be a WEN girl!</li>
            <li> my opinion i wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I am finding I am using less of this product than shampoo in the past.  </li>
            <li> my hair felt stiff and strawlike after using this stuff even though I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this stiff for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> No more harsh detergents, chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks and not sure if I am using it correctly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair down to my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the negative reviews from other fine-haired women, but couldn&#x27;t resist trying!</li>
            <li> This is not good for blonde thin hair at all I lost half my length as soon as I quit using it</li>
            <li> At a certain point I got too frustrated to keep doing it and threw the rest of it out.  </li>
            <li> Hair is dull and heavy.</li>
            <li> and it just leaves my hair dull and limp.</li>
            <li> , so don&#x27;t give up on the whole line of Wen after one time or one bad experience.  </li>
            <li> (i usually put my damp washed hair in a bun</li>
            <li> I usually use fig</li>
            <li> I never used 16 pumps, because after paying about $35 for this one bottle, I felt that was excessive.  </li>
            <li> but with no better results.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and tried to use some of the advice I read in several reviews, but sadly I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> you sleep weird last night.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about the past two months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried using fewer pumps but no better.</li>
            <li> So now I usually wash my hair two to three times a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without Wen, I am not sure what I would do I am so dependent on it now.</li>
            <li> Works ok as a conditioner, but terrible as a &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying WEN from Amazon for almost a year; I&#x27;m wondering if I have been buying a fake product for the last year!</li>
            <li> So I have been stuck with hair color darker than my usual.  </li>
            <li> With a few days of use, your hair loses its body, gets oilier and oilier, and builds up an icky layer of cells on the scalp that you have to wash away with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Also, if you have long hair you need a lot of it and it is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s Argan Oil moisturize comparably if not better and without the ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible hair (fine, flyaway, does not hold a style).  </li>
            <li> My hair would become hard to manage, my ends split &amp; the color faded.</li>
            <li> it is hard to get use to know suds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had NO problem with the oily feeling that everyone complained about.</li>
            <li> I say, give it at least one try.</li>
            <li> i was appalled at how much product the instructions ask you to use, but whatever...</li>
            <li> I say yes, because before I started using it, my hair was very very thin, dull, flat, lifeless and broken all over.</li>
            <li> Definitely not my favorite!</li>
            <li> used to use VERY expensive salon formulas, and having this 1 product, I actually save money.</li>
            <li> Between QVC and TV ads this product has been so overhyped its ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> i would have stopped using them in protest of the utterly ridiculous amount they suggest you use -- nobody, and</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, no matter how mild, just stripps it worst.</li>
            <li> After reading over and over about how bad it is to wash your hair daily I decided to switch to the WEN cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> liquefied useless product.[[ASIN:B007HOCQVS WEN® Spring Gardenia Green Tea Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li> , you cannot go wrong with it, i use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> does not clean your hair, feels dirty and is not shiny.</li>
            <li> Worse stuff I ever used.</li>
            <li> That, in addition to application recommendation and the poorly conceived packaging, is why I would not buy this again unless it was closer to $10.s about customers going through the official distribution club and getting signed up for stuff</li>
            <li> That, in addition to application recommendation and the poorly conceived packaging, is why I would not buy this again unless it was closer to $10.</li>
            <li> I found  the 12-15 pumps per section of the head absolutely unnecessary That equals 48-30 pumps per cleansing.</li>
            <li> It did not make it worse.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Not really  happy with the result of this product</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse once its on your head as opposed to sniffing it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;m ordering Lavender next and will base my decision on how that goes.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN cleansing conditioner products for approximately 2 months.  </li>
            <li> like i had bugs like crazy hard to get used to no lather</li>
            <li> Meh, made my hair feel gross, and I was really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The next day my hair was greasy and I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The Gardenia Green Tea does just that!!!!</li>
            <li> but you can not do that needless to say with cleaning your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Heed the warning from &#x27;Fake&#x27; - check the label and compare ingredients, check the packaging also.</li>
            <li> and it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was weird and decided to compare the two side by side.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> but this product failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna use it up as conditioner as it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> I blindly recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> this stuff is expensive and should be used sparingly (a half-dollar sized dollop is sufficient for below the ear hair).  </li>
            <li> Not so crazy about this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s not too bad if you don&#x27;t fall for the 24+</li>
            <li> and it keeps driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> it stinks.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing considering the price tag.</li>
            <li> That was disappointing, but I used it anyway</li>
            <li> Worst dispenser waste of money defective have to remove dispenser product does not come out when press it&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell to this bottle is unbelievable!!!!  </li>
            <li> NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;i did receive the gardenia version and was a bit disappointed -- vague if almost indistinguishable scent of gardenia.  </li>
            <li> Now Wen still ranks #1 with me but for the price this isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> try the Gardenia if you&#x27;ve had a bad experience before.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I ended up with a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> listen to the infomercials, this stuff is crap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me I was convinced I would hate it</li>
            <li> I tried the tea tree WEN and HATED the smell of it.</li>
            <li> but if you are on the fence about buying this insanely pricey product then i hope my review has swung you away from the ledge.</li>
            <li> it truly is a horrible product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Are you a Wen fan yet?  If you haven&#x27;t tried it you should. I will  never go back to regular shampoos &amp; conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much of a fan of Wen; I&#x27;m not so much of a fan on their price.  So I looked around and found something similar for about a third of the price. Now Wen still ranks #1 with me but for the price this isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Its by a brand called \\&quot;As I Am\\&quot;. The As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner.  Sells for around $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, after using cowashes for a couple of months now; I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is thicker.  So give it a try. What do you have to lose except more hair. ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Take care.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Not crazy about any WEN products so far.</li>
            <li> This would be better if the price was lower. Honestly you might as well go the no poo style and just rinse your hair daily with green tea you make at home, with added essential oils or whatever you prefer. Baking soda and apple cider vinegar are far from the only no poo solutions out there for different hair types, its much better worth it than WEN. Even the curly girl method washing with coconut Sauve conditioner is better than this.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell of this Shampoo. I also do not believe it to be a knock-off, just since it&#x27;s missing WEN from the bottom of the bottle. I had also purchased the lavender shampoo directly from the Wen website. Both behave in my hair identically. I only gave three stars since this doesn&#x27;t work as well in my hair. Even super cheap shampoo, such as Herbal essence or White Rain work better for my hair type. I typically don&#x27;t shampoo my hair daily. On the website, this product advertises that you won&#x27;t need to wash your hair as often. I disagree as it leaves my hair super oily. I also thought this might be cheaper than the higher quality Moroccan oil I frequently buy for perhaps more around 42$. It wasn&#x27;t cheaper however, since the Moroccan oil is so concentrated, you use significantly less of it. Also, ordering on Amazon was more expensive than the actual website. However, the website was not offering the gardenia shampoo. Also, ordering directly from the website was significantly cheaper, as they send you a ton of extra products to try plus their current shampoos are more like 32$ and not 38$. Ordering from the website also gives you instructions, where this product came with nothing but the bottle and the pump.</li>
            <li> I think because my hair is very fine that it is too heavy-makes it dull.  I think if you have frizzy or thick hair it would be good.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Wen and what a difference it has made to my hair.  I cannot believe how SOFT it is!  And it stays clean for days.  I no longer have to shampoo daily.  It is pricey for a hair product, but well worth it.  A lot of people think you have to use too much, but if it cuts down the number of times you have to shampoo, it comes out to a lot less per shampoo than you would think.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the WEN products, but this one seems to be heavier and makes my hair less shiny and full.</li>
            <li> i wished that the shampoo bubble  it &#x27;s clean more when its bubble&lt;br /&gt;i wished chad work on the shampoo that clean the hair better than what he had</li>
            <li> Wen is a little expensive than your normal hair products,but worth it because it doesnt damage the hair,scalp like everything else on the market..it doesnt contain any chemicals or additives like SLS,sodium laurenth sulfate,which strips the hair,which you dont want to do,this actualy buids up the hairs natural ingredients, and your hair feels 100 percent better too.</li>
            <li> awesome seller and product. shipped quickly! thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get into this product and i had not been home long enough to use it consistently and recommend it or not.  At first it made my hair feel wonderful and replenished and barely a week into using and hair went through a greasy stage as my hair is fine and this a thick product that does not lather.  It is really cold and dry out (November) and it seems to be getting better, but it also recommends using way more than I was using as my hair is short.</li>
            <li> I was do excited to try this I bought the big size assuming I would love. I am not a wen girl. I tried it for two weeks hoping the \\&quot;instant results\\&quot; just took longer on me.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, never dyed, long blonde hair. I used the massive 15 pumps it says to but it never felt clean. My hair appeared dirty sooner and was not nearly as soft as it is normally with my Dove shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bought this even though it had some pretty low reviews. Was curious what all the hype was about. Then a friend of mine bought it and was thrilled. On her advice I decided to give it a try. It leaves my hair soft and silky. I do not use the prescribed amount of product because I think that would be overkill. I use enough to saturate my hair and leave it on for about 10 min. Hair is soft and silky. I noticed a lot of people complained about how it left their hair oily and with a residue like texture. It did NOT do that for me, but of course I made sure to rinse well. I made sure to get all of the product out of my roots and off my scalp. For me it rinsed nice and clean. I&#x27;ve had NO problem with the oily feeling that everyone complained about. Would I buy again?...yes. Would I recommend this product...yes.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works great for hair that is affected by hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this shampoo. She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage. She has tried every shampoo available. She thinks this shampoo is just great. Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled. I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry. So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Scrumptious! I love this fragrance! Wen cleansing conditioner is the only &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I use on my hair. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> This product is all they say it is on the info commercials. The difference is the price. If you buy it through Wen after the initial introductory offer they send you products you Amy not want and the price is exorbitant. Much better icing on Amazon and you can get last season&#x27;s products. It seems that Wen changes their product every season.</li>
            <li> Im asking for more of this from Santa this year. Truly helped my split ends, my hair was a lot stronger (It stopped falling out) and it was also very soft, not it&#x27;s natural frizzy curls. Definitely works. Wish it was a bit cheaper tho&amp;#60;/3</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the mango scent but read another reviewer that said the Gardenia scent actually weighed her hair down less.  I have fine thin hair, so this was a big concern of mine.  This scent smells amazing and my hair feels wonderfully light.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that gets oily quickly. It was OK, but just not worth the price. I saw no difference in Wen than any other product out there that promises full body. If I had money to burn, I&#x27;d buy it again, it did smell nice. Just no jaw dropping results.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the tingle it gives my scalp</li>
            <li> I love Wen Cleansing Conditioner and love their seasonal scents, especially Gardenia Green Tea. The scent is perfect, a rich floral arrangement softened by the lightness of green tea. The cleansing conditioner part works wonders on my oily dry hair type, but you do have to use a lot, so you can have some sort of lather. I recommend splitting your pumps up in half, cleansing your scalp and roots first lathering vigorously with your finger pads till you can work it into your roots, then rinse not let it sit. Then use the other half pumps, and work it into the entirety of you hair till it lathers up nice and let sit in your hair as long as you can (5-10 minutes while you shave your legs or do other bathing steps). Use more if you feel it necessary, the more the better. Rinse for as long till it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy of really slippery-- with cooler water, if you can  stand it. I always add a pump for leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s a nice experience. The smell will get you a lot of compliments and the texture of your hair will improve the longer you use the product. Too bad it&#x27;s not limited edition, even though pretty much all of the formulas are the same with the scents being the unique factor.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to no lather and to many pumps to do the job. Nice for hair.</li>
            <li> bought this through amazon because i was really wanting to keep my natural hair chemical free. bought a 16 oz bottle for like 20 something bucks and when i got it in the mail the first thing i noticed was the smell. (which btw wasn&#x27;t pleasent and stays in your hair until you wash with a traditional shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;but i thought \\&quot;whatever\\&quot; i can get over the strong smell. so i used it the first time and didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair, i didn&#x27;t like the product then but wasn&#x27;t willing to throw it away, so i tossed it in the back of the closet and there it sat. 6 months ago i dyed my hair a shade lighter. i noticed my hair was brittle and split ends were developing quicker so i thought of this stuff and pulled it out. i washed my hair in the morning before going into work. (btw i hadn&#x27;t washed my hair at all that weekend and so i really needed to wash out my grimey hair!) so with that said. i followed the directions once more and used the full amount of suggested pumps... let me just say that 16 oz of this stuff would last me less than a week if i washed my hair everyday (which i don&#x27;t) i was appalled at how much product the instructions ask you to use, but whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i wash my hair and towel dry, comb it with a wide tooth comb toss it in a low bun and run out the door for work (I work in data entry) so an hour at work and my head is so itchy, and smells like special shampoo (like maybe the kind you use to get rid of lice or dandruff or something) so i am not used to the smell and it keeps driving me crazy. i had been scratching at my head all morning long and now i am in complete insecurity phase (did that cute guy from engineering see me scratch my smelly head!?!?) so then my bun is a mess so i have to undo my bun and redo it (i usually put my damp washed hair in a bun and when it dries it gives me awesome curls that loosen into waves (I have middle of the back blonde hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i undo my bun and my hair is nothing but a mess; its limp and scraggly, smells funny, itches, and it still looks so greasy. the ends are a little dry but the scalp is so oily it literally looks like i haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a month! so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun. made it through the rest of the day got home and immediately washed my hair with a traditional shampoo. ran out to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and bought a bottle of argan oil to put in my dry hair to tame the frizz and make it shiney, a hydrating hair mask to use once a week, and a really good deep conditioner for after i shampoo. my hair is in the best shape of its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people... if you don&#x27;t damage your hair with chemicals like straighteners, and dyes. if you aren&#x27;t scorching your hair with a blow dryer and flat iron. if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this! and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i know that this has recieved a lot of great reviews but if you are on the fence about buying this insanely pricey product then i hope my review has swung you away from the ledge. it truly is a horrible product both times i used it and a pricey trial and error.and scraggly, smells funny, itches, and it still looks so greasy. the ends are a little dry but the scalp is so oily it literally looks like i haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a month! so i was super embarrassed and pulled it back up into a bun. made it through the rest of the day got home and immediately washed my hair with a traditional shampoo. ran out to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and bought a bottle of argan oil to put in my dry hair to tame the frizz and make it shiney, a hydrating hair mask to use once a week, and a really good deep conditioner for after i shampoo. my hair is in the best shape of its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people... if you don&#x27;t damage your hair with chemicals like straighteners, and dyes. if you aren&#x27;t scorching your hair with a blow dryer and flat iron. if you aren&#x27;t brushing your hair when its wet then you probably have healthy hair and won&#x27;t need a shampoo like this! and if you do damage your hair with the above mentioned techniques then there are so many other things you can do rather then by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i know that this has recieved a lot of great reviews but if you are on the fence about buying this insanely pricey product then i hope my review has swung you away from the ledge. it truly is a horrible product both times i used it and a pricey trial and error.</li>
            <li> The Spring Gardenia Green Tea smells absolutely amazing! And WEN products really do make your hair awesome! I&#x27;m still just a little hesitant about the price though, because if I use the recommended amount of pumps for my hair, I go through 32oz a month... when it&#x27;s \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to last me three months. Maybe it&#x27;s not intended to be used daily? Either way... 16oz every two weeks can really put a dent in a person&#x27;s cash flow... and cash is definitely something I do not have right now.</li>
            <li> I am a big Wen fan and Gardenia and Green Tea is my new favorite fragrance.  It smells so light and so pretty and it has a little bit of a cooling feeling when you use it.  If you use it correctly you will NEVER want to go back to sulphates and lather shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried other comparable cleansing conditioners and they are okay, better than the soap on the hair,  but Wen is my favorite.  Even though they say all the fragrances are for any hair type I don&#x27;t necessarily think that&#x27;s true, so don&#x27;t give up on the whole line of Wen after one time or one bad experience.  The cucumber, the gardenia, and the tea tree and the sweet almond mint are great for my medium length and texture.  The fig, I&#x27;ve heard is best for thick course hair....try the Gardenia if you&#x27;ve had a bad experience before.  Be sure to work it in and through your hair, and be sure to rinse for at least a full minute.  The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t rinse it long enough and my hair felt heavy and flat.  When used properly, The only other product I need is hair spray and my hair is medium long in length and layerd. I read the review about the soft water versus hard water results and I have to say we have hard well water and the Wen works good for me.  I think working it through like you would any shampoo and rinsing well is key.  You might have to adjust the amount you use based on your water type.  I never feel like my hair or my scalp isn&#x27;t clean and hair color lasts longer with Wen. I think its Fabulous.</li>
            <li> love the product,way overpriced. qvc has a much better deal! I never have to pull my color to the ends of my hair. color stays true. I have long,curly,color treated hair and it works great. never again would I use shampoo</li>
            <li> The product was busted and I asked for it replaced and I want my money back</li>
            <li> Best shampoo, conditioner ever! Speedy delivery..and I am one happy lady! If you have never tried it, you should; you&#x27;ll be hooked too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the money. My hair loves Wen!! When I don&#x27;t use Wen I definitely notice the difference. Joy</li>
            <li> So I have become a die-hard fan of Wen. My hair is dark/coarse/frizzy and incredibly dry/damaged. I live in a very humid environment as well. I have tried and loved the Vanilla Mint and Fig cleansers. They were perfect for my dry over-processed hair. I decided to give this one a try. First I did not get the minty clean feeling after rinsing out the cleanser, nor did I feel my hair was as soft and shiny. I did not mind the scent as some people do. It might work for people with fine hair. Definitely not my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have used a number of Wen products, and the classics seem to be the best (Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner and styling cr&amp;egrave;me).  Would not buy this particular item again, but I like Wen overall.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  A few weeks ago when I was complaining about my hair being dry where it&#x27;s highlighted blond, and friend said \\&quot;I have one word for you, WEN.\\&quot;  I thought Ok I&#x27;ve seen it advertised plenty of times. She swears by it, I&#x27;ll try it.  I was not sure which fragrance, as I know my hair texture would normally require the Fig fragrance, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, if it would be nice and not too fake smelling.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the almond mint either.  So I opted for the spring gardenia green tea, I do like gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is really nice, just what I would expect it to be.  So I suppose I can now order the other two fragrances without fear.&lt;br /&gt;Today I used the product for the first time. I have fallen in love.  I was skeptical for sure, but I hardly had to put any time into styling my hair.  I have a short style, where it&#x27;s longer in the front, but not long by any means.  And short styles often take a longer time to style. Especially when your hair has developed it&#x27;s own way of doing things over the years as mine has.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, again, I spent less time styling, my hair looks great, and I can&#x27;t wait till my next shampoo.  How corny is that?!?!</li>
            <li> I love being able to try the different scents without entering into a contract. Thanks for making it available to do that. I love the Gardenia scent, and the Wen shampoos are just SO GOOD! Great seller, item got here fast and exactly what I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> First of all I have long hair (down to my waist I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; tall) I start at the front and work to the ends. My only suggestion would be wash your hair the first time with your old shampoo, rinse your hair well, then apply WEN to your wet clean hair. After the first use just use WEN and nothing else. With my old shampoo and contioner it would take me any were from thirty minutes to a hour to comb my hair out after washing it but with WEN it takes five minutes or less. Just saving that much time is worth it. The scent is perfect not too strong or not too weak. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little greasy after I use this product. Smells great. Just my 2nd week using it so hoping my hair will start to respond better. It is a pricey for the product.</li>
            <li> very nice scent and did a nice job on my hair. It was softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> It came from United parcel service frozen and ruined. Delivered today whoever the person was knocked left my  package at my  door I retrieved  it . Excited to get to use it!  I opened it immediately and discovered it was not usable. Now do you want to replace it? If not : who do I complain to? Amazon or the parcel delivery service who brought it to me from you? I will await an answer from you. Completely FROZEN and separated when thawed. So I have a big glob of congealed mess and liquefied useless product.[[ASIN:B007HOCQVS WEN® Spring Gardenia Green Tea Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
            <li> my hair felt stiff and strawlike after using this stuff even though I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed.  It&#x27;s back to shampoo for me!</li>
            <li> I love wen products and when I saw gardenia I had to have it! It did not disappoint. Love the smell and always like the way wen makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift and was able to try it myself. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Worse stuff I ever used. Saw all the commercials and it just left my hair feeling greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair which right now is waist length, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps the frizz at bay and gives my curls a more noticiable definition.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and I like the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy after my hair dries.</li>
            <li> I love the way Wen cleansing conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable every day.  I usually use fig but I wanted to try something different.  Dont try this one it stinks.  After 2 uses I had to throw it away because of the smell.  It smells like a flower garden blooming and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Every since I tried it, I wont use anything else. I love gardenia so this was my choice. Im not fond of mint so i didnt bother with the basic scented versions.&lt;br /&gt;They also make a plain green tea which is more neutral. The key to making it work as described is COMBING HAIR WHILE ON HAIR AND WET. I do this in the shower but also hanging head over a big sink. The key is the combing then don&#x27;t rinse it out completely, just a bit and gently squeeze hair of excess water WITHOUT SLIDING HANDS DOWN HAIR. Squeeze at scalp release, move down lower and squeeze... continue. Gripping and squeezing all the way down from scalp to ends Ive found removed too much residual and can damage hair.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Wen Almond Mint, and haven&#x27;t liked some of the other scents or the way my hair feels, but this one works very well for me and smells wonderful!! My hair is super soft.  I have very long, very dry hair that I wash, dry and curl every day.  This product keeps my hair so healthy that it seems like it grows longer simply because it doesn&#x27;t break as much.  My hair is so great even air drying, and my natural waves curl perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use VERY expensive salon formulas, and having this 1 product, I actually save money.</li>
            <li> Have had many of problems with perms , hair sprays and shampoo.  Just finally gave up but you can not do that needless to say with cleaning your hair.  Finally found something that did not give me drastic reactions but still had a itchy and flakey condition going on....much worse as I got older.  Now I am 73 and finally have something that makes my hair feel great and no itchy scalp or dry flakes on my dark colored clothes!!!  My grand kids were impressed too that this old lady orders her hair cleaner/conditioner ONLINE !!!</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that I usually don&#x27;t care about packaging.  But in this case, the packaging literally caused me to throw out the last portion of the product!&lt;br /&gt;The Wen cleansing conditioner works great on my hair.  I have somewhat thick, wavy hair, and after a few uses I could tell it wasn&#x27;t as frizzed out as it would be when using regular shampoo and conditioner.  Plus the gardenia scent with a hint of menthol is quite heavenly.  Every time I used it, I felt like I was pampering my hair and scalp.  But after about 5 or 6 straight days of using just Wen, my hair felt like it needed a break.  Once I shampooed and conditioned normally, just once, I was ready to go back to Wen.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use something like 16 pumps for my longish hair!  Uh, no.  I only used 8 pumps each washing, at most, and had good results.  I never used 16 pumps, because after paying about $35 for this one bottle, I felt that was excessive.  16 pumps of cleansing conditioner would&#x27;ve been overkill and a waste of cash.&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging, it worked fine until I got to the very last two or three applications, which turned out to be about 1/5 of the bottle.  The pump stopped working altogether, due to what I will call the Slushie Effect - you know, when you get down to the last little bit of your shake or slushie and the straw doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  Instead of sucking the stuff up into the straw, it just creates a hole so you have to move the straw around to get more slushie.  Well, you can&#x27;t move the pump around like that, so I ended up having to turn the bottle over and bang it against my shower wall like a ketchup bottle in order to get the rest of it out.  At a certain point I got too frustrated to keep doing it and threw the rest of it out.  This really needs to be in a squeeze bottle that you can set upside-down.&lt;br /&gt;I also take away points because I get the impression that Wen or the distributors of Wen don&#x27;t invest in customer care.  After reading several reviews about customers going through the official distribution club and getting signed up for stuff they never agreed to, I decided to look at Amazon and Ebay.  That, in addition to application recommendation and the poorly conceived packaging, is why I would not buy this again unless it was closer to $10.s about customers going through the official distribution club and getting signed up for stuff they never agreed to, I decided to look at Amazon and Ebay.

            <li> I love the wen cleansing conditioner I use it by it&#x27;s self with no other shampoo or anything and it has made my hair look and feel way healthier then any other shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners that I have tried</li>
            <li> Hair is sticky and heavy.  There is no value to the hight cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I like Wen products.  I have been using them for over a year.  I wanted to try the Gardenia Tea to see if I liked it as much as I do the Lavender.  I prefer the Lavendar.</li>
            <li> This is nice its smells good  it does make your hair smooth and shinny.  If you like gardenias you will like this.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of Wen,  Always looking for new scents - this one is great!  As always with WEN, my hair is soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  I had been using Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner, which I love.  I thought I&#x27;d give Wen a try.  I have medium fine hair, but a lot of it, and highlights.  Wen felt good in the shower but left my hair dry, kinda stiff and lifeless.  I switched back to my Moroccan, much better.  Then I gave Wen a try again but with no better results.  I would return it had I not missed the return window date.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my long thick hair and who would use 20 to 30 pumps like the bottle states.....hair felt dry, I will stick to Loreal for 6.00 which is sulfate free also.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and have used it twice.  My hair is medium length, 3 inches below the shoulders.  It tends to be dry.  I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen a major difference - my hair may feel slightly less dry than before (maybe?).  There&#x27;s no noticeable increase in volume and I still have the same amount of flyaways.  I use the same amount of non-Wen hair product.  The scent is nice and subtle - more of a grassy floral than medicinal.  I plan on finishing the bottle and hoping my hair gets softer, less frizzy, and whatever else the infomercial proclaims.</li>
            <li> After reading over and over about how bad it is to wash your hair daily I decided to switch to the WEN cleansing conditioner.  I have very fine hair and naturally oily skin - which can be a blessing in the dry climate I live in but makes it impossible to skip a shampoo without my hair feeling greasy.  I switched exclusively to WEN but found that after two or three days my hair started to look greasy again.  By the end of the week I decided that moderation was called for.  Now I alternate daily between the WEN conditioner and a sulfate free shampoo.  My hair never feels greasy and it does look much healthier, shinier and stronger.  If your find that using WEN exclusively isn&#x27;t working for your hair type I highly recommend using it every other day and seeing if that works.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Wen product so far (I&#x27;ve also used the fig &amp; the lavender). It just smells like gardenia &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that slightly medicinal smell &amp; tingly quality some of the other ones have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using Wen my hair started getting greasy around day 4-5 and I went back to regular shampoo, but I think that&#x27;s just a threshold you have to break through as your hair adjusts. Now I use it every day and never feel like I need to use regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for people with thick hair, but I have fine, long hair (to mid-back) and I only ever use 6-7 pumps total and it works great. I wet my hair &amp; get 4-5 pumps and spread it evenly over the hair around my scalp and spend a few minutes massaging it into the roots. Then I very quickly get the top of my head under the shower to add just a little water and massage my scalp/roots some more. Then I just grab two more pumps and spread it over the rest of my hair and then comb it all through with a pic comb &amp; let it sit while I do the rest of my showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year &amp; been able to grow my hair longer than in the past because it&#x27;s staying healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s not too bad if you don&#x27;t fall for the 24+ pumps per wash b.s.</li>
            <li> I have handfuls of hair falling out.  Are you aware there are numerous reports of women with similar experiences?  There is a class action lawsuit due to this harming people.  It&#x27;s not a seller issue it is a product quality issue.</li>
            <li> I always heard of wen so finally I gave in and bought it. I have curly hair and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. it was like a conditioner but didn&#x27;t make my hair any better. Also, if you have long hair you need a lot of it and it is quite expensive. Maybe it works fr other people, it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me</li>
            <li> I live in New Mexico and the hard water kills your hair. Even with a softener. Shampoo, no matter how mild, just stripps it worst. A cleansing conditioner seemed like a no brainer once I found out about it, it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am 50 ish lady with professionally color treated shoulder length hair . It is in excellent condition. I&#x27;ve always used a color treated shampoo and conditioner every day. I have no issues with dryness, itching, split ends or sparseness. I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials, you tube reviews and Amazon reviews. I was curious, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s been one month. I&#x27;m not sold. First of all, the amount of product recommended in the directions is ludicrous.Beware, before you buy this product, go on the Wen website and read the directions. I found  the 12-15 pumps per section of the head absolutely unnecessary That equals 48-30 pumps per cleansing. That also would lead to 1-2  bottle per month- no way! $60.00/ month for shampoo- positively no way! Secondly, the product left my hair flat and with less body. I&#x27;d rather use my regular color-treated shampoo and perhaps more conditioner if necessary. Third, my scalp is now itchy. I was not like that before Wen. I&#x27;ve tried Wen and I can honestly say I would not recommend it. Spend your money on a quality shampoo and conditioner recommended by a professional stylist. You&#x27;ll find your money will be spent on products that are more satisfying.  Next time you see a Wen commercial, turn the channel!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and loved it however this is a new fragrance for me and I love it.  It smells really good, I love this product it makes my hair fuller and really makes it shine and look healthy too.  Love this green tea smells great !!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I love the way my hair has more volume and really takes hair care to the next level. Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product and after speaking with several other family members and friends; they too were not real impressed. For me personally; due to contaminated water in my area, etc...I don&#x27;t think this product had a chance to work properly. I also have skin allergies, and there was something in the one that I ordered that did not agree with my scalp. So keep that in mind when you order if you suffer from certain allergies.</li>
            <li> This is not good for blonde thin hair at all I lost half my length as soon as I quit using it my hair started growing back to the length it was I lost eight inches of growth I was mortified cuz I really liked the product</li>
            <li> This scent is the most enticing of all of the WEN products I have tried.  Definately my favorite, I am a WEN user for life!</li>
            <li> WEN has wonderful hair products!!  They make my hair look and smell marvelous.  It cuts down on the time in the shower too since it is cleansing and conditioning in one product.</li>
            <li> After seeing the infomercials for about a year, I decided to try Wen Cleansing Conditioner out  of sheer curiosity. Truly, I didn&#x27;t expect much. I surely didn&#x27;t anticipate I&#x27;d quickly love it. Well, one year and 5 or 6 bottles later I&#x27;m writing this 5 star review and reordering the product. I&#x27;d started using products recommended by my hairdresser for dry- color treated hair...all great product but after a few months I&#x27;d have to change to another product line. My hair would become hard to manage, my ends split &amp; the color faded. Since using Wen I just don&#x27;t have any of those issues. I actually went 6 or 7 months without needing a cut or highlights. When I last saw my stylist, &amp; before she knew I used Wen, she commented about how great my hair looked &amp; told me to keep doing what I was doing. I adjusted to the suds&#x27;less creamy feel after the first couple of uses. No longer do I have to clutter the shelves with bottles of shampoo and separate conditioner...I just keep my one bottle of wen handy. My hair loves this stuff and looks &amp;#34;shiney &amp; manageable&amp;#34; (words I haven&#x27;t applied to my hair in decades). I have shoulder length hair &amp; use on average one 16 oz bottle every 8 to 10 weeks...that&#x27;s with daily shampooing. My hairdresser visits are about half what they were. I&#x27;m saving time, money AND my hair is better than ever so I guess that makes me a WEN GIRL!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product and my favorite scent. It&#x27;s very floral and feminine and gives my very dry hair a much needed moisture boost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle age bi-racial woman with thin hair and I absolutely love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair frizz free and full of body that last all day.  Love the different scents that this shampoo offers.</li>
            <li> This is ok. I found the cheapest price through this vendor. i would not buy it again. I just wanted to try it to see what the excitement was all about. It does not make a difference in my hair.It did not make it worse.</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in Wen cleansing conditioner! I have always loved the way my hair looks and feels after use. I have completely discontinued my use of shampoo altogether. I have very dry, frizzy hair naturally. So for me, Wen calms my hair down significantly and makes it look like it was handled by a professional every day! I love it. Totally worth the price considering it really does last you a while and nothing else beats it! The fragrance of the Spring Gardenia &amp; Green Tea is very nice. It&#x27;s natural and not overpowering. Good for men or women.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all the Wen products, but this one smells awesome!  I have naturally curly hair and this one really helps bring body and bounce to them!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of the Wen hair care line. Love to use this as a conditioner. I use shampoo first (any will do, even just using baking soda for my roots to soak up scalp oils). Living in a high humidity climate, it&#x27;s great for keeping the frizz at bay and is a great base for styling. Rinse out well and your hair will be so soft!</li>
            <li> I received this seasonal version of Wen cleansing conditioner yesterday and although I haven&#x27;t used it yet, it smells very-very good. Its by far my favourite Wen Cleansing Conditioner and I&#x27;ve tried them all. The scent reminds me of perfume, flowery, fresh, spring-ish. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the summer version of Wen will smell like.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, softer and much more manageable.  I am finding I am using less of this product than shampoo in the past.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would clean my hair, but it does.  I haven&#x27;t used shampoo since I started using Wen.  Not as fragrant as I had hoped, but a good product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just expensive.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s has Hair One in several varieties (color-treated, dry, etc.) that gives you an entire litre for less than this price for a counterfeit product sold here. Heed the warning from &#x27;Fake&#x27; - check the label and compare ingredients, check the packaging also.</li>
            <li> loved the way my hair felt after using it.  it is hard to get use to know suds but it really does work</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I will warn though when they say use a certain amount of pumps - try less first. When I use what they suggest my hair is way to heavy and can not style. It does leave my hair looking healthier. I have thin hair so maybe that is why I need to use less.</li>
            <li> excellent product you have never used anything like this before a little pricey but well worth the investment buy it now</li>
            <li> wen is amazing, obviously. i am only commenting on this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one is by far my absolute favorite! floral without being tres flores, it&#x27;s so light and wonderful. it smells like a nap in the late morning of a perfect spring saturday snuggled in clean sheets with the curtains gently blowing in the breeze and the sound of a small brook tinkling by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i. LOVE! it.</li>
            <li> I have used several other hair cleansers before, but this one smells so good and leaves my hair so soft.  I&#x27;m hesitant to recommend it only because then the supply will be lower for me to get LOL.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  It made my hair so brittle that when I combed it while it was wet, I was unknowingly snapping off hairs close to my hairline at about 2-5 inches from the scalp.  I look like I have frizzy hair no matter how much product I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product acts much more like a conditioner than a shampoo.  With a few days of use, your hair loses its body, gets oilier and oilier, and builds up an icky layer of cells on the scalp that you have to wash away with &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the infomercials, this stuff is crap and it&#x27;s not going to &amp;#34;revolutionize&amp;#34; anything.  Otherwise every store brand of shampoo would be offering something like this.</li>
            <li> It smelled nicely but really it was like using a heavy conditioner only.  Not for me and it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love all the Wen cleansing conditioners, but so far this is my favorite. I have used Wen for 6 years</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, decided to give this product a try. Doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair and I will not purchase WEN products in the future. Followed directions listed on product and my hair did not feel clean. Product actually made my hair feel coarse which was a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling silky and tangle free. I would purchase it again. You do not need to use a lot to get great results.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this product left it feeling very weighed down and heavy.  However, I can imagine if I had thick hair, it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves the fragrance and all wen products works well.</li>
            <li> It tends to strip the color from my hair.  It cleans well enough if you leave it on long enough and rinse it long enough.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.  The smell is just ok.</li>
            <li> Love this product, My hair has never felt so great !!!!</li>
            <li> Product works and keeps my hair clean and without the frizz. A big plus in my book. I purchased he Rasberry mint hoping for the same results with different scent, however my hair felt dryer and less mangeable. Stick to what works- will purchase this going forward. Also, I find I spend less and get better quality- who knew ;)</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but will stick to the lavender one instead since this one is only a special that no longer is available.</li>
            <li> Its not different then using just a conditioner as i use to do that. It also keeps the hair dirty so if you used it few times and then toy use real shampoo you will see how much dirt comes out from your heir. Its great marketing, mad product. I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t work any worse than my $3 drugstore shampoo and conditioner, I also didn&#x27;t see it work any better. I saw some reviewers raved about this scent; it wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and Lavender scents much better.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t lather quite well unless I washed my hair first. The scent wore off, but kept my less washable.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Continue to rave about it to everyone. I am almost stockpiling it as to make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> Not really  happy with the result of this product ,my was really really dry after using it , not going to try again</li>
            <li> I love wen hair products. I just wish the gardena smelled better than it does. I wanted a good smelling product and a good healthy product.</li>
            <li> Dove ultra moisture shampoo and conditioner or Trader Joe&#x27;s Argan Oil moisturize comparably if not better and without the ridiculous price.  Takes a long time to arrive once ordered.  Not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Between QVC and TV ads this product has been so overhyped its ridiculous.  If you are to believe QVC when Dean appears with models; he claims after one shampoo your hair is vastly improved.  Wrong.  First of all, recommended amount to use is ten pumps worth of this stuff, followed directions and saw absolutely no improvement in my overall hair condition.  Its pretty expensive too for all the hype.  Dont waste your money buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> i have coarse, curly hair that is unmanageable &amp; more than not, frizzy. Not to mention my have lots of problems with dry scalp. I like to dye my hair. I was hoping this product would help repair some of the damage to both my hair &amp; scalp. At first it seemed pretty good even though the smell wasn&#x27;t really pleasant. Although my hair seemed shinier at first &amp; had a definite reduction in frizz, it didn&#x27;t really seem to be helping make my hair more pliable and my ends still seemed dry most of the time. I recently switched to a different cleansing conditioner from another company &amp; I like it much better. If you have curly hair, do yourself a favor &amp; skip trying a bunch of costly products. Just go straight for the Ouidad. Since I switched to Ouidad my hair has been healthier as well as silkier. I use the low suds solution twice a week &amp; my hair stays clean, always smells good &amp; is softer than I can recall it being in years even without the application of heat. My curls are fuller &amp; smoother &amp; my straight styles last longer.</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....I bought some as a gift also</li>
            <li> I love wen. It makes my hair feel soft and silky.  Gardenia is a great smell for a shampoo.  My hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Had seen Wen commercials and always wanted to try the shampoo/conditioner without being sent monthly supplies.  I really like the way it leaves my hair shiny and feeling conditioned.  Seems gentle on my dyed hair also.  I don&#x27;t have to shampoo daily anymore.  I am sensitive to perfumes and have no problems with this purchase.  Would recommend WEN to others, although you have to consider it&#x27;s nothing like regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great. Expected more for the price!</li>
            <li> I have been buying WEN cleansing conditioners for a few years now and I really love them.  My hair feels very clean and looks shiny after using these conditioners.  They are also great detanglers as well.  I also really like the fragrance of the Spring Gardenia Green Tea.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I find it a bit heavy on my hair, so I use less than recommended.  I will also wash with shampoo a few times a week and then use this as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews and watching the infomercial, I tried WEN.  I don&#x27;t know if it had to do with the dry climate I live in or what, but after several uses, I have never had more dry, static, fly-away hair.  I followed the instructions and tried to use some of the advice I read in several reviews, but sadly I had to return it.  One plus was it was easy to return and my money was promptly refunded.  I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> This bottle came packed in it&#x27;s own WEN product box, which is not how other sellers send it.  It&#x27;s usually just a bottle and a separate pump, but this seller had the bottle in it&#x27;s own display box which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the WEN products because I can actually wake up in the morning with my hair looking as nice as it did before I went to bed even if I toss and turn while sleeping. There&#x27;s no weird bed head.  I have long hair, somewhat fine and color treated/highlighted and without WEN it&#x27;s very dry and brittle despite regular use of conditioning treatments and masks.  With WEN I don&#x27;t bother with other hair treatments and my hair stylist remarks on how healthy my hair is.  She used to complain that my hair was too dry and damaged and that I shouldn&#x27;t keep getting it highlighted.  Now she has nothing but positive things to say (and she can&#x27;t justify pushing products and services on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was also very easily tangled and I&#x27;d need to spray in detangler after a shower.  I don&#x27;t need to do that by using WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do periodically shampoo with regular shampoo (maybe once every couple weeks), but that&#x27;s only if I feel like my hair is really dirty from a recent workout or something.  I don&#x27;t know if it needs it, so it could just be a psychological thing to need to feel the suds if I know my hair&#x27;s full of sweat and ocean water, etc.  However, after washing with shampoo, even if I follow with conditioner, my hair feels dry like straw and I can&#x27;t wait to get back to using WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fragrance on the Spring Gardenia Green Tea is nice.  The standard sweet almond mint and any of the other &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; fragrances have such an awful medicinal smell that I won&#x27;t use them no matter how nice the product is.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have colored hair. Leaves my hair clean and soft, without needing conditioner. I like also that my hair when it dries feel more &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34;, not flying al over the place.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Did they change the formula or something?  When I first bought Wen, years ago, my hair looked fabulous after using it.  Now, it&#x27;s just eh.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the cost.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me.  The fragrance is lovely, though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! Amazing and incredible! What a transformation.  So many compliments , even from my hair stylist !</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking i&#x27;d get a little bit of a deal since it&#x27;s really not that much cheaper than the REAL Wen.  I received my order yesterday and immediately noticed a difference as the 16oz bottle was a different size than my REAL Wen 16oz bottle. This one was a bit taller.  I thought it was weird and decided to compare the two side by side.  I found the font was a tad different, the back labeling had differences and sure enough the ingredients were different.  I checked the bottom of the bottle and this FAKE one did not have wen sketched into the actual bottom like the REAL one did.  I immediately called Amazon and reported it.  I will be sending it back today to get a refund.  I feel bad for all the rest of the people who paid good money for this cheap quality copy cat and got ripped off without even knowing it.</li>
            <li> Not right for my hair type no body ,limp scent goes away fast,expensive won&#x27;t buy this kind again, looking for alternative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used twice so far and cannot believe the immediate effects of this product! I have long color treated hair that I straighten daily. Prior to using Wen, my hair felt like straw! So happy I&#x27;m dumping all of my remaining shampoos and conditioners in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo again! And it smells wonderfully! I color and highlight my hair a lot and this product is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT I LIKE WEN REGARDLESS OF WHICH CLEANSING CONDITIONER I PURCHASE!!!  THEY ARE ALL FANTASTIC ON MY HAIR...LOVE THEM ALL!! MY HAIR IS BRIGHT, MY COLOR LASTS LONGER...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love WEN products and I would say this has become a favorite of mine for this summer.  The product is fantastic not to mention the soft scent of gardenia that lingers in your hair after rinsing, but not overpowering that it will interfer with your favorite fragrance.  I would definately purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Love WEN products.  Love to try the difference fragrances but can be expensive so I look for sale items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair torture-aholic I love to do dramatic color... I wash everyday I blow dry...I straighten.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me I was convinced I would hate it but I read on a blog that it helped a girls hair grow and become more healthy.boom. Impulse buy.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine quasi wavy not the sexy kind the &amp;#34;did you sleep weird last night.&amp;#34; Kind(hence the straightener)&lt;br /&gt;So I use it and immediately noticed dang girl.. A little more volume but the most noticeable was how soft it is!&lt;br /&gt;Usually I have to use Moroccan oil as well before I dry my hair to make it look more lush.&lt;br /&gt;If your reading these reviews you already sorta want it..buy it.. Do it.</li>
            <li> I ordered in August and immediately saw a difference.  My hair had changed from normal to too dry.  My hair fell out.  My hair is no longer dry and is now normal again.  My husband supports the cost because he definitely sees a difference!  Thank you!  I only need about 6-7 pumps for shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it was not worth the cost. First couple days were fine, but after two days, my hair just felt too heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I Love this shampoo!! I have used for years and I will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner!! ❤️</li>
            <li> Great for summer humidity.  My hairs is not so dry or frizzy.  Love the fragrance and how my hair feels.  I think I am a follower!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a year and I just love it... it is great on curly hair.  My hair is never dry..</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; thick consistency. Scent is fantastic. The gardenia &amp; the green tea scent mixed together is a very unique scent. Definitely on the stronger side- if you prefer a lighter scent, the Sweet Almont Mint is the way to go.</li>
            <li> has helped my hair stay in shape  from damage from bleaching it. I have referred many of my client to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love WEN products.  These products are a little pricey but they are fabulous.  My hair feels so amazing when I use this.  Must try these products to see how wonderful they are.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Wen is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and my hair looks good and feels silky.  Sent it to my daughter and she is now a Wen user!</li>
            <li> It just was ok. Not like the other seasonal conditioners.  Left my hair not as soft as the others. Looking forward to getting another season.</li>
            <li> It works. Could take it or leave it. Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything better or worse than Nioxin or Axe</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I find Wen years ago? My hair looks and feels so much better after using Wen. This isn&#x27;t my favorite fragrance but it is nice.</li>
            <li> I do like this one. Overall, I love Wen cleansing conditioner. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I have tried almost all of the different scents, and this is my favorite so far. If you like Wen, this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It is very different than any other shampoo I have tried. When the shampoo is used there are no suds, weird but effective. Me hair color has remained the same for the last 3 months and I believe the shampoo is the reason. The smell is yummy.</li>
            <li> my wife and daughter love this product.. The sent is very appealing and leaves a nice fragrance in the hair.. would buy again</li>
            <li> I try all of the WEN types and this one is not the best. I LOVE Gardenia and thought I would love this as well but the way my hair feels after using it is not as good as other versions of WEN. This one leaves my hair feeling kinda dry and brittle</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that helps with the frizzy curly hair.  It makes it manageable and I love that It&#x27;s both a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. I will be ordering this one again. My hair is always so soft after using WEN products.</li>
            <li> Essential for shiny full hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but the first time for the Gardenia Green Tea, and it&#x27;s not as good as the original.  My hair needs moisture, I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair, like Hispanic women, but not Hispanic, my hair needs moisture and this product didn&#x27;t supply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought the Original and I&#x27;m sticking with it. Wen&#x27;s a great product, this one just didn&#x27;t do for me what I need to be done.</li>
            <li> I am 66 with color treated, thinning &amp; very fine hair texture.  It was always a problem getting it to style nice.  My daughter bought me some Wen for Mother&#x27;s Day to try, and I&#x27;m loving it.  After six months of using it, my hair looks healthier than it ever has.  She also got me the comb to run it through the ends and let it condition while scrubbing on the scalp.  Love the smell of the gardenia green tea product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have fine hair but a lot of it .  Works great for my hair . It takes getting used to since it does not &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;up , but the end result is wonderful. My hair is so healthy now . It costs more but worth it !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and I&#x27;ve tried practically all of the Wen varieties.  I have long, thin, baby fine hair and this stuff works for me.  i also have sensitive skin, and some hair products cause me to break out at the hairline.  This does not, and therefore, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Could be too strong for some.</li>
            <li> Heavy weighted product. Hair is dull and heavy. Fragrance is extremely light. Hair does not feel clean. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The smell to this bottle is unbelievable!!!!  I LOVE IT.  I have waiting for this scent to come out in the gallon bottles.</li>
            <li> Love WEN products, appreciate the availability on line &amp; reasonable price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I love all Wen products!  Gardenia stands out for me.  This has a light, floral scent with a bit if exoticness to it.</li>
            <li> The product is what I ordered. Nice to not have to order the entire kit.</li>
            <li> Love the new scent, Spring Gardenia Green Tea!!! And just love Wen all together. No more harsh detergents, chemicals in my hair. No more dry, lifeless hair. Yay! It is the fountain of youth for hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I was able to find what I needed on Amazon without having to deal with a monthly membership that makes you buy 3 or more products at a time to get a discount. I had the Wen membership for 2-3 years &amp; finally decided to just buy on a as needed basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the seller!</li>
            <li> Great product overall, but can not continually use it, and IT only. I have thin hair so it was awesome for about 3 days, then my hair started loosing volume &amp; almost got greasy looking. I use it a couple times a week, but still need to switch to different shampoos to give my hair what it needs.&lt;br /&gt;Just my experience...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a forever WEN fan now!</li>
            <li> Both times I have used this product I ended up itching like i had bugs like crazy hard to get used to no lather</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It leaves your hair so clean and manageable. It is worth every single penny. Also, great as a leave in.</li>
            <li> I Love wen. Really cleans hair with no lather, all while leaving it smooth and hydrated. I suggest you try it once.</li>
            <li> I just cant say enough good things about Wen products! This one smells so sweet and definitely gets me ready for spring!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this fragrance since Gardenia can be such a strong floral smell. But I took a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s very light. It&#x27;s not heavy on the floral, nor on the green tea. It just smells fresh and clean. And, of course, it works great like others in the line. My hair is very fine and curly. There are a few types of Wen that seem to work better than others (the Fig is fantastic, but the Sweet Almond Mint? Not so much), and this one works great for me! It&#x27;s my new favorite. I hope this fragrance becomes a permanent addition and not just a seasonal thing.</li>
            <li> Have tried several scents this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> WEN shampoo has changed my life.  I have extremely curly, thick and coarse hair.  I used to use multiple produts in the shower, multiple products on my wet hair and then more products on my dry hair in order to try and tame the frizz.  My mother in law bought me some lavender Wen to try because she loved it so much.  I feel in love with it as soon as I tried it.  I have never been able to wash my hair and let it air dry- and now not only can I but my hair looks better than ever.  The only complaint I ever had was that the smell is a little strong (like eucalyptus or someting) for my taste, the gardenia version of this product is the answer to my prayers.  Smells and works amazing!  If you have hair that is difficult to work with wen makes such a huge difference!</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE the smell of this product. Second, a little goes a long way. When I read the instructions that said 10 to 20 pumps for my length of hair I thought \\&quot;this is going to disappear fast\\&quot;. After following the instructions I found that while my hair was super soft, it always looked greasy at the roots. Even after really massaging the roots and rinsing multiple times. In the end I have slightly modified the product. I add about a nickel sized dollop of Pantene Shampoo to 5 pumps of the conditioner for a single treatment. My hair is clean, shiny, and bouncy for up to 4 days without having to wash it again (even with daily trips to the gym). That&#x27;s alot better than the daily to every other day I was washing it before Wen. I highly recommend this product. Give it a try the traditional way first. It may just be my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the sweet almond mint a while ago and after several washes my hair felt weighed down.  I couldn&#x27;t handle using it as intended and wound up using the rest just as a conditioner and didn&#x27;t reorder.  My hair was feeling really dry from coloring so I decided to give Wen a try again.  First I have to comment on the smell of the Spring Gardenia Green Tea.  To me it has an overwhelming menthol smell with a floral undertone, I think it would be better the other way around.  It&#x27;s even worse once its on your head as opposed to sniffing it from the bottle.  It gives an Icey/Hot sensation to your scalp and during my shower it kind of burns my eyes and makes my nose itch.  It will however open your sinuses right up!  I read somewhere that someone uses his CC as a face wash &amp; makeup remover - I can&#x27;t imagine putting this stuff straight on my face, especially the eyes!  After using it for a few weeks my head is starting to itch...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the hair.  It does seem like my color is lasting longer and my hair does feel softer.  This time it hasnt gotten that weighed down feeling and I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in a couple weeks.  I don&#x27;t use quite as much as recommended (I do about 16 pumps for just below should length hair), scrub scalp vigorously with fingerpads (NOT nails) and I add enough water to make it frothy, then clip it up and rinse THOROUGHLY at end of shower.  I sometimes add a half pump to the middle-to-ends of the back of my hair; not to roots.  This seems to be working for me.  I think its a matter of figuring out what works for you.  It is expensive and 16oz doesn&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;m almost finished my 16 oz bottle and I&#x27;ve had it almost 3 weeks.  But some of you might think it&#x27;s lasting me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the 613.  That has a really yummy smell.  Very light lemon rosemary vanillabean; none of the scents distinct but a very nice combination.  Not an everwhelming sweet vanilla, the lemon gives it a crisp clean scent.  It too has a little of the menthol scent but nothing like the Gardenia Green Tea.  I&#x27;m waiting to finish the Gardenia before I start using the 613.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my 3 yr old daughter who has loose natural curls.  It makes her hair shiney and boosts the ringlets when I add a touch as leave in conditioner.  And I have to say again, it smells really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase the Gardenia Green Tea again, especially now that my head is itching.  But I probably will get the 613 again.  I&#x27;ll write another review on the 613 once I start using it on my own hair tomorrow since my head is really itching...</li>
            <li> Love it!  My hair is fine and tangles easily.  After using WEN my hair has less breakage.  It keeps my hair clean, conditioned, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> there are too many steps to the process &#x3D; not happy</li>
            <li> Meh, made my hair feel gross, and I was really disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of WEN products now for about three years. The improvements they have made are outstanding and leads me to believe that Chaz does listen to what his users say, and makes efforts to improve his products, and I like that and am most impressed.. From past reviews, you know I am an avid WEN lover! the only problem I ever found was with the scents. Some are just,well a little to earthy, a little too natural if that can make any sense. But when my hair is dry, I don&#x27;t want it to smell anything but sweet and fragrant.. The Gardenia Green Tea does just that!!!! it goes on smelling good and drys smelling good A++++++ in my book!!!  For those of you unfamiliar with WEN products, I have tried every scent.  Although really made for all hair types, I found some favorites I felt just did a better job at managing my hair or the shine factor, but they all work GREAT!and Spring Gardenia is the icing on the cake as it smells so wonderful!Going back to regular shampoo, even the newer ones that are sulpher free, is not an option!! If you have never tried a WEN product, I highly recommend any of the scents!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is OK but in between one needs to use regular shampoo because it does not get the scalp clean.  It&#x27;s great for a great conditioning wash, though.  I wash my long hair every 3 days, sometimes more often.  It&#x27;s good for one time per week at most.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS. I HAVE NOT HAD THIS SCENT BUT KNOW IT WILL MADE MY HAIR SHINY AND SOFT. I HAVE BEEN USING WEN FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS AND WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE. MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY. NEED TO MAKE SURE USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT, ADD A LITTLE WATER AND LET SIT ON HAIR UNTIL YOU ARE DONE WASHING. THEN I RINSE AND ADD MORE PRODUCT UNTIL FOAMS UP AND RINSE.  THE MORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT THE BETTER YOUR FEELS AND LOOKS. MY DAUGHTER ALSO USES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love wen, so I wanted to try a new scent. I don&#x27;t like this scent personally. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite fragrance but the same great hair care all the same.</li>
            <li> i love every WEN product I&#x27;ve ever bought &amp; this one is no exception. Very strongly scented. Perfect for date night!!</li>
            <li> What can i say?  Wen has been what  I use for over 8 years. great hair cleanser and don&#x27;t need conditioner. and all thsoe toxic sulphates and parabens that cause disease and probably cancer are not commercially in there.  Chaz Dean is a real hairdresser for over 20 years, he formulated this  andam soooooooooo thankful.  vendor kept all promises, will use again</li>
            <li> Caused my scalp to develop cyst like large pimples. Smelled great but my after a month of use, scalp breakouts and my hair got super weighed down and oily. Ended up switching back to my old shampoo just to feel clean again and to stop the painful bumps. Wanted soo much to believe the infomercial but this product failed me.</li>
            <li> Gotta give it 3 stars because if you use it for a week it starts to leave a film on your hair. I usually use Loreal for color treated hair that is sulphate free. I typically wash my hair every other day (I&#x27;m caucasian with nearly waist length, thick and wavy hair). I was solely using this product, but had to go back to the Loreal shampoo and use this as the conditioner. It was just making my hair too greasy. I also have psoriasis in places on my scalp and just using this product made the psoriasis go buck wild! I now have it back under control with the Loreal. So, if you have really dry hair, then you might benefit from using this. If you have normal hair, then this product will most likely make it greasy after repeated use. The pros: it smells really good and makes your hair shiny. I also didn&#x27;t have any static in my hair when I solely used this. So, meh on this one. I&#x27;m gonna use it up as conditioner as it was so expensive. But I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a couple of years now, and I&#x27;ve used a multitude of scents. I have fine, thin, curly hair, and I noticed that the Gardenia Green Tea works the BEST! If you&#x27;ve read many of these reviews, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gathered by now that the different scents yield different results. I am partial to the lighter scents without the heavy oils since my hair is easily weighed down. Gardenia Green Tea &#x3D; Best Results, no frizz, soft, manageable, and I only need 5 pumps for my whole head. Ginger Pumpkin &#x3D; Next best results for the same reasons. Winter Vanilla Mint (name?) &#x3D; Works okay, but I found that my hair is a bit more frizzy unless I use more pumps. Pomegranete &#x3D; I stopped using this b/c it makes my hair frizzy no matter how many pumps I use. Almond Mint (original) &#x3D; Too heavy due to the almond oil. Coconut Mango &#x3D; Far too heavy due to the coconut oil. I&#x27;ve recommended the latter two to my friends with thick and/or hard to manage hair, and they have had wonderful results. DO NOT DESPAIR if one type doesn&#x27;t work for you! This product WILL work for you, just try to find the right one that works. It can be expensive having to test different scents, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Your hair will thank you for it! Gardenia Green Tea is the best for me!</li>
            <li> This WEN smells SOO good, it is by far my favorite scent. I have tried the Pomegranate and Mango Coconut as well. The Pomegranate, to me, doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell. The Mango Coconut is a great summer time smell but Gardenia is the best one!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and we will never go back to our original hair products again. My wife and I are stunned at how great our hair looks and feels. So much healthier. Especially because we have really hard water living in the city that we go through water softeners like babies go through bottles</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I am throwing out my old shampoos and conditioners! I can immediately tell the difference in my hair after only one use. I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower tomorrow :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not over impressed with this product but I do like the scent very much, it does make my hair less prone to static (mine gets really bad in cold winter weather) vs. regular shampoo and conditioners. Overall I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again though.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous for my thick wavy hair.  My hair is no longer dry or frizzy! I love it!</li>
            <li> WEN is a great product and this stuff smells amazing. I buy it in bulk so I always have some.</li>
            <li> As my other review of WEN I love and hate this product.  I use it then feel like my hair is oily, then go back. I have to say it smells the best of all I have tired.  My 7 year old loved the smell too.  Her hair has never been so shinny and soft it works great for her but she doesn&#x27;t wash her hair everyday like adults do.  Good for part time hair use in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this for about the past two months now and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in how much hair I shed. My drain doesn&#x27;t get clogged anymore and I have less shed hair in my brush. I am a natural curly African American woman and I can say with pride I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl! Detangling my hair is a breeze and my curls pop and my hair is shiny whenever I wear my hair curly. But the real miracle came when I straightened my hair. Normally it takes me 3 hours for me to straighten my curly hair, now it only takes me an hour and a half! I even noticed a difference in my hair when I went back to my regular condish when I was running out of my Wen. It&#x27;s softer, shiner, more definition, and the tangles melt away. With my straight hair, it has movement and I don&#x27;t have to blowdry my hair forever. If anyone wants to know if it works for black, natural hair, I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s the truth!</li>
            <li> I like it but you have to use so much it does not seem to be very cost efficient.  I&#x27;ve started using it to supplement my conditioner.  Works great for that.</li>
            <li> I love the new fragrance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, Spring Gardenia Green Tea and the Winter Vanilla Mint at the same time. This was the first time for me using the Wen product and was very excited to try them. They both smell amazing. Started with the Winter Vanilla Mint first, and used it 3 times. It did wonderful. Loved the way it made my hair feel and look. I have thick, straight hair down to the top of my bra and my hair always feels heavy, so I have to look for products that say weightless on them, The mint one made my hair feel really light and still had body. The gardenia on the other hand made it feel heavy, and kind of greasey. I have only used it once though so will try it again because I really like the smell. I think the winter mint will be my favorite so that only means they will discontinue it, that always happens to me. I am also planning on trying others in this line. I had read the reviews on the Wen line and wanted to try myself, loved being able to get it through Amazon, seems people either loved it or hated it, there were no in betweeners! I am satisified enough to try other scents and I am very particular about my hair products. Hope this helps someone wanting to jump in and try!</li>
            <li> first of all I love Wen cleansing products.  My hair is shiney and healthier.  The smell of the spring gardenia green tea is light and fresh smelling.  I get compliments all the time about how nice my hair smells.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected more..it seems okay but I&#x27;m still only half way through the bottle.  If it gets better I will update this review</li>
            <li> Great Conditioner -- remember this is not a shampoo so it&#x27;s not going to foam up like most shampoo products do. It makes your hair feel silky smooth but not dried out -- that&#x27;s what I like most about it. Oh yeah, and like everyone else said -- it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s just ok. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in fragrances so it&#x27;s funny this one is supposed to smell like gardenia because it smells like the original scent. I have thick hair that only requires washing once a week but with wen I have to wash more often and don&#x27;t notice enough of an improvement to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair cleanser. Works wonders on my granddaughter&#x27;s curly hair. My straight hair has more body and swing and feels so clean. Never gets that oily feeling first day afternoon. Wish I could find it discounted.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...Love all Wen Conditioners...I will be ordering more..Shasasipping was very fast...Packaging was very good. Cleansing Conditioner was exactly as described,</li>
            <li> Not so crazy about this product unfortunately. I followed the directions exactly as written and it just leaves my hair dull and limp. I&#x27;ve also tried using fewer pumps but no better. Disappointing considering the price tag.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but I was expecting it to make my hair a little more smooth then soft, I have long hair and I have to use 16 pumps for conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it...Smells great and makes my hair shiny and manageable. I would definitely recommend to others. I will never use regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s my favorite. I will make my decision once I&#x27;ve tried the Lavender. I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the scents now including almond mint, apple spice, spring gardenia, tee trea, summer mango coconut, winter cranberry, aloe cucumber, fig and pomegranate. I did not like the pomegranate at all! It made my hair dry like a broom. But I do like the spring-y scent that the spring gardenia leaves in my hair and I like the soft feeling it leaves. I cleanse with it, rinse with cool water and put one more pump as a leave in--as Wen does not get rid of frizz like they say they do. Some may wonder if Wen is even worth bothering over. I say yes, because before I started using it, my hair was very very thin, dull, flat, lifeless and broken all over. I got the dead ends trimmed when I began using Wen and I started taking Biotin (hair, skin n nail vitamin). PLUS, I stopped brushing my hair wet. So for any of you ladies who may be thinning, stop brushing your hair wet. Wide tooth comb only. See what a difference it makes. (I learned that from Wen too).&lt;br /&gt;In just about 8 months, my hair is over 50% thicker and 100% softer and easier to manage. Yes, I do have to use hairspray at the end to tame those little frizzies, but I love the feel of Wen when I&#x27;m cleansing my hair. I heard one girl say she would not try anything that doesn&#x27;t lather. I say, give it at least one try. But study the different scents and styles and see which one is best for you. Although I started with Almond mint, I wanted to try all the scents and see how/what they did to my hair. So far, this one is best. Like I said, I&#x27;m ordering Lavender next and will base my decision on how that goes. Summer mango coconut is great in the summer time, but I think that would get old month after month and wouldn&#x27;t fit in certain seasons.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d love to try winter mint, but cannot afford that one!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! This was recommended by my hair stylist because I was having trouble with dry , itchy scalp. I was using a cream shampoo( Argan oil) and I thought that was as good as it got. I used this today for the first time, the itch is gone  and my hair looks great. I have thick hair down to my shoulder blades. I used about 10 pumps, added some water, worked it through and let it sit for about 3 minutes. I used my regular conditioner and styling products.Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am a devoted WEN user, but  after two or three uses this formula makes my strands feel very waxy.  The pomegranate formula, which is my absolute favorite, does not leave the waxy and greasy feeling.  Since I hate to toss the gardenia because it&#x27;s so expensive, I mix it with the pomegranate to help cut back on the waxiness, and it does work better that way.  My hair is thick, fine, naturally wavy, and dyed.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this! I have very thick, fairly unruly hair and have never used a product that made my hair shiny and manageable until now. Not only does this work wonders on my hair, but helps manage the dry scalp I&#x27;ve had since moving to a desert climate. The first time I used it my husband was amazed and said it was worth every penny we spent on it. PLEASE KEEP THIS PRODUCT STOCKED!!</li>
            <li> My hair is to between my shoulder blades and very fine. My scalp used to be fairly oily after a day or two so my usual routine was to wash daily. Once I decided to get highlights, I had to space out washings to save my hair and my scalp adjusted. So now I usually wash my hair two to three times a week. I was worried about the negative reviews from other fine-haired women, but couldn&#x27;t resist trying! So I used 17 pumps and worked the shampoo through my hair--felt nice and luxurious, and I could feel my hair getting silky! Clipped it up and rinsed well with cool water (till it felt squeaky clean), then blew dry. I&#x27;d say my Frizzies were reduced about 80%, and there was no trace of heaviness nor oily residue. Just silky hair. I&#x27;ve used everything from Oribe ($45/bottle for shampoo and conditioner) to simple baking soda and vinegar (works well once in a while as a clarifier). I&#x27;m happy with Wen so far! I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of products to get my hair back to its pre-highlight silkiness and this product finally worked. I was even able to put a nickel-sized amount on my hair as a leave-in with no problems. So I think those having issues may have been washing their hair too often before or simply not using enough or rinsing enough. I&#x27;ve got some picky hair and this stuff works nicely.</li>
            <li> Heavier than other Wen conditioners... I think this might be a knock off...</li>
            <li> Not the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love WEN products! Great for my hair and with my allergies I thankfully have not had any issues :)</li>
            <li> The Wen shampoo/conditioner works as expected. I like Wen when I am not using Kerestase. However, there is NO  discernable gardenia smell to this so most likely I will not reorder. I was really hoping to smell gardenia as it is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite Wens so far, I have very thick, long hair, (think mixed chicks), and Wen is the only thing I use now, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wen was so fresh and fragrant it was like a summer breeze...I am also starting to use a little of the cleansing conditioner as leave in conditioner and that is working so well, smoothing my hair, controlling frizz and providing shine, I previously would have tangles no matter what I did and even combing my hair was challenging, it is now much more manageable, resists breaking, is soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without Wen, I am not sure what I would do I am so dependent on it now. Cannot wait for the next seasonal Wen to debut.</li>
            <li> I left a more detailed review on the lavender bottle...basically this product is a waste of money that will leave your hair oily and heavy.  Works ok as a conditioner, but terrible as a &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; conditioner.  Your money will be spent better elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get what I want when I want it.  I refused to sign up through Chaz Dean&#x27;s site because you have to do the autoship thing.  Amazon has made it possible for me to try new scents and formulas and not get stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of trying this product. I have wanted to try it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the monthly fee if you buy it from the tv ad. So I was thrilled when I saw that Amazon carries it. I know in the ad it says it doesn&#x27;t lather up and it really doesn&#x27;t. But my hair turned out so nice after I styled it. Very shiny and soft... I love this product and will buy again (from Amazon:-)</li>
            <li> I like the product although my hair didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with regular shampoo, am re-reading the directions again and possibly I did not follow them completely</li>
            <li> Since I first started using the Wen products, I haven&#x27;t stopped.  My hair is really fine, I live in adry climate and my daughter says she has never seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> I like these WEN cleansing conditioners that are free of the heavy oils. My reactive skin remains calm when I use this. My hair is softer &amp; shinier.</li>
            <li> The Wen products are great, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. The gardenia is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love wen  My hair is fine and I use curling iron every day. Wen keeps my ends from drying out.  Shine us inbelievable.  My friend has thick curly hair which is opposite of mine and her hair after using wen. Shines beautifully and is not frizzy at all.  Love this product</li>
            <li> By now I&#x27;ve used a  number of the Wen formulas and while overall I think it&#x27;s a super cool product, there are some Wen formulas more suited for different hair types.  This one, however, seems like one of the more nicely balanced ones for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m from the old school reasoning that it&#x27;s good to mix it up now and then.  Variety is the spice of life type thing and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells very feminine because of the Gardenia but its awfully good on the hair.  It&#x27;s really one of the cleaner Wen products that really moisturizes at an appropriate level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does err, it errs on the more moisturizing side than less like the Aloe/Cucumber one tends to do.  However, both of those formulas are great whereas the Winter Mint seems way over-the-top too moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mango Coconut is ok..just ok.  As an experiment, I did try mixing the Gardenia with the Mango/Coconut though and I must say my nose went right on vacation to the Hawai&#x27;ian islands.  Now that was kind of cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this one.  Nicely balanced...but if you are a man, keep in mind, it&#x27;s got a pretty/feminine scent.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Wen products and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  I wear my hair long and with Wen I don&#x27;t have broken hairs or split ends and my hair is beautifully conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite so far. Great smell and great results. I also use this for my Morky dog and it makes her hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ! Extremely happy with it and would recommend it to anyone. Made my hair feel wonderful and so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for a while and I&#x27;m going to keep using it! I recently used shampoo and conditioner and what a difference. I prefer the lavender or mint, gardenia isn&#x27;t as fragrant</li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t you using Wen yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that you really have to commit to it. You can&#x27;t just use it willy nilly whenever you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From experience it works much better when you use it twice a week maximum without washing in between. (Google the no-poo movement and you&#x27;ll see!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has really made my hair softer and shinier after 4-5 bleach and dye sessions in the last year, which I am so thankful for because my split ends are out of control.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this one when I smelled it - it smells nothing like gardenias and I can detect only the faintest hint of green tea. I thought maybe it was a knock-off and was not looking forward to using it. The texture is a bit different from the orange blossom (which smells much better) and the almond mint ones that I have. This has a sharp, almost household-cleaner-scent. That was disappointing, but I used it anyway and it is absolutely the most moisturizing of the three, almost too much so! I can&#x27;t complain about that though since I am trying to recover my hair from overuse of a curling iron and sun damage during the summer. I still like the orange blossom and rosemary mint best but this one is just fine and I will definitely use all of it. I just wish it smelled better, but the scent does not linger at all and I can barely smell it even in the shower while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the others, I only need 6-7 pumps as opposed to the recommended 16-20 pumps. My hair is fine and cut short with longer pieces in front, so it is ridiculous to slather so much on. I also don&#x27;t rinse for the recommended 2-3 minutes. I do not wash and rinse twice either. 1-1/2 minutes works out great for me. And instead putting another pump on my hair after rinsing, I simply take my comb which has some left on it after combing through in the shower and work it through my hair really well. Voila! Great hair. I also add some R &amp; B leave-in conditioner by LUSH on the dryer parts of my hair before blow-drying to give extra conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love WEN cleansing conditioner and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. Their texturizing product is great as well, gives good definition and oomph to my style without dryness or stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******* I had to amend my review, taking it from 4 stars down to 3. I have now used it 5 times and my hair just does not respond as well to this as to the Orange Blossom one. It feels greasy and dry at the same time. If I leave some in after rinsing, it is too greasy but dry at the same time. If I do not leave any in, my hair swells out like a mushroom. While I can get my hair to look pretty good by leaving some in, I hate the way it feels: someone else described her hair as feeling like lamb&#x27;s wool and that&#x27;s as good a descriptor as any. Soft and coarse at the same time &#x3D; weird! I will keep using it but thank goodness I still have some of the Orange Blossom and Almond Mint left to use. I especially love the Orange Blossom and that will be the one I stick to from now on *******r rinsing, it is too greasy but dry at the same time. If I do not leave any in, my hair swells out like a mushroom.

            <li> Favorite Wen formula- so happy to find it here.  Arrived quickly, works great. Thanks, very satisfied</li>
            <li> love love Wen doesn&#x27;t matter which one it is they are all great products.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it came without the pump from this seller. Should not be pictured with the pump!!!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of this product.  Does not have that medicinal or minty smell.  I think fragrance is very important in a hair product.</li>
            <li> I love this Wen conditioner. The Spring Gardenia Green Tea scent is light and fresh (light floral and minty). I feel like I&#x27;m having aromatherapy whenever I&#x27;m using this product. I use less pumps than recommended (6-7 pumps total; I clean with 3-3.5 pumps, rinse, then use another 3 pumps that I leave on while bathing and rinse off at the end).  My hair is medium/long length (3&amp;#34; below my shoulders) and highlighted regularly. I love how my hair feels and looks when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Love the smell and what it does for my hair. I hope to see it in beauty supply stores in America.</li>
            <li> Have been using Wen products for about a year and have tried several different types.  This is going to become my favorite.  My hair is curly and frizzy and this helps.  Still not getting the same results as show on QVC but think they have a stylist that does their hair for the promo.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product, it makes my hair soft, clean, and moisturized, it also has a nice floral scent, I still don&#x27;t know which one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stiff for my girlfriend.A little more costly than direct from WEN  but didn&#x27;t have to sign up for direct ship</li>
            <li> I am never going back to the regular shampoo and conditioner EVER again. I really, really love this stuff, esp. the Gardenia scent, I would buy this product again. It&#x27;s very much worth the price an goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just recently became a WEN gal. And I especially love this as a conditioner, and that is how I am using it. perfect for my thin flyaway grey hair.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks was great. than after that my haird began to feel gross, like a floiter left on it. than it became dried out not too happy about that</li>
            <li> I see a big difference in using thie product over regular shampoo.  Makes my hair really sily smooth.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been a Wen user for years, but had never tried this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  It is just scrumptious!  Get it!</li>
            <li> I was told by many firends about it and it really is as good as I was told.  I have recommended the product to eveyone that has commented on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was terrified this scent would be too flowery, but it was clean and fresh smelling instead! Works like the other WEN cleansing conditioners and I love it! Get one before they go out of season!</li>
            <li> I bought a 16oz bottle of Spring Gardenia Green Tea Cleansing Conditioner a few weeks ago and I really like it. My hair is thick and curly and was getting way too dry and I had to try something and this is the ticket! I use my regular highly humdifying shampoo and conditioner on Mondays and use Wen on Fridays and my hair is doing great! You have to use soooo much of the Wen, and it is quite expensive that I haven&#x27;t used it exclusively yet. BUT I will!</li>
            <li> my wife loves this product. it makes her hair more manageable. I don&#x27;t know what that means because to me her hair always looks great but if she loves this product it must be good.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN stuff. I&#x27;d try all the flavors to see what works best in your hair. My hair responds best to the Lavendar. However, just a note, it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy it from the Wen store online. They are always sending deals. Just sign up to receive them and BOOM! You can get a big discount.  This flavor smells good!</li>
            <li> Works very nice on straight, normal hair. Always buy this scent when it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> great value for money - product as described.</li>
            <li> The ultra BEST shampoo ever for those who have dry colored hair! i have long hair and i love this shampoo, you cannot go wrong with it, i use it a few times a week and i have seen much improvement. There is no other product that works as well! I have bought several different scents, this one is by far the best</li>
            <li> Item as advertised.  Would highly recommend.  Item arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Did NOT not come with a pump. Item description doesn&#x27;t say no pump and picture shows pump.</li>
            <li> I like it a great deal,  but so far my hair is not amazingly different or salon-esque. I think I&#x27;ll try it still, but add a bit of shampoo to my life. I miss  that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> After a full month of washing my color treated hair, it&#x27;s much softer, has a beautiful shine and my color has held. I typically have oily hair -scalp and the green tea has balanced that out.  I&#x27;ll contunue use and expand to other WEN products.</li>
            <li> I loved this product from the first time I used it. Leave me hair super smooth, and frizzless! I have tried many upscale haircare products, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li> heard about  this product--so thought I would  try it&lt;br /&gt;love  it&lt;br /&gt;a little different because it does not  suds&lt;br /&gt;but  gave  me  nice  clean  hair-will continue  to use  and  will buy  more</li>
            <li> I love Wen have been using it for nearly 2 years now, maybe more actually.  Love the smell of Gardenia also and it is so nice!</li>
            <li> actually, I haven&#x27;t met a WEN cleansing product that I haven&#x27;t liked. I have not tried this one yet, as I still have some of the pomegranate one left.. but I believe it will be great as all the others.</li>
            <li> I blindly recommend this to any one. Adore the fresh and flowery sent. Great creamy texture. Lives the hair shinny but not looking like you haven&#x27;t washed it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very handy to have a three in one! My hair always feels noticeably better after using this. It&#x27;s expensive, so I use this to repair the damage caused by the cheaper hair products I use more often.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it really works great, I would recommend it to my friends. I do have a problem with my hair getting oily some times with it... but then I cleanse with more the next time and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find exactly what I wanted and I was so happy when I received it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried the tea tree WEN and HATED the smell of it. It was still a great product and did its job, but the smell was so bad to me I couldn&#x27;t get over it. I used it all and then bought this one, the Gardenia Green Tea. It smells wonderful! I could bathe in this stuff. Like all the other WEN products this does not fail the test, it makes me hair feel a lot more alive, and it keeps the pink dye in my hair for a long time. Its no wonder miracle for hair but, it does make your hair a lot softer, and it moisturizes it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I *love* wen cleansing conditioner.  I am not brand loyal (I coupon- spending this kind of money on hair products goes against my frugal principles, but thankfully my job gives me amazon gift cards which I use to buy this) and have tried Hairone, L&#x27;oreal Evercream cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;ve tried co-washing, and nothing compares (queue sinead o&#x27;connor) to Wen, and my god, I wish something did.  This smell is phenomenal- my husband requests I shower at night instead of the morning so he can sleep smelling my hair, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> i have used various wen hair cleansers for well more than 5 years.  they are wonderful.  if the products were not so good i would have stopped using them in protest of the utterly ridiculous amount they suggest you use -- nobody, and i mean nobody needs up to 20 pumps per wash and nobody needs to do it a second time.  it borders on insult that they encourage the user to be so wasteful (both product-wise and financially).  this stuff is expensive and should be used sparingly (a half-dollar sized dollop is sufficient for below the ear hair).  and now they have employed marketing brilliance and created seasonal \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; -- those of us with limited attention spans are very excited to be using the mango cocoanut when lo and behold a gardenia-scented product has jumped onto the product line.  my massive container of cucumber aloe is missing me!  while i have yet to receive my recent order of the gardenia version i expect it will be just as good as both cucumber aloe and mango cocoanut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;i did receive the gardenia version and was a bit disappointed -- vague if almost indistinguishable scent of gardenia.  i&#x27;ll stick with the mango cocoanut!</li>
            <li> love the smell and this really makes my hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised that this product exceed my expectations!</li>
            <li> this could quickly become a standard for me.  fresh as spring time  with a nice clean smell.  please make it a standard.</li>
            <li> I have watched the commercials and wondered.  I finally bought some and I really like it.  It is easy to use.  I especially like how easily it rinses out.  The first time I tried it I followed the instructions and left some in as leave in conditioner.  It was too much.  I tried it again with less and it was better.  Then I tried it without and it was great!  The smell is heavenly - my dog came into the bathroom to see what smelled so good!</li>
            <li> Loved the fragrance of this Wen! However, it wasn&#x27;t the right formula for my hair. The lavender is perfect for my hair, the gardenia left my hair feeling heavy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for someone with drier, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try Wen. But in the end it works no better than other products ive used. The big difference is the price.  I will NEVER pay that much for any hair care product again. No matter what they promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first it made my curly very dry hair soft. Have to use so much it&#x27;s not worth it. Did not do miracles like I thought it would</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, particularly my roots. I guess it does make my hair soft though, so I&#x27;ll just use it as a conditioner and hold my nose while I use it, because at $30 a bottle now I feel like I have to use it even though I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is for me. I felt like I was cleansing my hair with a heavy cream rinse. My hair did have shine, it was manageable, however, it only lasted a day. I have short hair blonde hair, I am familiar with how much and how to use Wen, but I was not satisfied with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what they do on the infomercial, or on QVC to make the models look good it did not impress me…Some people love it; some people don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> Beware of ever contacting WEN directly...they will continue to charge you even after to attempt to cancel several times.  I had to cancel a credit card just to get out from under these scam artists.</li>
            <li> Not bad... but some1 told me the real wen has logo on bottom of bottles n ingredients are diff. But good for the price. N no alcohol</li>
            <li> Good product  love what it does for my hair.  Leaves your hair soft and easy to manage.  Smells great too</li>
            <li> No residue left behind. Hair never feels greasy even 1 or 2 days later. Shampoo and conditioner in a nice smelling package</li>
            <li> Seems a little thicker then the other shampoos...so don&#x27;t seem to need as much. Smells great too...I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Wen products and found them each to be a bit different.  By far, this is the best for my hair type.  Even though it&#x27;s pricey and you have to use quite a bit, I&#x27;ve changed from washing my hair every day to just twice a week.  I love the smell of this product and for some reason, it is a bit lighter in feel than the others.  I&#x27;m hoping that this will be a year round product as I will be purchasing it again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN cleansing conditioner products for approximately 2 months.  I have terrible hair (fine, flyaway, does not hold a style).  This gives me &#x27;good hair&#x27; days every day.  Also, sulfates in lathering shampoo had stripped the color from my hair even though it was not color treated.  I have nothing but good things to say about it and I am loving my hair finally!</li>
            <li> I DONOT like ordering from Wen because it it&#x27;s a contract deal where they auto ship every month, and they include about 5 other products I don&#x27;t use.  Buying from AMAZON I buy when I need and what I want.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job of cleansing my hair but can&#x27;t really justify the price since I can get a cleansing conditioner that does just as well and costs a lot less. But I had to try it to find out.</li>
            <li> bought it for my son who has psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to help relieve itching but not worth the price</li>
            <li> This product cleans your hair nicely without leaving it coarse or drying it. Just wish the scent was little stronger.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my bottle was taller and the labeling was different.  So I spoke with a WEN agent and they don&#x27;t even have this scent as part of their collection.  I&#x27;ve been buying WEN from Amazon for almost a year; I&#x27;m wondering if I have been buying a fake product for the last year!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Shipped faster than I thought. My hair feels great. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooooo nice not having to shampoo then condition every day. WEN is perfect. Works so well and this fragrance is my fav. Love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy WEN once and you&#x27;ll never use regular shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I have used several Wen products but this one does exactly what it shows in the TV advertissements.  If you have fine hair that tangles easily this is the Wen for you.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and at first thought hey this is nice!  The next day my hair was greasy and I was very disappointed.  Perhaps if your hair is very dry and course it may be great but for me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been trying to persuade me to use this product for several years.  Somehow I just never got around to trying it until a few weeks ago.  While I was waiting for it to be delivered, I did some research on how to use it and results others have experienced.  After about 4 shampoos, I was SOLD!!  I have colored my hair for years and always went a shade darker to compensate for the routine fading.  Surprise!!  With WEN there is NO fading!  So I have been stuck with hair color darker than my usual.  I will continue to use a shade lighter until it gradually lightens up.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed just a tad bit of buildup so I used one of my &#x27;upscale&#x27; shampoos.  As a result, I ended up with a bad hair day. Next time I will add just a drop or two of my &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo to the WEN and see if that will take care of the slight buildup.&lt;br /&gt; I believe the negative results that users experience is the consequence of either not using enough WEN or not rinsing thoroughly enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use 4 - 6 pumps total.  Two pumps at first and then rub&lt;br /&gt;it in like crazy til you feel you scalp tingle.&lt;br /&gt;then rub it in on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this product twice a week and do not wash my&lt;br /&gt;hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you hair feel soft and new.</li>
            <li> At first it was a great product.  I immediately noticed the difference in my hair.  Love the smell.  After two weeks, my hair started feeling greasy by mid day.  I tried to correct this by making sure I rinsed thoroughly but it still felt greasy.  Glad I tried it because I always wondered what the hype was all about.  I&#x27;m back to my regular shampoo and conditioner and no more Wen for me.</li>
            <li> I Love Wen products, and this flavor is one of my favorites.  I&#x27;m surprised I never heard of this fragrance before...glad I did a search!!</li>
            <li> Wen works great for me.  Controls my frizz and dry ends.  This scent is phenomenal!  Wish it was an everyday choice instead of seasonal.</li>
            <li> Used it because my friends recommended it but for me, it was too much for my hair. I used it for two months and just made my hair too heavy. Smells great but too much. Gave it to my mom, who loves it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at a friends house and loved it.  Since using Wen shampoo I have  noticed a marked difference and have reduced washing to two times weekly.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner but not for Everyday use. Heavy on hair</li>
            <li> Worst dispenser waste of money defective have to remove dispenser product does not come out when press it&lt;br /&gt;Horrid awful  vendor when asked to return it.</li>
            <li> love the wen products.  use on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Wrapped perfectly , this has an amazing smell.. one of my favorites of all i have used</li>
            <li> liked it very much but too much money for me to use regularly.  I used Dr. Woods on my hair and it felt so clean and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair. I have tried this every which way: using more, using less, mixing with another shampoo, only as a conditioner,etc. My hair is very nice for about 12 hours, and then begins to look dirty and oily. By 24 hours, my hair looks like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week.  I rinsed and rinsed, and it still doesn&#x27;t help. very sad, because I really wanted to be a WEN girl!</li>
            <li> I love WEN.  I&#x27;m a true WEN girl, though I have started looking for cheaper products that are similar.  I still treat myself every so often and ask for WEN as gifts.  This particular scent is my absolute favorite.  It is so light and leaves my curly hair bouncy, full and glossy.  There really is nothing like WEN and this scent is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> We usually only use the pomegranate, this is the first time we changed scents and we LOVE this Spring Gardenia Green Tea!  Super fast shipping and great packaging.  We will try to purchase from this buyer all the time.</li>
            <li> does not clean your hair, feels dirty and is not shiny. doesn&#x27;t matter how  much you rinse it still feels that way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, mid length hair. I&#x27;m generally kind to my hair, I wash it once a week, very very rarely blow dry and never straighten or curl. This left it frizzy and dry, and it noticeably breaking more after two uses this week. Smells good, but I&#x27;m going back to my nexus pro-mend.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but not sure if this product is any better than other brands. I have used it for a few weeks and not sure if I am using it correctly. I do not mind that it does not suds because there is a reason for that,but am not sure if it really leaves my hair in better condition.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in the condition of my hair!  Really loved the product! Thanks wen! I will order this again. Great</li>
            <li> Love this product. would by again</li>
            <li> It is just about money. it is nothing more than a regular conditioner.and they charge you more for reordering the product without your permission. jerk!!!!!</li>
            <li> Now this is some great stuff. Smells awesome and refreshing. this is great for color treated hair or dry damaged hair. Get some!</li>
            <li> first off i started out using as directed, but no one needs that much ever! what a waste, and given that it is super expensive  if i had continued to use it as directed it would not have lasted me even this long,.&lt;br /&gt;but over all it leaves my hair very heavy and sticky, which is disappointing considering i have heard great things about this product, and I have reduced the use i put in my hair down drastically; and i make sure to wash it out very well after every use.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion i wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> We do NOT need to strip the natural oils from our hair and then replace them. We simply need to clean any dirt from our hair. I have coarse, dry hair and it does better using Wen products that do NOT have the harsh foaming agents. The smell is natural NOT perfume which I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wen products for almost a year and I love it!! My hair is healthier and the product does not weigh down my hair because it only keeps what it needs when you rinse it out.  It&#x27;s more economical than shampoo because you use less. I highly recommend this product!!   As always, I got exactly what I wanted and expected with my purchase from Amazon. Outstanding customer service without any problems. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> love this product, I am sold. it makes my hair feel the softest it has ever been. and it is very healthy now</li>
            <li> VERY NICE.... I HAVE VERY OILY HAIR AND VERY SENSITIVE SKIN... IT CONTROLS THE OILS ALL DAY WITHOUT DRYING OUT THE SCALP AND IT DOSN&#x27;T IRRITATE MY SKIN AT ALL...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY LITTLE DOG HAS VERY DRY SKIN AND HE ALWAYS ITCHES AND IT WAS BREAKING OFF THE FUR SHORT.... SO FROM HIS WAST DOWN, IT WAS THIN AND SHORT, AND WAST UP HE WAS SHAGGY... NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN USING IT ON HIM NOT ONLY DOSE HE SMELL GOOD BUT HIS HAIR IS GROWING BACK NICELY.. YEAH FOR FONZIE!!! THANKS WEN..</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is my favorite Wen scent, It left my hair manageable and was super easy to use being a multi tasking product. I have used the lavender,  Wen 613  some seasonal and this one my favorite. It leaves my smooth and easy to manage. I try to use the Wen Gluten free products when I can. I love that the ingredients are listed so you can make choices.  I find I don&#x27;t need to use quite as many pumps as recommended for my medium longish thick hair.  This is also great for any time of year. I am so happy I can find the Gardenia on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I started using Wen in Dec.2012...I have dry course frizzy hair and live in South Fl. I have used every product on my hair to get a sleek frizz free look to my chin length Bob...that was before WEN! I have stopped using hair products...its just WEN from now on....The Gardenia Green Tea is my favorite fragrance so far....I wash my hair every other day...I use a Chi blow dryer and I use a flat iron on my bangs...and  my style stays all day and looks great on day two as well. Air drying doesn&#x27;t work for me....I did notice that my hair does not hold as much water with the WEN so drying time is cut in half and my hair is full and shiny and looks so good I think I&#x27;ll let it grown long!!! [[ASIN:B004HFBDE6 Chi Deep Brilliance Hair Dryer, Purple]]</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but it does leave my hair feeling a little heavy, especially between washes. I won&#x27;t purchase again but I think it could have to do with the fact I&#x27;m on well water also.</li>
            <li> The Spring Gardenia Green Tea has a wonderful springy smell. I have always loved gardenias and this does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> it works, but i use this product not so often, but i recommend try. Smells good. But don&#x27;t follow instruction on a bottle , take pumps as many as you need for your hair</li>
            <li> i love wen. i tell everyone i know about it. at my work everyone always says \\&quot; oh, your hair smells so good.\\&quot; and they always tell me how nice it looks. i give thanks to wen. ive been a hairstylist for 15 yrs and still have not found anything that compares. i have read some of the comments that werent good about wen. all i can think is i wish i could see what their doing. i still do hair on the side and i use it on everyone. and everyone i use it on has bought wen after. they love it too. the styling cream is everyones favorite too. in a nut shell, i have tried them all. i love them all. wen for life.</li>
            <li> Made my hair FALL OUT. Seriously. It was about triple the amount that normally comes out when I wash my hair with other shampoos.I gave it a month and decided nu-uh, no way am I using this stuff anymore when I googled &amp;#34;does Wen make your hair fall out&amp;#34; when I noticed my hair shedding abnormal amounts in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleansing conditioner.  I had dry, lightly coarse hair and the texture of my har has improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> WEN is by far the best thing my hair has ever come across!  Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better, I tried this fabulous scent!  It&#x27;s now my favorite.  Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have shared that...now it&#x27;ll be harder to find.  Anyway, I have very fine, color processed hair that is only at its best when I use the WEN products. *****FYI:  I&#x27;m a product junkie.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.*****</li>
            <li> My daughter, daughter-in-law and I love this product. We try to get the different fragrances and change from day to day.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the smell would be overpowerful, but it was wonderful.  I use other Wen cleansing conditioners as well, I try one fragrance at a time, then the next time a differnt one, I used to buy the expensive shampoos and conditioners, I wont go back to them.  My hair is fine and it used to feel like straw, but conditioner weighed it down too much.  Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner gives me a clean, light, healthy feeling.  Even my stylist said my hair is in better condition now than it used to be.  Its boucy, healthy - doesnt frizz or break off like before.  The Gardenia Green Tea and Lavender gave me the most body so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love Wen!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is so enticingly serene and uplifting, I love the smell of my hair all day long. And my hair looks healthly, full bodied and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Wen makes my hair so soft, it keeps my curls bouncy all day. My hair has so much volume now. I love it so much. People have noticed how wonderful my hair looks now</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  It promises to give volume and it, at the contrary, makes hair even flatter. The product is heavy and you dont feel your hair is clean.</li>
            <li> smells great and refreshing...I would not follow the directions of how much to use though.. I have hair to the middle of my back and semi thinnish...I only use 2 full pumps and it works great...If I use any more then that about, it will feel as if I have too much conditioner in my hair and then I just rinse it out more ( no big deal)...</li>
            <li> This does not clean like the Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  It seems more like a regular conditioner and that is how I will be using it.</li>
