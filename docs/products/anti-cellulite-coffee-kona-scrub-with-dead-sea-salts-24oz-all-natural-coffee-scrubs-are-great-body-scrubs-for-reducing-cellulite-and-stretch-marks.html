            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell what effect is has on getting rid of acne, but if I have more to add about that I will do it later!</li>
            <li>This is just a first impression since I have not used this long.</li>

            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed a different in cellulite, but my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> The texture is just right, not so small that it doesnâ€™t do anything and not so big that it is too rough for your face.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Who knew so much power could come in such a small package?</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this soft with any other exfoliater!!</li>
            <li> I expected the package to be larger than what I received.</li>
            <li> After only a short period of time I already have smoothed out my scars and my stretch marks look less severe.</li>
            <li> Momâ€™s arm doesnâ€™t look dry and aged anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> and I usually use coconut oil after showering, with this, NOT necessary!</li>
            <li> only negative I have for the scrub is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Cannot say as to the actual cellulite reduction, but I honestly do not expect miracles in that department.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it exfoliates your body, removing impurities and dead skin.</li>
            <li> The scrub comes in a resealable bag except because of all the tiny granules I&#x27;m unable to get a seal on it.</li>
            <li> The oils do not leave the Shower/Tub so slick</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks</li>
            <li> The stretch marks on my tummy seem a little lighter already!!!</li>
            <li> so I was no longer sad.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it seems that I might have an allergic reaction to something in this, and have had to stop using it to see if that is what is causing my rash.</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong there?!</li>

            <li> This scrub is like literally a miracle. I can&#x27;t even describe how amazing this makes your skin look and feel! I will continue to purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I expected the package to be larger than what I received. I feel if the creator put the product in a jar it would be easier to use and more eye catching. The product works great to smooth skin and I&#x27;m hoping by the time I finish the product my dimples and cellulite will be lessened. Since I&#x27;ve only used it twice I haven&#x27;t see an intense change yet. Great product</li>
            <li> This is just a first impression since I have not used this long. But this body scrub smells heavenly! It&#x27;s smells like a mix of coffee and chocolate. How could you go wrong there?! The granules are a good size, not too course to rip your skin off, but enough to slough off the dead skin. If you can keep your nose out of the bag long enough to wash with it you&#x27;ll be left with soft, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed on the bag are:&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt, Organic Kona Coffee, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Grape Seed Oil, Coffee Arabica Seed Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Natural Fragrance Extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gee, I think this scrub might be organic ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have for the scrub is the packaging. The scrub comes in a resealable bag except because of all the tiny granules I&#x27;m unable to get a seal on it. This would have been better in a jar. However, I&#x27;m betting that would have drove up the price. So, hush up and continue folding the bag over and clipping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through a promotional discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth. Smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Now this truly is a fantastic product, I love this coffee scrub which contains caffeine and aims to help draw out the  toxins and leave your skin feeling pampered and glowing. I like the fact that it exfoliates your body, removing impurities and dead skin. It has a very nice scent to the scrub, which also is infused with coconut which is another great additive that makes this dead sea scrub so on point. After using this I felt very refreshed, my skin was reinvigorated and alive I CANNOT say it enough, this is the most amazing body scrub I have ever used in my forty three years of life. I will definitely be a repeat customer for this product. My skin is the softest it has ever been and I usually use coconut oil after showering, with this, NOT necessary! Scrumptious and radiantly glowing is my skin. Feels like baby skin! Wow- I need gallons of this stuff.  I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest review. I would highly recommend this product for some definite pampering which you do not have to leave home to obtain.</li>
            <li> Very good product, does have a strong coffee smell though.  Leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very many stretch marks and not so smooth legs with a couple of scars. I decided to try out this scrub because the ingredients sound really good to me. Dead Sea Salt, Organic Kona Coffee, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Grape Seed Oil, Coffee Arabica Seed Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Cacao Powder, Coconut Shavings give you smooth skin and make you look younger. I have  integrated this in my daily shower routine. It feels good to rub my problem areas with the scrub, like a mini massage. And then I just rinse off. It smells good and a little goes a long way. After only a short period of time I already have smoothed out my scars and my stretch marks look less severe. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Love it... Used on my legs and lived it... Seen to learn looks of spider veins</li>
            <li> OMG, my skin has never felt so soft. This has the perfect balance of coffee, sea salt, and oils. I&#x27;m currently testing another one and that one does not compare to this scrub. I love this one so much more. I will definitely be buying again once I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I haven&#x27;t noticed a different in cellulite, but my skin is so soft I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased with a coupon code and provided my honest opinion. I would repurchase with no code again and buy some for my friends!</li>
            <li> Comfortable scrub that feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great coffee scrub; really makes my skin very soft and is removing cellulite fast. Yummy scent. My skin feels amazing!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it,  it makes you skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> Who knew so much power could come in such a small package? At first I was kind of disappointed by the size of the package because I thought there was gonna be more. When I opened the package all of the scrub had settled to the bottom of the bag  so I was no longer sad. Lol. The sea salt scrub felt amazing on my skin. It was just coarse enough to exfoliate my skin without feeling like I was scrubbing it off. The Kona coffee was the perfect boost for the mind and body. The caffeine helped me wake up while showering in the morning and also improved the look of my skin. Upon rinsing, my skin felt like heaven. It was the perfect balance of moisture. The scrub I selected was the Grapefruit and Lemongrass scent. Complete bliss. I&#x27;ve found my new go to body scrub. FYI: My husband loves it also</li>
            <li> Different, but very nice!  Nice exfoliation and scent</li>
            <li> this is quite an interesting scrub I had never used a product like this but will certainly use this again</li>
            <li> Smells great! (Lemon and grapefruit scent) Leaves skin very soft and gentle enough on my very sensitive skin.  Cannot say as to the actual cellulite reduction, but I honestly do not expect miracles in that department.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells like Starbucks and leaves your skin feeling soft and fabulous. The packaging sucks that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating it so low</li>
            <li> smell nice and skin feels soft after use it</li>
            <li> As a product, I really like this scrub. It smells great, and is very exfoliating! Although, I have two complaints about it. The shea butter leaves a lotion-y film on your skin, which I am not a fan of. Also, if you take a bath and use this stuff, the coffee flakes float in the water. Sadly, it seems that I might have an allergic reaction to something in this, and have had to stop using it to see if that is what is causing my rash.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and has an excellent combination of ingredients to really to take my bath experience to the next level. I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week, but my skin feels so much softer and looks so much better. I believe that it scrubs away the top layer of dead skin cells very well and leaves me feeling rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve used other scrubs before, but this one smells great and is working faster to make my skin feel tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT SMELLS VERY GOOD AND LEAVES SKIN FEELING SOFT.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have just received this product a few days ago and tried it for the first time yesterday and I have to say... I CAN NOT WAIT TO PURCHASE THIS AGAIN! It was super easy to use and smells delicious! My skin was baby soft, and I mean super baby soft for more then 24 hours... It is so so awesome and with just one use.. The stretch marks on my tummy seem a little lighter already!!! I can not wait to take a shower and use it again (&#x3D; Great product and awesome seller!! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Makes you feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cacao Coconut Anti Cellulite Kona Coffee Scrub with Dead Sea Salts with my mother in mind; she was absolutely in love with Sephoraâ€™s Coffee scrub that they discontinued several years ago. Since then I have been searching for something similar for her and have been unsuccessful until now.  Not only did she try it, I had to as well.  Here are our thoughts on the product&lt;br /&gt;1) BUY, BUY, BUY IT!!&lt;br /&gt;2) The smell is incredible; it does not have the artificial smell most others do when Chocolate is added.  Because they use the real thing (Cacao)&lt;br /&gt;3) The texture is just right, not so small that it doesnâ€™t do anything and not so big that it is too rough for your face.&lt;br /&gt;4) Has 3 different oils plus Shea Butter to leave your skin moisturized and feeling like a babyâ€™s bum&lt;br /&gt;5) The oils do not leave the Shower/Tub so slick you fall&lt;br /&gt;6) You feel as if you have pampered yourself at a fancy spa.&lt;br /&gt;7) Skin feels smooth and supple.  Momâ€™s arm doesnâ€™t look dry and aged anymore.&lt;br /&gt;8) Price is reasonable, not as high as some other National big brands that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;9) Again BUY IT!!&lt;br /&gt;With all that said I know that this will now be a purchase I make regularly so Mom can have the scent she loves and have wonderful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at discounted price, and am thrilled beyond belief with it. I will happily be buying at Full price.</li>
