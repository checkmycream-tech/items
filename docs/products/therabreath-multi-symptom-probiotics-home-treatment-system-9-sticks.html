    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The strains of bacteria show promise for excellent oral health.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great solution is great! !!</li>
            <li>Mouthwash is great though</li>
            <li>My husband said that my breath has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>Toothpaste had a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>since I know my hubby would have loved to use this, I guess I will have to get him a box too.</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the product I knew I was going to love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love that it does come with toothpaste so if you don&#x27;t have any of TheraBreath</li>
            <li>I love the ease of using this product and it isn&#x27;t time consuming for the effect and helpfulness of the product.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash and tooth paste are excellent though and I buy them regularly!</li>
            <li>It works okay, not a life changer for me.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do the 7 days as described and use the oral rinse.</li>
            <li>Best mouthwash ever, definitely makes your mouth feel clean and leaves you with no morning breath:)</li>
            <li>A lot of these things didn&#x27;t start to appear until my pregnancy and have just kind of lingered around for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my gums happyou and my teeth plaque and tartar free.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth</li>
            <li>This tasted funky but its worth it!</li>
            <li>coupon that was included was already expired, so I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>sweet breath.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Taste very much like sugar with a citrus taste.</li>
            <li>Worked from the first application.  </li>
            <li>I really need to request a refund!</li>
            <li>So I have not taken the most scientific of investigations, and in fact could more accurately be described as the &amp;#34;shotgun approach&amp;#34;, but adding TheraBreath probiotics along with the following regimen appears to have finally kept my gross mouth taste in check:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothpaste is made of stuff I don&#x27;t normally use as I try to stay away from fluoride and stay with natural products, but they try to make it sound like some super-scientific interaction between the rinse and the toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product line except that I&#x27;ll be using the mouthwash, toothpaste, gum, probiotics and other products for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li>I tried this and didn&#x27;t follow the directions very well.</li>
            <li>Even a bottled water with .05 fluoride has too much fluoride.</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t tell if it was doing anything or not.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I could see an immediate difference of it clearing away the coating on my tongue.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li>and if I hadn&#x27;t used the whole thing in hope of results, I would return it.</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions absolutely to the letter.</li>
            <li>I love the other TheraBreath products</li>
            <li>Within a few days I could see a difference and the problems I was having were subsiding which is the whole reason I love this product.</li>
            <li>But there is far too much fluoride.</li>
            <li>Breathe is much fresher and I am facing and speaking directly to the person and no longer get that &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>company itself is very inefficient and has sent a different (and coincidentally much cheaper) product</li>
            <li>I found other products for this brand at local stores, but not the treatment system, so glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used the entire package and though it didn&#x27;t get rid of my mild gum disease, I believe that with regular use, however, that I would see results.</li>
            <li>Product did absolutely nothing to improve my breathe or my overall mouth Health.  </li>
            <li>(I stand on the no-fluoride side of the debate), this product could be for you; but if you are trying to completely avoid it, like myself, this is one to avoid.</li>
            <li>I got some old stuff</li>
            <li>Combining this with Dr. Katz&#x27;s oral rinse has completely neutralized my breath.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of weeks to get complete results.</li>
            <li>will likely research other products containing these probiotics for regular use, which I&#x27;m sure is probably a healthier solution than just binging once a month because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li>But upon finishing off the last stick, my mouth has stabilized and been going strong for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li>Only lasts a few hours of clean.</li>
            <li>The box was included in a larger Amazon box with other items and they were all fine, but this box was crushed to the point where it looked like it had been run over.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it helps with so many things which I do have some issues like bad breath, gum problems, ear aches and among other things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strangely enough, during the course of the probiotics my mouth not only tasted WORSE, but it seemed like my level of plaque rapidly increased, and on top of all that, I&#x27;m convinced the tiny bit I would accidentally swallow while gargling made me kind of nauseated.  </li>
            <li>My tongue took a little longer, about midway through the first week of treatment.  </li>

            <li> These are much too expensive, probably due to the ridiculous over - packaging.&lt;br /&gt;They are good and do help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been struggling with gum disease and halitosis and was desperate for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not only did it clean up my breath, it completely eliminated the swelling in my gums and cleared up an infection!  </li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve had a white coating over my tongue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While driving to work, I heard about oral probiotics on a doctor&#x27;s radio show and made a mental note to investigate further.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works for others but this product did not work for me and was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll avoid more expensive dental work down the road.  </li>
            <li> If you know of a similar product with less packaging for less money, I&#x27;d like to know of it.</li>
            <li> I can do the old &amp;#34;tongue scrape test&amp;#34; for bad breath and while I don&#x27;t think Sephora will be marketing this particular fragrance any time soon, it no longer makes me worried that the next person I come within 5 feet of will be counting down the seconds until they&#x27;re allowed to leave my sphere of stench.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help balance my oral flora the same way probiotics have helped me in the past with my digestive tract.  </li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical, but by the first morning, I felt a difference.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of time I thought, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update my review if I feel the need to buy another round</li>
            <li> Did not work at all waste of money.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it&#x27;s quite expensive to have to purchase on a regular basis, so I think I&#x27;ll keep researching other products.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I would give this a lower review, but I don&#x27;t want to make the product look bad because it seems to have worked for other people.</li>
            <li> It is kinda expensive.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but I see it as an investment in my health care.  </li>
            <li> Despite flossing and using the type of electric toothbrush my dentist recommended, I would wake up with horrible breath and a slightly sticky residue on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I have to say the taste isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I fell bad now thought</li>
            <li> Bad breath...gone.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d notice I had bad breath an hour after eating.  </li>
            <li> This was truly disappointing!  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy and will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to have something in my mouth that has a horrible taste.</li>
            <li> Minimizing sugar (way before I started throwing products at my nasty mouth</li>
            <li> I noticed a connection between sodas and a disgusting taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received product found to be allergic to an ingredient not listed on website. Company will not return. Very unhappy and will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Spend you cash on the mouthwash. This was a waste of time I thought, didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Mouthwash is great though</li>
            <li> Worked from the first application.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the product I knew I was going to love this product. I love the fact that it helps with so many things which I do have some issues like bad breath, gum problems, ear aches and among other things. A lot of these things didn&#x27;t start to appear until my pregnancy and have just kind of lingered around for the fun of it. I also love that it does come with toothpaste so if you don&#x27;t have any of TheraBreath you will have some to start off with using this. I love the ease of using this product and it isn&#x27;t time consuming for the effect and helpfulness of the product. Another thing I have to say the taste isn&#x27;t that bad either which is a big thing  for me I hate to have something in my mouth that has a horrible taste. Within a few days I could see a difference and the problems I was having were subsiding which is the whole reason I love this product. I fell bad now thought since I know my hubby would have loved to use this, I guess I will have to get him a box too.</li>
            <li> This was truly disappointing!  Product did absolutely nothing to improve my breathe or my overall mouth Health.  May  be it&#x27;s not meant for people with chronic bb...at the end of day 7 I saw no improvement!  I really need to request a refund!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help balance my oral flora the same way probiotics have helped me in the past with my digestive tract.  I was already scheduled for a scaling- a deep tissue cleaning so I thought I&#x27;d start the product after. I&#x27;d been struggling with gum disease and halitosis and was desperate for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not only did it clean up my breath, it completely eliminated the swelling in my gums and cleared up an infection!  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product line except that I&#x27;ll be using the mouthwash, toothpaste, gum, probiotics and other products for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I tried this and didn&#x27;t follow the directions very well. I did finish the product in the 7 days but my timing of doing the rinse each day was off. My husband said that my breath has improved greatly.  This tasted funky but its worth it! I have followed up with the mouthwash and mints on a daily basis. I would use this again! This is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> It works a they say. Still dont know if ots necesary to use it once a month as the producer days. When it appeared the say its one use in life time.</li>
            <li> This is simply a buyer beware. I was looking forward to trying this product. The strains of bacteria show promise for excellent oral health. But there is far too much fluoride. Even a bottled water with .05 fluoride has too much fluoride. This product contains .24. If you are looking to add fluoride (I stand on the no-fluoride side of the debate), this product could be for you; but if you are trying to completely avoid it, like myself, this is one to avoid.</li>
            <li> I got this product along with the tooth paste and mouthwash. I used it according to the directions and I really couldn&#x27;t tell if it was doing anything or not. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. The mouthwash and tooth paste are excellent though and I buy them regularly!</li>
            <li> So I have not taken the most scientific of investigations, and in fact could more accurately be described as the &amp;#34;shotgun approach&amp;#34;, but adding TheraBreath probiotics along with the following regimen appears to have finally kept my gross mouth taste in check:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Using TheraBreath toothpaste and mouth rinse in the morning, along with flossing and scrubbing tongue/roof of mouth/inside of cheeks&lt;br /&gt;2. Drinking copious amounts of water throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;3. Minimizing sugar (way before I started throwing products at my nasty mouth I noticed a connection between sodas and a disgusting taste later)&lt;br /&gt;4. Xylitol + peppermint oil mints--I usually only pop one if it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve eaten something&lt;br /&gt;5. TheraBreath toothpaste at night (tried mouth rinse here as well but it never seems to make any difference)&lt;br /&gt;6. All but eliminated all plastics that come in contact with my food/water...because why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely enough, during the course of the probiotics my mouth not only tasted WORSE, but it seemed like my level of plaque rapidly increased, and on top of all that, I&#x27;m convinced the tiny bit I would accidentally swallow while gargling made me kind of nauseated.  But upon finishing off the last stick, my mouth has stabilized and been going strong for a few weeks now.  I can do the old &amp;#34;tongue scrape test&amp;#34; for bad breath and while I don&#x27;t think Sephora will be marketing this particular fragrance any time soon, it no longer makes me worried that the next person I come within 5 feet of will be counting down the seconds until they&#x27;re allowed to leave my sphere of stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if I feel the need to buy another round and it appears to make a noticeable difference again.</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash ever, definitely makes your mouth feel clean and leaves you with no morning breath:)</li>
            <li> These are much too expensive, probably due to the ridiculous over - packaging.&lt;br /&gt;They are good and do help and I have bought many.&lt;br /&gt;The company itself is very inefficient and has sent a different (and coincidentally much cheaper) product twice.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a substitute just so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this bunch. If you know of a similar product with less packaging for less money, I&#x27;d like to know of it.</li>
            <li> I use this about 4 times a year.  It keeps my gums happyou and my teeth plaque and tartar free.  And tames morning breath.  It is kinda expensive.  But I figure root canals, filings and root planing and scaling is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I could see an immediate difference of it clearing away the coating on my tongue. This was my second box I ordered I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this but it didn&#x27;t come with the toothbrush like it claims.  But it&#x27;s a great solution is great! !! 5 star on product but not seller for deceiving That there&#x27;s a brush that comes with. ...</li>
            <li> I would give this a lower review, but I don&#x27;t want to make the product look bad because it seems to have worked for other people. This product did absolutely nothing for me and if I hadn&#x27;t used the whole thing in hope of results, I would return it.</li>
            <li> It works okay, not a life changer for me. Only lasts a few hours of clean.</li>
            <li> Taste very much like sugar with a citrus taste. Did not work at all waste of money. Forgot to return with in 30 days</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I no longer wake up with a matel taste in my mouth and the overly white coating on my tongue is reduced! Breathe is much fresher and I am facing and speaking directly to the person and no longer get that &amp;#34; look&amp;#34; of omg what did you eat?!!</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve had a white coating over my tongue.  I would brush and scrape my tongue, but it alway looked the same.  Despite flossing and using the type of electric toothbrush my dentist recommended, I would wake up with horrible breath and a slightly sticky residue on my teeth.  Gross! My dentist would tell me it wasn&#x27;t my fault; it&#x27;s my genes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While driving to work, I heard about oral probiotics on a doctor&#x27;s radio show and made a mental note to investigate further.  After doing a bit of research, I decided to try TheraBreath.  Glad I did.  I admit, I was skeptical, but by the first morning, I felt a difference.  My teeth felt smooth like I&#x27;d just had a dental cleaning.  Bad breath...gone.  My tongue took a little longer, about midway through the first week of treatment.  Another plus, at work I can&#x27;t always get to a toothbrush and I&#x27;d notice I had bad breath an hour after eating.  No problem after TheraBreath treatment.  I know it&#x27;s expensive, but I see it as an investment in my health care.  I figure I&#x27;ll avoid more expensive dental work down the road.  Note: I found other products for this brand at local stores, but not the treatment system, so glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is good. I used the entire package and though it didn&#x27;t get rid of my mild gum disease, I believe that with regular use, however, that I would see results. The problem is that it&#x27;s quite expensive to have to purchase on a regular basis, so I think I&#x27;ll keep researching other products.</li>
            <li> Over-priced and over-packaged (to justify the price I&#x27;m sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is made of stuff I don&#x27;t normally use as I try to stay away from fluoride and stay with natural products, but they try to make it sound like some super-scientific interaction between the rinse and the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely research other products containing these probiotics for regular use, which I&#x27;m sure is probably a healthier solution than just binging once a month because it&#x27;s so unaffordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coupon that was included was already expired, so I&#x27;m pretty sure I got some old stuff (but it was not yet expired).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was not sealed. The seal was on there, but it was open.</li>
            <li> Have a son that has struggled with killer breath for years.  Purchased this and after one treatment...sweet breath.  Seriously.  We had truly given up.  Even the TheraBreath mouthwash would only work for an hour or so.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the other TheraBreath products so I figured I would try this.  The box was included in a larger Amazon box with other items and they were all fine, but this box was crushed to the point where it looked like it had been run over.  The stick packets were still sealed so I used them anyway and did not notice any benefit at all.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Used this product but did not notice any lasting effects during use or after. Toothpaste had a pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> I hope it works for others but this product did not work for me and was a complete waste of money.  I followed all the instructions absolutely to the letter.</li>
            <li> Combining this with Dr. Katz&#x27;s oral rinse has completely neutralized my breath. I was at a loss until I found this stuff. I used this over a month ago and my breath is still neutral. I maintain it with the Therbreath oral rinse and occasionally pop a Strawberry oral probiotic tablet from NOW. Make sure you do the 7 days as described and use the oral rinse. It took me a couple of weeks to get complete results.</li>
