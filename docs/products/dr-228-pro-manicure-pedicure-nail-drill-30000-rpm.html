    <ol>
            <li>This has been an excellent drill for me.</li>
            <li>and this was my best option for that budget.</li>
            <li>and i think this will work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>very nice and impressive for the price.</li>
            <li>To beginners in learning to do an acrylic nail set... this is a great product.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, this has been great</li>
            <li>Control box is getting very warm after using it just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Of perfect quality and the colors are brighter than picture making it cute.....</li>
            <li>The unit itself is good to use at home for at home manicure.</li>
            <li>However, it was a good machine and worked well.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality of the product for spending around $50 on it.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This nail drill seems to have really good quality and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the latest chuck and slim handpiece</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that the drill bits lock into place by twisting the handle, therefore they do not vibrate out.</li>
            <li>I have owned this for 3 years now and am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m able to change them easily.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m definately happy with my purchase and the shipping was super fast. :)</li>
            <li>So if you looking to purchase from this seller do so but make sure your drill makes the click sound when attaching the attachment.</li>
            <li>It comes with a foot switch that allows easy intermittent on/off operation.  </li>
            <li>Fits comfortably in the hand but has ALOT of vibration.</li>
            <li>the light came on but the drill itself would not move.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and plan to work from home part time doing nails, I was hoping the machine wasnt flimsy, lightweight or cheap looking</li>
            <li>the hand motor with the drill did not make the clicking sound</li>
            <li>Was excited to receive this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never gives me a clean finish.</li>
            <li>it drills right through my acrylic nails to shape and drill off, seems to have a lot of power!</li>
            <li>(That was a problem I had with the last drill I purchased that cost more than this one!)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the foot pedal because there aren&#x27;t really any instructions that come with the product, but that was fine for me because I wouldn&#x27;t have used the pedal anyway.</li>
            <li>Very sufficent and quiet excellent for the price made it worth every Penny spent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is prefect for me, I do my own nails, have for a long time</li>
            <li>It can get hot</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find a drill that doesn&#x27;t get hot, it&#x27;s called friction people.</li>
            <li>but was only able to use it about times and haven&#x27;t used it ever since because the wires on the insde disconnected</li>
            <li>my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs.</li>
            <li>This drill&#x27;s foot pedal didn&#x27;t work at all and the drill is not the right speed for professional work, very agitated with it after waiting and paying for it...</li>
            <li>The drill is price reasonable, however, when I wanted to power up my new toy</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to other buyers looking to do their own nails or clients.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>The drill is plastic, the cord is flimsy and looks exactly like the one I&#x27;m replacing because the cord short circuits.</li>
            <li>not satisfied but will make do until i can afford a better one.</li>
            <li>You actually feel like a professional, but it is a simple user friendly product.</li>
            <li>i have no clue why i need this fixed please</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a cosmetologist and plan on using this drill for professional use</li>
            <li>wonders!Just be careful if you use it for a long time the handle can get hot.</li>

            <li> wonders!Just be careful if you use it for a long time the handle can get hot.</li>
            <li> it slows down considerably or just stops.</li>
            <li> They send me these little things to decorate nails, which is quite different than receiving the files that were in the picture.</li>
            <li> Not what we expected.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Nail Technician and I use this in the salon at least 2 days a week to drill down acrylic for backfills.</li>
            <li> other brands have.</li>
            <li> So much that it made it uncomfortable for my clients.</li>
            <li> When I complained to the Chinese company, my words must have been lost in translation.</li>
            <li> This is not a PRO (professional) nail drill: handpiece is thick and very heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this helps cut down the filing time</li>
            <li> and then once I did couldn&#x27;t get them out due to lack of instructions, but it just took a little fiddling with and experimenting</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t even use it as a back-up drill in the salon or for home use because of the heavy weight of the handpiece.</li>
            <li> As for the noise, it&#x27;s not too awful, I&#x27;m still able to talk to my clients while drilling, you just have to speak up a little.</li>
            <li> There are vibrations sometimes, but I usually chalk that up to user mistake</li>
            <li> I had a hard time figuring out how to put the drill bits in</li>
            <li> big disappointment....</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> As a pro Nail Tech I feel this drill is useless and is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and they probably wouldn&#x27;t understand if I send it back :(</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kno what the problem is but the compartment for the mandrills are always wiggling like its broken inside or something.</li>
            <li> (sometimes that can mean you&#x27;re using the wrong drill bit, I use the metal grooved ones, they rock).</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> the machine would still be in use if it wasn&#x27;t for that :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also the power is terrible when i go to use it</li>

            <li> Was excited to receive this.&lt;br /&gt;It is prefect for me, I do my own nails, have for a long time&lt;br /&gt;this helps cut down the filing time and I like all the bits that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal !!</li>
            <li> This nail drill seems to have really good quality and its easy to use. I had a hard time figuring out how to put the drill bits in and then once I did couldn&#x27;t get them out due to lack of instructions, but it just took a little fiddling with and experimenting and now I&#x27;m able to change them easily. I would definitely recommend this to other buyers looking to do their own nails or clients. I will be doing both, so I can update in the future on how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a deal ... What a joke this drill broke after the second time of use and will not turn on .....not good being that I am a nail tech !</li>
            <li> I used it several times and now it&#x27;s broke.</li>
            <li> To beginners in learning to do an acrylic nail set... this is a great product. You actually feel like a professional, but it is a simple user friendly product.</li>
            <li> This is not a PRO (professional) nail drill: handpiece is thick and very heavy. It doesn&#x27;t have the latest chuck and slim handpiece other brands have. As a pro Nail Tech I feel this drill is useless and is a waste of money. We can&#x27;t even use it as a back-up drill in the salon or for home use because of the heavy weight of the handpiece. Control box is getting very warm after using it just 3 minutes. Poorly made. Not what we expected. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the product for spending around $50 on it. I am a professional Nail Technician and I use this in the salon at least 2 days a week to drill down acrylic for backfills. I&#x27;ve had the product almost a year now and I don&#x27;t really have any major complaints. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the foot pedal because there aren&#x27;t really any instructions that come with the product, but that was fine for me because I wouldn&#x27;t have used the pedal anyway. I absolutely love that the drill bits lock into place by twisting the handle, therefore they do not vibrate out. (That was a problem I had with the last drill I purchased that cost more than this one!) Yes, the hand piece isn&#x27;t the lightest, but you get used to it. There are vibrations sometimes, but I usually chalk that up to user mistake (sometimes that can mean you&#x27;re using the wrong drill bit, I use the metal grooved ones, they rock). It can get hot but I have yet to find a drill that doesn&#x27;t get hot, it&#x27;s called friction people. As for the noise, it&#x27;s not too awful, I&#x27;m still able to talk to my clients while drilling, you just have to speak up a little. This has been an excellent drill for me. I researched drills in the price range of under $100 and this was my best option for that budget. Yes I plan to get a more expensive drill (around $300) once this one dies, but I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon. In the meantime, this has been great and I would recommend it to anyone that was looking for a drill in this price range.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for 3 years now and am in love with it.  Comparilble to the Mani Pro and lightweight.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> but was only able to use it about times and haven&#x27;t used it ever since because the wires on the insde disconnected i have no clue why i need this fixed please the machine would still be in use if it wasn&#x27;t for that :(</li>
            <li> Fits comfortably in the hand but has ALOT of vibration. So much that it made it uncomfortable for my clients. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> very nice and impressive for the price. it drills right through my acrylic nails to shape and drill off, seems to have a lot of power! i&#x27;m a cosmetologist and plan on using this drill for professional use and i think this will work perfectly. i&#x27;m definately happy with my purchase and the shipping was super fast. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my feet...it works wonders!Just be careful if you use it for a long time the handle can get hot.</li>
            <li> The drill is plastic, the cord is flimsy and looks exactly like the one I&#x27;m replacing because the cord short circuits. I specifically needed a dual voltage machine. This product was specified to be dual voltage but was not. Look elsewhere for a drill.</li>
            <li> the display photos led me to believe that I was getting the extra bits.  But I was wrong.  I had to buy it separately.  The unit itself is good to use at home for at home manicure.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it .  It seems to do the job as described in the ad.</li>
            <li> Great! They are as posted and my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs. Thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> havent had it a month and it stopped working on me. the light came on but the drill itself would not move. when had it repaired it was because the outlet where you plug the drill into had come lose. Also the power is terrible when i go to use it it slows down considerably or just stops. not satisfied but will make do until i can afford a better one. Definitely you get what you pay for situation.</li>
            <li> I order this product about a month ago and I&#x27;m just now using it. I don&#x27;t kno what the problem is but the compartment for the mandrills are always wiggling like its broken inside or something. It never gives me a clean finish. My customers always complain about the feeling of electric shock (vibration) running throught there fingers. What should I do? Or how can u help!</li>
            <li> This drill&#x27;s foot pedal didn&#x27;t work at all and the drill is not the right speed for professional work, very agitated with it after waiting and paying for it...big disappointment....</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and plan to work from home part time doing nails, I was hoping the machine wasnt flimsy, lightweight or cheap looking and it wasnt.  Of perfect quality and the colors are brighter than picture making it cute..... love it!</li>
            <li> I did not get the product that I bought! It was a different model and didn&#x27;t come with all the accessories that the picuture had. However, it was a good machine and worked well. When I complained to the Chinese company, my words must have been lost in translation. They send me these little things to decorate nails, which is quite different than receiving the files that were in the picture. I just kept it, because the device works well and they probably wouldn&#x27;t understand if I send it back :(</li>
            <li> Love the item. Functions as described/designed and I am satisified.  I would purchase this item again and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very sufficent and quiet excellent for the price made it worth every Penny spent had been shopping for quiet some time .</li>
            <li> The unit works well.  It comes with a foot switch that allows easy intermittent on/off operation.  Additionally, it can be switched to constant on.  Unit will rotate either CW or CCW.  We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This drill didnt even work for 24 hrs i turned it on and tried it and then it turned off and wouldnt work anymore it sucks</li>
            <li> I was looking for a manicure/pedicure nail drill for my Cosmetology kit to expand my service within the arcylic and gel nails. The drill is price reasonable, however, when I wanted to power up my new toy the hand motor with the drill did not make the clicking sound it was suppose to make with placing the attachment drill. The foot pedal and motor system worked find. So if you looking to purchase from this seller do so but make sure your drill makes the click sound when attaching the attachment. The refund was recieve within 24 hours.</li>
