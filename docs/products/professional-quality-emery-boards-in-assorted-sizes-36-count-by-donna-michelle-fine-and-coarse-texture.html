            <li>They are just fine and do all that emery boards should do.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>, I bought &#x27;em on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>These are fine.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a file that I would consider fine.</li>
            <li>I did not feel that my nail tips were smooth after using them.</li>
            <li>Great bulk buy and low cost!</li>
            <li>#34;add-on&amp;#34; for my $$ for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I just used one of the bigger ones to file and shape my nails, and it worked very nicely...</li>
            <li>My way of getting scuzzy crud off of them that seems to accumulate even if you keep your floors clean.</li>
            <li>These emery boards serve the needed purpose and having them in different sizes was a plus for the price compared to the more popular brands.</li>
            <li>Having good various grit emery boards on hand is a must for this task.  </li>
            <li>The price for this pack of emery boards is great and now I feel like I have an endless supply of boards.</li>
            <li>Quick ship.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I just bought this exact set at the dollar tree for a dollar!</li>
            <li>I bought them to file the nails of my newborn twins, and the little boards do just great.  </li>
            <li>but it would probably be worth it.</li>
            <li>But these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be professional quality and they aren&#x27;t any better than anything else on the market</li>
            <li>You get a ton of emery boards in this pack, and it&#x27;s the right price.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good nail files but rougher than expected.</li>
            <li>I like the assorted sizes and the quality of the emery boards at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The grit wears off quite rapidly and you can notice it falling off with the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an advanced enough nail filer to know the difference in the types of emery boards included in the variety pack, but it&#x27;s nice to have different ones.  </li>
            <li>Lovely assortment and enough I can share.</li>
            <li>boards.they are a higher quality and thicker.i did not receive michelle.</li>
            <li>they file pretty well, and dont wear out like cheaper ones do</li>
            <li>They have two sides, one being coarse and one being fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good emery boards anymore.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy compared to some others I bought at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I guess they figure if you don&#x27;t pay much for them, they can sell garbage.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Love there&#x27;s so many of these in the pack, but these are really thin emery boards.</li>
            <li>Different sizes are nice and make it easy if you want to put one in a small purse.</li>
            <li>So far, these emery boards seem to work just fine, and I like the variety for the different size nails on hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t kow why you can&#x27;t get a decent emery board nowadays.  </li>
            <li>They are thin, but are a good quality, and sturdy...</li>
            <li>I think they mean the kind the professionals throw away after one use.</li>
            <li>I went to the dollar store today and saw the same exact 36 pc.</li>
            <li>these are pretty convenient since it comes with 5 different sizes.</li>
            <li>When the packaging says that they are professional quality</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t know how my life was complete before I got these.  </li>
            <li>but they do the job until they start to get soft and mushy</li>
            <li>These can&#x27;t be used more than a few times or there will be no grit left.</li>
            <li>The emery boards don&#x27;t last very long so you will go through this packet quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what number grit they contain, but really don&#x27;t think the coarse side is coarse enough for my tastes.</li>
            <li>If not careful, I catch a bit of finger</li>
            <li>I was a little weary about ordering, as it&#x27;s hard to tell if they&#x27;re super cheap, flimsy, emery boards, but took the risk due to the low price.  </li>

            <li> They are cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> that debacle is okay, so instead of driving myself crazy</li>
            <li> Only the black ones are double sided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, so not a whole lot of experience using these things.  </li>
            <li> They felt quite rough and jagged.</li>
            <li> This product is as described and expected...</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about emery boards - they are as expected.</li>
            <li> We used this kit to file the rough edges off some plastic 3D prints.  </li>
            <li> This is not an emery board for artificial nails, natural nails only.</li>
            <li> These are typical dimes store versions</li>
            <li> Maybe think about having them come in a little case - that would make the cost go up a little</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than people with gross nails...</li>
            <li> Your basic, thin disposable emery board.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here, way overpriced.</li>
            <li> but the boards are thin and not very coarse.  </li>
            <li> A little thin, but they function well.</li>
            <li> Poor quality for the price</li>
            <li> They are a thin piece of cardboard (I think) with grit on both sides.  </li>
            <li> I find it difficult to file when they&#x27;re so &amp;#34;bendy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Five stars because I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> the useless CVS or RiteAid or Walgreens</li>
            <li> This is a rip-off!!  </li>
            <li> hate going to brick and mortar and having to act like</li>
            <li> I hate that they force me to use 15 words when I am already doing all these sites by reviewing, I have no time for this garbage!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very nice emery boards, and I like the assorted sizes.</li>
            <li> They are just fine and do all that emery boards should do.  Maybe think about having them come in a little case - that would make the cost go up a little but it would probably be worth it.</li>
            <li> Love there&#x27;s so many of these in the pack, but these are really thin emery boards. I find it difficult to file when they&#x27;re so &amp;#34;bendy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice emery boards for the price. It&#x27;s hard to find good emery boards anymore. But these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, so not a whole lot of experience using these things.  But I know quality and these things are NOT.  Very flimsy compared to some others I bought at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I am in no way overly vain or a homosexual or anything however I do try to keep my nails in great shape both fingers and toes.  Having good various grit emery boards on hand is a must for this task.  This pack will keep my in good shape for quite a while.  Nothing worse than people with gross nails... Yuk.</li>
            <li> Great, all-inclusive set. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Poor quality for the price</li>
            <li> This package of emery boards contains 4 different sizes. They are a thin piece of cardboard (I think) with grit on both sides.  When the packaging says that they are professional quality I think they mean the kind the professionals throw away after one use. They have two sides, one being coarse and one being fine. I don&#x27;t know what number grit they contain, but really don&#x27;t think the coarse side is coarse enough for my tastes. I felt the fine side was good. That being said. I did not feel that my nail tips were smooth after using them. They felt quite rough and jagged. The grit wears off quite rapidly and you can notice it falling off with the first use. These can&#x27;t be used more than a few times or there will be no grit left. This is not an emery board for artificial nails, natural nails only. Different sizes are nice and make it easy if you want to put one in a small purse. Your basic, thin disposable emery board. Everyone has them.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and cheesy. I guess they figure if you don&#x27;t pay much for them, they can sell garbage. They will damage your nails.  However, I will save them to &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; the bottoms of the legs of my kitchen chairs - - My way of getting scuzzy crud off of them that seems to accumulate even if you keep your floors clean.</li>
            <li> You get a ton of emery boards in this pack, and it&#x27;s the right price.  I&#x27;m not an advanced enough nail filer to know the difference in the types of emery boards included in the variety pack, but it&#x27;s nice to have different ones.  I won&#x27;t need to buy more for quite a while.  Five stars because I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with these emery boards.  From toe nails to fingernails, I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These emery boards serve the needed purpose and having them in different sizes was a plus for the price compared to the more popular brands.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest emery boards known to mankind.  Nothing ever made is as good as these emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;These are the best emery boards I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon.  These are the greatest thing since sliced bread.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t know how my life was complete before I got these.  They&#x27;ve changed my nails forever.&lt;br /&gt;Jeez.  Really?  Review emery boards?  They&#x27;re fine.  Fair price.  Quick ship.  What I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I hate going to brick and mortar and having to act like that debacle is okay, so instead of driving myself crazy&lt;br /&gt;with the useless CVS or RiteAid or Walgreens, I bought &#x27;em on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re fine.  If I ever need more, I&#x27;ll buy them again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my sarcasm.  :  )</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t last. You&#x27;ll go through all of these very quickly.</li>
            <li> Meets all my requirements at a great price. Everything board I need in one package. All things should be so easy.</li>
            <li> Do not buy...waste of your money.  I went to the dollar store today and saw the same exact 36 pc. pack.  This is a rip-off!!  How is somebody actually getting away with this?!?!</li>
            <li> What can I say except the variety of emery boards is nice and they work great!  Lovely assortment and enough I can share.</li>
            <li> Great bulk buy and low cost!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty cheap. but they do the job until they start to get soft and mushy--can&#x27;t beat the prices though</li>
            <li> What else is there to say about emery boards?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, they work for the purpose I needed.</li>
            <li> This product is as described and expected...I was a little weary about ordering, as it&#x27;s hard to tell if they&#x27;re super cheap, flimsy, emery boards, but took the risk due to the low price.  They are thin, but are a good quality, and sturdy...I just used one of the bigger ones to file and shape my nails, and it worked very nicely...sometimes the emery strip rips or tears on boards, but it did not on these! :)</li>
            <li> i love donna Michelle emery boards.they are a higher quality and thicker.i did not receive michelle. I received an inferior product from  china.</li>
            <li> I just bought this exact set at the dollar tree for a dollar! Don&#x27;t waste your money here, way overpriced.</li>
            <li> Good assortment and good quantity</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  Gets the job done.  A good way to stock up on nail and foot care accessories (Heel). The variety pack affords a lot of flexibility.</li>
            <li> A little thin, but they function well. Only the black ones are double sided.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed so we could have a variety in various parts of the house and our purses.</li>
            <li> I hate that they force me to use 15 words when I am already doing all these sites by reviewing, I have no time for this garbage!</li>
            <li> The emery boards don&#x27;t last very long so you will go through this packet quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be the kind they use in salons, which are kind of rubberized. These are typical dimes store versions</li>
            <li> So far, these emery boards seem to work just fine, and I like the variety for the different size nails on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This looked good when I first purcahsed ot but the boards are thin and not very coarse.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The price for this pack of emery boards is great and now I feel like I have an endless supply of boards.</li>
            <li> these are pretty convenient since it comes with 5 different sizes. they file pretty well, and dont wear out like cheaper ones do</li>
            <li> thanks for a nice product !</li>
            <li> These are fine.  I bought them to file the nails of my newborn twins, and the little boards do just great.  Not much else to say about emery boards - they are as expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast delivery!  I needed an item to &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; for my $$ for free shipping.  I had the need for more emery board.  The best part - I shared them based on my Mother&#x27;s and Daughter&#x27;s size/type preferences.  They are solid and not flimsy.  I will order these again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kow why you can&#x27;t get a decent emery board nowadays.  Used to buy Revlon all the time and they were wonderful.  These are supposed to be professional quality and they aren&#x27;t any better than anything else on the market</li>
            <li> I wanted a good variety of courseness but these are mostly on the course side.  I haven&#x27;t found a file that I would consider fine.</li>
            <li> Nice pack of emery boards.  I like the assorted sizes and the quality of the emery boards at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good variety, nice bargain.</li>
            <li> Nice emery boards; well made and nice price too!</li>
            <li> Pretty good nail files but rougher than expected. If not careful, I catch a bit of finger and it&#x27;s like hitting it with sandpaper. Like that  there are smaller sizes that I can throw in my purse for nail &#x27;emergencies&#x27;.</li>
            <li> We used this kit to file the rough edges off some plastic 3D prints.  Works OK for that purpose</li>
            <li> They work ok I was hoping for something sturdier; but you get a lot of them so I guess quantity works in this case.</li>
