            <li>The product also started building up on my scalp as huge flakes.</li>

            <li>I was excited to receive this product.  </li>
            <li>Significantly reduced shedding for me during the week in between weekly washes.</li>
            <li>In addition, my curly hair looks great without other products when I use this.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below are my quick notes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but other people said they liked the smell so it may just be that I used to have horses and associate this smell with them!  </li>
            <li>My hair is longer and thicker than ever, and I rarely get split ends.</li>
            <li>and I can say that I really have not seen a significant difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Right now, I use the ApHogee line for the protein I need.</li>
            <li>Right now, I use the ApHogee line for the protein I need.</li>
            <li>I wish I could take a picture of my hair right now and post it.</li>
            <li>I have a major bald spot at the top of my head from wearing weaves etc.</li>
            <li>;-) I had pretty long, healthy hair to begin with for full disclosure.  </li>
            <li>and after 2 months i&#x27;m still on the first bottle</li>
            <li>and hair felt soft and smooth</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Syran Wrap and slept over night(hair dryer on the fritz, can&#x27;t wait for my steamer)&lt;br /&gt;-Stay tuned for update after a week using product for first time and what it has done to my</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or use it too often!</li>
            <li>I do plan to use it up, but most likely will not purchase again unless I really do see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I do plan to use it up, but most likely will not purchase again unless I really do see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of medicine that has a lot of side effects (one of them is dry skin and hair) when I started using this product it made my hair look a lot better and not as dry/unhealthy.</li>
            <li>And I certainly will not be repurchasing</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t notice much growth</li>
            <li>After much reading on hair care forums, I decided to splurge and purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Prepoo, MegaTek, ORS(steamer for an hour) - WAY TOO MUCH SHEDDING</li>
            <li>BUT I REALLY DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li>I never really write reviews but since I love the reviews I get off Amazon I decided to write one on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-My goal is to rebuild my hair thickness, I am at bra strap length but with significant short comings&lt;br /&gt;-Prior:</li>
            <li>This is a product that you have to find best way to apply on natural hair, if you use too much it can make hair heavy, but it does help hair become stronger, must be used with natural oil so hair can be supple and not hard and dry.</li>
            <li>I still wear wigs daily and wash my hair once every two-three weeks with whatever shampoo I have on hand, nothing particularly special.</li>
            <li>After concerns about shedding/breakage, I decided not to use this product straight since my hair was newly relaxed.</li>
            <li>I used this with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the combination made my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much growth at this point as it is still very early, but I have noticed that my hair has thickened up.</li>
            <li>say how much growth at this point as it is still very early, but I have noticed that my hair has thickened up.</li>
            <li>You might experience some shredding because its high in protein</li>
            <li>After getting a relaxer, I sought to thicken up my hair as it was long (almost BSL), but not as full as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>, it is seriously SUPER long and it looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that EQyss sell it in a smaller bottle just to let women or men try it out first.  </li>
            <li>will update this review in December after I get a new relaxer to post results.</li>
            <li>will update this review in December after I get a new relaxer to post results.</li>
            <li>post update after using it with my co-wash routine and new hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore wigs and achieved 12 months of new growth with no intention of going natural.</li>
            <li>And there seems to be new growth near my edges after one application.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>(I am not partial to specific shampoos and conditioners, but may do sulfate free occasionally).</li>
            <li>As far as delivery goes, I got it about 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m stationed in Korea and i have been natural for about 2 years</li>
            <li>today, it arrived early</li>
            <li>Initially, I used the product straight in an applicator bottle and applied it to my scalp 1-2x a week for about a month after getting the relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sometimes sensitive skin and must be cautious about idly using things on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>After this month if I don&#x27;t see a huge difference I may try everyday for the third month?</li>
            <li>In an 12-oz applicator bottle I mixed 1/2 bottle Megatek along with a hair oil concoction of sulfur, jojoba, wheatgerm, sweet almond, argan, jamaican black castor (</li>
            <li>I just apply it (mixed with the oils) directly to my scalp via the applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t get the relaxer in December as originally planned, but recently this past April.</li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t get the relaxer in December as originally planned, but recently this past April.</li>
            <li>Since most of the reviews complained of shedding I decided to only apply every other day in between my co washing once daily.</li>

            <li> Just be very careful when using this product.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I havent notice ant big diffrence but its softer. But im useing a shampoo and oil that can also be helping with the softness. Still waiting for result. No negetive feelinh toward it yet,only been 3weeks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fixing to order shampoo, thanks</li>
            <li> This is a product that you have to find best way to apply on natural hair, if you use too much it can make hair heavy, but it does help hair become stronger, must be used with natural oil so hair can be supple and not hard and dry.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair is longer and thicker than ever, and I rarely get split ends. In addition, my curly hair looks great without other products when I use this. One bottle lasts for ever and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product for horse care!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my hair fuller and thicker, but it did not give me length.  I used this with Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the combination made my hair healthy and shiny.  This product is very good to improve the look of your hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my coworker swears it thickens and lengthens her hair.  I have been using it for a few months now and it does make my hair shiny and soft, but I haven&#x27;t noticed and growth or thickness change.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after watching a youtube review.  It has worked well for me.  I like the feel of my hair after I use this product and it is helping with the length of my nature hair.</li>
            <li> I started to use it after I got my hair redone with color and cut.  I measured the growth and it grew 1/2 inch in 5 weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a lot or little to others... but to me that is a lot.  I like the smell and I only used it twice a week.  I will use it everyday.  Shedding wasn&#x27;t bad for me.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. use it as a protein conditioner every two week, a nice smell to it. recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Everything it was cranked up to be....great smelling &amp; it works.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, but I haven&#x27;t seen any growth results.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product.  After three uses, I decided it was not for my hair.  My hair became very kinky at the roots and dull towards the body and ends. The product also started building up on my scalp as huge flakes. Not everyone has the same hair type so what may not have worked for mine doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else.  Just be very careful when using this product.  I highly recommend that EQyss sell it in a smaller bottle just to let women or men try it out first.  Hopefully I will be able to remedy the &amp;#34;damage&amp;#34;.  What remains of the product I now use on my dog.  It does wonders for his hair.  :-)  Too bad it couldn&#x27;t perform the same on mine.</li>
            <li> My hair looks beautiful</li>
            <li> I noticed this formula has keratin protein as the 7th to last ingredient on this &amp;#34;flowered&amp;#34; bottle. Not sure why they decided to change the formula, but because of this, I will be using 3 times a week as a leave in conditioner to see how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;If all goes well, hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to write a better review. As far as delivery goes, I got it about 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Makes my hair shinier and fuller then any other shampoo that I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> This review is for it&#x27;s use on humans ;-) I had pretty long, healthy hair to begin with for full disclosure.  However, I was trying to grow it down to my waist and couldn&#x27;t ever get past a certain point.  I can&#x27;t remember if I used one or two bottles of Mega-tek but it definitely started my hair growing like crazy.  I personally felt like I smelled like a horse but other people said they liked the smell so it may just be that I used to have horses and associate this smell with them!  As for the shedding some people experience (on animals and themselves), I feel like I always lose a lot of hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I barely write reviews however this product is very good. You might experience some shredding because its high in protein so you must take some multivitamins. My hair definitely grew. I stop using this which I regret but I am definitely going to use it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle about 8 months ago. For my personal use, I was excited about all the great reviews on YouTube as well as here.&lt;br /&gt;This product did nothing but make my hair dryer and bridle. I understand that it is protein but I am one to moisturizer, seal and deep condition religiously. So no I would not recommended. And I certainly will not be repurchasing</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m stationed in Korea and i have been natural for about 2 years but i have opted to maintain my TWA. i recently decided to start growing my hair out so i decided to purchase this product as part of my hair growth regimen after seeing amazing reviews on youtube. well i recieved my mega-tek today, it arrived early so i gave one star for that. i opened it and smelled it because some reviews said the scent wasn&#x27;t that great, but i looooooved the tropical smell so i gave a star for that and i gave another star because i was sure that i ordered one bottle but i was given an extra bottle so yay! i will give additonal stars after i begin using the product and i see a difference in hair growth and texture! i&#x27;m sooooo excited to begin! UPDATE!!!! ok so i have been using this product for 2 months now and i have definitely see a difference in texture. i use this product alone for 1 month and i didn&#x27;t notice much growth but i did notice my hair was extremely thick, and my edges where they were thin were getting thicker. i started combinig mega-tek and jamaica black castor oil and noticed alllooooot of hair growth along with fuller thicker hair. and after 2 months i&#x27;m still on the first bottle sooo yes buy this product for yourself for your animals whatever it working for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair grew a quarter of an inch in 3 weeks and is more full and manageable. Not only that, but its now shiny and the split ends aren&#x27;t as noticeable. My daughter is 8 months old and she likes to pull out my hair but is having a harder time doing so now because its stronger now. Second time I ordered because its a great product. Should be on the Amazon subscription plan.</li>
            <li> great product, great experience</li>
            <li> After much reading on hair care forums, I decided to splurge and purchase this product. Amazon is a wonderful world in which to buy virtually anything you could ever want; however, I was able to get this find at a local Tractor Supply Company (TSC) store in my immediate area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore wigs and achieved 12 months of new growth with no intention of going natural. After getting a relaxer, I sought to thicken up my hair as it was long (almost BSL), but not as full as I would prefer. Initially, I used the product straight in an applicator bottle and applied it to my scalp 1-2x a week for about a month after getting the relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a lengthy nor complicated hair regimen. I have sometimes sensitive skin and must be cautious about idly using things on my hair and scalp. After concerns about shedding/breakage, I decided not to use this product straight since my hair was newly relaxed. In an 12-oz applicator bottle I mixed 1/2 bottle Megatek along with a hair oil concoction of sulfur, jojoba, wheatgerm, sweet almond, argan, jamaican black castor (approximately 1 oz of each oil - not exact measurements). I apply this mixture 1-2x weekly when I remember to do so (as I am quite lax about doing it routinely) and do not rinse it out. I still wear wigs daily and wash my hair once every two-three weeks with whatever shampoo I have on hand, nothing particularly special. I use various conditioners enhanced with silk amino acids, again whatever I have on hand (I am not partial to specific shampoos and conditioners, but may do sulfate free occasionally). Note: I do not use the Megatek as a deep conditioner or regular conditioner with each of my washes. I just apply it (mixed with the oils) directly to my scalp via the applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Megatek since June of this year in a not-so-consistent fashion. After less than three months of what I consider relatively sparse usage of the product, my roots are wavy and my edges fuzzy. I can&#x27;t say how much growth at this point as it is still very early, but I have noticed that my hair has thickened up. On the couple of occasions that I have worn it out, it appears healthier and fuller. I will add that I take daily supplements of iron, B-complex, MSM 1500 mg, and odorless garlic (1,000-1500 mg to avoid/reduce shedding/breakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in December after I get a new relaxer to post results. So far, so good. I thankfully have not experienced headaches or shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/13/15 - Update: I didn&#x27;t get the relaxer in December as originally planned, but recently this past April. I have not used this product since my initial review and it is now part of my product junkie arsenal. I do plan to use it up, but most likely will not purchase again unless I really do see a difference in my hair. Because I use different products and not just one or two consistently, it would be hard to attribute growth to any one thing. I am looking to reduce the amount of products used concurrently. Right now, I use the ApHogee line for the protein I need. You can get most of the ApHogee products for the cost of one bottle of Megatek.n&#x27;t say how much growth at this point as it is still very early, but I have noticed that my hair has thickened up.

            <li> [Update Sept 17, 2014] No longer going to use this as a protein conditioner (1 tbsp of megaton, EVOO, and 5tbsp of Hello Hydration conditioner). WHAT I DID FOR MY COWASH: Prepoo, MegaTek, ORS(steamer for an hour) - WAY TOO MUCH SHEDDING WHILE DETANGLING IN THE SHOWER. My edges did grow out and thicken but something about the products is not working will with my relaxed hair, I think i left it in too long, last time I only left it in for a minute. It seems like something you have to put on and immediately rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try mixing it with JBCO and Megatek - but will wait for a while, hair needs a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update Sept 14, 2014] Significantly reduced shedding for me during the week in between weekly washes. And there seems to be new growth near my edges after one application.&lt;br /&gt;Will post update after using it with my co-wash routine and new hair steamer(so excited!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are my quick notes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Arrived on Sept 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;-On the day I planned to wash my hair, so we will see if it is a happy coincidence&lt;br /&gt;-Product Name(New Version with Flowers)&lt;br /&gt;-EQyss grooming products, Mega-Tek Equine Rebuilder, 16Fl oz&lt;br /&gt;-My goal is to rebuild my hair thickness, I am at bra strap length but with significant short comings&lt;br /&gt;-Prior: Hair was feeling a little dry, week 3 post relaxer of using MegaTek&lt;br /&gt;-After 2nd week post: I washed hair an experience a lot of shedding ( I mixed Aloe Vera with Monoi Shampoo, followed by Argon Oil Creme of Nature shampoo, experienced a lot of shedding&lt;br /&gt;-During the week, my hair did not shed, it shed more towards the end of the week and it felt dryer - it was time for hair wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGIMENT FOR MEGA TEK&lt;br /&gt;-Pre-poo for about an hour on dry hair with Hello Hydration by Herbal Essence, rinse&lt;br /&gt;-Shampoo Hair with Argon Oil Creme of Nature Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-Shedding and hair felt soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;-MegaTek (1tbsp of Mega Tek, 4 Tbsp of Hello Hydration, 1 Tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil)&lt;br /&gt;-Mixed- I was not taking any chances, can&#x27;t afford anymore shedding, my next step is to chop and start all over but trying to be patient&lt;br /&gt;-Applied the mixture to hair and only left it on for 1 minute, rinse&lt;br /&gt;-I could feel instantly how the hair texture felt harder as soon as I applied it&lt;br /&gt;-I am not going to apply it as a hair conditioner with JBCO until I see how using it as a protein conditioner does for my hair&lt;br /&gt;-Lastly, Applied generous amount of ORS Replinishing Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;-Syran Wrap and slept over night(hair dryer on the fritz, can&#x27;t wait for my steamer)&lt;br /&gt;-Stay tuned for update after a week using product for first time and what it has done to my sheddingOil)&lt;br /&gt;-Mixed- I was not taking any chances, can&#x27;t afford anymore shedding, my next step is to chop and start all over but trying to be patient&lt;br /&gt;-Applied the mixture to hair and only left it on for 1 minute, rinse&lt;br /&gt;-I could feel instantly how the hair texture felt harder as soon as I applied it&lt;br /&gt;-I am not going to apply it as a hair conditioner with JBCO until I see how using it as a protein conditioner does for my hair&lt;br /&gt;-Lastly, Applied generous amount of ORS Replinishing Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;-Syran Wrap and slept over night(hair dryer on the fritz, can&#x27;t wait for my steamer)&lt;br /&gt;-Stay tuned for update after a week using product for first time and what it has done to my shedding</li>
            <li> FOR A BLACK WOMAN; THIS PRODUCT WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO DETANGLE MY HAIR.  USED IT FOR FOUR MONTHS AND FOUND IT TO BE WONDERFUL.  BUT I REALLY DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I WILL BUY IT AGAIN, IT&#x27;S EXPENSIVE THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT I FEEL CAN DO THE SAME THING.</li>
            <li> I wish I could take a picture of my hair right now and post it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, it is seriously SUPER long and it looks a lot healthier. I take a lot of medicine that has a lot of side effects (one of them is dry skin and hair) when I started using this product it made my hair look a lot better and not as dry/unhealthy. I love it and highly recommend it. Don&#x27;t use too much or use it too often! I sometimes use it just once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews but since I love the reviews I get off Amazon I decided to write one on this product. I have a major bald spot at the top of my head from wearing weaves etc. I found this product on a forum and with all the reviews and YouTube videos raving about how it grew in bald spots I had to try it. I have been using this product for almost 5 weeks now and I can say that I really have not seen a significant difference in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t until I added biotin that I noticed some growth. Since most of the reviews complained of shedding I decided to only apply every other day in between my co washing once daily. This month I decided to try it twice per day on the days i apply to see if that helps since from reviews and on the directions it states the more you use the better results. I have decided that I will stick with a three month rule with everything that I try so that is the reason why I will continue to use. After this month if I don&#x27;t see a huge difference I may try everyday for the third month? Overall the product isn&#x27;t bad it smells great and really goes in my hair with no problems. I will update maybe even take a pic once I get to three months</li>
