            <li>The smell is pleasant, basically non-existent.</li>

            <li>The smell is also good.</li>
            <li>Still searching for a good anti itch lotion.</li>
            <li>I found Curel Itch Defense to be somewhat denser than the original Curel lotion, which is excellent for hands and arms.  </li>
            <li>I use the Itch Defense version for my legs and feet after showering and it does an exceptional job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>feels soooo good and looks a thousand times better!</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion at a great price</li>

            <li>Awesome price for two large bottles of lotion!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Im soooooo glad i did!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazingly.</li>
            <li>My sister told me how well this worked for her and her girls, so I tried some and much to my surprise (and great relief!)</li>
            <li>It made my legs feel nice</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s eczema or chronic urticaria, this lotion is both inexpensive and highly effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>This lotion is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>They now buy and use this lotion in their own homes!&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>really effective and quality product</li>
            <li>I have to admit I&#x27;ve misjudged Curel; it turns out this is an excellent quality formula that I probably would not have tried if it weren&#x27;t for the NEA Seal on the bottle.long time, but I&#x27;ll live.    </li>
            <li>In fact, I did a lot of online research to find a good, strong lotion lacking those problem ingredients before settling on Curel Itch Defense.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion ever for my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suitable for babies since my son is 6 now and has been using it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>He liked the aveeno one slightly more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Curel for over 20 years and love it, but when I found this Itch Defense version, I was absolutely thrilled at how well it softened and protected my skin.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s not the best for anti-itch action</li>
            <li>Curel lotion is a great product and priced right.  </li>
            <li>I tried ointments, Aveno Baby Eczema Creme, L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s mama-baby balm, and this was FAAR more superior, and even friendly on the $.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my pregnant wife she didnt get one stretch mark!!</li>
            <li>I am having problems with my legs being incredibly itchy since I moved to New Jersey.  </li>
            <li>Great to put on right before bed and not be kept awake by a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok on my skin, but my husband who has eczema felt burning after applying it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>According to the label it says it is for adults and safe for babies as well.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, very soothing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my go to lotion after trying most on the market.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work on keeping her skin hydrated and not itchy, though, which is sure a plus.</li>
            <li>for her, wich I love.</li>
            <li>also love this lotion because no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was scented, but I am very happy that I can finally have itch free legs!</li>
            <li>If I am sure to lather on this lotion every day I am guaranteed to not have any eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li>The most soothing lotion I have found.</li>
            <li>mostly my lower legs.</li>
            <li>It soothes the hurt and the problem mostly goes away if i keep this routine up for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, i bought another hand creme for use at nighttime that seems to work better, but is too greasy for me to use during the day.</li>
            <li>We have tried everything and have seem many doctors.</li>
            <li>This lotion works better than the steroid creams.</li>
            <li>love this Curel.  </li>
            <li>My son had eczema as a baby, and we tried many of the creams intended for babies.</li>
            <li>In fact it works better on my face than some of my fancy department store creams.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>works better than anything out there</li>
            <li>I find Aveeno or Physiogel AI work much better for me.</li>
            <li>Our son suffered from eczema from age 6-9 month, and nothing helped to make things better.</li>
            <li>We bought it, used, it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>my dougter  has egzema, and this is help, it doesnt make it disappear, but help to feel better for sure</li>
            <li>We love it and believe it does help her skin.</li>
            <li>love this cream -</li>
            <li>My bottle was place inside a plastic bag, however the nozzle had ripped through the box and lotion was leaking out the top and was all over the cover of a book that was also in the box.</li>
            <li>After a month, most of my dauhgter&#x27;s itching is gone.</li>
            <li>Be sure to pick the itch defense from the many varieties of Curel lotions ☼</li>
            <li>I will give more feedback after we have used it for a while.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, yet</li>
            <li>Love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Target</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those of us with exceptionally dryer skin and need a more effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>got this based on the good reviews and it seems to be helping, quite a lot, and pretty immediately.</li>
            <li>lotion itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have been using Curel Fragrance Free Lotion, the original formula, with great success.  </li>
            <li>I add oil since I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>One tip our doc told me: use it within 3 minutes after getting out of the bath so that the skin can absorb it more easily while the pores are still &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Best lotion for itchy dry skin!</li>
            <li>Both are said to be excellent for eczema but many eczema moisturizers will have one or the other, this has both.</li>
            <li>It would wake me up at nights which was becoming unbearable.</li>
            <li>This may be an excellent product for someone with true eczema or another medical condition.</li>
            <li>This is fragrance free, which I need, and does an okay job of moisturizing, but not as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li>The 20oz with 25% more free.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use it and since buying this, my mother-in-law bought some because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I do not have psoriasis, which is what this particular product is marketed towards, I find the original formula more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li>Great, basic lotion.</li>
            <li>I needed to purchase another item to get free shipping and needed lotion.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth, leaving you skin silky.</li>
            <li>Some fragrance free products contain masking fragrance - a chemical added to negate all the smells found in an item.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the fragrance free; although it does have a bit of a nonoffensive smell to it.</li>
            <li>It makes our skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li>that is fragrance free, so I will keep using Curel until I find something else.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic lotion for people with eczema.</li>
            <li>His dermologist confirmed that he has eczema.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many lotions (gold bond, lubriderm, etc), and didn&#x27;t have any success.  </li>
            <li>Hope it has the same results for the rest of you, because it provides great relief for me.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, Curel is one of the last companies I would ever think to turn to for this type of product; I know they&#x27;re a fairly popular brand, but I just didn&#x27;t think of them as making \\&quot;serious\\&quot; products for skin conditions.</li>
            <li>It has worked, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It may be great for psoriasis, but for me, the other formula is much better.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Curel Fragrance Free Original.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy</li>
            <li>Doctors and Pharmacies need to get with the show and start featuring and recommending this lotion, because unlike many of the brands they do tout, this one does exactly what the label implies.  </li>
            <li>There is no horrible perfume smell and its a really big bottle and best of all it actually works!</li>
            <li>sometimes that I&#x27;d wake up at night to scratch, and when I got up in the morning, my legs would have significant scratches on them that scabbed and took forever to heal.  </li>
            <li>Now, 2 months since we started using this lotion, his skin is nice and soft, and he rarely scratches any more.</li>
            <li>My hubby has a skin problem and this lotion helps him a great deal with the itching and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Tried this for that dry winter itch skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff to relieve itchy, dry , winter skin--works almost immediately!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing for my itchy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I think it really has made a difference with my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>No perfume smell, just a good daily moisturizer that does not leave your skin with an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Good product - would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Super creamy.</li>
            <li>I found this too be effective and better than any other cream on market besides prescription.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient makes it so effective, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and oily like most lotions.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have a sweet baby smell like burt&#x27;s bees but the no itching wins any day.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Best overall lotion if you have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It pretty much has no smell at all and is clean and light.</li>
            <li>Also cheaper than many of the others, and the bottle is large so you don&#x27;t have to constantly get more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had severe Psoriasis for over 5 years, and this lotion is one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that works really great.</li>
            <li>curel really worked and it made his skin smooth</li>
            <li>I had a cast removed on my leg recently and needed a nice lotion that was not greasy.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t write tons of reviews and rarely lengthy ones</li>
            <li>It is so nice going through the day without constantly itching</li>
            <li>The 24 hour moisturizing Curel in the red print bottle works better but is not fragrance free, so it is always a trade off.</li>
            <li>is some people are more sensitive to bug bites than others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is worth the try and money.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried the other Curel lotions, they are OK, but this is significantly better for allergy prone, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Curel gets it just right, always has.</li>
            <li>This give it just the right consistency for me</li>
            <li>Curel &amp;#34;Itch Defense&amp;#34; certainly goes on the offense with this product!  </li>
            <li>This is not greasy, soaks in quickly and really does help.</li>
            <li>Now I never get dry skin, yes I use it every time I get out of the shower, but I&#x27;ll be honest if for some reason I skip a day</li>
            <li>Buying it on Amazon is super easy too because it seems to have disappeared from my local stores.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and the large size lasted a long time, considering my grands used it too.</li>
            <li>Recently the eczema became more severe and we started taking her to the dermatologist every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different methods, lotions, creams, and treatments to combat this issue for me, but to not avail.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, I had my first bout with winter itch</li>
            <li>Dosnt break me out and dosnt feel greasy but really moisturises!</li>
            <li>The spots on his cheeks were gone after the first day, and his hands cleared up in 3 days.  </li>
            <li>For the last 17 months we have tried many products (aquaphor, eucerin, cervae, cetaphil restoraderm, hydrocortisone, kenalog).</li>
            <li>Very thankful for this lotion!</li>
            <li>this helps so much!</li>
            <li>My skin looked so much better and didn&#x27;t feel all greasy or gross.</li>
            <li>This lotion is not like regular lotion where one gets a tablespoon or more and use it on one arm.</li>
            <li>Curel Itch Defense lotion worked when I first used it.</li>
            <li>try this first before going to dermatologist and spending money.  </li>
            <li>First, I will tell you some things you should already know: eczema is a highly individual condition, it is genetic, cyclical, and with most of us for life.</li>
            <li>worked as quickly or as consistently as this.</li>
            <li>Thanks Curel!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The pump is pretty</li>
            <li>I had given up on most lotions and soaps for my son&#x27;s moderate and persistent eczema.  </li>
            <li>, my skin stays pretty moist.</li>
            <li>excellent product ,i bought this lotion for my girlfriend who has bad legs due to diabetes,she has used it every day an her legs look an feel great</li>
            <li>It goes on thick but spreads VERY nicely.</li>
            <li>But for the other days, this lotion is nice.  </li>
            <li>if you usually have better luck with thick creams and/or ointments, this may not be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly into my skin, and DOESN&#x27;T leave my face looking or feeling greasy, like many other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>There are a few other tricks I use to maintain our sons healthy skin, this is just one of the tools in my basket of healthy, steroid free collection!  </li>
            <li>At the local store I get a fraction as much lotion for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>I have used it a long time and Amazon has a better price than anywhere I have found elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>SO much lotion for a first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the winter I get the most god-awful dry itchy feet.  </li>
            <li>Every winter, the skin on my legs has always been dry and itchy, and I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
            <li>this is ok for dry skin but not for rash or itching - I have combined it with another stronger anti itch lotion</li>
            <li>My husband and I purchased this lotion for our 1 year old baby boy who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and mild eczema.</li>
            <li>Even helped with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would get almost invisible bumps/sores/red spots that feel like a large area of my leg needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li>, I ordered the large 20 oz bottle from Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, two of their nearby stores were not carrying this exact product any longer, so I signed up with Amazon for their auto-ship program to make sure I get a supply every other month when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel</li>
            <li>We love it so much that our whole family uses it to help with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle enough for a light layer on your face.</li>
            <li>I really struggled it for a couple of seasons, even going to the doctor and getting some steroid ointment that really didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li>It was really beginning to affect my life.  </li>
            <li>I found the NEA website (National Eczema Association) and it&#x27;s been very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million Curel</li>
            <li>With my Psoriasis, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a decline in itching with this lotion; however, the quality of the moisturizing makes up for that.</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily ands</li>
            <li>It has a light, sweet, barely noticeable scent (likely from some of the oils in it, as there is no added</li>
            <li>Benadryl didn&#x27;t seem to work much either.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I just get very itchy legs after I shave and tried this to combat the discomfort and keep from ravaging my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all types of lotions and oils, and nothing seemed to really work.</li>
            <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much @</li>
            <li>and it really does stop the itching.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it</li>
            <li>If you use too much at one time you will feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Curel really helped.</li>
            <li>And whatever they put in their Itch Defense lotion really soothes inflamed skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing lotion without being oily.  </li>
            <li>And, it really has kept it away.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very humid and</li>
            <li>The anti-itch properties have really kept skin problems and rashes at bay.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m really picky about my lotions.</li>
            <li>Really helps and she hasn&#x27;t had any flare ups since then.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with aquaphor baby gentle wash and shampoo and she hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the price is really reasonable</li>
            <li>get really itchy skin in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has really helped my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like the tacky feeling it leaves you with at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of the products really worked for her.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>If you or your child has eczema, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>This product really works</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Walmart or CVS.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced also.  </li>
            <li>worked very well for us, the whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li>Really heals your skin.</li>
            <li>I decided a day ago to go online to find a lotion that would help me and low and behold Curel Miracle no more itch and beautiful supple skin.</li>
            <li>One thing good, at least without the fragrance, mosquitos aren&#x27;t attracted to you so much and there aren&#x27;t headaches and nausea from the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have had excema all my life and tried soo many different products, from prescriptions to over the counters to natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Some people are more sensitive to it, but i find it no different than most other creams.</li>
            <li>I had spent hours comparing labels on some very expensive eczema-friendly moisturizers and here was one that seemed to fit the bill AND came in a huge 20 ounce bottle for a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was skeptical at first because it is a lotion and not a cream, but it works very well and perhaps better than most creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>was looking around on Amazon for some other magical ointment that I had yet to discover when I found this Curel product.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to use so many other products trying to deal with the itching flaking plus buying a humidifier for my home.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other product I have used on his skin.</li>
            <li>But in other places Curel does its magic.    </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and have aging dry skin, and have not found anything that works better yet</li>
            <li>I have found very few moisturizers that work as effectively as this one.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for extra dry skin, I try so many others and keep coming back to this brand.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry and flaky and this helps me stay comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I noticed as I gotten older my skin has gotten drier and itchier.  </li>
            <li>I really am particular about lotions and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Curel.  </li>
            <li>My skin is left soft &amp; itch free.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd repeat buy as my other family members love it too!</li>
            <li>It was not thin and watery but nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Rather, I think it&#x27;s combination of him getting older and</li>
            <li>Doctors often recommend something like Eucerin or Aquafor with their heavy mineral oil component but my skin hates most any kind of oil and will tolerate no more than just a dollop of petrolatum chased with a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Since there is no doubt that there are side-effects of cortisone, discussion seems to focus on how severe the effects are, I didn&#x27;t follow the doctor&#x27;s prescriptions and decided to try Curel Itch Defense as it came highly recommended from online reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  </li>

            <li>Hy husband has eczema that recently developed and he says that this cream has really helped.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The doctor said this was normal.</li>
            <li>when applying this lotion it feels like it&#x27;s heavy and sitting on top of my skin</li>
            <li>Normally I would just apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone, which helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>I have year round mild-severe eczema on my hands and this is my favorite lotion for maintenance to ward off outbreaks.</li>
            <li>and this is pretty much the only lotion she can use.  </li>
            <li>fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to someone with only mildly dry skin, as it&#x27;s probably overkill, but it is awesome if you have extreme issues with dry</li>
            <li>Love it, and will continue to use it as her overall moisturizing lotion after baths, and I take a dab at it too when ever my skin feels dry.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and flaky skin, and this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found (after trying MANY)</li>
            <li>My daughter has super dry skin, so I use this one her.</li>
            <li>We would slather so much cream and top it off thickly with Vaseline afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Considering it usually starts with the first pair of long pants I consider this a huge success.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes in lotions and breakout into a rash or hives.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It goes on with a heavier feel, but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>One has severe eczema and this is the only OTC lotion that works when used consistently.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing of this product, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many products in the past: Aveeno, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aquaphor, California Baby, Cetaphil, Cerave, you name it - we&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>Once he was old enough I tried this and it works better than any other we used.</li>
            <li>But I really have not changed my eating habits and eat the same food I normally have eaten for years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on such positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE and costs just a few cents more than the small bottle at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>It provides very fast relief for itchy skin, and long term it seems to help with her eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle, will buy again in a few months when it runs out</li>
            <li>and she used Curel Itch Defense to clear it up.</li>
            <li>I had an itchy rash on my face and found out that it helped clear up irritation caused by my acne treatments as well.</li>
            <li>my 7 week old newborn had either worsening eczema, cradle cap, or a reaction to my sisters cats.</li>
            <li>her skin is clear and baby soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and tends to be prone to the itch-ys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything else, and not found anything which works as well as this.  </li>
            <li>Every  winter time my legs and back has very itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 18 months old had eczema since she was 6 months.</li>
            <li>My 23-month old daughter has had eczema since she was 2 months old.  </li>
            <li>This has been our go-to brand for almost two years now and so far, we&#x27;ve had no reactions to it.  </li>
            <li>My 3.5 year old son has eczema on his hands and face.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old has excema and has had it since 4 months old.</li>
            <li>but it was too early for my itching problem.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for our toddler as well.</li>
            <li>**mart and was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has had eczema since she was a month old.</li>
            <li>I bought a few and got free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on my daughter for six months now ( since she was six months old).</li>
            <li>But, if you are sensitive nothing helps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer the regular unscented Curel lotion, which I would give  5 stars to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema pretty much as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft and stops the itching when I itch.</li>
            <li>She has had eczema sicne 4 months old.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has had eczema ever since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my 7month old baby son, who used to have severe case of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>
            <li>This one seems a bit sticky, and almost made my skin a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema for over 10 years and this is by far my preferred body lotion.</li>
            <li>so far it seems working on my two-year-old&#x27;s hands and releases some itch of his skin</li>
            <li>that keeps my face soft, supple, hydrated, and reduces redness.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gone back to just using plain Vaseline for now as it works much better than this for us.</li>
            <li>If you have dry itchy skin this is a must worked the first time I used it</li>
            <li>No other lotion has completely rid my skin of itching and made it o soft with out greasiness and</li>
            <li>to it&#x27;s un-fragranced nature it can have a slightly odd sent that dissipates quickly after applying.</li>
            <li>While we had high hopes for this product after reading raving reviews, it just didn&#x27;t moisturize nor alleviate the itching that comes along with eczema well enough for us to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would probably try it except I prefer lotions that have a high EWG score for low carcinogens and neurotoxins.</li>
            <li>I use it more on the outer of the face and less in the center.</li>
            <li>While this lotion is a tad greasy, I&#x27;m willing to put up with that, as it&#x27;s the first lotion that&#x27;s cleared up some extreme dry patches of skin for me.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this lotion long, but it seems to really help our skin.</li>
            <li>As long as we apply this to her skin every day, her eczema really does stay at bay.</li>
            <li>I even went back to my home state for a few months and my legs were fine.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this cream especially in the winter, since it&#x27;s drier.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with severe dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with dry skin, eczema.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my dry skin and prevents bouts of itching.</li>
            <li>My Eczema recently came back after 30 years of being in remission much to my surprise and horror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is the only complaint, but I&#x27;ll hapily pay more for lotion that works.</li>
            <li>The lotion does have an unique feel but a small price to pay for something that works.  </li>
            <li>The reviews posted by other Amazon customers were very helpful!  </li>
            <li>We just started using last week, and so far we like it!  </li>
            <li>My dry sensitive thanks Curel for this terrific lotion and</li>
            <li>or it is so light that it&#x27;s hard to notice</li>
            <li>My go-to artillery is Lidex for my fingers and a 50/50 mix of cheap clotrimazole and 1% cortizone for everywhere else, but for head-to-toe after-bath moisture this is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sometimes get eczema in the summer, and I have itchy skin in general.  </li>
            <li>They were all temporary and for one week his skin would clear up,  but would come back.  </li>
            <li>Three days of daily application and bathing with Dove soap for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>People suffering with Eczema may have a different experience as far as the difference in itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My baby had eczema since month 3, topical, but it never let up completely until I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and it helps when I feel like my eczema is going to flair up in an area I can sometimes stop it early with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that works for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>This is by far my one &amp; only lotion.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that heals and works on my son who is 16 month old.  </li>
            <li>I apply this lotion on my skin, and my skin feels moist and soft after 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li>My feet have finally healed up and I feel close to being back to normal now.  </li>
            <li>No more dry itchy skin worth the money I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>The only draw back is she has a very sensitive skin on her face and neck where this lotion stings for a bit after application.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will buy again after the bottle is empty, will probably try something else to see if something is better, but it will stay on the \\&quot;fall back to\\&quot; list...</li>
            <li>Other than living in Hawaii, I haven&#x27;t found anything to help much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion for use wherever skin is very dry.</li>
            <li>I will recomendamos this lotion for new mom that have baby with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>Myself &amp; my children have very sensitive skin &amp; some fragrance allergies, also dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m pregnant with my 2nd child and I am unbelievably ITCHY.</li>
            <li>It took a while, maybe a solid month of applying twice a day and then covering my feet with cotton socks, but eventually the itching subsided to where now I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ so dry itchy skin is a daily occurrences.  </li>
            <li>Start with a small amount like a pea size and work up with little more at a time.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin which is exacerbated by my frequent hand washing with soap.</li>
            <li>I also like that I can use this for my two year old son if he&#x27;s feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have eczema, but just generally dry, itchy, and sensitive skin and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li>She is only two, so there is no way to help other than covering her up with long sleeves and pants in the middle of our hot, humid summers.</li>
            <li>It has been working very well in the northern California weather, and definitely calms down the itch.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that would constantly feel dry and get itchy.</li>
            <li>: I find the consistency a little thick and hard to easily spread, so I run my \\&quot;spreading\\&quot; hand under cool tap water before squirting on a dollop of the lotion.</li>

            <li> I love how it moisture my baby skin without leaving it oily and best of all is unsented.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, basically non-existent.</li>
            <li> but it had good reviews and at that stage I was trying everything I could get my hands on just to make it</li>
            <li> It strikes a good balance with moisturizing</li>

            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The smell is also good.</li>
            <li> Still searching for a good anti itch lotion.</li>
            <li> I found Curel Itch Defense to be somewhat denser than the original Curel lotion, which is excellent for hands and arms.  </li>
            <li> I use the Itch Defense version for my legs and feet after showering and it does an exceptional job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> feels soooo good and looks a thousand times better!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion at a great price</li>
            <li> my allergic nose is so happy to find it&#x27;s fragrance free!  </li>
            <li> Awesome price for two large bottles of lotion!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> use Hustle Butter for the first week and once the tattoo starts to peel I switch to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for me!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Im soooooo glad i did!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly.</li>
            <li> My sister told me how well this worked for her and her girls, so I tried some and much to my surprise (and great relief!)</li>
            <li> It made my legs feel nice</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s eczema or chronic urticaria, this lotion is both inexpensive and highly effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> They now buy and use this lotion in their own homes!&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> really effective and quality product</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;ve misjudged Curel; it turns out this is an excellent quality formula that I probably would not have tried if it weren&#x27;t for the NEA Seal on the bottle.long time, but I&#x27;ll live.    </li>
            <li> In fact, I did a lot of online research to find a good, strong lotion lacking those problem ingredients before settling on Curel Itch Defense.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever for my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suitable for babies since my son is 6 now and has been using it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> He liked the aveeno one slightly more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Curel for over 20 years and love it, but when I found this Itch Defense version, I was absolutely thrilled at how well it softened and protected my skin.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not the best for anti-itch action</li>
            <li> Curel lotion is a great product and priced right.  </li>
            <li> I tried ointments, Aveno Baby Eczema Creme, L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s mama-baby balm, and this was FAAR more superior, and even friendly on the $.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my pregnant wife she didnt get one stretch mark!!</li>
            <li> I am having problems with my legs being incredibly itchy since I moved to New Jersey.  </li>
            <li> Great to put on right before bed and not be kept awake by a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok on my skin, but my husband who has eczema felt burning after applying it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> According to the label it says it is for adults and safe for babies as well.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, very soothing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my go to lotion after trying most on the market.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to work on keeping her skin hydrated and not itchy, though, which is sure a plus.</li>
            <li> for her, wich I love.</li>
            <li> also love this lotion because no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was scented, but I am very happy that I can finally have itch free legs!</li>
            <li> If I am sure to lather on this lotion every day I am guaranteed to not have any eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li> The most soothing lotion I have found.</li>
            <li> mostly my lower legs.</li>
            <li> It soothes the hurt and the problem mostly goes away if i keep this routine up for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, i bought another hand creme for use at nighttime that seems to work better, but is too greasy for me to use during the day.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything and have seem many doctors.</li>
            <li> This lotion works better than the steroid creams.</li>
            <li> love this Curel.  </li>
            <li> My son had eczema as a baby, and we tried many of the creams intended for babies.</li>
            <li> In fact it works better on my face than some of my fancy department store creams.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> works better than anything out there</li>
            <li> I find Aveeno or Physiogel AI work much better for me.</li>
            <li> Our son suffered from eczema from age 6-9 month, and nothing helped to make things better.</li>
            <li> We bought it, used, it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> my dougter  has egzema, and this is help, it doesnt make it disappear, but help to feel better for sure</li>
            <li> We love it and believe it does help her skin.</li>
            <li> love this cream -</li>
            <li> My bottle was place inside a plastic bag, however the nozzle had ripped through the box and lotion was leaking out the top and was all over the cover of a book that was also in the box.</li>
            <li> After a month, most of my dauhgter&#x27;s itching is gone.</li>
            <li> Be sure to pick the itch defense from the many varieties of Curel lotions ☼</li>
            <li> I will give more feedback after we have used it for a while.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, yet</li>
            <li> Love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Better price than Target</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those of us with exceptionally dryer skin and need a more effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> got this based on the good reviews and it seems to be helping, quite a lot, and pretty immediately.</li>
            <li> lotion itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Curel Fragrance Free Lotion, the original formula, with great success.  </li>
            <li> I add oil since I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> One tip our doc told me: use it within 3 minutes after getting out of the bath so that the skin can absorb it more easily while the pores are still &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for itchy dry skin!</li>
            <li> Both are said to be excellent for eczema but many eczema moisturizers will have one or the other, this has both.</li>
            <li> It would wake me up at nights which was becoming unbearable.</li>
            <li> This may be an excellent product for someone with true eczema or another medical condition.</li>
            <li> This is fragrance free, which I need, and does an okay job of moisturizing, but not as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li> The 20oz with 25% more free.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use it and since buying this, my mother-in-law bought some because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I do not have psoriasis, which is what this particular product is marketed towards, I find the original formula more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li> Great, basic lotion.</li>
            <li> I needed to purchase another item to get free shipping and needed lotion.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth, leaving you skin silky.</li>
            <li> Some fragrance free products contain masking fragrance - a chemical added to negate all the smells found in an item.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the fragrance free; although it does have a bit of a nonoffensive smell to it.</li>
            <li> It makes our skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li> that is fragrance free, so I will keep using Curel until I find something else.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic lotion for people with eczema.</li>
            <li> His dermologist confirmed that he has eczema.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many lotions (gold bond, lubriderm, etc), and didn&#x27;t have any success.  </li>
            <li> Hope it has the same results for the rest of you, because it provides great relief for me.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, Curel is one of the last companies I would ever think to turn to for this type of product; I know they&#x27;re a fairly popular brand, but I just didn&#x27;t think of them as making \\&quot;serious\\&quot; products for skin conditions.</li>
            <li> It has worked, so far so good.</li>
            <li> It may be great for psoriasis, but for me, the other formula is much better.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Curel Fragrance Free Original.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and creamy</li>
            <li> Doctors and Pharmacies need to get with the show and start featuring and recommending this lotion, because unlike many of the brands they do tout, this one does exactly what the label implies.  </li>
            <li> There is no horrible perfume smell and its a really big bottle and best of all it actually works!</li>
            <li> sometimes that I&#x27;d wake up at night to scratch, and when I got up in the morning, my legs would have significant scratches on them that scabbed and took forever to heal.  </li>
            <li> Now, 2 months since we started using this lotion, his skin is nice and soft, and he rarely scratches any more.</li>
            <li> My hubby has a skin problem and this lotion helps him a great deal with the itching and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Tried this for that dry winter itch skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to relieve itchy, dry , winter skin--works almost immediately!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for my itchy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I think it really has made a difference with my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> No perfume smell, just a good daily moisturizer that does not leave your skin with an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Good product - would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Super creamy.</li>
            <li> I found this too be effective and better than any other cream on market besides prescription.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient makes it so effective, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and oily like most lotions.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a sweet baby smell like burt&#x27;s bees but the no itching wins any day.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Best overall lotion if you have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It pretty much has no smell at all and is clean and light.</li>
            <li> Also cheaper than many of the others, and the bottle is large so you don&#x27;t have to constantly get more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe Psoriasis for over 5 years, and this lotion is one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that works really great.</li>
            <li> curel really worked and it made his skin smooth</li>
            <li> I had a cast removed on my leg recently and needed a nice lotion that was not greasy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t write tons of reviews and rarely lengthy ones</li>
            <li> It is so nice going through the day without constantly itching</li>
            <li> The 24 hour moisturizing Curel in the red print bottle works better but is not fragrance free, so it is always a trade off.</li>
            <li> is some people are more sensitive to bug bites than others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is worth the try and money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried the other Curel lotions, they are OK, but this is significantly better for allergy prone, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Curel gets it just right, always has.</li>
            <li> This give it just the right consistency for me</li>
            <li> Curel &amp;#34;Itch Defense&amp;#34; certainly goes on the offense with this product!  </li>
            <li> This is not greasy, soaks in quickly and really does help.</li>
            <li> Now I never get dry skin, yes I use it every time I get out of the shower, but I&#x27;ll be honest if for some reason I skip a day</li>
            <li> Buying it on Amazon is super easy too because it seems to have disappeared from my local stores.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and the large size lasted a long time, considering my grands used it too.</li>
            <li> Recently the eczema became more severe and we started taking her to the dermatologist every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different methods, lotions, creams, and treatments to combat this issue for me, but to not avail.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I had my first bout with winter itch</li>
            <li> Dosnt break me out and dosnt feel greasy but really moisturises!</li>
            <li> The spots on his cheeks were gone after the first day, and his hands cleared up in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> For the last 17 months we have tried many products (aquaphor, eucerin, cervae, cetaphil restoraderm, hydrocortisone, kenalog).</li>
            <li> Very thankful for this lotion!</li>
            <li> this helps so much!</li>
            <li> My skin looked so much better and didn&#x27;t feel all greasy or gross.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not like regular lotion where one gets a tablespoon or more and use it on one arm.</li>
            <li> Curel Itch Defense lotion worked when I first used it.</li>
            <li> try this first before going to dermatologist and spending money.  </li>
            <li> First, I will tell you some things you should already know: eczema is a highly individual condition, it is genetic, cyclical, and with most of us for life.</li>
            <li> worked as quickly or as consistently as this.</li>
            <li> Thanks Curel!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The pump is pretty</li>
            <li> I had given up on most lotions and soaps for my son&#x27;s moderate and persistent eczema.  </li>
            <li> , my skin stays pretty moist.</li>
            <li> excellent product ,i bought this lotion for my girlfriend who has bad legs due to diabetes,she has used it every day an her legs look an feel great</li>
            <li> It goes on thick but spreads VERY nicely.</li>
            <li> But for the other days, this lotion is nice.  </li>
            <li> if you usually have better luck with thick creams and/or ointments, this may not be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly into my skin, and DOESN&#x27;T leave my face looking or feeling greasy, like many other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> There are a few other tricks I use to maintain our sons healthy skin, this is just one of the tools in my basket of healthy, steroid free collection!  </li>
            <li> At the local store I get a fraction as much lotion for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> I have used it a long time and Amazon has a better price than anywhere I have found elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> SO much lotion for a first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the winter I get the most god-awful dry itchy feet.  </li>
            <li> Every winter, the skin on my legs has always been dry and itchy, and I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
            <li> this is ok for dry skin but not for rash or itching - I have combined it with another stronger anti itch lotion</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased this lotion for our 1 year old baby boy who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mild eczema.</li>
            <li> Even helped with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would get almost invisible bumps/sores/red spots that feel like a large area of my leg needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li> , I ordered the large 20 oz bottle from Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, two of their nearby stores were not carrying this exact product any longer, so I signed up with Amazon for their auto-ship program to make sure I get a supply every other month when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel</li>
            <li> We love it so much that our whole family uses it to help with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle enough for a light layer on your face.</li>
            <li> I really struggled it for a couple of seasons, even going to the doctor and getting some steroid ointment that really didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> It was really beginning to affect my life.  </li>
            <li> I found the NEA website (National Eczema Association) and it&#x27;s been very helpful.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million Curel</li>
            <li> With my Psoriasis, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a decline in itching with this lotion; however, the quality of the moisturizing makes up for that.</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily ands</li>
            <li> It has a light, sweet, barely noticeable scent (likely from some of the oils in it, as there is no added</li>
            <li> Benadryl didn&#x27;t seem to work much either.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just get very itchy legs after I shave and tried this to combat the discomfort and keep from ravaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of lotions and oils, and nothing seemed to really work.</li>
            <li> &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much @</li>
            <li> and it really does stop the itching.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it</li>
            <li> If you use too much at one time you will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Curel really helped.</li>
            <li> And whatever they put in their Itch Defense lotion really soothes inflamed skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing lotion without being oily.  </li>
            <li> And, it really has kept it away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very humid and</li>
            <li> The anti-itch properties have really kept skin problems and rashes at bay.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m really picky about my lotions.</li>
            <li> Really helps and she hasn&#x27;t had any flare ups since then.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with aquaphor baby gentle wash and shampoo and she hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the price is really reasonable</li>
            <li> get really itchy skin in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has really helped my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the tacky feeling it leaves you with at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely adore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of the products really worked for her.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> If you or your child has eczema, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Walmart or CVS.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced also.  </li>
            <li> worked very well for us, the whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li> Really heals your skin.</li>
            <li> I decided a day ago to go online to find a lotion that would help me and low and behold Curel Miracle no more itch and beautiful supple skin.</li>
            <li> One thing good, at least without the fragrance, mosquitos aren&#x27;t attracted to you so much and there aren&#x27;t headaches and nausea from the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have had excema all my life and tried soo many different products, from prescriptions to over the counters to natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Some people are more sensitive to it, but i find it no different than most other creams.</li>
            <li> I had spent hours comparing labels on some very expensive eczema-friendly moisturizers and here was one that seemed to fit the bill AND came in a huge 20 ounce bottle for a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical at first because it is a lotion and not a cream, but it works very well and perhaps better than most creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> was looking around on Amazon for some other magical ointment that I had yet to discover when I found this Curel product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to use so many other products trying to deal with the itching flaking plus buying a humidifier for my home.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have used on his skin.</li>
            <li> But in other places Curel does its magic.    </li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and have aging dry skin, and have not found anything that works better yet</li>
            <li> I have found very few moisturizers that work as effectively as this one.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for extra dry skin, I try so many others and keep coming back to this brand.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and flaky and this helps me stay comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I noticed as I gotten older my skin has gotten drier and itchier.  </li>
            <li> I really am particular about lotions and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Curel.  </li>
            <li> My skin is left soft &amp; itch free.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd repeat buy as my other family members love it too!</li>
            <li> It was not thin and watery but nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Rather, I think it&#x27;s combination of him getting older and</li>
            <li> Doctors often recommend something like Eucerin or Aquafor with their heavy mineral oil component but my skin hates most any kind of oil and will tolerate no more than just a dollop of petrolatum chased with a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Since there is no doubt that there are side-effects of cortisone, discussion seems to focus on how severe the effects are, I didn&#x27;t follow the doctor&#x27;s prescriptions and decided to try Curel Itch Defense as it came highly recommended from online reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  </li>

            <li> Hy husband has eczema that recently developed and he says that this cream has really helped.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle for his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The doctor said this was normal.</li>
            <li> when applying this lotion it feels like it&#x27;s heavy and sitting on top of my skin</li>
            <li> Normally I would just apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone, which helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> I have year round mild-severe eczema on my hands and this is my favorite lotion for maintenance to ward off outbreaks.</li>
            <li> and this is pretty much the only lotion she can use.  </li>
            <li> fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to someone with only mildly dry skin, as it&#x27;s probably overkill, but it is awesome if you have extreme issues with dry</li>
            <li> Love it, and will continue to use it as her overall moisturizing lotion after baths, and I take a dab at it too when ever my skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and flaky skin, and this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found (after trying MANY)</li>
            <li> My daughter has super dry skin, so I use this one her.</li>
            <li> We would slather so much cream and top it off thickly with Vaseline afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Considering it usually starts with the first pair of long pants I consider this a huge success.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes in lotions and breakout into a rash or hives.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It goes on with a heavier feel, but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> One has severe eczema and this is the only OTC lotion that works when used consistently.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing of this product, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried so many products in the past: Aveeno, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aquaphor, California Baby, Cetaphil, Cerave, you name it - we&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> Once he was old enough I tried this and it works better than any other we used.</li>
            <li> But I really have not changed my eating habits and eat the same food I normally have eaten for years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on such positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE and costs just a few cents more than the small bottle at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> It provides very fast relief for itchy skin, and long term it seems to help with her eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle, will buy again in a few months when it runs out</li>
            <li> and she used Curel Itch Defense to clear it up.</li>
            <li> I had an itchy rash on my face and found out that it helped clear up irritation caused by my acne treatments as well.</li>
            <li> my 7 week old newborn had either worsening eczema, cradle cap, or a reaction to my sisters cats.</li>
            <li> her skin is clear and baby soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and tends to be prone to the itch-ys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything else, and not found anything which works as well as this.  </li>
            <li> Every  winter time my legs and back has very itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 18 months old had eczema since she was 6 months.</li>
            <li> My 23-month old daughter has had eczema since she was 2 months old.  </li>
            <li> This has been our go-to brand for almost two years now and so far, we&#x27;ve had no reactions to it.  </li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old son has eczema on his hands and face.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old has excema and has had it since 4 months old.</li>
            <li> but it was too early for my itching problem.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for our toddler as well.</li>
            <li> **mart and was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had eczema since she was a month old.</li>
            <li> I bought a few and got free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on my daughter for six months now ( since she was six months old).</li>
            <li> But, if you are sensitive nothing helps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I much prefer the regular unscented Curel lotion, which I would give  5 stars to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema pretty much as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin soft and stops the itching when I itch.</li>
            <li> She has had eczema sicne 4 months old.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has had eczema ever since she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 7month old baby son, who used to have severe case of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>
            <li> This one seems a bit sticky, and almost made my skin a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for over 10 years and this is by far my preferred body lotion.</li>
            <li> so far it seems working on my two-year-old&#x27;s hands and releases some itch of his skin</li>
            <li> that keeps my face soft, supple, hydrated, and reduces redness.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone back to just using plain Vaseline for now as it works much better than this for us.</li>
            <li> If you have dry itchy skin this is a must worked the first time I used it</li>
            <li> No other lotion has completely rid my skin of itching and made it o soft with out greasiness and</li>
            <li> to it&#x27;s un-fragranced nature it can have a slightly odd sent that dissipates quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> While we had high hopes for this product after reading raving reviews, it just didn&#x27;t moisturize nor alleviate the itching that comes along with eczema well enough for us to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would probably try it except I prefer lotions that have a high EWG score for low carcinogens and neurotoxins.</li>
            <li> I use it more on the outer of the face and less in the center.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is a tad greasy, I&#x27;m willing to put up with that, as it&#x27;s the first lotion that&#x27;s cleared up some extreme dry patches of skin for me.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this lotion long, but it seems to really help our skin.</li>
            <li> As long as we apply this to her skin every day, her eczema really does stay at bay.</li>
            <li> I even went back to my home state for a few months and my legs were fine.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this cream especially in the winter, since it&#x27;s drier.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with severe dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with dry skin, eczema.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my dry skin and prevents bouts of itching.</li>
            <li> My Eczema recently came back after 30 years of being in remission much to my surprise and horror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is the only complaint, but I&#x27;ll hapily pay more for lotion that works.</li>
            <li> The lotion does have an unique feel but a small price to pay for something that works.  </li>
            <li> The reviews posted by other Amazon customers were very helpful!  </li>
            <li> We just started using last week, and so far we like it!  </li>
            <li> My dry sensitive thanks Curel for this terrific lotion and</li>
            <li> or it is so light that it&#x27;s hard to notice</li>
            <li> My go-to artillery is Lidex for my fingers and a 50/50 mix of cheap clotrimazole and 1% cortizone for everywhere else, but for head-to-toe after-bath moisture this is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sometimes get eczema in the summer, and I have itchy skin in general.  </li>
            <li> They were all temporary and for one week his skin would clear up,  but would come back.  </li>
            <li> Three days of daily application and bathing with Dove soap for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> People suffering with Eczema may have a different experience as far as the difference in itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My baby had eczema since month 3, topical, but it never let up completely until I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily and it helps when I feel like my eczema is going to flair up in an area I can sometimes stop it early with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that works for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> This is by far my one &amp; only lotion.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that heals and works on my son who is 16 month old.  </li>
            <li> I apply this lotion on my skin, and my skin feels moist and soft after 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li> My feet have finally healed up and I feel close to being back to normal now.  </li>
            <li> No more dry itchy skin worth the money I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> The only draw back is she has a very sensitive skin on her face and neck where this lotion stings for a bit after application.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again after the bottle is empty, will probably try something else to see if something is better, but it will stay on the \\&quot;fall back to\\&quot; list...</li>
            <li> Other than living in Hawaii, I haven&#x27;t found anything to help much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion for use wherever skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I will recomendamos this lotion for new mom that have baby with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> Myself &amp; my children have very sensitive skin &amp; some fragrance allergies, also dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m pregnant with my 2nd child and I am unbelievably ITCHY.</li>
            <li> It took a while, maybe a solid month of applying twice a day and then covering my feet with cotton socks, but eventually the itching subsided to where now I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> I live in AZ so dry itchy skin is a daily occurrences.  </li>
            <li> Start with a small amount like a pea size and work up with little more at a time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which is exacerbated by my frequent hand washing with soap.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can use this for my two year old son if he&#x27;s feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have eczema, but just generally dry, itchy, and sensitive skin and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> She is only two, so there is no way to help other than covering her up with long sleeves and pants in the middle of our hot, humid summers.</li>
            <li> It has been working very well in the northern California weather, and definitely calms down the itch.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that would constantly feel dry and get itchy.</li>
            <li> : I find the consistency a little thick and hard to easily spread, so I run my \\&quot;spreading\\&quot; hand under cool tap water before squirting on a dollop of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually put a little dab on his face after his baths because his cheeks are the most prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white but slightly translucent which reflects the highly emollient ingredients like petrolatum and dimethicone.</li>
            <li> : I do still need to find a specific treatment cream or ointment to put on the worst areas during flare-ups, but this Curel formula is excellent for after showers to seal in moisture and for general use all over my body on a daily basis during dry winter months.</li>

            <li> During the winter my skin is so dry I can barely stand</li>
            <li> I used other kinds of lotions for sensitive skin that has been out for years.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tricky: use too little and you&#x27;ll dry out, use too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as severe as when I was younger, but it does flare up occasionally, especially during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> Curel lotion last a long time.</li>
            <li> This definitely takes away the itch of dry skin.</li>
            <li> less than a week of using this product twice a day, all the skin rash, dryness and itching were completely gone.</li>
            <li> My face has been so dry that i have actual sores on my face</li>
            <li> I have environment allergies &amp; constant dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> When we moved to a dry state from a humid one, this was the only thing that kept me from getting the dry itchy skin I used to get on short trips to dry areas.  </li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s been so long I had no clue</li>
            <li> I will be using it all winter long.</li>
            <li> This one works as long as i put it on after almost every hand washing.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t run out year long ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched my whole life for a thick lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky or slimy and this is it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that this is a lotion and not a cream, so it&#x27;s thin, so</li>
            <li> This was the first winter when I hardly had any itch at all!</li>
            <li> disappointed I didn&#x27;t buy more than one!</li>
            <li> We have very sensitive skin in our family and there are very few things don&#x27;t irritate our skin.  </li>
            <li> She started off with what I thought was baby acne on her cheeks and dry patches on her eyebrows and ears.</li>
            <li> On my cracked dry skin, no burn.</li>
            <li> For seriously dry skin.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t dry and there&#x27;s no rash</li>
            <li> Oh what a treat for itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My legs are really dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> My knees get really dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> None of us have eczema, but we have dry or itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to stop the itching from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin this winter even though I put lotion on every day when I shower.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I buy it for someone else, who seems to like it for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy, dry skin since I was a kid</li>
            <li> All of these things can seriously dry u out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t scratched my dry spots at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 5 month baby dry skin and it work miracle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very subtle and typical of any fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this on me too since I have dry and ichy skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Dry skin ?</li>
            <li> induced by those dry winter months.</li>
            <li> When we went to my parents after a few days her condition worsened to red scaly patches on her cheeks that spread to her ears and red bumps on her forehead, scalp, and eye lids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money on more expensive creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> This is only thing (other than one very expensive and small prescription cream that was only for small spots) that actually kept my excema calm for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single spot on my legs.</li>
            <li> It started a few years ago and generally clears up in the summer.  </li>
            <li> After doing a bit of online research and reading customer reviews on various body lotions that target eczema prone skin, I narrowed it down to Eucerin Intensive Repair, Aveeno Eczema Therapy and Curel Itch Defense Lotion.  </li>
            <li> treating\\&quot; areas, spreading a small amount like an ointment on an area that starts itching out of the blue - it soothes the itch enough for me to leave it alone</li>

            <li> skin improved a lot recently, but I am not sure if this lotion actually cured his condition.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin</li>
            <li> Living over a mile above sea level is very dry and add super cold to that</li>
            <li> I was not sure of the result when I bought this, since thus far I have spent about $300 just in lotions, oils, and tropical ointment, and other medications for my son.</li>
            <li> In the summer months my legs stay itchy due to constant shaving, but I&#x27;ve noticed less itching/irritation from nightly use of the Curel.</li>
            <li> I would itch so bad that I would eventually tear the skin from itching so much and so intensely and cause bleeding and scabbing on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I did buy more of these, as we would religiously apply this (and still with Vaseline after, to seal in the moisture and protect her skin from the cold wind) at least 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 10 different lotions/ointments to heal her patchy, red, itchy skin and nothing else</li>
            <li> This stuff saved me from a mental breakdown over itchy feet.</li>
            <li> lotion is thicker than I expected, somewhere between a lotion and a cream in thickness.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it since, occasionally when we spot a heavy rush.</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.</li>
            <li> The flare ups are minimal.</li>
            <li> I expected the 13oz or maybe the 20oz, but he came home with a 25oz.  </li>
            <li> But since my fiance spent 8 bucks on it, I feel like I should use it for a while.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and comforts the skin and does help with our very dry skin and helps keep eczema flare ups down.</li>
            <li> This was the closest one which was mild enough to apply to areas where she has scratched up so badly without it stinging her.  </li>
            <li> I can sometimes tolerate beauty products with masking fragrance - other times</li>
            <li> We now use it every other day after the bathing and everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw this as I was searching for other eczema treatments.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no itching!</li>
            <li> no more red spots, no more waking up at night with an itchy back.  </li>
            <li> Maybe order this separately from other items if you&#x27;re concerned about leakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received other bottle products like shampoo which had a piece of tape securing the nozzle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried aquaphor, cerave, and all other medication his doctor prescribed.  </li>
            <li> Though the other lotions kept her moisturized, the itching never stopped.  </li>
            <li> the other things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it because of other reviews, and I have received it for about a week,</li>
            <li> Very little of this goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> lotion does not have a bad scent or smell, it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I orderd it late one night and got it two days later!</li>
            <li> We tried Curel Itch Defence Lotion recently and at least 75% of her itching is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found out that using the rx hyrocortizone cream helps but really do not wish to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what eczema patients need, a moisture barrier on their skin - not a lotion that disappears/evaporates, but the downside to that is that I personally find it an annoying feeling, a slight tackiness on the skin that lingers for a long time, but I&#x27;ll live.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So extremely helpful!</li>
            <li> going with other products without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> During the week and a half we stayed at my parents</li>
            <li> Unscented, but odd texture, not moisturizing, feels corn starchy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was half off</li>
            <li> Well, now I&#x27;ve gone through late Sept. and Oct wearing long pants</li>
            <li> Both my little girls have eczema...</li>
            <li> We have been using this since he was a little baby.  </li>
            <li> It is a miracle my little guy is no longer scratching.</li>
            <li> My little girl has &amp;#34;mild eczema&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it on myself, it seems to burn a little when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t disappear entirely, but I got relief of the worst of it and some areas have stopped itching, so it&#x27;s still a huge improvement.</li>

            <li> /&gt;PS: In the doctor&#x27;s defense, this product is not available in my country.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few things that don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> of the few body lotions that can be applied to the face.</li>
            <li> This feeling took me a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> Eurcerin was a bit too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> The container&#x27;s quite sizeable, so much waste</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my itching and it is SO heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> My 4-month-old son has stubborn eczema, and we were having trouble keeping it at bay</li>
            <li> It did not work for him at all, and after one day of use he was VERY red and itchy all over - way worse than he had been before.</li>
            <li> Even after waiting 10 minutes or so to put on my jeans, it&#x27;s still hard to pull them on because they stick to my skin due to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve scratched so much to where areas are dark and scaly, bleed, and burn so bad that I can&#x27;t sleep sometimes.</li>
            <li> The past few months I&#x27;ve been dealing with increasingly itchy legs...</li>
            <li> Well if her eczema is mild I&#x27;d hate to see what severe eczema is like.</li>
            <li> At the bottom of my neck around my shoulders, that area gets that itchy tight feeling, hard to relieve at times.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this lotion for the past 4 years because our son has severe eczema.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped it would cure her small patch of eczema, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> There is the usual hand cream smell.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle before at *</li>
            <li> I usually buy products based on what&#x27;s on sale, but not with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> However the tubes are small, so the cost can add up.  </li>
            <li> Other lotions did not help but this finally stopped the bad itching.</li>
            <li> On really bad days, we have to turn to a little bit of prescription steriods mixed with Aquaphor (for dilution).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been Curel users for at least two years.</li>
            <li> I make a point to apply it at least once a day and nothing else cream-wise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lately for some reason I have had itchy skin on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> My daughter hasn&#x27;t complained, so I keep using it one her.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, which provides substantial moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a thick lotion that I like to use on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit too thick for my hands.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick or greasy like petroleum jelly, but still seems to give you that protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cold and windy now here in the NE, but her face is as clear as anything!!  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other unscented lotions that can have a slightly weird smell, Curel doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Our 6-month old granddaughter had a horrible dry skin rash.</li>
            <li> It was so bad sometimes that I would get up in the middle of the night and put cold cloths on my legs as that was the only thing that brought temporary relief.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> It felt so disgusting that I gave up waiting for it to work and showered it off because it was more uncomfortable then the itch.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> For the last 8+ years I have dreaded cold weather because it meant long pants and painful, itchy legs.</li>
            <li> Depending how bad you may apply this multiple times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have very a very thin and sensitive epidermis, and it&#x27;s been very difficult to find lotions for hand or face that soothe and protect it.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> and it helps cut down that crazy itchy feeling when your tattoo starts</li>
            <li> Sometimes it makes my itching worse.</li>
            <li> The ones that don&#x27;t seem to make me itch worse, also don&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> It is quite thin</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old son has had very bad eczema since when he was about 1.5.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t continue using it due to the bad smell!</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of expensive creams and ointments and nothing would stop the maddening itching.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get immediate (albeit not total) relief of my INSANE itching.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical, but just tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> They would itch like crazy yet any scratching just made it worse with no relief.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t to wrong with Curel.</li>
            <li> Lotion leaves my skin feeling sticky, not impressed.</li>
            <li> It feels almost like a very thin layer of powder over the surface.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs as whenever I shave they always itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel as muggy as a swamp rat.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did nothing. :-(</li>
            <li> comments report a bad smell.</li>
            <li> The itching did not itch as bad.  </li>
            <li> My excema has been so bad that at times I couldn&#x27;t even leave my house</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d scratch so badly</li>
            <li> and it was driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that this has a fishy smell.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just hate the fish smell.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> awful ingredients, would not be using these on my children.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a terrible medicated smell like some others we have tried.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m applying it, it has a HORRIFIC rotten fish smell.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion through the changing of the seasons, which is always the worst time for me because of the day to day changes in temperature and humidity..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok on my skin, but my husband who has eczema felt burning after applying it. He had to wash it off immediately.</li>
            <li> My daughter who has eczema says it serves it&#x27;s purpose as an itch relief.  So, it moisturizes well too.</li>
            <li> If you have chronically itchy skin, this will be the cure! I&#x27;ve tried it all and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li> Best ever moisturizer for winter itch.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> During the week and a half we stayed at my parents my 7 week old newborn had either worsening eczema, cradle cap, or a reaction to my sisters cats. She started off with what I thought was baby acne on her cheeks and dry patches on her eyebrows and ears. The doctor said this was normal. When we went to my parents after a few days her condition worsened to red scaly patches on her cheeks that spread to her ears and red bumps on her forehead, scalp, and eye lids. After strenuous research I came across a mother who had the same problem with her newborn and she used Curel Itch Defense to clear it up. Three days of daily application and bathing with Dove soap for sensitive skin her skin is clear and baby soft. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  In the winter I get the most god-awful dry itchy feet.  It started a few years ago and generally clears up in the summer.  I really struggled it for a couple of seasons, even going to the doctor and getting some steroid ointment that really didn&#x27;t work too well. I tried all kinds of expensive creams and ointments and nothing would stop the maddening itching.  I would itch so bad that I would eventually tear the skin from itching so much and so intensely and cause bleeding and scabbing on my feet.  It was really beginning to affect my life.  All I could think about were my itchy feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around on Amazon for some other magical ointment that I had yet to discover when I found this Curel product.  I&#x27;d never heard of it before but it had good reviews and at that stage I was trying everything I could get my hands on just to make it stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did the trick.  It took a while, maybe a solid month of applying twice a day and then covering my feet with cotton socks, but eventually the itching subsided to where now I barely notice it.  My feet have finally healed up and I feel close to being back to normal now.  I still apply it liberally twice a day even though I may only need a once a day application but I&#x27;m not taking any chances.  This stuff saved me from a mental breakdown over itchy feet.</li>
            <li> Every winter, the skin on my legs has always been dry and itchy, and I&#x27;ve tried many products. This was the first winter when I hardly had any itch at all! Great product.</li>
            <li> My Eczema recently came back after 30 years of being in remission much to my surprise and horror. But because it&#x27;s been so long I had no clue what&#x27;s currently out there for eczema products. I found the NEA website (National Eczema Association) and it&#x27;s been very helpful. I was on their Facebook page one day and saw a couple of people recommended this Curel &#x27;Itch Defense&#x27; formula. I have to be honest, Curel is one of the last companies I would ever think to turn to for this type of product; I know they&#x27;re a fairly popular brand, but I just didn&#x27;t think of them as making \\&quot;serious\\&quot; products for skin conditions. But I went to Curel&#x27;s website and checked it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, it&#x27;s a fragrance-free formula designed for eczema and with ingredients I was told to look for and none of the ingredients I was told to avoid. Two things sold me on trying it: 1. It had the NEA Seal of Acceptance. That&#x27;s a big deal, that means they went through vigorous tests and reformulating in order to meet the criteria of the NEA&#x27;s standards, including avoiding all ingredients on the NEA&#x27;s known list of irritants. 2. The price! I had spent hours comparing labels on some very expensive eczema-friendly moisturizers and here was one that seemed to fit the bill AND came in a huge 20 ounce bottle for a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is thicker than I expected, somewhere between a lotion and a cream in thickness. It&#x27;s white but slightly translucent which reflects the highly emollient ingredients like petrolatum and dimethicone. Both are said to be excellent for eczema but many eczema moisturizers will have one or the other, this has both. It goes on thick but spreads VERY nicely. It&#x27;s definitely on the heavy side, you can really feel that \\&quot;barrier\\&quot; on the skin. That&#x27;s exactly what eczema patients need, a moisture barrier on their skin - not a lotion that disappears/evaporates, but the downside to that is that I personally find it an annoying feeling, a slight tackiness on the skin that lingers for a long time, but I&#x27;ll live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get immediate (albeit not total) relief of my INSANE itching. It didn&#x27;t disappear entirely, but I got relief of the worst of it and some areas have stopped itching, so it&#x27;s still a huge improvement. I&#x27;ve started using it in two ways: Putting it all over my body morning and night and after showers, and also \\&quot;spot treating\\&quot; areas, spreading a small amount like an ointment on an area that starts itching out of the blue - it soothes the itch enough for me to leave it alone and I repeat that as needed. I&#x27;ve decided this: I do still need to find a specific treatment cream or ointment to put on the worst areas during flare-ups, but this Curel formula is excellent for after showers to seal in moisture and for general use all over my body on a daily basis during dry winter months. I have to admit I&#x27;ve misjudged Curel; it turns out this is an excellent quality formula that I probably would not have tried if it weren&#x27;t for the NEA Seal on the bottle.long time, but I&#x27;ll live.

            <li> this is a miracle in a bottle, I have severe itches does&#x27;nt matter what I do. It would wake me up at nights which was becoming unbearable. I have used everything you can possibly imagine from olive oil to coconut oil and nothing would help. I decided a day ago to go online to find a lotion that would help me and low and behold Curel Miracle no more itch and beautiful supple skin. Thanks a million Curel</li>
            <li> The only lotion in my house.  One has severe eczema and this is the only OTC lotion that works when used consistently. Daily hydrocorizon is not an option for five year-old.  The lotion does have an unique feel but a small price to pay for something that works.  Best part?  On my cracked dry skin, no burn.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for extra dry skin, I try so many others and keep coming back to this brand.  It goes on with a heavier feel, but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft all day long.  I highly recommend for those of us with exceptionally dryer skin and need a more effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have used it a long time and Amazon has a better price than anywhere I have found elsewhere.  My hubby has a skin problem and this lotion helps him a great deal with the itching and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great, basic lotion. Does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Curel lotion is a great product and priced right.  I needed to purchase another item to get free shipping and needed lotion. I bought this based on such positive reviews.  I was not disappointed. I had a cast removed on my leg recently and needed a nice lotion that was not greasy.  This worked great. I will be using it all winter long. Curel makes great lotion, this has been my second purchase of Curel. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this lotion for the past 4 years because our son has severe eczema.  It has been working very well in the northern California weather, and definitely calms down the itch.  Its not too greasy and still gets the job done.  There are a few other tricks I use to maintain our sons healthy skin, this is just one of the tools in my basket of healthy, steroid free collection!  Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> For seriously dry skin. According to the label it says it is for adults and safe for babies as well. Our 6-month old granddaughter had a horrible dry skin rash. This was a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, very soothing.  I add oil since I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been Curel users for at least two years. My children has eczema and we use this for maintenance-prevention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe Psoriasis for over 5 years, and this lotion is one of the few that I&#x27;ve found that works really great. The texture is smooth, leaving you skin silky. The consistency is thick, which provides substantial moisture without being greasy. With my Psoriasis, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a decline in itching with this lotion; however, the quality of the moisturizing makes up for that. People suffering with Eczema may have a different experience as far as the difference in itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to lotion after trying most on the market.</li>
            <li> Instant relief??? Sometimes it makes my itching worse.</li>
            <li> Some fragrance free products contain masking fragrance - a chemical added to negate all the smells found in an item. This lotion does not have that. I am very sensitive to perfumes in lotions and breakout into a rash or hives. I can sometimes tolerate beauty products with masking fragrance - other times I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not contain a masking fragrance. It is a thick lotion that I like to use on my arms and legs. I find it a bit too thick for my hands. This definitely takes away the itch of dry skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.  It strikes a good balance with moisturizing well but without that greasy feel. It absorbs readily ands I appreciate that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and tends to be prone to the itch-ys. I tried this out as winter came and noticed she was drying out. I had hoped it would cure her small patch of eczema, but it hasn&#x27;t. It does seem to work on keeping her skin hydrated and not itchy, though, which is sure a plus. Not sure if I will buy again after the bottle is empty, will probably try something else to see if something is better, but it will stay on the \\&quot;fall back to\\&quot; list...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I also use [[ASIN:B0032YV1T0 California Baby Calming Shampoo and Bodywash, 19 fl oz]] for her, wich I love.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh.  Curel &amp;#34;Itch Defense&amp;#34; certainly goes on the offense with this product!  This is the BEST lotion if you suffer from itchy skin.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything else, and not found anything which works as well as this.  I was purchasing this from a local big-box retailer.  However, two of their nearby stores were not carrying this exact product any longer, so I signed up with Amazon for their auto-ship program to make sure I get a supply every other month when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel has created a wonderful product.  KAO Brands brings it to my mailbox via Amazon without fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy (and not itching!)</li>
            <li> Every  winter time my legs and back has very itch.&lt;br /&gt;But after just one time use this item&lt;br /&gt;my itch had gone.&lt;br /&gt;Try this if you have itch skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also love this lotion because no fragrance.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is a tad greasy, I&#x27;m willing to put up with that, as it&#x27;s the first lotion that&#x27;s cleared up some extreme dry patches of skin for me.  It has a light, sweet, barely noticeable scent (likely from some of the oils in it, as there is no added fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to someone with only mildly dry skin, as it&#x27;s probably overkill, but it is awesome if you have extreme issues with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  if you (like me) have had allergic reactions to Eucerin or Cetaphil, Curel Itch Defense does not contain methylchloroisothiazolinone or methylisothiazolinone, the likely allergenic culprits.  I do not react to this one.  In fact, I did a lot of online research to find a good, strong lotion lacking those problem ingredients before settling on Curel Itch Defense.</li>
            <li> My 18 months old had eczema since she was 6 months. Recently the eczema became more severe and we started taking her to the dermatologist every two weeks. After trying a six different prescriptions by the doctor and nothing worked, the doctor wanted to try cortisone based products. Since there is no doubt that there are side-effects of cortisone, discussion seems to focus on how severe the effects are, I didn&#x27;t follow the doctor&#x27;s prescriptions and decided to try Curel Itch Defense as it came highly recommended from online reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a week of using this product twice a day, all the skin rash, dryness and itching were completely gone. We now use it every other day after the bathing and everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: In the doctor&#x27;s defense, this product is not available in my country. I had it shipped costing over $90 for 3 20oz tubes. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs as whenever I shave they always itch like crazy. I have tried many different methods, lotions, creams, and treatments to combat this issue for me, but to not avail. My sister told me how well this worked for her and her girls, so I tried some and much to my surprise (and great relief!), this lotion does the trick for me! I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was scented, but I am very happy that I can finally have itch free legs!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I think it really has made a difference with my son&#x27;s skin. He&#x27;s had eczema since he was a baby and this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s rich and creamy and I think it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling like the Aquaphor that the doctors often recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suitable for babies since my son is 6 now and has been using it for about 2 years. I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended or should be used on the face. One tip our doc told me: use it within 3 minutes after getting out of the bath so that the skin can absorb it more easily while the pores are still &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My 23-month old daughter has had eczema since she was 2 months old.  We&#x27;ve tried everything...all sorts of steriods, from 2.5% hydrocortisone to Bethametasone to Desonide.  We&#x27;ve gone to 2 dermatologists and an allergist too.  NOthing seemed to work.  We also switched her to Cerave cream lotion.  We would slather so much cream and top it off thickly with Vaseline afterwards.  Nothing. She still itched.  It kept her up at night too.  Benadryl didn&#x27;t seem to work much either.  I saw this as I was searching for other eczema treatments.  I was skeptical, but just tried it anyway.  WIthin 5 minutes of applying it on my daugher&#x27;s face and neck, she just stopped scratching!!!  It&#x27;s very cold and windy now here in the NE, but her face is as clear as anything!!  Thank you to Curel, what a miracle, and how happy I am as a mom to see my daughter have some relief!!!  It has been a week, hopefully, this continues to work, though.  I did buy more of these, as we would religiously apply this (and still with Vaseline after, to seal in the moisture and protect her skin from the cold wind) at least 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, I had my first bout with winter itch and it was driving me crazy! I tried any lotion I could get my hands on but nothing worked.  I googled itchy skin lotions and decided on this rather than one from gold bond because this was approved by the National Eczema Association (even though I do not have eczema I figured it would be gentile and effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome!  I had an itchy rash on my face and found out that it helped clear up irritation caused by my acne treatments as well. Great skin balancer, my face has never been clearer.  I was literally torturing my skin unknowingly and CAUSING breakouts before I discovered this.</li>
            <li> We have very sensitive skin in our family and there are very few things don&#x27;t irritate our skin.  This is one of the few things that don&#x27;t.  After trying unscented brand after unscented brand, this is one of the only lotions that work for us.  We were discouraged after Aveeno started to irritate my mother&#x27;s skin and found several more expensive brands irritated her skin (and later mine) as well.  This has been our go-to brand for almost two years now and so far, we&#x27;ve had no reactions to it.  That makes it a keeper.</li>
            <li> If I am sure to lather on this lotion every day I am guaranteed to not have any eczema flare-ups. LOVE IT, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> works just as described; thank you!</li>
            <li> Must have for me! Dosnt break me out and dosnt feel greasy but really moisturises! I use it face and body works great. No more dry itchy skin worth the money I highly recommend to everyone! I have tried so many from all price ranges and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Really helps with severe dry, itchy skin.  Other lotions did not help but this finally stopped the bad itching.</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old son has eczema on his hands and face.  It will go away in the summer, but comes out in the winter.  We started using prescribed steroids, and the helped, but as soon as we stopped, the itchy patches came back.  My mom uses this for her eczema and recommended it.  The spots on his cheeks were gone after the first day, and his hands cleared up in 3 days.  It is amazing!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Living over a mile above sea level is very dry and add super cold to that and I get some red rash.  I use this all the time to eliminate the rashes, and soothe if I get one.  Also great for a man&#x27;s face every day.  No perfume smell, just a good daily moisturizer that does not leave your skin with an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> excellent product ,i bought this lotion for my girlfriend who has bad legs due to diabetes,she has used it every day an her legs look an feel great an the itch has been taken away ,i will buy more as this is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> The most soothing lotion I have found.</li>
            <li> The past few months I&#x27;ve been dealing with increasingly itchy legs...mostly my lower legs. They aren&#x27;t dry and there&#x27;s no rash so I had no idea what it could be but it was driving me up the wall. I was itching to the point it was starting to marr my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this based on the good reviews and it seems to be helping, quite a lot, and pretty immediately. Now whether that&#x27;s psychological or not, or combining it with zinc soap when I shower, I don&#x27;t know, but the itching is like 98% gone. Very effective.</li>
            <li> this is ok for dry skin but not for rash or itching - I have combined it with another stronger anti itch lotion</li>
            <li> This may be an excellent product for someone with true eczema or another medical condition. I just get very itchy legs after I shave and tried this to combat the discomfort and keep from ravaging my skin. Unfortunately, it did nothing. :-(</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which is exacerbated by my frequent hand washing with soap. In the winter my skin cracks and bleeds and one knuckle periodically becomes uncontrollably itchy. I have tried numerous hand creams, some work, some do not. This one works as long as i put it on after almost every hand washing. It soothes the hurt and the problem mostly goes away if i keep this routine up for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, i bought another hand creme for use at nighttime that seems to work better, but is too greasy for me to use during the day. The two together seem to do a great job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some comments report a bad smell. There is the usual hand cream smell. Some people are more sensitive to it, but i find it no different than most other creams. Unless you have an issue with a hand cream smelling like a hand cream, i wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> Oh what a treat for itchy dry skin.  It is so soothing and calming.  Curel is all it says it is.  Go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there for my eczema. I can&#x27;t go anywhere without it!</li>
            <li> My legs are really dry and itchy. I&#x27;ve tried all types of lotions and oils, and nothing seemed to really work. I&#x27;ve scratched so much to where areas are dark and scaly, bleed, and burn so bad that I can&#x27;t sleep sometimes. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 3 days and already see a change! My skin is clearing and hasn&#x27;t itched since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has excema and has had it since 4 months old. We have tried everything and have seem many doctors. I stumbled upon this; since I was looking for curel for me.I found this too be effective and better than any other cream on market besides prescription.</li>
            <li> For the last 8+ years I have dreaded cold weather because it meant long pants and painful, itchy legs. I would get almost invisible bumps/sores/red spots that feel like a large area of my leg needs to be scratched. They would itch like crazy yet any scratching just made it worse with no relief. I&#x27;d tried every OTC cream I knew of as well as various creams from the dermatologist. No help. I switched detergents in case that was the problem. No change. It was so bad sometimes that I would get up in the middle of the night and put cold cloths on my legs as that was the only thing that brought temporary relief.&lt;br /&gt;Last summer I saw an ad for Curel Itch Defense in a magazine. I wasn&#x27;t optimistic but as I said, I would try almost anything. I bought it on my next trip to the store and started applying it daily in August. It made my legs feel nice but it was too early for my itching problem. Well, now I&#x27;ve gone through late Sept. and Oct wearing long pants and I haven&#x27;t had a single spot on my legs. Absolutely no itching! Considering it usually starts with the first pair of long pants I consider this a huge success.I make a point to apply it at least once a day and nothing else cream-wise.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write tons of reviews and rarely lengthy ones but I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I wanted to take the time to write this in case it can help anyone else suffering like I did. It is now one of my Subscribe and Save items so I never run out.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion we buy for my husband and myself. Appreciate the fragrance free; although it does have a bit of a nonoffensive smell to it. Great to put on right before bed and not be kept awake by a strong smell. We also like it because it is not one bit greasy. You can use it anytime and not have to worry about leaving greasy handprints all over everything. Gentle enough for our toddler as well.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this so I had to try it. It is a very nice lotion and it does help with the Itchy arms that I have.</li>
            <li> If you have dry itchy skin this is a must worked the first time I used it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much @ all a dime size goes farther then what you&#x27;d think. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Hy husband has eczema that recently developed and he says that this cream has really helped.  He liked the aveeno one slightly more but it doesn&#x27;t come in the size that this one does.</li>
            <li> This stops my skin from itching.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of others, but this is the one that works.  Whether it&#x27;s eczema or chronic urticaria, this lotion is both inexpensive and highly effective.  Doctors and Pharmacies need to get with the show and start featuring and recommending this lotion, because unlike many of the brands they do tout, this one does exactly what the label implies.  After years of trying and even making lotions to address my itchy skin, Curel Itch Defense solved the problem for me.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the underlying disease, but it does dramatically reduce the symptoms.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle before at ***mart and was surprised at how well it worked.  My knees get really dry and itchy.  When I apply this it soothes and stops the scratch immediately.  Depending how bad you may apply this multiple times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had eczema since she was a month old. For the last 17 months we have tried many products (aquaphor, eucerin, cervae, cetaphil restoraderm, hydrocortisone, kenalog). This lotion works better than the steroid creams. Very thankful for this lotion! No itching, no rash.</li>
            <li> Best overall lotion if you have really dry skin.  I&#x27;ve searched my whole life for a thick lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky or slimy and this is it.  I use it occasionally on my face too.  It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have them on all the cabinets and drawers in my house. My kids can&#x27;t open them. However, my wife and I have no problem. Easy to install and use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, but I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions. I use it on my legs only, though. During the winter my skin is so dry I can barely stand it- this helps so much! In the summer months my legs stay itchy due to constant shaving, but I&#x27;ve noticed less itching/irritation from nightly use of the Curel.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever for my very sensitive skin and it really does stop the itching. My skin is extremely dry and flaky and this helps me stay comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a good for my child&#x27;s skin. It works on reducing the itchy and red skin.  I bought a few and got free shipping.  That was a discounted price if you compare to Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth my money.</li>
            <li> I found Curel Itch Defense to be somewhat denser than the original Curel lotion, which is excellent for hands and arms.  I use the Itch Defense version for my legs and feet after showering and it does an exceptional job of moisturizing.  I highly recommend this lotion for use wherever skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I noticed as I gotten older my skin has gotten drier and itchier.  Noticed that the lotions I was using was not helping me at all. My parents used this Curel Itch Defense lotion, so I tried it one day. I was amazed how I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it and it did relieve the itchiness on my skin. My skin looked so much better and didn&#x27;t feel all greasy or gross. None of us have eczema, but we have dry or itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Curel lotion last a long time. I am still on the same bottle since February of this year, still got about 2 to 3 months left of this lotion. I don&#x27;t have to use much, enough to cover my body after I get out of the shower. Last all day. Sometimes I will reapply to my hands and arms.  This lotion really makes my skin soft and moisturized. Start with a small amount like a pea size and work up with little more at a time. If you use too much at one time you will feel greasy. This lotion is not like regular lotion where one gets a tablespoon or more and use it on one arm. Very little of this goes a long ways. It&#x27;s best to apply after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few body lotions that can be applied to the face. I use this on my neck and face. At the bottom of my neck around my shoulders, that area gets that itchy tight feeling, hard to relieve at times. Curel really helped. When I use on my face I use it more on the outer of the face and less in the center. I don&#x27;t use it all the time on my face but every so often, when I need some extra relief in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I get mosquito or bug bites, this lotion helps take the itch away, not fully but it does help to relieve that itchy feeling to where you can forget about it and not touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does not have a bad scent or smell, it&#x27;s fragrance free. Some lotions that have no scent or no fragrance, will have a smell to it, kinda gross like. This lotion has no smell at all or it is so light that it&#x27;s hard to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was never a Curel fan before I tried it years ago, but this lotion has changed my mind about Curel. I used other kinds of lotions for sensitive skin that has been out for years. Did not help me one bit. Curel Itch Defense lotion worked when I first used it. I hope the makers of Curel lotion keeps this lotion on the shelves and does not change the formula. This stuff works amazingly.</li>
            <li> great price on itch reducing lotion and it helps on my constantly itching ankles. At the local store I get a fraction as much lotion for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Lately for some reason I have had itchy skin on my legs and arms.  Have tried several different creams including prescription hydrocortisone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that using the rx hyrocortizone cream helps but really do not wish to use it everyday.  My dermatologist said I could now be getting allergic to type of food item I am eating. But I really have not changed my eating habits and eat the same food I normally have eaten for years.  He told me to try CUREL Itch Defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I did and after shower applied all over except face.  And I noticed a difference the next day.  The itching did not itch as bad.  Then the next day after showering reapplied the Curel again.  The next day it was even a bigger change. After the 3rd night and after showering and applying I no longer itch and from this day forward am itch free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Curel.  So happy I do not have to apply the cortisone cream.  It is so nice going through the day without constantly itching all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem with itchy skin try this first before going to dermatologist and spending money.  This might just be all you need.</li>
            <li> First, I will tell you some things you should already know: eczema is a highly individual condition, it is genetic, cyclical, and with most of us for life. I have found very few moisturizers that work as effectively as this one. Doctors often recommend something like Eucerin or Aquafor with their heavy mineral oil component but my skin hates most any kind of oil and will tolerate no more than just a dollop of petrolatum chased with a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin pulls moisture out of the air but it&#x27;s tricky: use too little and you&#x27;ll dry out, use too much and you&#x27;ll feel as muggy as a swamp rat. Curel gets it just right, always has. And whatever they put in their Itch Defense lotion really soothes inflamed skin. My go-to artillery is Lidex for my fingers and a 50/50 mix of cheap clotrimazole and 1% cortizone for everywhere else, but for head-to-toe after-bath moisture this is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I find the consistency a little thick and hard to easily spread, so I run my \\&quot;spreading\\&quot; hand under cool tap water before squirting on a dollop of the lotion. This give it just the right consistency for me and I can always go back over the dryer areas with a second coat.</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased this lotion for our 1 year old baby boy who has mild eczema. While we had high hopes for this product after reading raving reviews, it just didn&#x27;t moisturize nor alleviate the itching that comes along with eczema well enough for us to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I will continue to use it, as we don&#x27;t want to be wasteful; however, we will not be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> My son had eczema as a baby, and we tried many of the creams intended for babies. Once he was old enough I tried this and it works better than any other we used. Also cheaper than many of the others, and the bottle is large so you don&#x27;t have to constantly get more.</li>
            <li> we have tried everything, from physiogel to burt&#x27;s baby bees... although they helped, it still wasn&#x27;t enough for my baby. curel really worked and it made his skin smooth and he was not itchy anymore. no more red spots, no more waking up at night with an itchy back.  it doesn&#x27;t have a sweet baby smell like burt&#x27;s bees but the no itching wins any day. stocking up on these!!!</li>
            <li> I have very a very thin and sensitive epidermis, and it&#x27;s been very difficult to find lotions for hand or face that soothe and protect it. I&#x27;ve used Curel for over 20 years and love it, but when I found this Itch Defense version, I was absolutely thrilled at how well it softened and protected my skin. In fact it works better on my face than some of my fancy department store creams. Go figure! But definitely go try it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good lotion. It seems to stop the itching from dry skin. It makes our skin smooth and moist. I haven&#x27;t used this lotion long, but it seems to really help our skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to relieve itchy, dry , winter skin--works almost immediately!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. I live in AZ so dry itchy skin is a daily occurrences.  This is a very moisturizing lotion without being oily.  And this is also an anti itch formula which works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I tried ointments, Aveno Baby Eczema Creme, L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s mama-baby balm, and this was FAAR more superior, and even friendly on the $.  My baby had eczema since month 3, topical, but it never let up completely until I started using this lotion.  Love it, and will continue to use it as her overall moisturizing lotion after baths, and I take a dab at it too when ever my skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked wonders for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I tried at least 10 different lotions/ointments to heal her patchy, red, itchy skin and nothing else worked as quickly or as consistently as this. And, it really has kept it away. As long as we apply this to her skin every day, her eczema really does stay at bay. It is the closest thing to a cure we&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other lotions I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;Babyganics&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives&lt;br /&gt;Lubriderm&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this above the others.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that works for my eczema. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now!</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry skin, eczema. Huge bottle, will buy again in a few months when it runs out</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for my itchy sensitive skin. No other lotion has completely rid my skin of itching and made it o soft with out greasiness and best of all this is no fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell nasty or like medicine. It pretty much has no smell at all and is clean and light. I love it!</li>
            <li> Tried this for that dry winter itch skin and it works great. Soothing lotion and also accepted by the Eczema association. Great lotion!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin this winter even though I put lotion on every day when I shower. This is not greasy, soaks in quickly and really does help. I had to use so many other products trying to deal with the itching flaking plus buying a humidifier for my home. Plus this was an excellent price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> works better than anything out there</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mild eczema. This lotion is on the thicker side so living in Hawaii it&#x27;s very humid and when applying this lotion it feels like it&#x27;s heavy and sitting on top of my skin but when I actually touch my skin it&#x27;s smooth and not sticky. This feeling took me a few days to get used to. I use this daily and it helps when I feel like my eczema is going to flair up in an area I can sometimes stop it early with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus for me is I&#x27;ve used this on 2 tattoos recently and it helps cut down that crazy itchy feeling when your tattoo starts peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I use Hustle Butter for the first week and once the tattoo starts to peel I switch to this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for me!</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not the best for anti-itch action but it does help. I find Aveeno or Physiogel AI work much better for me.</li>
            <li> When we moved to a dry state from a humid one, this was the only thing that kept me from getting the dry itchy skin I used to get on short trips to dry areas.  The anti-itch properties have really kept skin problems and rashes at bay.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry skin.  My skin was itching and I didn&#x27;t know why.  My doctor recommended I use this lotion and it solved the problem.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is fragrance free, which I need, and does an okay job of moisturizing, but not as well as I would like.  I am 62 years old and have aging dry skin, and have not found anything that works better yet that is fragrance free, so I will keep using Curel until I find something else.  The 24 hour moisturizing Curel in the red print bottle works better but is not fragrance free, so it is always a trade off.</li>
            <li> Both my little girls have eczema... and this does a wonderful job at heading it off.  Can&#x27;t live without this cream especially in the winter, since it&#x27;s drier.  Thanks Curel!</li>
            <li> Super creamy. And a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin and this lotion is the best!  It provides very fast relief for itchy skin, and long term it seems to help with her eczema flare ups.</li>
            <li> Great for relief from eczema. I put it on my daughter from head to toe after every bath. She has no eczema flare ups. It is wonderful! Before we found this lotion it was a constant battle to find relief for her.</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely effective. I&#x27;ve had eczema and a milder form of ichthyosis vulgaris my entire life. Other than living in Hawaii, I haven&#x27;t found anything to help much. My daughter also has eczema and scratches to the point that she breaks the skin and gets skin infections. She is only two, so there is no way to help other than covering her up with long sleeves and pants in the middle of our hot, humid summers. Now I&#x27;m pregnant with my 2nd child and I am unbelievably ITCHY. Any of the pregnancy lotions (shea butter + cocoa butter) make me itch like I have fleas. The ones that don&#x27;t seem to make me itch worse, also don&#x27;t seem to help. The texture of this lotion is wonderful. It creates a layer that seems to soak into the skin and create a barrier at the same time. It isn&#x27;t thick or greasy like petroleum jelly, but still seems to give you that protection. It feels almost like a very thin layer of powder over the surface. If you&#x27;ve tried the other Curel lotions, they are OK, but this is significantly better for allergy prone, itchy skin. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient makes it so effective, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m really picky about my lotions. I&#x27;m prone to eczema and my legs tend to itch after shaving. This helps a bit. I also like that I can use this for my two year old son if he&#x27;s feeling dry. I usually put a little dab on his face after his baths because his cheeks are the most prone to dry skin. I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this!</li>
            <li> Item arrived. Bought 5 bottles, out of which one was opened and leaking.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic lotion for people with eczema. I have used it on my daughter for six months now ( since she was six months old). Really helps and she hasn&#x27;t had any flare ups since then. I use it in combination with aquaphor baby gentle wash and shampoo and she hasn&#x27;t had a flare up since.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that works for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema. Works better than any other product I have used on his skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I buy it for someone else, who seems to like it for dry itchy skin. I would probably try it except I prefer lotions that have a high EWG score for low carcinogens and neurotoxins. I&#x27;m one of those organic people and this lotion only gets a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; from EWG. I look for &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; or lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy, dry skin since I was a kid and I could never get it to go away until this stuff. It is the absolute best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Buying it on Amazon is super easy too because it seems to have disappeared from my local stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on a Mosquito Bug Bite.&lt;br /&gt;Relieves the itchy feeling and the Bite healed in about 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;My wife received some mini sample products at a supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;This is called Curel Itch Defense.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I wonder how well this product would work on a bug bite.&lt;br /&gt;Catch is some people are more sensitive to bug bites than others.&lt;br /&gt;I applied a lot of this lotion at the area of the bug bite.&lt;br /&gt;It is gummy on the skin and if you wash this off the itch comes back.&lt;br /&gt;This item works great. I never needed to scratch the bug bite.&lt;br /&gt;The site became red and sore looking but I did not feel the urge to scratch the itch.&lt;br /&gt;Curel Itch Defense MIGHT work for you. But, if you are sensitive nothing helps.&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered the large 20 oz bottle from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! There is no horrible perfume smell and its a really big bottle and best of all it actually works! I am in menapause and i have copd and asthma and i do breathing treatments! All of these things can seriously dry u out. My face has been so dry that i have actual sores on my face and i can even put this on my face!It feels soooo good and looks a thousand times better! And the icing on the cake? I orderd it late one night and got it two days later! I couldnt believe it! Do your self a favor and give this a try! Im soooooo glad i did!</li>
            <li> Our son suffered from eczema from age 6-9 month, and nothing helped to make things better. We tried ointments that the doctors prescribed, we tried homeopathic treatments, and just anything else. One day, a lady at a park where my son plays, told my wife about this cream. We bought it, used, it worked like magic. We&#x27;ve been using it since, occasionally when we spot a heavy rush.</li>
            <li> awful ingredients, would not be using these on my children. going with other products without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> this anti itch lotion is great&lt;br /&gt;and the price is really reasonable&lt;br /&gt;when i buy it in store its over $10&lt;br /&gt;definitly orderin again</li>
            <li> Unscented, but odd texture, not moisturizing, feels corn starchy. I much prefer the regular unscented Curel lotion, which I would give  5 stars to.</li>
            <li> I usually buy products based on what&#x27;s on sale, but not with this lotion.  I sometimes get eczema in the summer, and I have itchy skin in general.  It works on itch, isn&#x27;t greasy, and it&#x27;s not perfumy.  Sale or not, I buy it.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.  Works great!  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  Works great!  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised.  Works great!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing of this product, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I am disappointed that this has a fishy smell. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The only cream I trust with my eczema.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for itchy dry skin!</li>
            <li> So extremely helpful! This is the ONLY lotion I buy anymore! It&#x27;s also gentle enough for a light layer on your face.</li>
            <li> Good product - would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;We get really itchy skin in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Before we installed the humidifier, this stuff was a life-saving necessity.&lt;br /&gt;Tried a bunch of lotions, none worked as well as this for itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Price is the only complaint, but I&#x27;ll hapily pay more for lotion that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema pretty much as long as I can remember.  It&#x27;s not quite as severe as when I was younger, but it does flare up occasionally, especially during the dry winter months.  Normally I would just apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone, which helps a lot.  However the tubes are small, so the cost can add up.  After doing a bit of online research and reading customer reviews on various body lotions that target eczema prone skin, I narrowed it down to Eucerin Intensive Repair, Aveeno Eczema Therapy and Curel Itch Defense Lotion.  Eurcerin was a bit too heavy for me.  Aveeno was a bit pricey ($10 for 7.3 oz).  I got a 25 oz bottle of Curel for under $9.00.  I&#x27;ve been using Curel for a week now and my skin is much softer.  Unlike some other unscented lotions that can have a slightly weird smell, Curel doesn&#x27;t.  I haven&#x27;t scratched my dry spots at all.  I really am particular about lotions and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Curel.  It&#x27;s great as a hand lotion too!  A+++!  The reviews posted by other Amazon customers were very helpful!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t to wrong with Curel. This lotion works best with my eczema. It&#x27;s not thick and oily like most lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 5 month baby dry skin and it work miracle. I love how it moisture my baby skin without leaving it oily and best of all is unsented. I will recomendamos this lotion for new mom that have baby with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have environment allergies &amp; constant dry itchy skin no matter the season- this does the trick! I&#x27;ve tried Aveeno &amp; Eucericin creams/oils recommended by my allergist to no avail. This is by far my one &amp; only lotion. My skin is left soft &amp; itch free. Finally!</li>
            <li> This lotion has really helped my son&#x27;s eczema.  It&#x27;s gentle for his sensitive skin.  We have been using this since he was a little baby.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> we have been using this lotion for almost 2 years now.  Does a great job moisturinzing and helps with the itching.  Doesn&#x27;t have a terrible medicated smell like some others we have tried.  Does a good job.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I use it after I shower and it keeps my skin soft and stops the itching when I itch.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My daughter and I both use it and since buying this, my mother-in-law bought some because she loved it so much. It moisturizes and comforts the skin and does help with our very dry skin and helps keep eczema flare ups down. Will so buy it again! Awesome price for two large bottles of lotion!</li>
            <li> The item was as I expected.</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE and costs just a few cents more than the small bottle at the drug store.  I have year round mild-severe eczema on my hands and this is my favorite lotion for maintenance to ward off outbreaks.</li>
            <li> The best itch defense  body lotion I ever used.  This is my 3rd repeat buy as my other family members love it too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy and it immediately hydrates. I have several family members that came to visit and they used this on their visit. They now buy and use this lotion in their own homes!&lt;br /&gt;Due to it&#x27;s un-fragranced nature it can have a slightly odd sent that dissipates quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best Lotions for my eczema. .</li>
            <li> It was not thin and watery but nice and thick. It smelled nice and the large size lasted a long time, considering my grands used it too.</li>
            <li> This product does help relieve itchiness on use, but later still leaves a yucky clammy feeling that has you wanting a shower.  Except for a facial moisterizer used on the body, I have yet to find a lotion that absorbs so well that it leaves no stickiness.  The container&#x27;s quite sizeable, so much waste if you don&#x27;t use it anymore, which I&#x27;m not.  Really don&#x27;t like the tacky feeling it leaves you with at the end of the day.  One thing good, at least without the fragrance, mosquitos aren&#x27;t attracted to you so much and there aren&#x27;t headaches and nausea from the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but has a rancid smell.&lt;br /&gt;I realize it&#x27;s unscented, but is this normal?&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t continue using it due to the bad smell!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion at a great price</li>
            <li> my dougter  has egzema, and this is help, it doesnt make it disappear, but help to feel better for sure</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best for eczema. It has cured and healed my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I swear by it. It has worked, so far so good. She has had eczema sicne 4 months old. Her eczema seems to have stopped once we started using it. Absolutely adore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Maria</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has had eczema ever since she was 6 months old. We&#x27;ve tried so many products in the past: Aveeno, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aquaphor, California Baby, Cetaphil, Cerave, you name it - we&#x27;ve tried it. None of the products really worked for her.  This was the closest one which was mild enough to apply to areas where she has scratched up so badly without it stinging her.  We love it and believe it does help her skin. Not to say that this ended her flare ups. On really bad days, we have to turn to a little bit of prescription steriods mixed with Aquaphor (for dilution). But for the other days, this lotion is nice.  It is quite thin and I was skeptical at first because it is a lotion and not a cream, but it works very well and perhaps better than most creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> love this cream - it works like a charm</li>
            <li> A word of warning. My bottle was place inside a plastic bag, however the nozzle had ripped through the box and lotion was leaking out the top and was all over the cover of a book that was also in the box. Maybe order this separately from other items if you&#x27;re concerned about leakage. I&#x27;ve received other bottle products like shampoo which had a piece of tape securing the nozzle. Perhaps that is what needs to be done for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is pretty good. Not too sticky or greasy. I&#x27;m unsure if it actually reduces itching or if it&#x27;s reduced because it moisturizes skin, thus relieving itchiness. Either way, it&#x27;s good. The smell is also good. It does have a scent to it but it&#x27;s very subtle and typical of any fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> I was not sure of the result when I bought this, since thus far I have spent about $300 just in lotions, oils, and tropical ointment, and other medications for my son. Finally, something that heals and works on my son who is 16 month old.  His dermologist confirmed that he has eczema.  I&#x27;ve tried aquaphor, cerave, and all other medication his doctor prescribed.  They were all temporary and for one week his skin would clear up,  but would come back.  With this location I see his skin healing from day 1.  I have been using it on him now for over 3 weeks.  It is a miracle my little guy is no longer scratching. I use this on me too since I have dry and ichy skin in the winter. This is worth the try and money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema and skin problems.  We have tried multiple lotions.  Though the other lotions kept her moisturized, the itching never stopped.  We tried Curel Itch Defence Lotion recently and at least 75% of her itching is gone. Finally we found something that can stop the itching and moisturize at the same time. The flare ups are minimal. The only draw back is she has a very sensitive skin on her face and neck where this lotion stings for a bit after application. We still do the jojoba oil + Eucerine ointment on the neck. But in other places Curel does its magic.    Update: After a month, most of my dauhgter&#x27;s itching is gone. In the neck we do an additional layer of Curel Intensive Healing cream. It works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 7month old baby son, who used to have severe case of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;His skin improved a lot recently, but I am not sure if this lotion actually cured his condition.  Rather, I think it&#x27;s combination of him getting older and the other things.&lt;br /&gt;However, this lotion seemed to work just as well as more expensive lotion/creams I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> My little girl has &amp;#34;mild eczema&amp;#34;. Well if her eczema is mild I&#x27;d hate to see what severe eczema is like. Sometimes she scratches and scratches (even in her sleep) until she breaks the skin. She did this recently and ended up with a severe (and contagious) infection on her earlobe. This lotion is the only lotion that helps control the severity of her flare ups. It&#x27;s especially helpful when in pops up on her eyelids. If you or your child has eczema, I really recommend this. We love it so much that our whole family uses it to help with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found to relieve my chronic excema.  It acts as both a barrier and a moisterizer.  Be sure to pick the itch defense from the many varieties of Curel lotions ☼</li>
            <li> I am having problems with my legs being incredibly itchy since I moved to New Jersey.  I even went back to my home state for a few months and my legs were fine.  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the water in the house I&#x27;m living.  Anyway, I found this online and asked my fiance to pick it up on his way home from work.  I expected the 13oz or maybe the 20oz, but he came home with a 25oz.  The 20oz with 25% more free.  SO much lotion for a first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, in the morning after I get out of the shower, and just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does seem to keep my itchiness to a minimum.  I used to get so itchy sometimes that I&#x27;d wake up at night to scratch, and when I got up in the morning, my legs would have significant scratches on them that scabbed and took forever to heal.  Now I never get to that point.&lt;br /&gt;- The pump is pretty handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- When I&#x27;m applying it, it has a HORRIFIC rotten fish smell.  If I had bought it myself, I would probably ditch it and try another lotion.  But since my fiance spent 8 bucks on it, I feel like I should use it for a while.  I just hate the fish smell.&lt;br /&gt;- It does tend to sit on my skin. Even after waiting 10 minutes or so to put on my jeans, it&#x27;s still hard to pull them on because they stick to my skin due to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Works at reducing itching, but smells like rotten fish.</li>
            <li> I have been using Curel Fragrance Free Lotion, the original formula, with great success.  I am constantly battling hives and itchy welts on my skin, so I ordered this to try.  I prefer the Curel Fragrance Free Original.  Maybe because I do not have psoriasis, which is what this particular product is marketed towards, I find the original formula more pleasant.  This one seems a bit sticky, and almost made my skin a bit sensitive.  It may be great for psoriasis, but for me, the other formula is much better.</li>
            <li> I had given up on most lotions and soaps for my son&#x27;s moderate and persistent eczema.  Then one day while shopping for a lotion in the regular lotion section at Target I came across this Eczema Org symbol on the curel bottle and thought, &amp;#34;well, what the heck. If it doesn&#x27;t work for him then I&#x27;ll use it&amp;#34;. The next morning after his bath I lathered him up and the itchiness went away. We&#x27;ve been using this happily for a year now.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my dry skin and prevents bouts of itching.</li>
            <li> This lotion does it all. I have extremely sensitive skin that would constantly feel dry and get itchy. Now I never get dry skin, yes I use it every time I get out of the shower, but I&#x27;ll be honest if for some reason I skip a day, my skin stays pretty moist. I no longer have itching spells either. I didn&#x27;t have eczema, but just generally dry, itchy, and sensitive skin and this product works wonders. The smell is pleasant, basically non-existent. It moisturizes great, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or oil.</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old son has had very bad eczema since when he was about 1.5.  We&#x27;ve tried many lotions (gold bond, lubriderm, etc), and didn&#x27;t have any success.  Our allergist kept ordering steroids, and those drugs just scare us, and the skin would improve for a short time, but then return with a vengeance.  Then we found an ad for Curel Itch Defense in a &amp;#34;Family&amp;#34; magazine and decided to give it a try, after going to the website and read about it.  The improvement was almost immediate!  Within 3 days, the scabbiness on my son&#x27;s wrists and ankles had improved substantially.  Now, 2 months since we started using this lotion, his skin is nice and soft, and he rarely scratches any more.</li>
            <li> My dry sensitive thanks Curel for this terrific lotion and my allergic nose is so happy to find it&#x27;s fragrance free!  AND it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Walmart or CVS.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best anti-itch products on the market...in my opinion.  I have tried others and they do not do the job like Curel Anti-Itch Defense Lotion.  It is reasonably priced also.  I will use it again.  Hope it has the same results for the rest of you, because it provides great relief for me.</li>
            <li> really effective and quality product</li>
            <li> Stops the itching, seems to moisturize and doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Removes the itch. But it does leave a sweaty sticky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> We just started using last week, and so far we like it!  My husband has very dry skin and it is working quite well for him.  I will give more feedback after we have used it for a while.</li>
            <li> Dry skin ? This is your lotion. Stop buying all those lotions that say they work. This is the one that does work.&lt;br /&gt;Almost instantly it stops the itchiness. It soothes and adds moisture to your skin. It&#x27;s the best. I will not buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I have had excema all my life and tried soo many different products, from prescriptions to over the counters to natural remedies. This is only thing (other than one very expensive and small prescription cream that was only for small spots) that actually kept my excema calm for more than a few days. I bought this because it was half off and it was literally my last effort to find something that could help..I am so glad I did, yet disappointed I didn&#x27;t buy more than one! My excema has been so bad that at times I couldn&#x27;t even leave my house and I&#x27;d scratch so badly I have scars. I used this lotion through the changing of the seasons, which is always the worst time for me because of the day to day changes in temperature and humidity..this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I use Curel lotions simply because my skin loves it.  I apply this lotion on my skin, and my skin feels moist and soft after 24 hours later.  Now you know why I rated this product with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Lotion leaves my skin feeling sticky, not impressed. Still searching for a good anti itch lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for over 10 years and this is by far my preferred body lotion. It does a great job of soothing irritated skin and keeping my skin well moisturized for 24 hours. Love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that Amazon puts it in a plastic bag I case some leaks out during shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of other reviews, and I have received it for about a week, so far it seems working on my two-year-old&#x27;s hands and releases some itch of his skin</li>
            <li> My daughter has super dry skin, so I use this one her. I can&#x27;t use it on myself, it seems to burn a little when I put it on my face. My daughter hasn&#x27;t complained, so I keep using it one her. Cruel is a great brand!</li>
            <li> induced by those dry winter months. I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money on more expensive creams/lotions. keep this on subscribe and save so you don&#x27;t run out year long .. worked very well for us, the whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment! It did nothing for my itching and it is SO heavy and greasy. It felt so disgusting that I gave up waiting for it to work and showered it off because it was more uncomfortable then the itch.</li>
            <li> Myself &amp; my children have very sensitive skin &amp; some fragrance allergies, also dry skin issues. This lotion addresses all those problems.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps me keep my sanity when my eczema flares up.  Its the only otc lotion I&#x27;ve found that alleviates the itching and heals the redness to the extent that it does. My flare ups are fewer and further in between since I started using it. It&#x27;s awesome. seriously.</li>
            <li> My 4-month-old son has stubborn eczema, and we were having trouble keeping it at bay so I decided to give this a shot based on the reviews. It did not work for him at all, and after one day of use he was VERY red and itchy all over - way worse than he had been before. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that this is a lotion and not a cream, so it&#x27;s thin, so if you usually have better luck with thick creams and/or ointments, this may not be the best choice for you. We&#x27;ve gone back to just using plain Vaseline for now as it works much better than this for us.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and flaky skin, and this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found (after trying MANY) that keeps my face soft, supple, hydrated, and reduces redness. It also absorbs quickly into my skin, and DOESN&#x27;T leave my face looking or feeling greasy, like many other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Get this lotion! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!  Really heals your skin.</li>
            <li> I got it for my pregnant wife she didnt get one stretch mark!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for winter&#x27;s in Wisconsin.  Better price than Target plus I didn&#x27;t have to go outside in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion in our house besides what the newborn uses. Even helped with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this is pretty much the only lotion she can use.  She loves it and it&#x27;s not greasy either.</li>
