            <li> Less than one star really.  First shave out of the package and the razor was catching on my hair, not cutting it.  It seemed to have no trouble cutting my SKIN though!  Poor, ineffective, painful product.  Non-smooth blades.  It was the most painful shave in the last 20 years.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> These are horrible!! I would not recommend these to anyone! I had to basically scrape the skin off my underarm before it even began to cut. I never get razor burn but that&#x27;s not the case with this razor. It cut the hair on my legs ok (and also took a layer of skin with it) but only for the hair to return the next day. I will never buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> This blade is dull after shaving your armpits and half a leg. I don&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t cut as well--I mean you&#x27;d have a better shave if you scraped your skin with a dull rock. I&#x27;ll not be buying these again.</li>
            <li> After trying every other brand, I came back to Noxzema after having trouble finding them in the stores. They don&#x27;t nick, cut or razor burn like the other brands.</li>
            <li> These razors are extremely dangerous! Long story short, you&#x27;re better off hairy if these were the last razors on earth! I brought one of these along on a trip out of town last year for a wedding, and instead of going to the wedding I ended up going to the Emergency Room, NO JOKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graphic description follows, don&#x27;t read if you don&#x27;t want to understand what these blades are capable of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is dull on hair and sharp on skin. I was trying to gently shave around my ankle and it took off the entire layer of my skin, all the way to the cartilage. I had to go to the emergency room to get bandaged up. They warned me against using cheap razors in the future, needless to say. I now have a large scar that I could have avoided simply by spending a couple more dollars on a better quality disposable. Now when I travel I use the Gillette Venus Spa or Breeze razors, they have a shaving bar built in so I don&#x27;t haul shaving gel/cream with when I travel.</li>
            <li> I had to give this product 1 star in order to write this review, however it does not deserve a single star. These are by far the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used. You would be better off buying dollar store razors. I am not exaggerating when I say that it would not shave my under arm hair. I have normal hair (not coarse and not fine). I got razor burn because I had to scrap my skin for the blade to take the hair off. Do NOT waste your money. I wrote Noxzema about how bad these razors are and they sent me a coupon to buy more razors.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re as efficient as using a plastic butter knife. after 10 minutes of shaving one leg... it successfully removed ONE single blade of hair. maybe they&#x27;d be good for teaching your young teen how to shave... since there&#x27;s literally no way she could cut herself with these. They&#x27;re as sharp as a circle.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst razor I have ever used.  I tried several of them out of the pack thinking I just had a defective one.  Went over the same spot over a dozen times and finally had to go buy another brand to finish the job.  Contacted the manufacturer for a refund and was told I would have to send them a receipt as well as postage to get my money back.  Worst customer service ever!</li>
            <li> This razer is worse than the cheaper ones. I had to go over the areas twice just to get a regular shave.  It was also way too lightweight.  I replaced these with Gillete Venus.</li>
            <li> I clicked on the Noxema triple blade razors (#4) - and it came to this item. The one I clicked showed the Noxema razor that I think is the very best I&#x27;ve ever used. Notice the holes in the handle are all the same size in the first picture. In this add, they are different sizes. THIS is the new useless razor. It is good for about one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have gone everywhere in town and to Amazon and cannot find the great Nozema razors..&lt;br /&gt;This product is so bad they should be giving refunds.  Boohoo !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- when you click on the pac with the pink razor with the matching holes in the handle - you come to thenewer one which is useless</li>
            <li> This razor comes out of the package dull. I went through two in 5 minutes just to shave my legs and under arms. I&#x27;ve had dollar store razors better than these.</li>
            <li> This is the only disposable razor I have ever bought that failed the basic function of removing hair. Try *anything* else.</li>
            <li> They should sell their handle design to someone who can create a razor that actually shaves. Blades are recessed too far to actually come close to your skin.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for a disposable.  They only last a couple weeks with daily usage but that is not too bad!</li>
            <li> STAY FAR AWAY! I think they could use these to torture terrorist prisoners with. Idk how they did it, but they managed to make the dullest, deadliest razor possible. I&#x27;m up to 8 bandaids on my leg, and will probably require another multi-bandaid change soon. I don&#x27;t think a skin graft will be necessary,  I only hope that keeping my leg elevated stops the bleeding. My shower floor resembles the shower scene from the movie &amp;#34;Psycho&amp;#34;. I hope the bleeding stops before the blood on the shower floor dries.</li>
            <li> Worst razor ever. Brand new out of the package and it just pulls/skips right over your hair. If you feel like pushing hard enough you might get a few hairs with some skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use this razor if it was the only one left after the apocalypse. I might save more time with tweezers. Get this... I&#x27;m not even that hairy.</li>
            <li> A fresh blade couldn&#x27;t cut the on my leg after 10 swipes and still left razor burn. Apparently noxzema can&#x27;t figure out how to put a sharp piece of metal in a handle.</li>
            <li> I have never taken the time to write a negative review....but these are terrible.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very sharp.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of these razors. They feel very light and cheap. The shave doesn&#x27;t seem very smooth. I would go with another brand.</li>
            <li> My husband stole these and says they work well since they are triple blade. Will have to order more...lol</li>
            <li> Tired to use these, didn&#x27;t actually shave the hair.  Actually won&#x27;t cut anything...tried on several items for the fun of it, including an over ripe strawberry.</li>
