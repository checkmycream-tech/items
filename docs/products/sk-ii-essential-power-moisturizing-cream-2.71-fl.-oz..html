    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think the best thing I can say about SK-11 is that it delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizing cream ever.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife and I were both very impressed with the SK-II.  </li>
            <li>so I bought it here on amazon (the best price I found on the internet.)</li>
            <li>They are especially good to use after a long/late night without sleep.</li>
            <li>I think this cream will be wonderful during the winter when my skin tends to be drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best pre workout ever.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford it this is arguably the best moisturizing cream in the world in my opinions.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford it this is an incredible moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>and I began using Lancome&#x27;s Hydra Zen, which is no longer made, but it was the best for a good nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Seems peculiar for a company that goes to great explanatory lengths otherwise to explain the potency of its product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>so I am happy I found this and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that the cream did not break me out.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s non-greasy and feels great going on.</li>
            <li>(All this scrutinizing my skin in bright sunlight, as I&#x27;ve been doing throughout my experiment, is murder on my vanity, however.</li>
            <li>“And so with a superior proposition, what we&#x27;ve got is a superior claim of about 10 days&#x27; usage, you can get firmness of 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>it seems to be a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>As for the Dateline test, I don&#x27;t think its fair to judge the efficaciousness of a product by the reaction of one person.</li>
            <li>One good thing about the cream is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover my face and neck</li>
            <li>During the winter months I need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product line.  </li>
            <li>I try to spend my money on good skincare as a means of preventative care</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used the product for around two weeks and her feedback is very convincing; the product works</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>The Dateline experiment upholds my own experience.to judge the efficaciousness of a product by the reaction of one person.</li>
            <li>The Dateline experiment upholds my own experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not greasy, nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, but I inherited a good complexion and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for a woman my age.</li>
            <li>Well the price is kind of nuts</li>
            <li>it would really be nice</li>
            <li>it offered sun protection of some kind</li>
            <li>Though she wouldn&#x27;t say the results rose to the level of \\&quot;youthful looking\\&quot;, she did say she received complements from a number of her friends; and her husband, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion comes in a beautiful container and looks attractive next to my sink.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>On my wife&#x27;s fair skin there were significant improvements in the wrinkles and lines, easing some and erasing others.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free and am very glad that I have it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I don&#x27;t suppose it would be unreasonable to expect a product like this to come in an attractive package and jar; and this one certainly does.</li>
            <li>So, although I like the way it feels on my skin, I&#x27;ve come to expect a more explicit list of ingredients in my beauty products (these are not even listed on the jar) and an addition of sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li>This way, if your skin responds favorably to the product, you can buy more, but if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, you aren&#x27;t out all that</li>
            <li>As it turns out, many beauty treatments use some form of yeast in their concoctions.</li>
            <li>The company claims that \\&quot;skin is visibly firmer and more youthful-looking in</li>
            <li>But if paying more makes you walk taller</li>
            <li>But if paying more makes you walk taller</li>
            <li>This will be my top product in this line.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel and it also somehow seems to relax or minimize the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for one month, I found it to be a wonderful daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizing cream I have personally ever used.</li>
            <li>My face is firmer/plumper and feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>At this price point, the product should be outstanding, but I much more prefer my Olay products.</li>
            <li>cream is great and really moisturized my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so you either have to wear it at night or layer sun screen over top of it.</li>
            <li>For the price of the jar, I was expecting something more.  </li>
            <li>Everything seemed okay, except what bothered me</li>
            <li>* \\&quot;More</li>
            <li>* \\&quot;Skin is visibly firmer and more youthful looking in just 10 days.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(4) More youthful look?</li>
            <li>In any event, I am happy with the product but as I said I do have concerns about the high price and long-term effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The SK-II moistuizer has a nice velvety texture with no fragrance that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>That, backed by solid scientific credentialing and great teamwork, has really enabled us to deliver a great result.”</li>
            <li>Great for daily use and suitable for all seasons.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth, and I love applying it to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think the best thing to do is to get a sample of this product before committing to the full jar, especially if this is a splurge for you.</li>
            <li>wife was impressed with how soft and smooth the cream was, as well as how easily it absorbed into her skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this cream would be a good substitute, and while I really wanted to like it, I won&#x27;t seek it out again, and I doubt I finish the jar.  </li>
            <li>So if this lasts a year or even 6 months and it keeps your skin nice and glowy, it might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li>Unlike most moisturizers, this is non-greasy with a light and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Oh man I am one strong dude because of this product.</li>
            <li>&gt; If you&#x27;ve been using a drugstore or average department store moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be immediately impressed by this stuff.</li>
            <li>(3) Fine lines were beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and silky, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin dewey and lovely.</li>
            <li>After having used SK-II I can say that there is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The cream spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it continues as it seems to be, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to fit this stuff into my budget.</li>
            <li>If it continues as it seems to be, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to fit this stuff into my budget.</li>
            <li>a moisturizer, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Both visibly makes your skin look more youthful and fresh after 1 maybe 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li>, I can only tell my wife that her skin looks great, which is the truth.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a creature of habit, and once I get comfortable with something, I stick to it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to use it only at night and got some great results.  </li>
            <li>sample was free; never would&#x27;ve paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Price aside, this is a smooth and velvety moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.  </li>
            <li>Goes a long way and does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The cream is easy and pleasant to apply without any offending odor, and does a great job moisturizing and making skin feel supple; however, other products can do the same at a lower price point.</li>
            <li>Some beauty treatments are famous in the USA like Retin A, or hydroxyl acid, but pitera is more known in Japan and the far east.</li>
            <li>, the cream is light, it absorbs quickly, without leaving any greasy trace; and it is unscented (a biggie for me).</li>
            <li>Also, SKII feel nice and smooth going on your skin and maybe makes me look a little better?!  </li>
            <li>This creme is light ,seems very non scented,and goes  on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>:) The good news is that it seems to go far--after a month of use on my face and throat (half, but still), it looks barely touched, while there&#x27;s a good dent in the Youth Code.at or the shade).  </li>
            <li>:) The good news is that it seems to go far--after a month of use on my face and throat (half, but still), it looks barely touched, while there&#x27;s a good dent in the Youth Code.</li>
            <li>This is true both with my face relaxed and smiling.</li>
            <li>manufacturer claims visible results in two weeks, so I went for a full month, as demonstrated in the attached before and after pictures.  </li>
            <li>It did so without being greasy or oily, just rubbing in smooth and staying fresh all</li>
            <li>and she wants more.  </li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I don&#x27;t use this cream - my wife does.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it&#x27;s good [enough] stuff.  </li>
            <li>That was enough time to get a good idea of its effectiveness for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine is still rather full at the 2-3 month mark.</li>
            <li>My wife is very satisfied and pleased with SK-II products as expected.</li>
            <li>If you want something super moisturizing, there are better products out there that do the job for much cheaper (check out CeraVe cream).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof:  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried many, many different products, from drug-store brands to Sephora.</li>
            <li>This cream certainly goes on easily and it doesn&#x27;t cause her any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be used on top of ALL acne products as I discovered when I tried a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this moisturizer which is highly touted to reduce the appearance of aging and smooth out wrinkles.</li>
            <li>skin was firmer and the wrinkles around my eyes less noticeable as well as the wrinkles around my mouth when I smiled and I felt more confident and radiant and my skin felt soft and looked healthier.</li>
            <li>face cream as an award winning cream that \\&quot;fights multiple signs of aging and reduces the appearance of fine lines.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>In all honesty, I&#x27;ve been trying to find something else, because I&#x27;m not convinced that this is worth &amp;#</li>
            <li>destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pitera compound stimulates the skins natural cellular repair and promotes more efficient skin regeneration.  </li>
            <li>For me, while it is nice, it&#x27;s not such a drastic difference that I have to have</li>
            <li>The jar is especially eye catching and suited for placement on the bathroom counter instead of tucked away in a drawer or under the sink.</li>
            <li>you do decide to give it a whirl, I&#x27;m pretty sure most of you would like it, but please do check the bottom of the box and make sure it hasn&#x27;t expired, or that you&#x27;ve not bought it from Modern Everyday - Caveat emptor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>preliminary result: after a month of use, the lines on the right side of my face are fainter.</li>
            <li>The preliminary result: after a month of use, the lines on the right side of my face are fainter.</li>
            <li>right at the eye line, which was mitigated substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the right regimen, you can change your skin’s</li>
            <li>While the former is more in tune with my budget, I am very happy to have this very large, generous jar of high quality SK-II moisturizer to use for the next several months.</li>
            <li>And as I said before, it really absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found that many &amp;#34;odor-free&amp;#34; face creams actually have an odor to them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a wonder cream, but I definitely look better with it than without it.  </li>
            <li>This is not an exactly rigorous experiment.</li>
            <li>First a picture of a finger pointing to what looks like a book.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to use this product and even just after a week I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how smooth the texture of the cream is.</li>
            <li>But I will definitely continue to use this cream in the AM/PM to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>but I suppose if this works for you then you are willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Formulated with a potent anti-aging combination of Stem-Acanax and Pitera, SK-II Essential Power Cream</li>
            <li>Skin continued to be soft and smooth and stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>wife was pleased with this SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream and plans to continue using it until it is gone.</li>
            <li>Although technically fragrance free it has a mild yeasty smell to it</li>
            <li>first impression of the cream was a positive one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve been using this particular cream from SK-II for three years now, and right away (first use from this seller)</li>
            <li>although nothing is as good at removing pigment scarring as IPL lasers this product actually does help and nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried out of jar has helped at all, even when that was its only advertised claim.  </li>
            <li>cream itself, typically, has been very good; it&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, and seems to have slowed down my skin&#x27;s aging.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, I have acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin remarkably soft and smooth while still being light enough to not clog pores.  </li>
            <li>Back in the good old days when my skin was young and soft, I could get away with a quick lather of Night of Olay (we had Oil of Olay for day, and Night of Olay for night).  </li>
            <li>(strong Japanese beer.)</li>
            <li>I am so strong that the gym doesn&#x27;t have enough weight for me to lift</li>
            <li>Anyway, I can tell you for certain that this cream really works well -</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very discriminating when it comes to calling something truly</li>
            <li>I cant claim too much for it, tho</li>
            <li>The SK2 products are the leading luxury brand in Japan, where they don&#x27;t cost quite so much as in the USA.  </li>
            <li>just 10 days\\&quot; thanks to the combination of two anti-aging ingredients: Stem-Acanax and Pitera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much</li>
            <li>so I felt comfortable taking the plunge and spending an enormous amount of money on a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Let the lady try out the SK-II Essential Power cream as she is absolutely obsessed with keeping her face in tip top shape (I can, personally, without a hint of bias, vouch for her almost ethereal beauty that she wonderfully maintains).&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, the SK-II cream works very well but stomaching that price</li>
            <li>that aside, I really do like the way it makes my complexion feel.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and suffer from break outs and wrinkles</li>
            <li>and so I won&#x27;t have to spend as much time and money on makeup.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles do not have much change-and for the price</li>
            <li>Massage gently outwards to spread evenly.</li>
            <li>was this SK-II moisturizing cream doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li>I love that it is non-greasy and virtually scent-free (I am sensitive to perfumes, especially in moisturizing products).</li>
            <li>I found it a bit too heavy to use during the day since it has been really warm out here this summer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different special face creams creams, along with some cheap Olay \\&quot;Complete\\&quot;, on samples of my aging skin on my inner forearm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not instantaneous - in other words, it&#x27;s not like getting a photofacial, but in a way it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>This SK-II Essential Power Moisturizing Cream is evidently one of their more recent products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who live in the Midwest, using a moisturizing cream of some kind is essential, especially in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s different, and apparently some people have much better results from this cream, than others.  </li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s different, and apparently some people have much better results from this cream, than others.  </li>
            <li>The texture is dreamy, and it made my skin feel lovely, but with the $200+ price tag, I wanted to see if I could look past the confirmation bias and see if it was *really* worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure part of this was due to the cream, but it&#x27;s probably also because you tend to be a lot more meticulous with your skin when you&#x27;re throwing down a couple hundred bucks on the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly as it is super rich and creamy and it takes a few minutes to absorb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Small wrinkles seem to disappear and deeper ones are less prominent.</li>
            <li>I thought my wife may enjoy testing this SK-II product with me since the air is so dry here because of our seasonal snowfall.</li>
            <li>There is a mild scent but not enough to notice or be an issue.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more even,but I have a bit of red blotchiness after initial application,that fades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, the price seems really high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  </li>
            <li>The price is quite high</li>
            <li>But I passed that off, and now wish I had put a little more thought into it.  </li>
            <li>This entire experience has finally jarred me enough to put some time into researching a better product/solution; the return on this investment was OK, but again, not worth themoney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cream spreads on very lightly, so you need just the tiniest bit, and has very little aroma.  </li>
            <li>For the first few weeks, I definitely saw that my skin got softer and I was waking up to a more glowy complexion.</li>

            <li>When I was pregnant with my daughter, my skin got dry even during the summer</li>
            <li>I wash my face, use the Facial Treatment Essence then use Estee Lauder  Advanced Night Repair Serum and finish it off with the Essential Power Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it is fragrance free which is not true for the Amore Pacific brand.  </li>
            <li>First thing you might want to do, is to read a bit about SK2, or watch some of their videos about proper application of their skin care products.</li>
            <li>The first thing to notice was that, after using it, there was no film/residue present when washing it from skin.</li>
            <li>This soft, velvety moisturizer helps combat multiple signs of aging.\\&quot; For those who are interested, a list of ingredients are included on the retail box and on the SK-II website.</li>
            <li>Which is fantastic especially in the dry winter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dramatic enough to be incontrovertible to me, so I&#x27;m going to go another month and see what happens.</li>

            <li>But I do think overall the SKII is a little better for my skin.  </li>
            <li>By the way, my wife didn&#x27;t experience any of the negative results that other reviewers experienced, so if after an additional period of time she provides any new revelations concerning the product, or I notice a change for the better (or the worse)</li>

            <li>Lastly, I thought this paragraph from an interview with their president says a LOT about how they think as a company: it says absolutely NOTHING about the quality of the cream.</li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t find much benefit, after using it for almost two weeks.</li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t find much benefit, after using it for almost two weeks.</li>
            <li>Supposedly, old men working in a Sake brewing plant had young hands and they tried to figure out why.  </li>
            <li>In the end, it was determined that Pitera from the Sake&#x27;s yeast, was keeping the workers&#x27; hands really young looking.  </li>
            <li>is just asking too much and when I told her she&#x27;d have to buy the next bottle...</li>
            <li>That said, it looks like the bottle will last her around 3 months, but still, that works out to a bit over $1.00/day for a moisturizing cream, which is a bit much.</li>
            <li>My mom has used SK-II on and off for several years, but hasn&#x27;t really been sold on the brand&#x27;s product claims.</li>
            <li>This Essential Power Moisturizing Cream hasn&#x27;t done much to change her mind,</li>
            <li>This miracle ingredient is at the core of the revolutionary products SK-II offers.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using Essential Power pre workout my power level has gone up so much at the gym.</li>
            <li>was that the manufacturing date on the bottom of the box was completely scratched out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels rejuvinated and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>helps strengthen the skin and enhances its natural ability to renew itself, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and radically improving skin firmness.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like ridiculously sensitive.</li>
            <li>That makes it SK-II 5x - 8x (or more) more expensive than the other two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That makes it SK-II 5x - 8x (or more) more expensive than the other two.  </li>
            <li>This stuff feels like a whole different world from the Loreal Youth Code (my backup moisturizer), and still dramatically better than Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream (my usual).</li>
            <li>Another item worth noting is something I read in a couple of the other reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>but this seems to really get down into the skin and help slough off the older skin and allow the new skin to come through.</li>
            <li>I searched the scientific literature (via PubMed) for any research about a few of the special ingredients (SK-II, Stem-Acanax, Pitera, and Galactomyces), and have found nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyway, recently I moved and the change in my surroundings coupled with the stress of a new job has been putting my skin through a lot.</li>
            <li>The SK-II was fantastic at a long-lasting moisturizer that didn&#x27;t bail on me after a few hours like my less-expensive regular moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in your skin&#x27;s reaction to the active ingredient in SK2 products, PITERA, I suggest you buy a sample bottle of the skin toner.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned that because this moisturizer is so good it might be secretly clogging my pores or in some other make my acne worsen,</li>
            <li>I got about three weeks worth of use out of this little jar.</li>
            <li>price, it&#x27;s too high for my taste no matter how long</li>
            <li>Vandergrift University was not able to find these studies, nor anything else special about pitera either.</li>
            <li>But until then, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is anything special.</li>
            <li>rejuvenating powers of SK-II are clearly overhyped by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;But with an asking price of upwards of 80 bucks an ounce, this touting seems necessary to move the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SK-II apparently has none.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for my wife, but when it became apparent she wasn&#x27;t going to model her eye crinkles for everyone on Amazon, I decided to use it, too.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a really expensive moisturizer before, so this is a nice treat for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, like a night cream usually us, but it dials in nicely.</li>
            <li>long as folks hope a pill or elixir is all that&#x27;s needed to find happiness, as long as others lay down dollars on LOTTO&#x27;s illusion of instant millions, as long as there&#x27;s aging former beauties wanting to hold onto their youthful faces, there will always be a market for such concoctions as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the SK-II on the right half of my face and neck, and a cheaper moisturizer on the left.</li>
            <li>And I certainly can&#x27;t give her the critique, above, without risking my life, but I can say that I expect her to keep using this stuff from now on, and she likes it, so that&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agreed that my skin felt somewhat firmer after the trial period but not by much from the other products.  </li>
            <li>As for reducing the appearance of fine lines and a more youthful look, it didn&#x27;t seem to perform any better or any worse than the least expensive brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to Secret Key, this is \\&quot;SK-II&#x27;s bestselling and most awarded anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li>However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This cream absorbs fast but is packed with moisture so that my skin feels softer and my wrinkles look a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>And Loreal Youth Code Day/Night is $9.98 - $11.74/oz (or much less if you use one of the frequent coupon offers).</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep going like this for at least another month to be certain before I can rationalize a $200 face cream, but right now, I can see a difference in the sides, especially around my eyes, where both the network of fine lines and the bags under my eyes are less dramatic in the SKII side.</li>
            <li>I did not see any noticeable change to my skin, either good or bad.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I think the best thing I can say about SK-11 is that it delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream ever.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife and I were both very impressed with the SK-II.  </li>
            <li> so I bought it here on amazon (the best price I found on the internet.)</li>
            <li> They are especially good to use after a long/late night without sleep.</li>
            <li> I think this cream will be wonderful during the winter when my skin tends to be drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you can afford it this is arguably the best moisturizing cream in the world in my opinions.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford it this is an incredible moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> and I began using Lancome&#x27;s Hydra Zen, which is no longer made, but it was the best for a good nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Seems peculiar for a company that goes to great explanatory lengths otherwise to explain the potency of its product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
            <li> A great product.  </li>
            <li> so I am happy I found this and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that the cream did not break me out.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s non-greasy and feels great going on.</li>
            <li> (All this scrutinizing my skin in bright sunlight, as I&#x27;ve been doing throughout my experiment, is murder on my vanity, however.</li>
            <li> “And so with a superior proposition, what we&#x27;ve got is a superior claim of about 10 days&#x27; usage, you can get firmness of 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> As for the Dateline test, I don&#x27;t think its fair to judge the efficaciousness of a product by the reaction of one person.</li>
            <li> One good thing about the cream is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover my face and neck</li>
            <li> During the winter months I need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product line.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used the product for around two weeks and her feedback is very convincing; the product works</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>

            <li> The Dateline experiment upholds my own experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not greasy, nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, but I inherited a good complexion and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for a woman my age.</li>
            <li> Well the price is kind of nuts</li>
            <li> it would really be nice</li>
            <li> it offered sun protection of some kind</li>
            <li> Though she wouldn&#x27;t say the results rose to the level of \\&quot;youthful looking\\&quot;, she did say she received complements from a number of her friends; and her husband, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion comes in a beautiful container and looks attractive next to my sink.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> On my wife&#x27;s fair skin there were significant improvements in the wrinkles and lines, easing some and erasing others.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free and am very glad that I have it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I don&#x27;t suppose it would be unreasonable to expect a product like this to come in an attractive package and jar; and this one certainly does.</li>
            <li> So, although I like the way it feels on my skin, I&#x27;ve come to expect a more explicit list of ingredients in my beauty products (these are not even listed on the jar) and an addition of sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li> This way, if your skin responds favorably to the product, you can buy more, but if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, you aren&#x27;t out all that</li>
            <li> As it turns out, many beauty treatments use some form of yeast in their concoctions.</li>
            <li> The company claims that \\&quot;skin is visibly firmer and more youthful-looking in</li>
            <li> But if paying more makes you walk taller</li>
            <li> But if paying more makes you walk taller</li>
            <li> This will be my top product in this line.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and it also somehow seems to relax or minimize the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for one month, I found it to be a wonderful daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have personally ever used.</li>
            <li> My face is firmer/plumper and feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> At this price point, the product should be outstanding, but I much more prefer my Olay products.</li>
            <li> cream is great and really moisturized my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> so you either have to wear it at night or layer sun screen over top of it.</li>
            <li> For the price of the jar, I was expecting something more.  </li>
            <li> Everything seemed okay, except what bothered me</li>
            <li> * \\&quot;More</li>
            <li> * \\&quot;Skin is visibly firmer and more youthful looking in just 10 days.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (4) More youthful look?</li>
            <li> In any event, I am happy with the product but as I said I do have concerns about the high price and long-term effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The SK-II moistuizer has a nice velvety texture with no fragrance that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> That, backed by solid scientific credentialing and great teamwork, has really enabled us to deliver a great result.”</li>
            <li> Great for daily use and suitable for all seasons.</li>
            <li> The cream is smooth, and I love applying it to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think the best thing to do is to get a sample of this product before committing to the full jar, especially if this is a splurge for you.</li>
            <li> wife was impressed with how soft and smooth the cream was, as well as how easily it absorbed into her skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this cream would be a good substitute, and while I really wanted to like it, I won&#x27;t seek it out again, and I doubt I finish the jar.  </li>
            <li> So if this lasts a year or even 6 months and it keeps your skin nice and glowy, it might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li> Unlike most moisturizers, this is non-greasy with a light and smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Oh man I am one strong dude because of this product.</li>
            <li> &gt; If you&#x27;ve been using a drugstore or average department store moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be immediately impressed by this stuff.</li>
            <li> (3) Fine lines were beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and silky, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin dewey and lovely.</li>
            <li> After having used SK-II I can say that there is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> The cream spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it continues as it seems to be, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to fit this stuff into my budget.</li>

            <li> a moisturizer, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Both visibly makes your skin look more youthful and fresh after 1 maybe 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li> , I can only tell my wife that her skin looks great, which is the truth.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a creature of habit, and once I get comfortable with something, I stick to it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use it only at night and got some great results.  </li>
            <li> sample was free; never would&#x27;ve paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Price aside, this is a smooth and velvety moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.  </li>
            <li> Goes a long way and does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> The cream is easy and pleasant to apply without any offending odor, and does a great job moisturizing and making skin feel supple; however, other products can do the same at a lower price point.</li>
            <li> Some beauty treatments are famous in the USA like Retin A, or hydroxyl acid, but pitera is more known in Japan and the far east.</li>
            <li> , the cream is light, it absorbs quickly, without leaving any greasy trace; and it is unscented (a biggie for me).</li>
            <li> Also, SKII feel nice and smooth going on your skin and maybe makes me look a little better?!  </li>
            <li> This creme is light ,seems very non scented,and goes  on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> :) The good news is that it seems to go far--after a month of use on my face and throat (half, but still), it looks barely touched, while there&#x27;s a good dent in the Youth Code.at or the shade).  </li>

            <li> This is true both with my face relaxed and smiling.</li>
            <li> manufacturer claims visible results in two weeks, so I went for a full month, as demonstrated in the attached before and after pictures.  </li>
            <li> It did so without being greasy or oily, just rubbing in smooth and staying fresh all</li>
            <li> and she wants more.  </li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I don&#x27;t use this cream - my wife does.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it&#x27;s good [enough] stuff.  </li>
            <li> That was enough time to get a good idea of its effectiveness for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is still rather full at the 2-3 month mark.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied and pleased with SK-II products as expected.</li>
            <li> If you want something super moisturizing, there are better products out there that do the job for much cheaper (check out CeraVe cream).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof:  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried many, many different products, from drug-store brands to Sephora.</li>
            <li> This cream certainly goes on easily and it doesn&#x27;t cause her any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be used on top of ALL acne products as I discovered when I tried a new one.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this moisturizer which is highly touted to reduce the appearance of aging and smooth out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> skin was firmer and the wrinkles around my eyes less noticeable as well as the wrinkles around my mouth when I smiled and I felt more confident and radiant and my skin felt soft and looked healthier.</li>
            <li> face cream as an award winning cream that \\&quot;fights multiple signs of aging and reduces the appearance of fine lines.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, I&#x27;ve been trying to find something else, because I&#x27;m not convinced that this is worth &amp;#</li>
            <li> destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pitera compound stimulates the skins natural cellular repair and promotes more efficient skin regeneration.  </li>
            <li> For me, while it is nice, it&#x27;s not such a drastic difference that I have to have</li>
            <li> The jar is especially eye catching and suited for placement on the bathroom counter instead of tucked away in a drawer or under the sink.</li>
            <li> you do decide to give it a whirl, I&#x27;m pretty sure most of you would like it, but please do check the bottom of the box and make sure it hasn&#x27;t expired, or that you&#x27;ve not bought it from Modern Everyday - Caveat emptor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> preliminary result: after a month of use, the lines on the right side of my face are fainter.</li>

            <li> right at the eye line, which was mitigated substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the right regimen, you can change your skin’s</li>
            <li> While the former is more in tune with my budget, I am very happy to have this very large, generous jar of high quality SK-II moisturizer to use for the next several months.</li>
            <li> And as I said before, it really absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve found that many &amp;#34;odor-free&amp;#34; face creams actually have an odor to them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a wonder cream, but I definitely look better with it than without it.  </li>
            <li> This is not an exactly rigorous experiment.</li>
            <li> First a picture of a finger pointing to what looks like a book.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to use this product and even just after a week I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how smooth the texture of the cream is.</li>
            <li> But I will definitely continue to use this cream in the AM/PM to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> but I suppose if this works for you then you are willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Formulated with a potent anti-aging combination of Stem-Acanax and Pitera, SK-II Essential Power Cream</li>
            <li> Skin continued to be soft and smooth and stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> wife was pleased with this SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream and plans to continue using it until it is gone.</li>
            <li> Although technically fragrance free it has a mild yeasty smell to it</li>
            <li> first impression of the cream was a positive one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve been using this particular cream from SK-II for three years now, and right away (first use from this seller)</li>
            <li> although nothing is as good at removing pigment scarring as IPL lasers this product actually does help and nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried out of jar has helped at all, even when that was its only advertised claim.  </li>
            <li> cream itself, typically, has been very good; it&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, and seems to have slowed down my skin&#x27;s aging.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, I have acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin remarkably soft and smooth while still being light enough to not clog pores.  </li>
            <li> Back in the good old days when my skin was young and soft, I could get away with a quick lather of Night of Olay (we had Oil of Olay for day, and Night of Olay for night).  </li>
            <li> (strong Japanese beer.)</li>
            <li> I am so strong that the gym doesn&#x27;t have enough weight for me to lift</li>
            <li> Anyway, I can tell you for certain that this cream really works well -</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very discriminating when it comes to calling something truly</li>
            <li> I cant claim too much for it, tho</li>
            <li> The SK2 products are the leading luxury brand in Japan, where they don&#x27;t cost quite so much as in the USA.  </li>
            <li> just 10 days\\&quot; thanks to the combination of two anti-aging ingredients: Stem-Acanax and Pitera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much</li>
            <li> so I felt comfortable taking the plunge and spending an enormous amount of money on a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Let the lady try out the SK-II Essential Power cream as she is absolutely obsessed with keeping her face in tip top shape (I can, personally, without a hint of bias, vouch for her almost ethereal beauty that she wonderfully maintains).&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, the SK-II cream works very well but stomaching that price</li>
            <li> that aside, I really do like the way it makes my complexion feel.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and suffer from break outs and wrinkles</li>
            <li> and so I won&#x27;t have to spend as much time and money on makeup.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles do not have much change-and for the price</li>
            <li> Massage gently outwards to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> was this SK-II moisturizing cream doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the feel of this cream.</li>
            <li> I love that it is non-greasy and virtually scent-free (I am sensitive to perfumes, especially in moisturizing products).</li>
            <li> I found it a bit too heavy to use during the day since it has been really warm out here this summer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different special face creams creams, along with some cheap Olay \\&quot;Complete\\&quot;, on samples of my aging skin on my inner forearm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not instantaneous - in other words, it&#x27;s not like getting a photofacial, but in a way it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> This SK-II Essential Power Moisturizing Cream is evidently one of their more recent products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who live in the Midwest, using a moisturizing cream of some kind is essential, especially in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different, and apparently some people have much better results from this cream, than others.  </li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different, and apparently some people have much better results from this cream, than others.  </li>
            <li> The texture is dreamy, and it made my skin feel lovely, but with the $200+ price tag, I wanted to see if I could look past the confirmation bias and see if it was *really* worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure part of this was due to the cream, but it&#x27;s probably also because you tend to be a lot more meticulous with your skin when you&#x27;re throwing down a couple hundred bucks on the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly as it is super rich and creamy and it takes a few minutes to absorb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Small wrinkles seem to disappear and deeper ones are less prominent.</li>
            <li> I thought my wife may enjoy testing this SK-II product with me since the air is so dry here because of our seasonal snowfall.</li>
            <li> There is a mild scent but not enough to notice or be an issue.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more even,but I have a bit of red blotchiness after initial application,that fades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, the price seems really high.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  </li>
            <li> The price is quite high</li>
            <li> But I passed that off, and now wish I had put a little more thought into it.  </li>
            <li> This entire experience has finally jarred me enough to put some time into researching a better product/solution; the return on this investment was OK, but again, not worth themoney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cream spreads on very lightly, so you need just the tiniest bit, and has very little aroma.  </li>
            <li> For the first few weeks, I definitely saw that my skin got softer and I was waking up to a more glowy complexion.</li>

            <li> When I was pregnant with my daughter, my skin got dry even during the summer</li>
            <li> I wash my face, use the Facial Treatment Essence then use Estee Lauder  Advanced Night Repair Serum and finish it off with the Essential Power Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that it is fragrance free which is not true for the Amore Pacific brand.  </li>
            <li> First thing you might want to do, is to read a bit about SK2, or watch some of their videos about proper application of their skin care products.</li>
            <li> The first thing to notice was that, after using it, there was no film/residue present when washing it from skin.</li>
            <li> This soft, velvety moisturizer helps combat multiple signs of aging.\\&quot; For those who are interested, a list of ingredients are included on the retail box and on the SK-II website.</li>
            <li> Which is fantastic especially in the dry winter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dramatic enough to be incontrovertible to me, so I&#x27;m going to go another month and see what happens.</li>

            <li> But I do think overall the SKII is a little better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> By the way, my wife didn&#x27;t experience any of the negative results that other reviewers experienced, so if after an additional period of time she provides any new revelations concerning the product, or I notice a change for the better (or the worse)</li>

            <li> Lastly, I thought this paragraph from an interview with their president says a LOT about how they think as a company: it says absolutely NOTHING about the quality of the cream.</li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t find much benefit, after using it for almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t find much benefit, after using it for almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> Supposedly, old men working in a Sake brewing plant had young hands and they tried to figure out why.  </li>
            <li> In the end, it was determined that Pitera from the Sake&#x27;s yeast, was keeping the workers&#x27; hands really young looking.  </li>
            <li> is just asking too much and when I told her she&#x27;d have to buy the next bottle...</li>
            <li> That said, it looks like the bottle will last her around 3 months, but still, that works out to a bit over $1.00/day for a moisturizing cream, which is a bit much.</li>
            <li> My mom has used SK-II on and off for several years, but hasn&#x27;t really been sold on the brand&#x27;s product claims.</li>
            <li> This Essential Power Moisturizing Cream hasn&#x27;t done much to change her mind,</li>
            <li> This miracle ingredient is at the core of the revolutionary products SK-II offers.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using Essential Power pre workout my power level has gone up so much at the gym.</li>
            <li> was that the manufacturing date on the bottom of the box was completely scratched out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels rejuvinated and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> helps strengthen the skin and enhances its natural ability to renew itself, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and radically improving skin firmness.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like ridiculously sensitive.</li>
            <li> That makes it SK-II 5x - 8x (or more) more expensive than the other two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes it SK-II 5x - 8x (or more) more expensive than the other two.  </li>
            <li> This stuff feels like a whole different world from the Loreal Youth Code (my backup moisturizer), and still dramatically better than Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream (my usual).</li>
            <li> Another item worth noting is something I read in a couple of the other reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> but this seems to really get down into the skin and help slough off the older skin and allow the new skin to come through.</li>
            <li> I searched the scientific literature (via PubMed) for any research about a few of the special ingredients (SK-II, Stem-Acanax, Pitera, and Galactomyces), and have found nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anyway, recently I moved and the change in my surroundings coupled with the stress of a new job has been putting my skin through a lot.</li>
            <li> The SK-II was fantastic at a long-lasting moisturizer that didn&#x27;t bail on me after a few hours like my less-expensive regular moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> If you are interested in your skin&#x27;s reaction to the active ingredient in SK2 products, PITERA, I suggest you buy a sample bottle of the skin toner.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned that because this moisturizer is so good it might be secretly clogging my pores or in some other make my acne worsen,</li>
            <li> I got about three weeks worth of use out of this little jar.</li>
            <li> price, it&#x27;s too high for my taste no matter how long</li>
            <li> Vandergrift University was not able to find these studies, nor anything else special about pitera either.</li>
            <li> But until then, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is anything special.</li>
            <li> rejuvenating powers of SK-II are clearly overhyped by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;But with an asking price of upwards of 80 bucks an ounce, this touting seems necessary to move the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SK-II apparently has none.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my wife, but when it became apparent she wasn&#x27;t going to model her eye crinkles for everyone on Amazon, I decided to use it, too.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a really expensive moisturizer before, so this is a nice treat for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, like a night cream usually us, but it dials in nicely.</li>
            <li> long as folks hope a pill or elixir is all that&#x27;s needed to find happiness, as long as others lay down dollars on LOTTO&#x27;s illusion of instant millions, as long as there&#x27;s aging former beauties wanting to hold onto their youthful faces, there will always be a market for such concoctions as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the SK-II on the right half of my face and neck, and a cheaper moisturizer on the left.</li>
            <li> And I certainly can&#x27;t give her the critique, above, without risking my life, but I can say that I expect her to keep using this stuff from now on, and she likes it, so that&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agreed that my skin felt somewhat firmer after the trial period but not by much from the other products.  </li>
            <li> As for reducing the appearance of fine lines and a more youthful look, it didn&#x27;t seem to perform any better or any worse than the least expensive brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to Secret Key, this is \\&quot;SK-II&#x27;s bestselling and most awarded anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream absorbs fast but is packed with moisture so that my skin feels softer and my wrinkles look a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> And Loreal Youth Code Day/Night is $9.98 - $11.74/oz (or much less if you use one of the frequent coupon offers).</li>
            <li> And Loreal Youth Code Day/Night is $9.98 - $11.74/oz (or much less if you use one of the frequent coupon offers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep going like this for at least another month to be certain before I can rationalize a $200 face cream, but right now, I can see a difference in the sides, especially around my eyes, where both the network of fine lines and the bags under my eyes are less dramatic in the SKII side.</li>
            <li> I did not see any noticeable change to my skin, either good or bad.</li>
            <li> It spread out so easily so a little really went a long way.  </li>
            <li> There is a flat plastic stick with two different sized ends included in the box to remove the cream from the jar.</li>
            <li> It has potent anti-aging ingredients including &amp;#34;Stem-Acanax and pitera&amp;#34; and it visibly made my skin look less tired after two weeks of daily use in the morning and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Of course topical solutions only work as long as you continue to use them -</li>
            <li> So getting to try this tiny sample of the cream was really important for me before I would commit to purchasing such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had a few breakouts around my lips and nose that I normally don&#x27;t get after I used this cream.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a string fragrance, but it does make my face a little irritated, but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> wife applied the SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream twice daily as recommended and admitted that she noticed a skin softness she didn&#x27;t get with other products by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I use it as a night creme and as just a bit of moisturizer in the morning (especially during these dry winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have had skin troubles since my teens -- acne, dry skin, oily skin, etc.</li>
            <li> Though she likes it now, this is not necessarily a product my mom will seek out once the current jar is empty.</li>
            <li> SK-II Facial Treatment Masks deliver an indulgent concentration of Pitera™ in a single application.</li>
            <li> Your future isn’t limited by your DNA.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is really the key to helping the skin seem smoother and a little less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> It only speak to how they expect to sell it to us: “It really builds on the insight of the consumer believing that skin aging is accelerating, and she&#x27;s starting to fall behind,” said Joanne Crewes, President Global Prestige.</li>
            <li> (In contrast, [[ASIN:B00ET3D5VK L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream]] does leave the skin feeling immediately nicer due to various filler and plumping ingredients, but for it too, I found no lasting effect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use no face makeup and only use sunscreen if I&#x27;m spending time in direct sunlight (usually I opt for a hat or the shade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now maybe I&#x27;ll color out my grey hairs to match my youthful eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about usual advertising hype, but it does leave my face feeling very soft (and non-greasy).</li>
            <li> This has proven that I shouldn&#x27;t be so complacent and assuming, and perform some basic due diligence upon receiving products.  </li>
            <li> I often struggle with dry skin over the winter, and the extra-cold temperatures this year have meant the heater keeps the house extra-dry.  </li>
            <li> The skin seems moist ,and dry sreas softened and improved.</li>
            <li> There is a subtle fragrance, but nothing intense or offensive.</li>
            <li> No one is  going to pay this kind of money for a vague beauty cream that doesn&#x27;t provide us with, at the least, what we expect in a product.  </li>
            <li> I would hate for anyone out there to try this for the first time as an expired product, and not get to realize the full benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so that jar is going to last a lot longer than you might think.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 10 days: (1) Skin was soft and smooth and stayed moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin but get T-zone blackheads and occasional breakouts with heavy products.  </li>
            <li> I know we&#x27;re not supposed to rate the seller here, which I don&#x27;t feel like I am, but it&#x27;s hard not to rate this product considering its circumstances, which directly ties to its seller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aghast that someone would be so low to do something like this on such a large retail platform like Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Although the company does not claim its products to be organic or natural, I thought that for the price they ask for their cream, they would at least avoid ingredients that have chemically dubious reputations.  </li>
            <li> When I was offered the opportunity to try an SK-II cream, I took it since creams as expensive as those belonging to SK-II are rarely within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next a circle with 2 round arrows in it.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t see any wrinkles, not even crows&#x27; feet, and some of the &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; spots she had before (she had a bit of mis-coloration in a few spots) has entirely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The scent is minimal.  </li>
            <li> I decided a while back to give a few SK-II products a try.</li>
            <li> thing is, as it is when it comes to any expensive skincare product, asking myself whether the results are worth the price.</li>
            <li> They mentioned a manufacturing date, so I carefully inspected the retail box, inside and out, and the jar the cream came in.</li>
            <li> The SK-II product I am reviewing contains only 2.71 fluid ounces (80 ml) of cream, which initially seemed to be a very small quantity for its heavy sticker price.</li>
            <li> As I got older and a bigger bank account, I began using the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> but with this product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband also uses a moisturizer during the winter and tried this, and he felt the same way, there was an odd odor after having it on a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I read the list of ingredients, I started to feel a bit disappointed because it seems to contain as many chemicals</li>
            <li> abruptly my quest was over.  </li>
            <li> Me, on the other hand, am not interested in shelling out over $200 for not even 3 fl.</li>
            <li> Softer than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Winter dryness is a thing of the past, and my skin actually glows.</li>
            <li> In my defense, I use this only at night, and by that time, my brain is usually on auto-pilot.</li>
            <li> It plumps my face up so that the deep wrinkles are less deep and the shallow wrinkles seem to disappear.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buyers look to other sellers for this cream, given its expense.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of other moisturizers, all of this cheaper than this.  </li>
            <li> When compared to other moisturizing creams and lotions she had used, this SK-II was lighter and covered her face with less effort.</li>
            <li> And a very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At a \\&quot;pearl-sized\\&quot; amount per application, this SK-II cream should last her at least a month.</li>
            <li> At a \\&quot;pearl-sized\\&quot; amount per application, this SK-II cream should last her at least a month.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a smell in particular when it&#x27;s in the jar, but once you put it on, it seems to react with your skin and has an unpleasant odor, almost reminds me of a home where something was recently fried in the kitchen.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a silky thin texture which I personally like in a moisturizer as opposed to the heavier &amp;#34;richer&amp;#34; textures which I perceive as clogging my pores. I thought it odd that it comes without any directions though, not even a description of &#x27;what it does.&#x27; Seems peculiar for a company that goes to great explanatory lengths otherwise to explain the potency of its product. So, although I like the way it feels on my skin, I&#x27;ve come to expect a more explicit list of ingredients in my beauty products (these are not even listed on the jar) and an addition of sunscreen as well. SK-II apparently has none. Unless it is meant solely as a night cream -- and again, who knows? ... because there are no instructions -- you are going to require an additional product for day wear and protection. No one is  going to pay this kind of money for a vague beauty cream that doesn&#x27;t provide us with, at the least, what we expect in a product.  Lastly, I thought this paragraph from an interview with their president says a LOT about how they think as a company: it says absolutely NOTHING about the quality of the cream. It only speak to how they expect to sell it to us: “It really builds on the insight of the consumer believing that skin aging is accelerating, and she&#x27;s starting to fall behind,” said Joanne Crewes, President Global Prestige. “And so with a superior proposition, what we&#x27;ve got is a superior claim of about 10 days&#x27; usage, you can get firmness of 10 years ago. That, backed by solid scientific credentialing and great teamwork, has really enabled us to deliver a great result.”</li>
            <li> I think the best thing I can say about SK-11 is that it delivers what it promises. It&#x27;s not instantaneous - in other words, it&#x27;s not like getting a photofacial, but in a way it&#x27;s better. Why? Because you don&#x27;t have to deal with the burning and redness from photofacial. I use it as a night creme and as just a bit of moisturizer in the morning (especially during these dry winter months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference and so have co workers and friends. My skin feels better and looks better. Of course topical solutions only work as long as you continue to use them - but this seems to really get down into the skin and help slough off the older skin and allow the new skin to come through.</li>
            <li> Unlike most moisturizers, this is non-greasy with a light and smooth texture. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face. Great for daily use and suitable for all seasons.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free and am very glad that I have it.  I wouldn&#x27;t, though, spend $200+ for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The lotion comes in a beautiful container and looks attractive next to my sink.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The product has no fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  (I&#x27;ve found that many &amp;#34;odor-free&amp;#34; face creams actually have an odor to them.  So I&#x27;m very discriminating when it comes to calling something truly odorless.)&lt;br /&gt;3.  The cream is smooth, and I love applying it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The cream spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The cream leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the product because:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The container is heavy, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to carry it around in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I haven&#x27;t seen any anti-aging effects yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two weeks. I cant claim too much for it, tho it seems to be a good moisturizer.  It might have caused some pealing, which might be why some people find it evens out the skin tone. I did a lot of investigating about SK2 products on the internet. First thing you might want to do, is to read a bit about SK2, or watch some of their videos about proper application of their skin care products. I found some helpful suggestions provided by their company&#x27;s beauty ambassador Mr Jan (mrjanallinone.com), for example always apply the product with an upward motion, mouth to outer eye, to counter gravity&#x27;s effect on aging.  The SK2 products are the leading luxury brand in Japan, where they don&#x27;t cost quite so much as in the USA.  If you are interested in your skin&#x27;s reaction to the active ingredient in SK2 products, PITERA, I suggest you buy a sample bottle of the skin toner. This way, if your skin responds favorably to the product, you can buy more, but if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, you aren&#x27;t out all that money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHATS UP WITH PITERA?&lt;br /&gt;Pitera is a liquid that results from yeast fermentation, during the creation of sake. (strong Japanese beer.) As it turns out, many beauty treatments use some form of yeast in their concoctions. Some beauty treatments are famous in the USA like Retin A, or hydroxyl acid, but pitera is more known in Japan and the far east. NBC DATELINE conducted a test with SK2 products, applying it on half of a woman&#x27;s face for two weeks. After that period, the show&#x27;s make up artist could not discern any difference from the side of the face that was using SK2. The SK2 company maintains that they have tested, and proved, that pitera helps the skin to rejuvenate. Vandergrift University was not able to find these studies, nor anything else special about pitera either. It helps if you google pitera or SK2, and look for information that isn&#x27;t provided by the company.  As for the Dateline test, I don&#x27;t think its fair to judge the efficaciousness of a product by the reaction of one person. Everybody&#x27;s different, and apparently some people have much better results from this cream, than others.  Personally, I didn&#x27;t find much benefit, after using it for almost two weeks. The Dateline experiment upholds my own experience.to judge the efficaciousness of a product by the reaction of one person.

            <li> My choices for anti-aging creams have been Avon, Olay, and Ponds.  When I was offered the opportunity to try an SK-II cream, I took it since creams as expensive as those belonging to SK-II are rarely within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SK-II touts its Essential Power face cream as an award winning cream that \\&quot;fights multiple signs of aging and reduces the appearance of fine lines.\\&quot;  The company claims that \\&quot;skin is visibly firmer and more youthful-looking in just 10 days\\&quot; thanks to the combination of two anti-aging ingredients: Stem-Acanax and Pitera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the cream was a positive one.  It comes in a big jar (2.71 fl. Oz.), the cream is light, it absorbs quickly, without leaving any greasy trace; and it is unscented (a biggie for me). Also they provide a little plastic spatula to scoop the cream onto your hands, thus avoiding contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the list of ingredients, I started to feel a bit disappointed because it seems to contain as many chemicals as less expensive creams have, including three members of the paraben family (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben).  Although the company does not claim its products to be organic or natural, I thought that for the price they ask for their cream, they would at least avoid ingredients that have chemically dubious reputations.  However, since the brands I use contain parabens too, I decided that the cream should be judged by the results its star ingredients, Pitera and Stem-Acanax, may achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream for three weeks. I applied it every night and twice on the weekends. One good thing about the cream is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover my face and neck so a jar should last a couple of months.  And as I said before, it really absorbs quickly.  I agreed that my skin felt somewhat firmer after the trial period but not by much from the other products.  As for reducing the appearance of fine lines and a more youthful look, it didn&#x27;t seem to perform any better or any worse than the least expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.  But if paying more makes you walk taller, then perhaps paying $200 for a face cream might make your skin glow.  After all, attitude contributes to beauty too.better or any worse than the least expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me who think that the more you pay for a product, the better quality or the better results you should get, then this cream may not satisfy that standard.

            <li> Love this product!  Don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  Goes a long way and does a great job of moisturizing.  This will be my top product in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who actuall cares about my skin.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream as an evaluation sample, saw the price and thought, &amp;#34;Are they crazy, or what&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tried it.  Best moisturizing cream ever.  I love the way it makes my face feel and it also somehow seems to relax or minimize the wrinkles.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a wonder cream, but I definitely look better with it than without it.  Just returned from a cruise and had some sun damage.  This cream changed the entire feel of my skin.  So much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitera is supposedly the &amp;#34;secret ingredient&amp;#34;, which is made from a specific type of yeast.  Supposedly, old men working in a Sake brewing plant had young hands and they tried to figure out why.  In the end, it was determined that Pitera from the Sake&#x27;s yeast, was keeping the workers&#x27; hands really young looking.  So surprise, it was added into a line of cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, the price seems really high.  But it&#x27;s great stuff.  5 stars based on the product&#x27;s merits alone.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve been using this on half my face &amp; Loreal Youth Code on the other half for a little over two months. I&#x27;m going to keep going like this for at least another month to be certain before I can rationalize a $200 face cream, but right now, I can see a difference in the sides, especially around my eyes, where both the network of fine lines and the bags under my eyes are less dramatic in the SKII side. This is true both with my face relaxed and smiling. My forehead lines have also lightened on the SKII side, though the lines in the corners of my mouth are still the same, as is the somewhat crepey skin on my eyelids. . (All this scrutinizing my skin in bright sunlight, as I&#x27;ve been doing throughout my experiment, is murder on my vanity, however. Even the improved side looks worse that I realized. I think there&#x27;s a lesson here...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;ve been using a drugstore or average department store moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be immediately impressed by this stuff. It&#x27;s light and silky, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin dewey and lovely. And a very little goes a long way. This stuff feels like a whole different world from the Loreal Youth Code (my backup moisturizer), and still dramatically better than Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream (my usual). The texture is dreamy, and it made my skin feel lovely, but with the $200+ price tag, I wanted to see if I could look past the confirmation bias and see if it was *really* worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what did I do? An experiment, natch. I&#x27;ve been using the SK-II on the right half of my face and neck, and a cheaper moisturizer on the left. This is not an exactly rigorous experiment. I started out with Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream, but ran out after 2 weeks and switched to Loreal Youth Code Day and Night. I used each cream on half of my face and throat, morning and bedtime. I wash my face with water only, so this is the only product I&#x27;m using. I use no face makeup and only use sunscreen if I&#x27;m spending time in direct sunlight (usually I opt for a hat or the shade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is $79.33/oz with amazon&#x27;s current 215 price tag. Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra is $11.07 - 15.59/oz, depending on the jar size. And Loreal Youth Code Day/Night is $9.98 - $11.74/oz (or much less if you use one of the frequent coupon offers). That makes it SK-II 5x - 8x (or more) more expensive than the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preliminary result: after a month of use, the lines on the right side of my face are fainter. It&#x27;s not dramatic enough to be incontrovertible to me, so I&#x27;m going to go another month and see what happens. If it continues as it seems to be, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to fit this stuff into my budget. :) The good news is that it seems to go far--after a month of use on my face and throat (half, but still), it looks barely touched, while there&#x27;s a good dent in the Youth Code.at or the shade).

            <li> I picked this up for my wife, but when it became apparent she wasn&#x27;t going to model her eye crinkles for everyone on Amazon, I decided to use it, too.  Plus what 40yo guy wouldn&#x27;t want to look a little younger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims visible results in two weeks, so I went for a full month, as demonstrated in the attached before and after pictures.  On my wife&#x27;s fair skin there were significant improvements in the wrinkles and lines, easing some and erasing others.  On me I saw the biggest difference in my smile-wrinkle (blame it on 20 years in sales) right at the eye line, which was mitigated substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  I often struggle with dry skin over the winter, and the extra-cold temperatures this year have meant the heater keeps the house extra-dry.  The SK-II was fantastic at a long-lasting moisturizer that didn&#x27;t bail on me after a few hours like my less-expensive regular moisturizers.  It did so without being greasy or oily, just rubbing in smooth and staying fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife and I were both very impressed with the SK-II.  Now maybe I&#x27;ll color out my grey hairs to match my youthful eyes.</li>
            <li> The first thing to notice was that, after using it, there was no film/residue present when washing it from skin. Also, when applied it did not cause the skin to look shiny but it did give it a supple feel. The price is a bit steep though thus the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I have been a habitué of sephora forever and have tried all their moisturizers in a quest for skin that feels like dewy summer skin during the winter months.  I thought I was dreaming the impossible dream until my local Sephora started carrying this.  One little sample pot and abruptly my quest was over.  That sample pot lasted me two weeks (used twice a day) so I felt comfortable taking the plunge and spending an enormous amount of money on a moisturizer.  However, I didn&#x27;t actually want to spend the extra 50$ dollars it was going for at sephora so I bought it here on amazon (the best price I found on the internet.) This product does give your face a youthful glow- which is not a euphemism for oily or greasy- just healthier and honestly, younger.  It also has a slight ability to lighten pigment scarring from acne (which I have a lot of this winter) although nothing is as good at removing pigment scarring as IPL lasers this product actually does help and nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried out of jar has helped at all, even when that was its only advertised claim.  I do still get hormonal acne and I was concerned that because this moisturizer is so good it might be secretly clogging my pores or in some other make my acne worsen, but no, that hasn&#x27;t happened and it&#x27;s been over a month of continuous use.  One thing- it can&#x27;t be used on top of ALL acne products as I discovered when I tried a new one.  The two products interacted and created a &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; effect and I had to wash my face to get the sticky things off and start over.  However that interaction didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin but get T-zone blackheads and occasional breakouts with heavy products.  After using this product for one month, I found it to be a wonderful daily moisturizer.  It keeps my skin remarkably soft and smooth while still being light enough to not clog pores.  However, there has been no appreciable improvement in my skin tone or coloration and no noticeable reduction in wrinkles.  I am unlikely to purchase SK-II regularly because it is just too expensive for what is, in effect, a daily moisturizer only.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I need a good moisturizer.  Back in the good old days when my skin was young and soft, I could get away with a quick lather of Night of Olay (we had Oil of Olay for day, and Night of Olay for night).  As I got older and a bigger bank account, I began using the expensive creams. When I was pregnant with my daughter, my skin got dry even during the summer and I began using Lancome&#x27;s Hydra Zen, which is no longer made, but it was the best for a good nighttime moisturizer.  I was hoping this cream would be a good substitute, and while I really wanted to like it, I won&#x27;t seek it out again, and I doubt I finish the jar.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell in particular when it&#x27;s in the jar, but once you put it on, it seems to react with your skin and has an unpleasant odor, almost reminds me of a home where something was recently fried in the kitchen.  My husband also uses a moisturizer during the winter and tried this, and he felt the same way, there was an odd odor after having it on a few minutes. Also, I had a few breakouts around my lips and nose that I normally don&#x27;t get after I used this cream.  I&#x27;m not sure why it has the pricey tag, but I know I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Let the lady try out the SK-II Essential Power cream as she is absolutely obsessed with keeping her face in tip top shape (I can, personally, without a hint of bias, vouch for her almost ethereal beauty that she wonderfully maintains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used the product for around two weeks and her feedback is very convincing; the product works and she wants more.  Me, on the other hand, am not interested in shelling out over $200 for not even 3 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps her skin from itching for up to a 24-hour period.&lt;br /&gt;Requires very little application allowing the 2.71 fl. oz bottle to last over a month (her projections, not mine).&lt;br /&gt;No discernable anti-aging results but it definitely improves day-to-day comfort of facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, it&#x27;s too high for my taste no matter how long that bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the SK-II cream works very well but stomaching that price is just asking too much and when I told her she&#x27;d have to buy the next bottle... well, I&#x27;m sleeping on the couch tonight for that one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different special face creams creams, along with some cheap Olay \\&quot;Complete\\&quot;, on samples of my aging skin on my inner forearm. In the short run, I am not seeing any lasting differences in moisturization among the creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream spreads on very lightly, so you need just the tiniest bit, and has very little aroma.  After an hour, I could detect no discernible difference between the moisturized skin and the neighboring unmoisturized skin. (In contrast, [[ASIN:B00ET3D5VK L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream]] does leave the skin feeling immediately nicer due to various filler and plumping ingredients, but for it too, I found no lasting effect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some of the claimed effects of this cream are gradual, so if I notice any changes over time, I will report back.  But until then, I&#x27;m not sure this cream is anything special. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof:  I searched the scientific literature (via PubMed) for any research about a few of the special ingredients (SK-II, Stem-Acanax, Pitera, and Galactomyces), and have found nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made in Japan and distributed by a London-based company.  There is a number code stamped on it, but it is not an obvious date.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about usual advertising hype, but it does leave my face feeling very soft (and non-greasy). Softer than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before. No noticeable fragrance. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, but I inherited a good complexion and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for a woman my age. It&#x27;s my hands that are wrinkled and thin skinned, so maybe I should try a little on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long scary looking list of ingredients, including 3 types of parabens. The only instructions are 3 pictures which make no sense to me. First a picture of a finger pointing to what looks like a book. Next a circle with 2 round arrows in it. Am I supposed to stir it, recycle it, or put it in the drier? The last picture looks like the opened jar with &amp;#34;12 M&amp;#34; written on the jar. What does that mean? 12 meters? I did look at the amazon site, and there it says to use a pearl size amount twice a day. What size pearl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, I really do like the way it makes my complexion feel. I&#x27;ve never used a really expensive moisturizer before, so this is a nice treat for me.</li>
            <li> A great product.  Works as advertized.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something wrong with it. My face got some serious reactions with it. Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to use this product and even just after a week I could tell a difference.  The cream is on the heavy side but not overly dense.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  There is a mild scent but not enough to notice or be an issue.  I had been looking to change moisturizer so I am happy I found this and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have personally ever used. I love that it is non-greasy and virtually scent-free (I am sensitive to perfumes, especially in moisturizing products). Over the years, I have tried many, many different products, from drug-store brands to Sephora. While the former is more in tune with my budget, I am very happy to have this very large, generous jar of high quality SK-II moisturizer to use for the next several months. After several weeks of twice daily use, I can notice a visible difference in the look and feel of my skin. Winter dryness is a thing of the past, and my skin actually glows. I used to think that those claims by skin creams were just pipe-dreams and marketing hype, but this SK-II moisturizer actually does what it advertises. If I can re-arrange my budget to accommodate this luxury item, it will definitely become a staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> 4 1/2 stars (A half star less for the price.)&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer works!  My face is firmer/plumper and feels more hydrated.  Which is fantastic especially in the dry winter.  However, I am not sure about the price- if I would get it again.  I am currently using the Amore Pacific Moisture Bound Sleeping Recovery Masque which also hydrates my skin well and is less expensive.  But I do think overall the SKII is a little better for my skin.  The main thing is that it is fragrance free which is not true for the Amore Pacific brand.  Also, SKII feel nice and smooth going on your skin and maybe makes me look a little better?!  It is hard to tell.  Both visibly makes your skin look more youthful and fresh after 1 maybe 2 days of use.  They are especially good to use after a long/late night without sleep.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this cream. At this price point, the product should be outstanding, but I much more prefer my Olay products. The cream is watery and goes on very thin. It does not provide all th moisture that I need and it does not make my skin feel any different after using it. I wouldn&#x27;t order this one again.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I don&#x27;t use this cream - my wife does.  Anyway, I can tell you for certain that this cream really works well - her skin has a glow to it like I haven&#x27;t seen in years, I can&#x27;t see any wrinkles, not even crows&#x27; feet, and some of the &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; spots she had before (she had a bit of mis-coloration in a few spots) has entirely disappeared.  This cream certainly goes on easily and it doesn&#x27;t cause her any breakouts.  I also note that some pores that I used to see on her nose are no longer noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can only tell my wife that her skin looks great, which is the truth.  And I certainly can&#x27;t give her the critique, above, without risking my life, but I can say that I expect her to keep using this stuff from now on, and she likes it, so that&#x27;s not really an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this cream is really, really expensive.  That said, it looks like the bottle will last her around 3 months, but still, that works out to a bit over $1.00/day for a moisturizing cream, which is a bit much.</li>
            <li> My mom has used SK-II on and off for several years, but hasn&#x27;t really been sold on the brand&#x27;s product claims. This Essential Power Moisturizing Cream hasn&#x27;t done much to change her mind, although she does like it a lot. It&#x27;s moisturizing without the sticky feeling that creams sometimes leave behind, and her skin definitely feels softer. However, the anti-aging claims she feels are unfounded in her case; whereas SK-II says that &amp;#34;most users agree that their skin feels firmer after just two weeks&amp;#34;, my mom was unfortunately in the apparent minority who didn&#x27;t see or feel any firming effects. The cream is easy and pleasant to apply without any offending odor, and does a great job moisturizing and making skin feel supple; however, other products can do the same at a lower price point. Though she likes it now, this is not necessarily a product my mom will seek out once the current jar is empty.</li>
            <li> My review will echo AC34 somewhat.  I bought it August 29th, so maybe around the same time they did.  I&#x27;m aghast that someone would be so low to do something like this on such a large retail platform like Amazon.  Maybe that sounds a bit naive, but I have always trusted Amazon, thus the sellers.  This has proven that I shouldn&#x27;t be so complacent and assuming, and perform some basic due diligence upon receiving products.  Sigh.  The 30-day window has passed, so I guess I&#x27;m out $130.00. :(  I know we&#x27;re not supposed to rate the seller here, which I don&#x27;t feel like I am, but it&#x27;s hard not to rate this product considering its circumstances, which directly ties to its seller.  I would hate for anyone out there to try this for the first time as an expired product, and not get to realize the full benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve been using this particular cream from SK-II for three years now, and right away (first use from this seller) I did notice a difference in viscosity of the cream, compared to the others I&#x27;ve purchased from Sephora in the past; it was slight, but it was noticeable.  But I passed that off, and now wish I had put a little more thought into it.  In my defense, I use this only at night, and by that time, my brain is usually on auto-pilot. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself, typically, has been very good; it&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, and seems to have slowed down my skin&#x27;s aging.  For example, I was beginning to develop deep crows feet, and it minimized it to a few very thin, short lines around my eyes.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it&#x27;s good [enough] stuff.  In all honesty, I&#x27;ve been trying to find something else, because I&#x27;m not convinced that this is worth &amp;#62;$100 at all, but I&#x27;m a creature of habit, and once I get comfortable with something, I stick to it.  This entire experience has finally jarred me enough to put some time into researching a better product/solution; the return on this investment was OK, but again, not worth themoney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to give it a whirl, I&#x27;m pretty sure most of you would like it, but please do check the bottom of the box and make sure it hasn&#x27;t expired, or that you&#x27;ve not bought it from Modern Everyday - Caveat emptor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for smell, texture, and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for effectivity, in relation to cost (would be a 4 if it were less expensive).&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for amount received for the price.</li>
            <li> The SK-II company uses only the highest quality ingredients which is reflected in the price tag of their product line.  The SK-II Essential Power Moisturizing Cream, 2.71 fl. oz. sells for $215.00 at Amazon and Sephora.  So getting to try this tiny sample of the cream was really important for me before I would commit to purchasing such an expensive product.  The little jar holds a bit less than .05 oz of the cream but with this product a little goes a long way. I have really oily skin and suffer from break outs and wrinkles (what a combo) so I was a little bit afraid that the cream would break me out.  I used a pea size amount on the drier parts of my skin to see if I would break out.  I am happy to say that the cream did not break me out.  I was also surprised at how smooth the texture of the cream is. It spread out so easily so a little really went a long way.  I got about three weeks worth of use out of this little jar. That was enough time to get a good idea of its effectiveness for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is great and really moisturized my skin.  I found it a bit too heavy to use during the day since it has been really warm out here this summer.  I decided to use it only at night and got some great results.  I think this cream will be wonderful during the winter when my skin tends to be drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the BzzAgent website the &amp;#34; SK-II Essential Power Cream contains Stem-Acanax and Pitera™ to radically improve firmness and reduce wrinkles&amp;#34;.  This miracle ingredient is at the core of the revolutionary products SK-II offers. SK-II Facial Treatment Essence is a liquid concentrate with 90% Pitera™ in every bottle. SK-II Facial Treatment Masks deliver an indulgent concentration of Pitera™ in a single application. Your future isn’t limited by your DNA. With the right regimen, you can change your skin’s destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pitera compound stimulates the skins natural cellular repair and promotes more efficient skin regeneration.  For those who do not know, Pitera is a type of fermented yeast that is supposed to speed up the skins rejuvenation process.  The yeast come from Saki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.

            <li> I used the SK-II line, including the water and the serum, for several months.  It is a good product line.  Absorbs well and leaves skin well moisturized.  The scent is minimal.  I did not see any noticeable change to my skin, either good or bad.</li>
            <li> Best pre workout ever. Ever since I started using Essential Power pre workout my power level has gone up so much at the gym. I take a half hour before my workout and &amp;#34;BAM&amp;#34; I have power to spare. I am so strong that the gym doesn&#x27;t have enough weight for me to lift so they have a couple dudes put desk and vending machines on the barbells while I am lifting them. Oh man I am one strong dude because of this product.</li>
            <li> I decided a while back to give a few SK-II products a try. I try to spend my money on good skincare as a means of preventative care and so I won&#x27;t have to spend as much time and money on makeup. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have had skin troubles since my teens -- acne, dry skin, oily skin, etc. My skin just likes to screw with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, recently I moved and the change in my surroundings coupled with the stress of a new job has been putting my skin through a lot. I purchased this and the Facial Treatment Essence and added it to my routine. I wash my face, use the Facial Treatment Essence then use Estee Lauder  Advanced Night Repair Serum and finish it off with the Essential Power Moisturizing Cream. For the first few weeks, I definitely saw that my skin got softer and I was waking up to a more glowy complexion. I&#x27;m sure part of this was due to the cream, but it&#x27;s probably also because you tend to be a lot more meticulous with your skin when you&#x27;re throwing down a couple hundred bucks on the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thing is, as it is when it comes to any expensive skincare product, asking myself whether the results are worth the price. I didn&#x27;t see a miraculous difference. If you want something super moisturizing, there are better products out there that do the job for much cheaper (check out CeraVe cream). Granted, this 2.71 oz  container will probably last months. Mine is still rather full at the 2-3 month mark. So if this lasts a year or even 6 months and it keeps your skin nice and glowy, it might be worth it for you. For me, while it is nice, it&#x27;s not such a drastic difference that I have to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best thing to do is to get a sample of this product before committing to the full jar, especially if this is a splurge for you.</li>
            <li> This creme is light ,seems very non scented,and goes  on easy and smooth. The skin seems moist ,and dry sreas softened and improved. My wrinkles do not have much change-and for the price I believe this is not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream. My skin is more even,but I have a bit of red blotchiness after initial application,that fades.I assume that is variable for skin types.</li>
            <li> OPINION:&lt;br /&gt;The rejuvenating powers of SK-II are clearly overhyped by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;But with an asking price of upwards of 80 bucks an ounce, this touting seems necessary to move the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sample was free; never would&#x27;ve paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Simply, does time run backwards?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as folks hope a pill or elixir is all that&#x27;s needed to find happiness, as long as others lay down dollars on LOTTO&#x27;s illusion of instant millions, as long as there&#x27;s aging former beauties wanting to hold onto their youthful faces, there will always be a market for such concoctions as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  This cream absorbs fast but is packed with moisture so that my skin feels softer and my wrinkles look a lot less noticeable. It plumps my face up so that the deep wrinkles are less deep and the shallow wrinkles seem to disappear.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have any sun screen in it so you either have to wear it at night or layer sun screen over top of it.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied and pleased with SK-II products as expected.</li>
            <li> Well the price is kind of nuts but maybe I&#x27;m just not used to buying products of this calibre. Price aside, this is a smooth and velvety moisturizing cream that&#x27;s non-greasy and feels great going on. A little goes a long way so that jar is going to last a lot longer than you might think. Been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small wrinkles seem to disappear and deeper ones are less prominent. Even after one application my skin feels smoother to the touch and there&#x27;s a sensation of firmness or tightness. Although technically fragrance free it has a mild yeasty smell to it that&#x27;s not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price it would really be nice it offered sun protection of some kind but alas it has no SPF.</li>
            <li> The SK-II moistuizer has a nice velvety texture with no fragrance that absorbs quickly into the skin. After a few minutes you would never know it was applied.  After several weeks of using this, I&#x27;m not convinced I see any results.  For the price of the jar, I was expecting something more.  But I will definitely continue to use this cream in the AM/PM to see if I get better results. On a positive note, I have acne prone skin and this caused me no problems. Four stars because of the expense!!  If I see a substantial change in my skin I will update.</li>
            <li> Purchased this from Modern Everyday with one-day shipping. Everything seemed okay, except what bothered me was that the manufacturing date on the bottom of the box was completely scratched out. Now, I know that SK-II lasts 3 years from manufacture and 1 year from opening, and from what I can tell between the scratches this product was made in 2011. However, I think it&#x27;s unethical for a seller to scratch off the manufacturing date on products that definitely can expire/lose their potency. I would recommend buyers look to other sellers for this cream, given its expense.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to do what it says it will do. I remain somewhat skeptical about products like these in the long-term but in the short term it seems to make the skin look and feel smoother. The price is quite high so I am also somewhat concerned about that but I suppose if this works for you then you are willing to pay the price. I do find that as a moisturizer it works quite well. Maybe this is really the key to helping the skin seem smoother and a little less wrinkly. In any event, I am happy with the product but as I said I do have concerns about the high price and long-term effectiveness.</li>
            <li> If my budget could absorb the cost I would buy this cream forever. I was excited to try this moisturizer which is highly touted to reduce the appearance of aging and smooth out wrinkles. It has potent anti-aging ingredients including &amp;#34;Stem-Acanax and pitera&amp;#34; and it visibly made my skin look less tired after two weeks of daily use in the morning and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was firmer and the wrinkles around my eyes less noticeable as well as the wrinkles around my mouth when I smiled and I felt more confident and radiant and my skin felt soft and looked healthier. Use it sparingly as it is super rich and creamy and it takes a few minutes to absorb.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream is wonderful.  If you can afford it this is arguably the best moisturizing cream in the world in my opinions.  I have tried tons of other moisturizers, all of this cheaper than this.  After having used SK-II I can say that there is a huge difference.  The quality and texture of this cream is in a class by itself.  My skin feels rejuvinated and incredibly soft.  If you can afford it this is an incredible moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> For those who live in the Midwest, using a moisturizing cream of some kind is essential, especially in the wintertime. I thought my wife may enjoy testing this SK-II product with me since the air is so dry here because of our seasonal snowfall. Secret Key (SK) is a company in Japan and has been developing a variety of beauty creams since the 1980s; so they are no newcomer to the cosmetic business. This SK-II Essential Power Moisturizing Cream is evidently one of their more recent products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suppose it would be unreasonable to expect a product like this to come in an attractive package and jar; and this one certainly does. The jar is especially eye catching and suited for placement on the bathroom counter instead of tucked away in a drawer or under the sink. Though Secret Key (SK) products are manufactured in Japan, the P&amp;G Prestige in London, UK distributes this product for them. The SK-II product I am reviewing contains only 2.71 fluid ounces (80 ml) of cream, which initially seemed to be a very small quantity for its heavy sticker price. However, after visiting the SK-II website I noticed that the recommended application is only a \\&quot;pearl-sized\\&quot; amount of cream. In other words, you don&#x27;t need to slather this moisturizing cream on you face, as if you were using cold cream (I&#x27;m dating myself now!). There is a flat plastic stick with two different sized ends included in the box to remove the cream from the jar. Here are the basic instructions from the SK-II Application Guide on their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;How to use: Take a pearl-sized amount of the cream and dot your face. Massage gently outwards to spread evenly. Use morning and night after the essence.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was impressed with how soft and smooth the cream was, as well as how easily it absorbed into her skin. When compared to other moisturizing creams and lotions she had used, this SK-II was lighter and covered her face with less effort. According to Secret Key, this is \\&quot;SK-II&#x27;s bestselling and most awarded anti-aging cream. This soft, velvety moisturizer helps combat multiple signs of aging.\\&quot; For those who are interested, a list of ingredients are included on the retail box and on the SK-II website. Here is the essential product claim, also pulled from their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Formulated with a potent anti-aging combination of Stem-Acanax and Pitera, SK-II Essential Power Cream helps strengthen the skin and enhances its natural ability to renew itself, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and radically improving skin firmness.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* \\&quot;More than 90% of users say their skin feels firmer after just two weeks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* \\&quot;Skin is visibly firmer and more youthful looking in just 10 days.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife applied the SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream twice daily as recommended and admitted that she noticed a skin softness she didn&#x27;t get with other products by the next morning. But, of course, she wanted to wait the 10 days and 2 weeks before comparing her results to that of what SK-II claims should be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 days: (1) Skin was soft and smooth and stayed moisturized all day. (2) Some areas appeared firmer. (3) Fine lines were beginning to fade. (4) More youthful look? Not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks: (1) Skin continued to be soft and smooth and stayed moisturized all day. (2) Fine-lines were less noticeable and her face felt firmer. (3) Though she wouldn&#x27;t say the results rose to the level of \\&quot;youthful looking\\&quot;, she did say she received complements from a number of her friends; and her husband, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed that my wife didn&#x27;t mention was this SK-II moisturizing cream doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell. There is a subtle fragrance, but nothing intense or offensive. Another item worth noting is something I read in a couple of the other reviews about this product. They mentioned a manufacturing date, so I carefully inspected the retail box, inside and out, and the jar the cream came in. I could find nothing that resembled a date of any configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was pleased with this SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream and plans to continue using it until it is gone. At a \\&quot;pearl-sized\\&quot; amount per application, this SK-II cream should last her at least a month. By the way, my wife didn&#x27;t experience any of the negative results that other reviewers experienced, so if after an additional period of time she provides any new revelations concerning the product, or I notice a change for the better (or the worse), I will try to remember to add a postscript to this review.th this SK-II Essential Moisturizing Cream and plans to continue using it until it is gone.

            <li> I actually really like the feel of this cream. It&#x27;s heavy, like a night cream usually us, but it dials in nicely. It doesn&#x27;t have a string fragrance, but it does make my face a little irritated, but I have very sensitive skin. Like ridiculously sensitive. My daughter tried it and had none of the same issues. I will still use it, despite the slight irritation.</li>
