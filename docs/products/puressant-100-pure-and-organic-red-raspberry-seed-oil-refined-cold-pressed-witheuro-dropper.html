            <li>Nice oil.  </li>
            <li>This is highly effective and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion .</li>
            <li>First I noticed the smell which is incredible.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very impressed with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I have been on the lookout for a suitable skin care product for my day to day application.</li>
            <li>and it took going to see a GOOD aesthetician to really find a good strategy for combating breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle of oil!</li>
            <li>This is the best and the purest of the red raspberry seed oils I have found.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>; I always try things from them and don’t worry if I don’t like it, but I ALWAYS love everything.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better now.</li>
            <li>Since I found out that I have UV damage to my eyes, I realized that I needed to find something that was better than what I was finding in the stores to use as protection.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this company does not test on any animals, and that they don&#x27;t use fillers.</li>
            <li>Just because I received this at a discounted rate, does not take away from how awesome red raspberry seed oil is!</li>
            <li>The fact that it doubles as a sunscreen makes it all the better because I’m able to serve 2 purposes with 1 product.</li>
            <li>On our next trip to the beach, we tried the oil and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Ok this is my 4th Puressant product and yes by now even I feel biased towards this brand name.</li>
            <li>Now, I love Raspberries,</li>
            <li>I figure that ought to give the two ingredients to work their collective magic and guess what - ever since I started using the Raspberry Seed Oil, I notice scars regenerating gradually.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I tried jojoba oil before I tried this, and this is way better for me and my acne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t no raspberry oil was so healthy that it wouldn&#x27;t even irritate skin at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Most products, even the fragrance free options are not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>This oil is such a wonderful moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It not only helps soothe all the irritation that cause my breakouts, but it’s a great moisturizer, too!</li>
            <li>I had no idea it had so many healing properties.  </li>
            <li>and my face has never looked or felt so healthy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more progress.</li>
            <li>The kids like it so much more than spraying in their face</li>
            <li>I love that I can mix this raspberry oil in with my SPF and apply that on my skin I have never thought of doing that before.</li>
            <li>and I am so sure with more time use you will see softer skin if I already feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Oh yea and it smells pretty good too. :)</li>
            <li>The raspberry fragrance is sweet and nice.</li>

            <li>This oil is so great on my sensitive skin!</li>

            <li>You really can&#x27;t expect anything more out of a product.</li>

            <li>I received this red raspberry oil for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my skin very easily and leaves it feeling soft and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Seed oil has a safe and naturally high SPF</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with several attributes including the aroma and</li>
            <li>I hoped since it was pure and organic it would be fine, and luckily it was.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend getting some as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida and are in the sun probably more than we should be.  </li>
            <li>We live right by the Gulf of Mexico, so protecting ourselves from harmful sun rays is always top priority.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But even beyond using it as protection, red raspberry seed oil is amazing for skin issues.</li>
            <li>Red raspberry has been absolutely amazing for me.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>This Red Rasberry Seed Oil is amazing ..</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the expiration on my bottle says 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just more sensitive,</li>
            <li>like some people are more sensitive to vegetables with oxalate and cilantro, for example.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive, but I am able to use this after I wash my face and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li>Since I have started, my skin has become soft and blemish free!</li>
            <li>Just one more reason to go completely natural.</li>
            <li>I love the smell which is the same smell you would get from crushing up fresh raspberries.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this Red Raspberry Seed Oil so I could make my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This left my face more smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>sunscreens contain toxic ingredients or endocrine disrupting chemicals that in many cases may actually promote skin cancer growth and free radical production in the body.</li>
            <li>My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably.</li>
            <li>It also is very quickly absorbed — I’d say it falls in between a dry oil like rosehip or tamanu and a slightly heavier oil like jojoba, which is perfect since I personally blend the two, and advise others to do the same to get the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>This oil delivered positive results to my sister from the very first day onward.</li>
            <li>I can feel proud to use it everyday!</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the fact that my dry skin is barely noticeable right now, and to be honest it minimized some of the wrinkles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>This 100 % Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>have a theory that some people are more sensitive to the smell of certain seed oils.</li>
            <li>If you have fair and sensitive skin, Red Raspberry Seed Oil is just right.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat 100% pure and organic!</li>
            <li>Not only is red raspberry seed oil great for sunscreen</li>
            <li>When I learnt about Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil under Puressant, I immediately ordered one to try based on the good experience I had with their products so far.</li>
            <li>has so many benefits other than being a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>will make me hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product, its left my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>In fact, I love Raspberries but only as a fruit!</li>
            <li>Five Star Product!&lt;br /&gt;You cannot get better and cheaper red raspberry seed oil online, i promise you!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I put on my raspberry seed oil first, wait a couple minutes, put some aloe vera gel on, wait a couple minutes, and then put my mineral makeup on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of this essential oil!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Raspberry Seed Oil.  </li>
            <li>I want to take him outside more</li>
            <li>There is only one ingredient which makes it better for your skin rather than having a ton of chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li>This product really helps and also helped right away and gave immediate relief.  </li>
            <li>My cousin can seem a little wacky with all the natural remedies, but this product has been highly effective at adding much needed moisture to my face and clearing up the acne and acne scarring.</li>
            <li>As a person who&#x27;s had a long history of skin problems, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to clear up acne or eczema using natural ingredients, or just anyone who wants to see smoother, more radiant skin.</li>
            <li>and you can tell straight away the oil is acting on your skin, whether it is to cure some issues or simply to feel good.</li>
            <li>I often get headaches that are triggered by certain scents.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from eczema whenever I consume certain food.</li>
            <li>daily moisturizer cream makes this little bottle of joy a must for me.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that it worked for both case I could see a suttle difference within only a few weeks of application.  </li>
            <li>I have not broken out and believe it truly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I really wish that I had some before and after pictures to prove that this stuff is like</li>
            <li>product does NOT smell like raspberry or much of anything else for that matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it made my hands feel much softer too.</li>
            <li>This oil really worked for my acne problem.</li>
            <li>I like that this oil is very versatile you can use it practically anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It really makes it easier to move on with my finger and feels soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel after about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>but the price was soooooo much lower</li>
            <li>this is not irritating.</li>
            <li>For me, raspberry seed oil is an absolute miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>To soft the skin is OK, but my intention was to use it as a sunscreen since Red Raspberry Seed Oil should have a high level of protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fatty acids and host of antioxidants in this particular oil is just amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high quality and the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic</li>
            <li>reasons to use Raspberry seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs UV-B and UV-C so useful as a broad spectrum</li>
            <li>In fact, in the years since sunscreen use began, skin cancer rates have actually risen, and a 2007 document from the FDA stated that: “The FDA is not aware of data demonstrating that sunscreen use alone helps prevent skin cancer” many reports show that most sunscreens actually raise skin cancer risk.</li>
            <li>When it comes to things I use for my children, the less non-natural ingredients, the better.  </li>
            <li>The color and consistency of this particular brand tell me</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li>high in Vitamin E – an antioxidant.</li>
            <li>high levels of phytosterols that can help reduce trans epidermal water loss thereby helping to keep skin moisturised</li>
            <li>and I wish I had listened a little more closely.</li>
            <li>It only takes two drops to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly.</li>

            <li>They aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before but it will still take a few more months to completely get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can lightly smell the scent for a few hours after the massage which is very calming to me.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle will allow me to use the oil multiple times before it runs out, which I also like very much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>It makes me look so young!</li>
            <li>The liquid doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily and sticky, which was a big concern for me at first.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>After applying to my dry skin I was able to apply make up to my face without it looking flaky, dry,  and caked on.</li>
            <li>Someone turned us onto red  raspberry seed oil recently and we simply love this one as a daily moisturizer and as a natural spf.  </li>
            <li>My first impression upon smelling the oil was that it was rancid but after further investigation I realized it&#x27;s the natural scent.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using red raspberry seed oil daily for the past few weeks with great results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth, a little goes</li>
            <li>She was fed up with chemical based products, but decided to use 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil since it is made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Putting a little bit on each morning keeps my skin smooth and soft, as well as keeps it protected from the sun when we go out.  </li>
            <li>Finding Puressant’s 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has definitely made my day and it’s for this reason that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I did a little research to find the most bennificial uses of red rasperry seed oil and found that most sources agree on at least 6 uses</li>
            <li>I used it for moisture and eczema; someone told me if you use the purest you can find it will clear up acne also.</li>
            <li>It is suspiciously silky, and so far no irritation on my insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I’ve always had incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised, my skin was never irritated by this.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how soft my skin feels whenever I use it, and it isn&#x27;t just a five minute softness</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have absurdly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use that much of this product so it will last you awhile.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>love finding natural solutions (that actually work) for my everyday skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I started using this product everyday and in a matter of a week my face not only looked better</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect base for my foundation.</li>
            <li>A friend told me that she had stated using organic red raspberry seed oil for the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to people who have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is my go-to source for high quality organic essential oils.</li>
            <li>I also love that its all natural, I hate using too many chemicals or processed lotions, this one is all natural.</li>
            <li>This 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has done wonders for my skin since I have started using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I used the 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil for the sole purpose to reduce wrinkles and soften my skin.  </li>
            <li>Due to this, I&#x27;m very hesitant to put new things on my face.</li>
            <li>It is really a must have for anyone who has dry skin or a condition like mine.</li>
            <li>I used to have extremely dry skin that moisturizer really wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really worked for me was this red raspberry seed oil!</li>
            <li>Though my acne isn&#x27;t 100% gone, I&#x27;d definitely say its at least 90% better.</li>
            <li>This study show that elegiac acid “reduced the destruction of collagen and inflammatory response, both major causes of wrinkles.”</li>
            <li>I have had thyroid issues for many years, and one of the side effects is excessive dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical, but she insisted that it is a great natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Plus, its completely organic unlike corticosteroids contained in the topical creams.</li>
            <li>I had never thought of Raspberries as a natural cure for skin ailments prior to seeing this.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin that tends to retain scars from acnes, pimples and even simple injuries.</li>
            <li>Essential for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this red raspberry oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>– it is not overpowering at all, and is just barely there.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin in the past several weeks.</li>
            <li>This is by far the highest quality oil I have purchased and the only one I&#x27;ve found to actually work.</li>
            <li>Unlike topical creams that smell really bad, this actually smells great.</li>
            <li>But there are so many things that my dermatologist tried to give to me that actually made it worse because of all of the fillers that were put into specific medicines.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend can even usually tell if I haven’t been drinking a gallon of water a day for a while, because it goes right to my chin.</li>
            <li>-inflammatory due to high content of alpha linolenic acid (the highest in any fruit seed oil) and phytosterols therefore helpful for eczema and psoriasis</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been on the lookout for a suitable skin care product for my day to day application.</li>

            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend getting some as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida and are in the sun probably more than we should be.  </li>
            <li> We live right by the Gulf of Mexico, so protecting ourselves from harmful sun rays is always top priority.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But even beyond using it as protection, red raspberry seed oil is amazing for skin issues.</li>
            <li> Red raspberry has been absolutely amazing for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> This Red Rasberry Seed Oil is amazing ..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just more sensitive,</li>
            <li> like some people are more sensitive to vegetables with oxalate and cilantro, for example.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive, but I am able to use this after I wash my face and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> Since I have started, my skin has become soft and blemish free!</li>
            <li> Just one more reason to go completely natural.</li>
            <li> I love the smell which is the same smell you would get from crushing up fresh raspberries.</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this Red Raspberry Seed Oil so I could make my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This left my face more smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> sunscreens contain toxic ingredients or endocrine disrupting chemicals that in many cases may actually promote skin cancer growth and free radical production in the body.</li>
            <li> My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably.</li>
            <li> It also is very quickly absorbed — I’d say it falls in between a dry oil like rosehip or tamanu and a slightly heavier oil like jojoba, which is perfect since I personally blend the two, and advise others to do the same to get the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> This oil delivered positive results to my sister from the very first day onward.</li>
            <li> I can feel proud to use it everyday!</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of this essential oil!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Raspberry Seed Oil.  </li>
            <li> I want to take him outside more</li>
            <li> There is only one ingredient which makes it better for your skin rather than having a ton of chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product really helps and also helped right away and gave immediate relief.  </li>
            <li> My cousin can seem a little wacky with all the natural remedies, but this product has been highly effective at adding much needed moisture to my face and clearing up the acne and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> As a person who&#x27;s had a long history of skin problems, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to clear up acne or eczema using natural ingredients, or just anyone who wants to see smoother, more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> and you can tell straight away the oil is acting on your skin, whether it is to cure some issues or simply to feel good.</li>
            <li> I often get headaches that are triggered by certain scents.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema whenever I consume certain food.</li>
            <li> daily moisturizer cream makes this little bottle of joy a must for me.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that it worked for both case I could see a suttle difference within only a few weeks of application.  </li>
            <li> I have not broken out and believe it truly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I really wish that I had some before and after pictures to prove that this stuff is like</li>
            <li> product does NOT smell like raspberry or much of anything else for that matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it made my hands feel much softer too.</li>
            <li> This oil really worked for my acne problem.</li>
            <li> I like that this oil is very versatile you can use it practically anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It really makes it easier to move on with my finger and feels soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel after about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> but the price was soooooo much lower</li>
            <li> this is not irritating.</li>
            <li> For me, raspberry seed oil is an absolute miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> To soft the skin is OK, but my intention was to use it as a sunscreen since Red Raspberry Seed Oil should have a high level of protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fatty acids and host of antioxidants in this particular oil is just amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high quality and the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic</li>
            <li> reasons to use Raspberry seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs UV-B and UV-C so useful as a broad spectrum</li>
            <li> In fact, in the years since sunscreen use began, skin cancer rates have actually risen, and a 2007 document from the FDA stated that: “The FDA is not aware of data demonstrating that sunscreen use alone helps prevent skin cancer” many reports show that most sunscreens actually raise skin cancer risk.</li>
            <li> When it comes to things I use for my children, the less non-natural ingredients, the better.  </li>
            <li> The color and consistency of this particular brand tell me</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> high in Vitamin E – an antioxidant.</li>
            <li> high levels of phytosterols that can help reduce trans epidermal water loss thereby helping to keep skin moisturised</li>
            <li> and I wish I had listened a little more closely.</li>
            <li> It only takes two drops to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I breakout easily with regular moisturizers and red raspberry seed oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new face lotion and this surpasses anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before but it will still take a few more months to completely get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can lightly smell the scent for a few hours after the massage which is very calming to me.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle will allow me to use the oil multiple times before it runs out, which I also like very much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It helps clear up everything!  </li>
            <li> It makes me look so young!</li>
            <li> The liquid doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily and sticky, which was a big concern for me at first.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> After applying to my dry skin I was able to apply make up to my face without it looking flaky, dry,  and caked on.</li>
            <li> Someone turned us onto red  raspberry seed oil recently and we simply love this one as a daily moisturizer and as a natural spf.  </li>
            <li> My first impression upon smelling the oil was that it was rancid but after further investigation I realized it&#x27;s the natural scent.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using red raspberry seed oil daily for the past few weeks with great results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth, a little goes</li>
            <li> She was fed up with chemical based products, but decided to use 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil since it is made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Putting a little bit on each morning keeps my skin smooth and soft, as well as keeps it protected from the sun when we go out.  </li>
            <li> Finding Puressant’s 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has definitely made my day and it’s for this reason that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I did a little research to find the most bennificial uses of red rasperry seed oil and found that most sources agree on at least 6 uses</li>
            <li> I used it for moisture and eczema; someone told me if you use the purest you can find it will clear up acne also.</li>
            <li> It is suspiciously silky, and so far no irritation on my insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I’ve always had incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised, my skin was never irritated by this.</li>
            <li> Did I mention how soft my skin feels whenever I use it, and it isn&#x27;t just a five minute softness</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have absurdly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use that much of this product so it will last you awhile.</li>

            <li> love finding natural solutions (that actually work) for my everyday skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I started using this product everyday and in a matter of a week my face not only looked better</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> A friend told me that she had stated using organic red raspberry seed oil for the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to people who have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to source for high quality organic essential oils.</li>
            <li> I also love that its all natural, I hate using too many chemicals or processed lotions, this one is all natural.</li>
            <li> This 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has done wonders for my skin since I have started using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I used the 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil for the sole purpose to reduce wrinkles and soften my skin.  </li>
            <li> Due to this, I&#x27;m very hesitant to put new things on my face.</li>
            <li> It is really a must have for anyone who has dry skin or a condition like mine.</li>
            <li> I used to have extremely dry skin that moisturizer really wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really worked for me was this red raspberry seed oil!</li>
            <li> Though my acne isn&#x27;t 100% gone, I&#x27;d definitely say its at least 90% better.</li>
            <li> This study show that elegiac acid “reduced the destruction of collagen and inflammatory response, both major causes of wrinkles.”</li>
            <li> I have had thyroid issues for many years, and one of the side effects is excessive dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but she insisted that it is a great natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Plus, its completely organic unlike corticosteroids contained in the topical creams.</li>
            <li> I had never thought of Raspberries as a natural cure for skin ailments prior to seeing this.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin that tends to retain scars from acnes, pimples and even simple injuries.</li>
            <li> Essential for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this red raspberry oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> – it is not overpowering at all, and is just barely there.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin in the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> This is by far the highest quality oil I have purchased and the only one I&#x27;ve found to actually work.</li>
            <li> Unlike topical creams that smell really bad, this actually smells great.</li>
            <li> But there are so many things that my dermatologist tried to give to me that actually made it worse because of all of the fillers that were put into specific medicines.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend can even usually tell if I haven’t been drinking a gallon of water a day for a while, because it goes right to my chin.</li>
            <li> -inflammatory due to high content of alpha linolenic acid (the highest in any fruit seed oil) and phytosterols therefore helpful for eczema and psoriasis</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, smoother skin with less breakouts!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to get your makeup to blend right after putting the raspberry seed oil on.</li>
            <li> recommend using it for dry patches, acne and a general moisturizer on parts of the face that are prone to wrinkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can relax and it leaves my face feeling so soft and the oil doesn&#x27;t stay all greasy as with other products</li>
            <li> I tried this oil a few months ago and already notice my skin isn&#x27;t as dry and feels so much healthier than before.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was looking for a solution and found this.</li>
            <li> I started seeing minor improvements after about a week of usage and since them everything&#x27;s just improved massively.</li>
            <li> I received this oil to try for my dry skin around my nose that seems to accumulate daily.</li>
            <li> It can be used everyday as it is completely natural...</li>
            <li> love the smell and so much less expensive than my department store products.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the Raspberry smell, but I would prefer it to any other chemically enhanced smell.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It will not only helps with dry skin and other skin issues like psoriasis, but it helps with wrinkles and leaves you glowing.</li>
            <li> The dry patches I used to have at the corner of my mouth have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of nights use I could see the reduction of the dry skin on her face</li>
            <li> She now uses it every night and her face no longer has any signs of dry skin or acne.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> Finally, I really like the subtle smell that this product has</li>
            <li> As a daily applicant, raspberry seed oil makes me look younger by eliminating wrinkles, puffiness, and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry flaky skin on her face and have tired numerous different lotions but the outcome is almost always the same, acne.</li>
            <li> I had tried several things with little to no results.  </li>
            <li> this prevents that from happening and a little goes a long way to hydrate and protect all day long.</li>
            <li> Know that it isn&#x27;t an instant fix and will take a few days to a week or two (depending on the condition of your skin)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> For my body I apply a few drops in my hand and mix it with fractionated coconut oil and put that on my back.</li>
            <li> It’s very painful, and my regular daily moisturizer isn’t really able to alleviate it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive if the product is not suitable and will feel &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; and slight redness almost upon application.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase since I usually use young living</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> My face is much less dry</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> -aging benefits due to content of ellegic acid (an anti oxidant).</li>
            <li> and I woke up and noticed my eczema was less dry and less itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for eight years and conventional treatments have never worked  for me.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended and I borrowed it from a coworker who suffers the same fate as me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sad thing, but it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> Only because you know, your pores are open and again cold enough time to get in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to create a better base for the makeup.</li>
            <li> I have severely cracked and dry skin on my hands from excessive exposure to water.  </li>
            <li> However the contents of the medication is not suitable for long term usage.</li>
            <li> It is 100 times less smelly than carrot seed oil, which for me is unbearable.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so dry over the years and the expensive moisturizers seem to barely keep up with it, not to mention having to continually buy spf products.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure how it works on other ailments but it works for my eczema.</li>
            <li> There is honestly little to none skincare hygiene products that this can not act as a substitute for.</li>
            <li> Especially since I live in Florida, and we have a lot of really really bad rays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deathly afraid of harsh chemicals as my skin turns into bubble wrap after contact with certain oils, rubs and lotions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s existence everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using this oil as part of her everyday skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I mangled my finger in the freezer ice maker and I&#x27;ve been putting it on it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had damaged skin ever since I hit puberty and the acne medicine that doctors prescribe has only made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried prescription face cream but that only seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to know that I am not putting all those horrible chemicals on my baby.</li>
            <li> We are all quite pale in my family and my baby is no exception.</li>
            <li> The cold winter months left my skin so dry and uneven.</li>
            <li> Which is why I have turned to using natural oils, cold pressed oils.</li>
            <li> Using the wrong product will leave my face red, puffy and itchy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not into all of those big name remedies with questionable ingredients, the Raspberry Seed oil should be a suffice</li>
            <li> and I hardly see acne marks on her face.</li>
            <li> The acne and skin cracks are slowly disappearing and</li>
            <li> I get really bad heat rashes, even just thinking about being outside</li>
            <li> I found this product when I was having a really bad rough patch of acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing long sleeves during summer to hide them :(</li>
            <li> I wish I had tired this sooner!</li>
            <li> but I heard that it has an unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil does miracles. Red Rasp. Seed oil has a safe and naturally high SPF so I use it to make my own sunscreen.  I use it at 100% on beach days, and - with frequent applications - it&#x27;s quite effective. It goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin. I have not broken out and believe it truly hypoallergenic. It only takes two drops to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly. It does not look shiny or greasy at all. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I put in on after I wash my face at night. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Makes my face feel good and luxurious!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and want to make sure I get the highest quality and organic products. This is the best and the purest of the red raspberry seed oils I have found. If you have never used raspberry seed as part of your beauty regiment, you should. It helps clear up everything!  I used it for moisture and eczema; someone told me if you use the purest you can find it will clear up acne also. Although, I don’t have much acne I can tell you that my skin is smoother ​and feels so much more moisturized.  The best part about this company is that if you don’t like the product, you can send it back 100% money back! I love that; I always try things from them and don’t worry if I don’t like it, but I ALWAYS love everything.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make my face more appealing and beautiful, and it surpassed my expectations! It makes me look so young! It helps regenerate skin cells and improve the dryness of my skin. It moisturizes my skin and prevents wrinkles and peeling skin. The product is very good quality and the price is amazing! I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin in the past several weeks. I heavily recommend this great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for eight years and conventional treatments have never worked  for me. I decided to try naturopathy and organic oils. The only thing that really worked for me was this red raspberry seed oil! Unlike topical creams that smell really bad, this actually smells great. Plus, its completely organic unlike corticosteroids contained in the topical creams. So I know I am not putting anything unnatural into my body! Also, It helped moisturize and smoothen my skin. My skin looks much better now. It is really a must have for anyone who has dry skin or a condition like mine.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of oil! Its great quality too! I love mixing it into my shampoo and lotions! It makes such a difference! *I received a sample in order to give my unbiased and honest opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> It is suspiciously silky, and so far no irritation on my insanely sensitive skin. My first impression upon smelling the oil was that it was rancid but after further investigation I realized it&#x27;s the natural scent. It is 100 times less smelly than carrot seed oil, which for me is unbearable. The &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma, as they like to call it, dissipates after a short while leaving a sweeter scent. And of course keep any carrier oils in the refrigerator. For what it&#x27;s worth, the expiration on my bottle says 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a theory that some people are more sensitive to the smell of certain seed oils. Some people LIKE the scent of carrot seed oil. To me it is horrifying and lingers for WEEKS. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just more sensitive, like some people are more sensitive to vegetables with oxalate and cilantro, for example. The chemical in that stuff is super amplified for some.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Pure, organic product that I keep handy for all remedy, it&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle. I use it for all skin related treatments, for my entire family.</li>
            <li> What I love about Puressant&#x27;s products is that it always feels great on the skin and you can tell straight away the oil is acting on your skin, whether it is to cure some issues or simply to feel good. It can be used everyday as it is completely natural... Worked great on my back and face.</li>
            <li> I have loved red raspberry seed oil since forever! I have been using it off and on throughout say about 10 years, for my sunscreen. Not regular sunscreen, but it&#x27;s what I use to block out UVA and UVB rays. Since I found out that I have UV damage to my eyes, I realized that I needed to find something that was better than what I was finding in the stores to use as protection. Especially since I live in Florida, and we have a lot of really really bad rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even beyond using it as protection, red raspberry seed oil is amazing for skin issues. If you have psoriasis or eczema, this stuff is amazing. I get really bad heat rashes, even just thinking about being outside will make me hot. But there are so many things that my dermatologist tried to give to me that actually made it worse because of all of the fillers that were put into specific medicines. You know how the pharmaceutical business like you do that... It&#x27;s a sad thing, but it&#x27;s real. Which is why I have turned to using natural oils, cold pressed oils. Red raspberry has been absolutely amazing for me. I really wish that I had some before and after pictures to prove that this stuff is like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fatty acids and host of antioxidants in this particular oil is just amazing. I love the fact that this company does not test on any animals, and that they don&#x27;t use fillers. I would definitely recommend this as a daily regiment, I like to put some on before I go to bed, and I like putting it on as soon as I get out of my shower. Only because you know, your pores are open and again cold enough time to get in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have received this at a discounted rate for an honest review, but I m a strong advocate, and loud advocate for taking care of your skin. Just because I received this at a discounted rate, does not take away from how awesome red raspberry seed oil is!</li>
            <li> This red raspberry seed oil has done wonders for my skin. I used to have extremely dry skin that moisturizer really wouldn&#x27;t fix. I tried this oil a few months ago and already notice my skin isn&#x27;t as dry and feels so much healthier than before. The liquid doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily and sticky, which was a big concern for me at first. And a bonus... it smells really good! My skin finally feels good and I&#x27;m happy with how it looks.. I give almost all the credit to this raspberry organic oil.</li>
            <li> I did a little research to find the most bennificial uses of red rasperry seed oil and found that most sources agree on at least 6 uses&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;6 reasons to use Raspberry seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs UV-B and UV-C so useful as a broad spectrum sunscreen*&lt;br /&gt;Anti-inflammatory due to high content of alpha linolenic acid (the highest in any fruit seed oil) and phytosterols therefore helpful for eczema and psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;Anti-aging benefits due to content of ellegic acid (an anti oxidant). This study show that elegiac acid “reduced the destruction of collagen and inflammatory response, both major causes of wrinkles.” It also protects against ultra violet damage.&lt;br /&gt;Very high in Vitamin E – an antioxidant. Antioxidants in skin care are important to prevent oxidative damage which can lead to premature skin aging and skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;Very high levels of phytosterols that can help reduce trans epidermal water loss thereby helping to keep skin moisturised&lt;br /&gt;Phytosterols also help to repair skin damaged by environmental factors including sun damage&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT smell like raspberry or much of anything else for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
            <li> Now that I am constantly holding my baby 24/7, I noticed that I was starting to develop eczema on my arms. I&#x27;ve been wearing long sleeves during summer to hide them :( Long story short, I was looking for a solution and found this. It came highly recommended and I borrowed it from a coworker who suffers the same fate as me. I put some on before going to bed and I woke up and noticed my eczema was less dry and less itchy. Im not sure how it works on other ailments but it works for my eczema. Oh yea and it smells pretty good too. :)</li>
            <li> I’ve always had incredibly sensitive skin. I’m allergic to a lot of ingredients used in moisturizers and sunscreens, so when I heard about the benefits of raspberry seed oil I had to try it out. My sister had purchased a bottle and let me use some. This product is FANTASTIC, it left my skin feeling hydrated without being oily and smells delightful. The fact that it doubles as a sunscreen makes it all the better because I’m able to serve 2 purposes with 1 product. I will absolutely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> When it comes to things I use for my children, the less non-natural ingredients, the better.  That&#x27;s why when i read about the UV Protection properties of Red Raspberry Seed Oil, I had to try it as soon as possible.  We live right by the Gulf of Mexico, so protecting ourselves from harmful sun rays is always top priority.  On our next trip to the beach, we tried the oil and it worked great!  No sunburn on any of us.  I also noticed that it made my hands feel much softer too. This is a great product and I highly recommend getting some as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li> The cold winter months left my skin so dry and uneven. I have lots of red patches and I heard that red raspberry seed oil can improve the look and feel of your skin. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product, its left my face so smooth and soft. I get the silky moisture without breaking out. And never mind the fact is smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or spotty. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new face lotion and this surpasses anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I also love that its all natural, I hate using too many chemicals or processed lotions, this one is all natural. I can feel proud to use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Ok this is my 4th Puressant product and yes by now even I feel biased towards this brand name. Why shouldn&#x27;t I? The last three products I tried of theirs was great. Raspberry Seed Oil, to be honest I had never thought of Raspberries as a natural cure for skin ailments prior to seeing this. In fact, I love Raspberries but only as a fruit! Now, I love Raspberries, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so how do I use it and for what? Well, I already use Tea Tree Oil from Puressant and now this Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil is my second herbal remedy for acnes and scars. I have a sensitive skin that tends to retain scars from acnes, pimples and even simple injuries. So, my strategy is two fold. Raspberry oil 1 hour prior to bathing and Tea Tree Oil after bathing. I figure that ought to give the two ingredients to work their collective magic and guess what - ever since I started using the Raspberry Seed Oil, I notice scars regenerating gradually. They aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before but it will still take a few more months to completely get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I don&#x27;t need to buy Puressant products from Amazon as my local beautician has them all in stock.</li>
            <li> Five Star Product!&lt;br /&gt;You cannot get better and cheaper red raspberry seed oil online, i promise you!&lt;br /&gt;The qualty is outstanding!</li>
            <li> This oil does miracles! This oil really worked for my acne problem. After use now I feel really good. This oil is simply marvelous at moisturizing my skin. I am very pleased with my purchase. A great oil with great skin moisturizing properties. Will order again. Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Excited to use this in my skin and body mixes. Comes with a control drop lid built in.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was not aware of how many uses red raspberry seed oil has but it has limitless possibilities and this is the best on the market! You can&#x27;t beat 100% pure and organic! It smells great. I do wish the bottle was a bit larger.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for very sensitive skin. This does not make me breakout at all. And it doubles as sun protection! I use it every day in the morning under my mineral makeup. It smells great, and soaks into skin pretty fast. Sometimes it can be hard to get your makeup to blend right after putting the raspberry seed oil on. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I put on my raspberry seed oil first, wait a couple minutes, put some aloe vera gel on, wait a couple minutes, and then put my mineral makeup on. This seems to create a better base for the makeup. But on days when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, I just put on some raspberry seed oil as moisturizer and I&#x27;m out the door. Will definitely be buying again!! I tried jojoba oil before I tried this, and this is way better for me and my acne. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This oil is so great on my sensitive skin! I breakout easily with regular moisturizers and red raspberry seed oil has so many benefits other than being a fantastic moisturizer. I add it to my vita c serum to keep it from drying my skin out as well as for the sun screen benefits. It leaves my skin silky and not oily as you may imagine an oil would. It&#x27;s great for its antioxidant properties and the light scent is perfect for me. The color and consistency of this particular brand tell me it&#x27;s high quality and the fact that it&#x27;s 100% pure and organic is a big plus. I definitely recommend using this in your cosmetics and skin care routine. I received my bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience having used it.</li>
            <li> This 100 % Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed oil is amazing.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about the affect it will have on my skin because it is organic and all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my skin very easily and leaves it feeling soft and non greasy.  I like that this oil is very versatile you can use it practically anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This oil does not have a smell which is great.  I often get headaches that are triggered by certain scents.  I definitely recommend this oil because it has so many great benefits.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it to massage my scalp sometimes and I use it for my skin. It works great as a daily moisturizer or spf. My skin is so sensitive, but I am able to use this after I wash my face and it does not break me out. I would definitely recommend this product to people who have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has done wonders for my skin since I have started using it regularly. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have eczema, but my skin has been patchy and flaky. Since I have started, my skin has become soft and blemish free! Know that it isn&#x27;t an instant fix and will take a few days to a week or two (depending on the condition of your skin) but in the end you will have the best skin you have ever had!</li>
            <li> I have had thyroid issues for many years, and one of the side effects is excessive dry skin.  I am always looking for something that will assist with my skin dryness.  A friend told me that she had stated using organic red raspberry seed oil for the exact same thing.  So I knew I had to give it a try  I have been using for about 2 weeks and my skin is totally different, I can&#x27;t believe the difference in just a short time.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> As a person who&#x27;s had a long history of skin problems, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. Though my acne isn&#x27;t 100% gone, I&#x27;d definitely say its at least 90% better. You really can&#x27;t expect anything more out of a product. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this, and if you struggle with skin problems, even things unrelated to acne, you should still give this a try. It just clears up skin, moisturizes more efficiently than any lotion, and really helps with skin elasticity. It&#x27;s got a lot of good vitamins and antioxidants and even omega-3s that make this product the powerhouse it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen significant results. I started seeing minor improvements after about a week of usage and since them everything&#x27;s just improved massively. I was really surprised, my skin was never irritated by this. I didn&#x27;t no raspberry oil was so healthy that it wouldn&#x27;t even irritate skin at all. Just one more reason to go completely natural. It&#x27;s really just better in every way. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough with anyone struggling with skin problems! And even if you don&#x27;t have problems, it&#x27;s a great natural moisturizer too, so give it a try!</li>
            <li> Thus far the best Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil. It&#x27; consistency and the ability to mix well with me daily moisturizer cream makes this little bottle of joy a must for me. I love the scent, the fact that my dry skin is barely noticeable right now, and to be honest it minimized some of the wrinkles underneath my eyes. Did I mention how soft my skin feels whenever I use it, and it isn&#x27;t just a five minute softness it&#x27;s like all day softness. Just thought I would put my two cents in for this product, since I&#x27;ve been grateful for it&#x27;s existence everyday.</li>
            <li> rather pleasant and surprisingly effective acne and skin treatment. My cousin can seem a little wacky with all the natural remedies, but this product has been highly effective at adding much needed moisture to my face and clearing up the acne and acne scarring. I use about twice a day when I remember. love the smell and so much less expensive than my department store products. Note: little goes a long way. My son spilled some and I thought I would never get it all smoothed in to my skin.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented oil that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it for dry patches, acne and a general moisturizer on parts of the face that are prone to wrinkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on under my eyes and around my mouth at night before bed for maximum benefit. When I wake up my skin feels smooth and moisturized.  The dry patches I used to have at the corner of my mouth have disappeared.  Overall I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I received this oil to try for my dry skin around my nose that seems to accumulate daily. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. I was very pleased with several attributes including the aroma and how well it seemed to give my skin needed moisture without breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard my mother speak of raspberry seed oil and I wish I had listened a little more closely. I am now a believer!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to source for high quality organic essential oils. I purchased the Red Raspberry Seed oil to use to control my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Most products, even the fragrance free options are not as effective as this one. This is by far the highest quality oil I have purchased and the only one I&#x27;ve found to actually work. Her skin is clear and we are both happy about that. I&#x27;ll continue using this oil as part of her everyday skin care regimen. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil feels on my skin! I have been using it for a few weeks now and can really tell a difference in my skin acne. My skin feels softer and less dry. I also love the smell of this essential oil! I&#x27;ve been very impressed with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to keep using it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to clear up acne or eczema using natural ingredients, or just anyone who wants to see smoother, more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using red raspberry seed oil daily for the past few weeks with great results! It does not clog my pores whatsoever and leaves my skin super smooth. It also is very quickly absorbed — I’d say it falls in between a dry oil like rosehip or tamanu and a slightly heavier oil like jojoba, which is perfect since I personally blend the two, and advise others to do the same to get the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> The scent of this red raspberry seed oil isn&#x27;t overpowering but the oil does have a very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oils that smell good are the kinds I like to use as massage oil. This is one of those oils! I use this oil to rub into my temples when I have a headache, and also I ask my husband to rub my back with it as well. The oil softens my skin and relaxes the muscles. I can lightly smell the scent for a few hours after the massage which is very calming to me. The size of the bottle will allow me to use the oil multiple times before it runs out, which I also like very much. This is the perfect oil for massages!

            <li> Having a bright gold to reddish color, red raspberry seed oil is valuable for skin applications. The red rasperry seed oil soothes skin and used for remedies like acne, eczema, and psoriasis, reduces wrinkles. moisturize and improve skin elasticity, dryness, fine lines, regenerating skin cells and anti oxidant.Great qualityred rasperry seed oil. I mangled my finger in the freezer ice maker and I&#x27;ve been putting it on it everyday. It really makes it easier to move on with my finger and feels soothing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Using the wrong product will leave my face red, puffy and itchy. Due to this, I&#x27;m very hesitant to put new things on my face. I hoped since it was pure and organic it would be fine, and luckily it was. It smells wonderful, and it is an equally great moisturizer. My face is much less dry and it&#x27;s the perfect base for my foundation. I recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This oil is such a wonderful moisturizer! I love it! It feels great on my skin and absorbs great! I have sensitive skin and I’m always on the lookout for products that will nourish it. My plan is to include this Red Raspberry Seed Oil as an all-over skin conditioner. It is just so soothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love finding natural solutions (that actually work) for my everyday skincare routine. Finding Puressant’s 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil has definitely made my day and it’s for this reason that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have absurdly sensitive skin and it took going to see a GOOD aesthetician to really find a good strategy for combating breakouts. My boyfriend can even usually tell if I haven’t been drinking a gallon of water a day for a while, because it goes right to my chin. I break out if I step outside the house without mineral sunscreen! I love this oil! It not only helps soothe all the irritation that cause my breakouts, but it’s a great moisturizer, too! I will definitely be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry flaky skin on her face and have tired numerous different lotions but the outcome is almost always the same, acne. A friend of mine told me to try have her put red raspberry seed oil on her face at night after her shower. Within a couple of nights use I could see the reduction of the dry skin on her face and she did not have acne from using it either. She now uses it every night and her face no longer has any signs of dry skin or acne. She loves this product and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I found this product when I was having a really bad rough patch of acne.  I had tried several things with little to no results.  My sister was had the same issue and turned me on to organic red raspberry seed oil.  I started using this product everyday and in a matter of a week my face not only looked better but my skin was glowing!  I am so happy that I found something that truly does work.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Raspberry Seed Oil.  I had no idea it had so many healing properties.  I have ordered products in the pas from Puressant so I knew I could expect a quality product.  The smell was wonderful when applying to my face.  I used the 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil for the sole purpose to reduce wrinkles and soften my skin.  I am happy to say that it worked for both case I could see a suttle difference within only a few weeks of application.  Great product overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had damaged skin ever since I hit puberty and the acne medicine that doctors prescribe has only made it worse. I&#x27;ve tried prescription face cream but that only seemed to make it worse. I finally was recommended to this oil and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s been three weeks and my face has never looked or felt so healthy. The acne and skin cracks are slowly disappearing and I can&#x27;t wait to see more progress.</li>
            <li> Essential for those with sensitive skin. If you&#x27;re not into all of those big name remedies with questionable ingredients, the Raspberry Seed oil should be a suffice substitution.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m deathly afraid of harsh chemicals as my skin turns into bubble wrap after contact with certain oils, rubs and lotions. The Raspberry Seed Oil leaves the skin moisturized and smelling great. Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the Raspberry smell, but I would prefer it to any other chemically enhanced smell.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin so I thought I would give this a try as it seems to be making a huge appearance in the make up industry. First I noticed the smell which is incredible. After applying to my dry skin I was able to apply make up to my face without it looking flaky, dry,  and caked on.So for me this product works great and I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality product! I love the smell which is the same smell you would get from crushing up fresh raspberries. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel after about 30 seconds. I feel it&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well elimination my breakouts and red spots...love!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I purchased it for homemade sunscreen and it was perfect! If you didn&#x27;t already know this oil has an spf of about 30. You can apply it to your face as is for a great moisturizer as well as a good spf. The recipe I used called for this (spf 30), coconut oil (spf 4), Shea butter (spf 4), beezwax (to thicken it). I was a little hesitant to purchase since I usually use young living but the price was soooooo much lower so I figured I&#x27;ll give it a try. So glad I did because I love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice oil.  Purchased for SPF.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our home made sunscreen and it&#x27;s great!  The kids like it so much more than spraying in their face and I love that it&#x27;s natural.  Find a recipe for DIY and make your own!!</li>
            <li> If you have fair and sensitive skin, Red Raspberry Seed Oil is just right.  It is an all-natural oil and organic is a plus for me. I have dry skin in the winter this prevents that from happening and a little goes a long way to hydrate and protect all day long. It will not only helps with dry skin and other skin issues like psoriasis, but it helps with wrinkles and leaves you glowing.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with carrot seed oil for skin issues.  It is great.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> To soft the skin is OK, but my intention was to use it as a sunscreen since Red Raspberry Seed Oil should have a high level of protection. Did not work for that purpose efficiently.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this for my sister who was suffering from acne in her face. She was fed up with chemical based products, but decided to use 100% Pure and Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil since it is made out of all natural ingredients. This oil delivered positive results to my sister from the very first day onward. She has been using this for three weeks now and I hardly see acne marks on her face. This is highly effective and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The raspberry seed oil was shipped quickly and in a container that insures the bottle won&#x27;t leak.  The actual oil smells great and you can&#x27;t beat all the benefits of a pure organic seed oil.  I am excited to try it again!</li>
            <li> This oil is great and moisturizing. I put the oi with lotion . To see if i have to reapply by the end of day. Worked great. I have very sensitive skin this is not irritating.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Red Raspberry Seed Oil so I could make my own sunscreen. We are all quite pale in my family and my baby is no exception. I want to take him outside more but I cam constantly worried that he will burn. This oil has an SPF of 28-50 so it is the perfect addition to my sunscreen recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many homemade sunscreen recipes call for carrot seed oil but I heard that it has an unpleasant smell so I opted for red raspberry oil. It has a light fruity smell. Not only is red raspberry seed oil great for sunscreen it is also great for skin. This left my face more smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most sunscreens contain toxic ingredients or endocrine disrupting chemicals that in many cases may actually promote skin cancer growth and free radical production in the body. In fact, in the years since sunscreen use began, skin cancer rates have actually risen, and a 2007 document from the FDA stated that: “The FDA is not aware of data demonstrating that sunscreen use alone helps prevent skin cancer” many reports show that most sunscreens actually raise skin cancer risk. Once I read all the information out there I decided not to put that junk on my family anymore. Here is the recipe I used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homemade Sunblock – Lotion (20-30 SPF) - Melt together:&lt;br /&gt;2 oz shea butter&lt;br /&gt;2 oz coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;1 oz zinc oxide&lt;br /&gt;1 oz red raspberry seed oil&lt;br /&gt;15 drops lavender oil&lt;br /&gt;10 drops eucalyptus oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so glad I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It&#x27;s so nice to know that I am not putting all those horrible chemicals on my baby.</li>
            <li> I was sent this oil free for review. It arrived fast and was packaged securely. The oil doesnt feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;and rubs in well. It makes my skin feel so soft and it smells amazing. I would recommend this seller and&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for my acne because I have it on my face and back. I have sensitive skin and this red raspberry oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.I apply a could of drops in my hand and mix it in with my moisturizer and put that on my face. I notice the redness and size of my acne is deceasing which is amazing. For my body I apply a few drops in my hand and mix it with fractionated coconut oil and put that on my back. I have seem results for both my face and back. I love that I can mix this raspberry oil in with my SPF and apply that on my skin I have never thought of doing that before. There is only one ingredient which makes it better for your skin rather than having a ton of chemicals on your skin. You don&#x27;t need to use that much of this product so it will last you awhile. I received this red raspberry oil for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I received some of this organic red raspberry seed oil as a gift from a friend. I was a little skeptical, but she insisted that it is a great natural moisturizer. She wasn&#x27;t lying!@ My skin feels so soft since I have started using it. As an added bonus, raspberry seed oil is said to be a great natural sun protectant and my monthly breakouts are almost nonexistent! I wish I had tired this sooner! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, smoother skin with less breakouts!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema whenever I consume certain food. My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably. However the contents of the medication is not suitable for long term usage. I have been on the lookout for a suitable skin care product for my day to day application. When I learnt about Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil under Puressant, I immediately ordered one to try based on the good experience I had with their products so far. The raspberry fragrance is sweet and nice. The oil is soothing on my skin and does not cause any irritation which is important. My skin is very sensitive if the product is not suitable and will feel &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; and slight redness almost upon application. Hence I am quite assured that the Organic Red Raspberry Seed Oil works quite well for me. I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> For me, raspberry seed oil is an absolute miracle worker. There is honestly little to none skincare hygiene products that this can not act as a substitute for. I&#x27;ve used this as a skin toner, moistener, and aftershave. All of these uses are great, and rival the intended products for each use. As a daily applicant, raspberry seed oil makes me look younger by eliminating wrinkles, puffiness, and uneven skin tone. My family and close friends have all noticed a visible difference in my face, and it makes me feel a thousand times younger.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida and are in the sun probably more than we should be.  My skin has become so dry over the years and the expensive moisturizers seem to barely keep up with it, not to mention having to continually buy spf products.  Someone turned us onto red  raspberry seed oil recently and we simply love this one as a daily moisturizer and as a natural spf.  Putting a little bit on each morning keeps my skin smooth and soft, as well as keeps it protected from the sun when we go out.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This Red Rasberry Seed Oil is amazing .. I put it on my face when I get out of the shower so I can relax and it leaves my face feeling so soft and the oil doesn&#x27;t stay all greasy as with other products and I am so sure with more time use you will see softer skin if I already feel the difference. I really must say that this is god sent for those people that love feeling reenergized after a good shower. I  received this product for free to test and try out, to give feedback on the quality. This review is my honest opinion .</li>
            <li> I have severely cracked and dry skin on my hands from excessive exposure to water.  It’s very painful, and my regular daily moisturizer isn’t really able to alleviate it.  This product really helps and also helped right away and gave immediate relief.  My hands feel so much better, and I am much happier!  I read through a lot of these reviews and note that some have used the oil on stretch marks and have had good results so I look forward to trying that as well.  Finally, I really like the subtle smell that this product has – it is not overpowering at all, and is just barely there.  I say try it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  My skin is glowing  and it is definitely working as a sun block.  I am very impressed.</li>
