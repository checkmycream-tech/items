            <li>no quality at all..possibly good for cleaning...</li>
            <li>The quality is ok, the towels are not as puffy as i imagine they will be but it is a good deal because of the price, i will buy them again</li>

            <li>&quot; x 25\\&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge deal except that I bought them for their size.  </li>
            <li>The company handled my return quickly and easily</li>
            <li>very bummed!!</li>
            <li>I will go back to what I used to buy for about a quarter more per towel.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this and says it serves her purposes!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>good enough for general use around the house.</li>
            <li>will likely order more.</li>
            <li>So far the threads are coming right out of the towels.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed and a huge waste of time.</li>
            <li>Ok for general use, but harsh on the skin.</li>

            <li>Bought it for a friend starting out in her new business!  </li>
            <li>The last time I needed to buy towels, I saw these and was excited that they were a little bit cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t the right size I was expecting really didn&#x27;t do the justice that it should have done... Not thrilled</li>
            <li>However, after I received them and tried to use one I noticed that they are not nearly as wide as the ones I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li>they are very very thin, washed them once and they are shedding and falling apart in the first day!!!!  </li>

            <li> After using them in my spa for a little over 6 months I can tell you I will not buy these towels again.  They get dirty easy, and average quality and you cannot bleach out stains at all.  I will go back to what I used to buy for about a quarter more per towel.  Ok for general use, but harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> These towels are not salon quality. They are paper thin &amp; very rough. The company handled my return quickly and easily but I had to pay $17 to ship them back. Very dissapointed and a huge waste of time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these.&lt;br /&gt;A dirty, gray, off white, very thin and after one wash with a splash of bleach these looked like they&#x27;d been used hard for a year. Not at all what I expected and I will definitely not be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> very bummed!! received these towels yesterday in the mail and very disappointed wiith them  they are very very thin, washed them once and they are shedding and falling apart in the first day!!!!  NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish the towels more softer. I know they are economy but they were sold in the facial section. I will have to use them for other things.</li>
            <li> Not salon sized at all this was false advertising</li>
            <li> Towels were too thin and it take several towels to use just for a perm.  I would not re order these towels.  I prefer to go to the store and check them out.</li>
            <li> These should be used as kitchen towels. They are not good for salon, bc the cotton is rough, thin, and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend starting out in her new business!  She absolutely loves this and says it serves her purposes!</li>
            <li> These are awfully rough and a bit smaller than our other salon towels.  Not suitable for use on people except as exfoliators.</li>

            <li> I used these to embroider for golf towels and it worked out great. Loved them.</li>
            <li> En el tema de lasa toallas &amp;ntilde;hay muchas las comentare luego de lavarla varias vieses le tenGo poca calificaci&amp;oacute;n hasta los momentos</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the right size I was expecting really didn&#x27;t do the justice that it should have done... Not thrilled</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the quality when I first received them because they seemed a little thin and rough.  Turns out they work fine.  They are easier to use on the face because they are thinner and and aren&#x27;t so heavy.  They could be a little softer though.  I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have rats and use towels to line the shelves in their cage.  I&#x27;ve been buying 15\\&quot; x 25\\&quot; hand towels from Amazon and they are always the perfect size.  The last time I needed to buy towels, I saw these and was excited that they were a little bit cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve been getting.  They are advertised as being 15\\&quot; x 25\\&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t think twice about ordering them.  However, after I received them and tried to use one I noticed that they are not nearly as wide as the ones I&#x27;ve been getting.  These towels are more like 12\\&quot; x 25\\&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge deal except that I bought them for their size.  They don&#x27;t cover the shelves all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;towelly-ness\\&quot; of the towels is fine, they&#x27;re moderately absorbant and not too scratchy, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the size was misrepresented.</li>
            <li> The towels are too thin..no quality at all..possibly good for cleaning...I tried in my salon.. Not anything I can recommend!</li>
            <li> Not so great quality. I ordered these for my master barber exam and was a little disappointed in how poor the quality was.</li>
            <li> I have been using this towels for one month and they are falling apart. Never would I buy these again.</li>
            <li> The quality is ok, the towels are not as puffy as i imagine they will be but it is a good deal because of the price, i will buy them again</li>
            <li> good enough for general use around the house. not the highest quality, but for the price can&#x27;t beat. will likely order more.</li>
            <li> Some of the towels arrived dirty. No real big deal since you should wash them before use anyway.</li>
            <li> The products arrived timely and we packaged well. However, they fall apart. So far the threads are coming right out of the towels.</li>
