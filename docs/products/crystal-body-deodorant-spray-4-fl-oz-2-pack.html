    <ol>
            <li>Cakes on time and works great!</li>
            <li>One of the best body deodorant!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>If you are reading this just buy this stuff because there is no way to tell you how good it is without sounding like I&#x27;m making stuff up.</li>
            <li>And the price is good, too.</li>
            <li>Nice price, good deodorant without the additives.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Since I am a smoker, I need some kind of body spray, and this one works amazing.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well, spray all over those smelly areas and the smell will be gone.</li>
            <li>I work in the restaurant industry, and we are not allowed to wear any kind of perfume or fragrances.</li>
            <li>Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Ok stuff.</li>
            <li>The roll on works better.</li>
            <li>Great product for those suffering from HS or those with sensitive skin issues</li>
            <li>It is pretty effective.</li>
            <li>Seems ok in a couple of uses Again it would tell more if  I could wait longer to see if i really works.</li>
            <li>Amazing product highly recommend for everyone</li>
            <li>You know, this deodorant is a pretty interesting invention.</li>
            <li>I have had great success with this product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>True to the product&#x27;s claims</li>
            <li>Spray it right on your clothes, or skin, it won&#x27;t leave any kind of white residue like most deodorants.</li>
            <li>It is a more of a natural product and does not contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li>It works for me for about 1/2 a day if I use it in the morning right after shower.</li>
            <li>The original has a particular scent to it.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but after using this for a week I am very happy!</li>
            <li>I like  this spray better than the actual crystal.</li>
            <li>My whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really touch odor, but it also doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or have any chemicals.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this at whole foods</li>
            <li>The only pain is waiting for it to dry after spraying it on, but Wow, it sure does work!</li>
            <li>In my case if I want to make it last longer I first apply a small amount of a regular deodorant and then spray this one on top.</li>
            <li>However when it comes to natural deodorant you cant have the highest expectations as far as its longevity is concerned.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the product, but was disappointed that I only got one when I checked the box to order a two-pack.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other comments that you need to put it on right after you shower.</li>
            <li>Not impressed with the product or with the containers, which do not pump effectively.  </li>

            <li> Not impressed with the product or with the containers, which do not pump effectively.  </li>
            <li> While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak.  </li>
            <li> I actually stopped using them and went back to my old brand of deodorant because I was sick of stinking:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that if you move furniture this won&#x27;t hold up for long.</li>
            <li> This stuff contains simple ingredients, and if you are active mat require using it twice in a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried over ten different deodorants and have had a hard time finding one that actually works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wondering if they water this down.</li>
            <li> I wear an all black uniform.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind.  </li>
            <li> One of the lids was missing.</li>
            <li> For the past year I have been on a hunt for organic/natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have hidradenitis suppurativa which makes wearing normal deodorant impossible for me.</li>
            <li> I do hate the fact that it only last 8 hours tops.</li>

            <li> This is exactly what you are looking for. If you are reading this just buy this stuff because there is no way to tell you how good it is without sounding like I&#x27;m making stuff up. Its a must have for anyone who cares about their health and their smell.</li>
            <li> Meh.  Not impressed with the product or with the containers, which do not pump effectively.  The spray leaves you sticky.  Gross.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is a deodorant so it does not stop wetness but it does prevent you from smelling.  It is a more of a natural product and does not contain aluminum.  It is pretty effective.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this at whole foods and I&#x27;m wondering if they water this down. The original has a particular scent to it. You can smell the minerals though in the one I bought here online it just smells like water.</li>
            <li> Finally a nontoxic, fragrance-free deodorant that actually works.  The only pain is waiting for it to dry after spraying it on, but Wow, it sure does work! Even 24 hours after I use it, I still smell like glorious nothing. And the price is good, too. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak.  Using non-toxic mineral salts it turns your armpits into surfaces on which odor-causing bacteria can&#x27;t grow.  True to the product&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind.  It&#x27;s also not tested on animals and endorsed by Cancer Treatment Centers.  Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Nice price, good deodorant without the additives.</li>
            <li> I have hidradenitis suppurativa which makes wearing normal deodorant impossible for me. I was very happy with the product, but was disappointed that I only got one when I checked the box to order a two-pack.</li>
            <li> Seems ok in a couple of uses Again it would tell more if  I could wait longer to see if i really works.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I work in the restaurant industry, and we are not allowed to wear any kind of perfume or fragrances. Since I am a smoker, I need some kind of body spray, and this one works amazing. This body spray is not an over powering fragrance, where you come back in from a smoke break smelling like a flower scented cigarette. The spray provides an invisible, unscented shield that blocks any unwanted scent from sticking to your skin or clothes. I spray the deodorant on before smoking, and again afterwards. Spray it right on your clothes, or skin, it won&#x27;t leave any kind of white residue like most deodorants. I should know, sine I wear an all black uniform. I always get compliments from co-workers. They say, &amp;#34;how do you never smell like smoke?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ok stuff. Some irritation. The roll on works better.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Cakes on time and works great!</li>
            <li> You know, this deodorant is a pretty interesting invention. When you spray it, it literally feels like you&#x27;re spraying yourself with water -- it has no smell (perfumy or otherwise) nor it&#x27;s sticky. It works for me for about 1/2 a day if I use it in the morning right after shower. I&#x27;m a guy in mid-30&#x27;s and I work in an office, so I don&#x27;t do much of physical activity at work. I&#x27;m assuming that if you move furniture this won&#x27;t hold up for long. In my case if I want to make it last longer I first apply a small amount of a regular deodorant and then spray this one on top. That seems to last longer in my case.</li>
            <li> For the past year I have been on a hunt for organic/natural deodorant. I have tried over ten different deodorants and have had a hard time finding one that actually works. I actually stopped using them and went back to my old brand of deodorant because I was sick of stinking:) I searched again and found Crystal...I was skeptical but after using this for a week I am very happy! It does not stop you from sweating but it definitely keeps you from smelling! I agree with the other comments that you need to put it on right after you shower. I have had great success with this product, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> Great product for those suffering from HS or those with sensitive skin issues</li>
            <li> One of the lids was missing. Otherwise, I´m a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years.  My whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, no aluminum, and I don&#x27;t have to smell like a hippy.  This stuff contains simple ingredients, and if you are active mat require using it twice in a day.</li>
            <li> I like  this spray better than the actual crystal. I do hate the fact that it only last 8 hours tops. However when it comes to natural deodorant you cant have the highest expectations as far as its longevity is concerned.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really touch odor, but it also doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or have any chemicals.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well, spray all over those smelly areas and the smell will be gone. Amazing product highly recommend for everyone</li>
            <li> One of the best body deodorant!</li>
