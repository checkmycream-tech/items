            <li>Very cute on paper...not so cute on nails.</li>
            <li>The sugar skulls r very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Best when covered with a coat of clear polish.</li>
            <li>I was able to slide the decal around a bit before it set to make sure it was positioned correctly.</li>
            <li>Definetly ordering more.</li>
            <li>i get so many comploments</li>
            <li>If you cover with a top coat it helps.</li>
            <li>At the end they look ok, but it took me like 20 minutes to do it.</li>

            <li>If you have the time and patience to apply correctly you will not be disappointed..definitely buying more decals from this company.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you consider the nail polish you&#x27;re putting it on before trying to apply them.</li>
            <li>But I love these, I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>They stick well and stay on pretty good..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute and go on very smooth.</li>
            <li>most of them will fit on fingernails, though.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and look great under a clear coat of polish.</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>Super cute and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They look like cheaply printed paper stickers.</li>
            <li>but you need to use on light colored nail polish.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li>Super easy to work with and look just like they are pictured.</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>user friendly either-</li>
            <li>saving for a special occaision</li>
            <li>Cute for a night out but don&#x27;t expect them to last much more than that.</li>
            <li>Fun transfers for nails.  </li>
            <li>fun decals</li>
            <li>They lasted a whopping 3 hours before smudging and scraping off, even with two clear coats on top.</li>
            <li>Not convenient and not the best size for making them stay down properly.</li>
            <li>but they are LARGE!</li>
            <li>They are cute but you have to have super long nails to wear them.</li>
            <li>First of all, these are not user-friendly.</li>
            <li>I put these skulls on a white nail for most impact/readability of image.</li>
            <li>They are pretty, (also got the owls)</li>
            <li>So the only way to hide it is to cut it super super close to the designs; requiring some time and patience.</li>
            <li>I used a bright white, 2 coats, dried completely, applied the decal, then topped with a gloss top coat.</li>
            <li>product came MUCH earlier than anticipated, so that was a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>Fun decals with clear details.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like them</li>
            <li>just what I was looking for  thanks</li>
            <li>They came out pretty good but only lasted a few days.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re a bit big, some of them, only suitable for thumbnails.  </li>
            <li>These are really cool decals but must be used on white polish.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t last a full week.</li>
            <li>they look decent on .. will purchase again</li>
            <li>Color seems to not be as vibrant once they are</li>
            <li>Just be careful when you put them on, you can&#x27;t slide to fit, you have to be spot on.</li>
            <li>Kind of annoying to put on, but still very cute.</li>
            <li>nice and thick</li>
            <li>sucks graphic wise.</li>
            <li>They are pretty big in size and the lines are a bit blurry.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I only put decals on my ring fingers.</li>
            <li>They were really cute but kinbd of hard to put on</li>
            <li>why the seller&#x27;s storefront says it&#x27;s shipped from the US in 5-10 business days, because it was clearly shipped from overseas and took four weeks.</li>
            <li>complete rip off -</li>
            <li>Big mistake, huge mess.</li>
            <li>Arrived before estimated delivery date and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>the clear plastic is so thick it makes the clear sheet super noticeable.</li>
            <li>You can barely discern any detail in the skulls at all.</li>
            <li>Use a light colored base and a top coat</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even see them on top of the nail even with a light color as your base coat</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t really show up on anything other than white polish.</li>

            <li> You have to cut the tiny little skulls out individually, soak them in water, fish them out of the water with your freshly painted nails, then gingerly try to peel the delicate decal off the paper and stick it on your nail.</li>
            <li> only half of them are decent other half</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you have to cut them down to size, but it&#x27;s not a big ordeal to do.</li>
            <li> So cheap, and awkwardly shaped.</li>
            <li> decals not worth $1</li>
            <li> And I also was not happy how they are printed on a single sheet and you have to cut them out individually...</li>
            <li> Cant see the decal on black nail polish</li>
            <li> This were odd.  </li>
            <li> it was a mess to put them in the nails.</li>
            <li> Also a little blurred and pixelated.</li>
            <li> broken pixel low definition.</li>
            <li> I love decals, and these are the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure</li>
            <li> Sadly, they were not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Shipping was to slow, past expected date and the quality of the decals after transferring them onto nail was horrible.</li>
            <li> The bare so hard to see, and just literally the worst.</li>
            <li> Very complicated to stick them to your nail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate them</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super cute and easy to use. Stayed on for 4 days. They didn&#x27;t crack or peel off, i removed them with nail polish remover. Definitely need to use a lighter color. I used a bright white, 2 coats, dried completely, applied the decal, then topped with a gloss top coat. I was able to slide the decal around a bit before it set to make sure it was positioned correctly. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and look great under a clear coat of polish.</li>
            <li> They look like cheaply printed paper stickers. Also a little blurred and pixelated. I do not suggest these to customers.</li>
            <li> They lift off the nails they didn&#x27;t last 1 day!</li>
            <li> These decals are bada$$. They came in TWO DAYS. Super easy to work with and look just like they are pictured. Use a light colored base and a top coat and you&#x27;re good to go. Definetly ordering more.</li>
            <li> Shipping was to slow, past expected date and the quality of the decals after transferring them onto nail was horrible. I couldn&#x27;t even tell what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!! They&#x27;re super cute and go on very smooth. I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> These are really cool decals but must be used on white polish. If using a darker color, the colors in the decals don&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li> Excited to try these!! Fun! Fun!</li>
            <li> So cheap, and awkwardly shaped. No no no. I love decals, and these are the worst. The bare so hard to see, and just literally the worst.</li>
            <li> Cool! Fun decals with clear details. Best when covered with a coat of clear polish.</li>
            <li> Fun transfers for nails.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet....saving for a special occaision</li>
            <li> i get so many comploments</li>
            <li> The details on the skulls look really good. I gave these to my girlfriend and she loved them</li>
            <li> The decals look blurry and colors are muted! Don&#x27;t let the details and clarity of the photo fool you.</li>
            <li> Bought all three designs. Happy with all.</li>
            <li> fun decals but you need to use on light colored nail polish. Cant see the decal on black nail polish</li>
            <li> They are as pictured and described</li>
            <li> This were odd.  you have to cut them out.  Not convenient and not the best size for making them stay down properly.</li>
            <li> Love! I can&#x27;t wait to wear! Great color!</li>
            <li> The sugar skulls r very easy to use. They stick well and stay on pretty good.. they look decent on .. will purchase again</li>
            <li> Very cute on paper...not so cute on nails. Color seems to not be as vibrant once they are applied.&lt;br /&gt;The product came MUCH earlier than anticipated, so that was a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter, she loves sugar skulls and doing her nails. I hope they work for her! Arrived before estimated delivery date and was exactly what I expected. Would do business again.</li>
            <li> only half of them are decent other half sucks graphic wise. broken pixel low definition.</li>
            <li> They were really cute but kinbd of hard to put on and they didn&#x27;t last a full week.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t really show up on anything other than white polish. Cute for a night out but don&#x27;t expect them to last much more than that.</li>
            <li> The skulls are beautiful, however they don&#x27;t stay on your nails as described.  If you cover with a top coat it helps. However, it&#x27;s difficult to put on a top coat when the decal won&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like them it was a mess to put them in the nails. I thought it was going to be easier. At the end they look ok, but it took me like 20 minutes to do it. Very complicated to stick them to your nail.</li>
            <li> Love the detail on them!</li>
            <li> They are pretty big in size and the lines are a bit blurry. I don&#x27;t hate them but I wouldn&#x27;t but them for $4.35 again.</li>
            <li> What a joke!!!! decals not worth $1 you can&#x27;t even see them on top of the nail even with a light color as your base coat -not user friendly either- complete rip off - NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on your nails. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> these decals are great.  nice and thick so they hold up if you don&#x27;t get them perfectly positioned the first time.  they&#x27;re a bit big, some of them, only suitable for thumbnails.  most of them will fit on fingernails, though.  i have both sets of these and i really love wearing them.</li>
            <li> First of all, these are not user-friendly. They&#x27;re also not peel-and-stick, like I thought they were. You have to cut the tiny little skulls out individually, soak them in water, fish them out of the water with your freshly painted nails, then gingerly try to peel the delicate decal off the paper and stick it on your nail. The first time I tried this, I only put decals on my ring fingers. They came out pretty good but only lasted a few days. The second time I tried them, I put them on all of my nails. Big mistake, huge mess. They lasted a whopping 3 hours before smudging and scraping off, even with two clear coats on top. Second, the quality is low. You can barely discern any detail in the skulls at all. Third, they took FOREVER to show up in my mailbox. Literally a month. I&#x27;m not exactly sure why the seller&#x27;s storefront says it&#x27;s shipped from the US in 5-10 business days, because it was clearly shipped from overseas and took four weeks. Sadly, they were not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> cant wait to use them</li>
            <li> Good quality. If you have the time and patience to apply correctly you will not be disappointed..definitely buying more decals from this company. I put these skulls on a white nail for most impact/readability of image. Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Eh. They are pretty, (also got the owls) but they are LARGE! And I also was not happy how they are printed on a single sheet and you have to cut them out individually... Normally not a big deal to do so, but the clear plastic is so thick it makes the clear sheet super noticeable. So the only way to hide it is to cut it super super close to the designs; requiring some time and patience. Over all, I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have bought these twice now. I don&#x27;t like that you have to cut them down to size, but it&#x27;s not a big ordeal to do. Just make sure you consider the nail polish you&#x27;re putting it on before trying to apply them. Besides that, follow the instructions and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying to put on, but still very cute.</li>
            <li> They are cute but you have to have super long nails to wear them.</li>
            <li> arrived well packed so no worries about breakage.  Nice color and just what I was looking for  thanks</li>
            <li> A gift for a friend.  They really liked it.  She loves this style.</li>
            <li> Loved these. Just be careful when you put them on, you can&#x27;t slide to fit, you have to be spot on. But I love these, I got so many compliments. I did a beige, periwinkle purple, blue, etc. polish with these decals. Looked awesome, lasted a while. Would def repurchase.</li>
