            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this place to buy my pencil</li>
            <li>Purchase more through this person.</li>
            <li>I know people seem to love mac, and i will say that their eye shadows are the best (pigment wise), but i have never liked their eye liners.</li>
            <li>Amazing deal, well worth it.</li>
            <li>I will also layer it with a liquid eyeliner on top, and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner..was not able to buy anymore at stores and was very very happy to be able to purchase here ,,,,</li>
            <li>Could easily be smoked out for a quick and easy smokey eye on the go, since it&#x27;s so creamy!</li>
            <li>goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Sharpens easily.</li>
            <li>Its an easy to sharpen pencil, and its now my go to eyeliner in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I can easily line my lower eyelid without having to apply any pressure.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Application is easy.</li>
            <li>Awesome black however....</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it my eyes are fine.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be a cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I put eye liner on my waterline, and its a problem for me to find an eye liner that with smoothly go on my waterline.</li>
            <li>It even comes off well with my oil free eye make up removal pads.</li>
            <li>creamy feel, doesn&#x27;t smear or melt, and precise application for a pencil.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something on the cheap side, i definitly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t need sharpened after every use.</li>
            <li>Smooth application always.  </li>
            <li>Prestige always goes on really smooth and neat</li>
            <li>Smooth glide.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>Goes on very well, very smooth.</li>
            <li>But because of my super watery eyes, I think my eyeliner is just naturally prone to more smudging than most women.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this in the stores, it was utmost favorite, it stayed on and it was reasonably priced, then they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but can be easily smudged.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality pencil, setting it apart from the many others I have</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it not so smooth and rich like other brands I had before, but for the price it pretty good.</li>
            <li>Really like this eyeliner, it goes on easy</li>
            <li>My favorite so far!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was reasonable, with free shipping (over $25)</li>
            <li>and it really goes on smooth and stays on.  </li>
            <li>Is really intense and has a smooth application.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, blends earlier, stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about it is that it isn&#x27;t overly soft and doesn&#x27;t break off in my sharpener.</li>
            <li>The delivery was as expected, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>I end up using it on my top eyelid when I don&#x27;t want to put a super dark line on top because, again, I know it&#x27;ll fade away and look subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This eyeliner stays put much better then most of the other pencils.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays on for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Great vibrant black.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The liner is exactly as stated in the description.</li>
            <li>The blurriness didn&#x27;t last all day or even more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I researched all around the top ten sites for pencil eyeliner before I found bought this.</li>
            <li>Good black eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, it isn&#x27;t hard like most pencil eyeliners.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the Covergirl Liquidblast pencil I buy from Walmart for $8, which is the cheap knockoff of my Urban Decay 24/7 pencil which costs more than double that.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>eyeliner is super creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; at all like other cheap eyeliners, so it doesn&#x27;t pull on your eyelids at all.</li>
            <li>I ended up changing my whole order just so it&#x27;d be my add on item</li>
            <li>Really creamy too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a product that cost over twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>It is very pointed so have very applying it</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well for me.</li>
            <li>It does, however, go on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li>Glides easily and lasts so long.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is REALLY black and glides on REALLY easy!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re trying to get a thin line, and it&#x27;s easy to keep it sharp.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, soft, smooth, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t end up smudging down during the day.</li>
            <li>Easily smudges,no lasting power and black is way too light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>Having very oily skin and sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>As a long time client of Prestige, I am still loyal to it.  </li>
            <li>I had been on the lookout for a new replacement because i can&#x27;t seem to find Barry M in the US.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dark, doesn&#x27;t run, easy to apply, goes on smoothly and costs hardly anything!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, watery eyes (even flash photos make them go watery), but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>The color is natural and not too dark, it is easy for me to use it</li>
            <li>It has stayed soft without any warming or wetting!</li>
            <li>Really dark, goes on the waterline smooth and stays on for quite a while considering that my skin is oily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually black and goes on smoothly, but I still like my Rimmel London Scandal Eyes</li>
            <li>Its black and smooth.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, and was sealed closed.</li>
            <li>,It&#x27;s soft, smooth and long lasting pencil.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a watery/super sensitive eyes, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>The tip keeps it shape very well and takes several applications before it needs sharpening.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>But soft without being mushy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not so soft that I have to resharpen it every day.</li>
            <li>It goes on soft, so it doesn&#x27;t scratch as it goes on.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as replacement of Lancome eye pencil and like it so far.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sensitive to smudging.</li>
            <li>i even bought highly reccemmonded urban decay eye pencil</li>
            <li>I would like it more when it is less pointy, and that shouldn&#x27;t take long as it is now my daily eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It was a bit sharp when i first used it, but it was because it was sharpened to a point and had not been used before.</li>
            <li>If they would be able to make that small improvement to make it last longer then it would definitely be a 5star rated product.</li>
            <li>Unlike other kohl pencils this one glides on easily and is VERY dark.</li>
            <li>crease it pure black kohl eyeliner</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will also layer it with a liquid eyeliner on top, and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner..was not able to buy anymore at stores and was very very happy to be able to purchase here ,,,,</li>
            <li> Could easily be smoked out for a quick and easy smokey eye on the go, since it&#x27;s so creamy!</li>
            <li> goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Sharpens easily.</li>
            <li> Its an easy to sharpen pencil, and its now my go to eyeliner in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I can easily line my lower eyelid without having to apply any pressure.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Application is easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome black however....</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it my eyes are fine.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be a cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I put eye liner on my waterline, and its a problem for me to find an eye liner that with smoothly go on my waterline.</li>
            <li> It even comes off well with my oil free eye make up removal pads.</li>
            <li> creamy feel, doesn&#x27;t smear or melt, and precise application for a pencil.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something on the cheap side, i definitly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t need sharpened after every use.</li>
            <li> Smooth application always.  </li>
            <li> Prestige always goes on really smooth and neat</li>
            <li> Smooth glide.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!</li>
            <li> Goes on very well, very smooth.</li>
            <li> But because of my super watery eyes, I think my eyeliner is just naturally prone to more smudging than most women.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in the stores, it was utmost favorite, it stayed on and it was reasonably priced, then they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but can be easily smudged.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality pencil, setting it apart from the many others I have</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it not so smooth and rich like other brands I had before, but for the price it pretty good.</li>
            <li> Really like this eyeliner, it goes on easy</li>
            <li> My favorite so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonable, with free shipping (over $25)</li>
            <li> and it really goes on smooth and stays on.  </li>
            <li> Is really intense and has a smooth application.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, blends earlier, stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about it is that it isn&#x27;t overly soft and doesn&#x27;t break off in my sharpener.</li>
            <li> The delivery was as expected, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I end up using it on my top eyelid when I don&#x27;t want to put a super dark line on top because, again, I know it&#x27;ll fade away and look subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This eyeliner stays put much better then most of the other pencils.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stays on for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Great vibrant black.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The liner is exactly as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> The blurriness didn&#x27;t last all day or even more than an hour.</li>
            <li> I researched all around the top ten sites for pencil eyeliner before I found bought this.</li>
            <li> Good black eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it isn&#x27;t hard like most pencil eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the Covergirl Liquidblast pencil I buy from Walmart for $8, which is the cheap knockoff of my Urban Decay 24/7 pencil which costs more than double that.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> eyeliner is super creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; at all like other cheap eyeliners, so it doesn&#x27;t pull on your eyelids at all.</li>
            <li> I ended up changing my whole order just so it&#x27;d be my add on item</li>
            <li> Really creamy too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a product that cost over twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> It is very pointed so have very applying it</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well for me.</li>
            <li> It does, however, go on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li> Glides easily and lasts so long.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is REALLY black and glides on REALLY easy!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re trying to get a thin line, and it&#x27;s easy to keep it sharp.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, soft, smooth, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t end up smudging down during the day.</li>
            <li> Easily smudges,no lasting power and black is way too light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> Having very oily skin and sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> As a long time client of Prestige, I am still loyal to it.  </li>
            <li> I had been on the lookout for a new replacement because i can&#x27;t seem to find Barry M in the US.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super dark, doesn&#x27;t run, easy to apply, goes on smoothly and costs hardly anything!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, watery eyes (even flash photos make them go watery), but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> The color is natural and not too dark, it is easy for me to use it</li>
            <li> It has stayed soft without any warming or wetting!</li>
            <li> Really dark, goes on the waterline smooth and stays on for quite a while considering that my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually black and goes on smoothly, but I still like my Rimmel London Scandal Eyes</li>
            <li> Its black and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, and was sealed closed.</li>
            <li> ,It&#x27;s soft, smooth and long lasting pencil.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a watery/super sensitive eyes, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> The tip keeps it shape very well and takes several applications before it needs sharpening.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> But soft without being mushy.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not so soft that I have to resharpen it every day.</li>
            <li> It goes on soft, so it doesn&#x27;t scratch as it goes on.  </li>
            <li> Bought it as replacement of Lancome eye pencil and like it so far.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sensitive to smudging.</li>
            <li> i even bought highly reccemmonded urban decay eye pencil</li>
            <li> I would like it more when it is less pointy, and that shouldn&#x27;t take long as it is now my daily eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It was a bit sharp when i first used it, but it was because it was sharpened to a point and had not been used before.</li>
            <li> If they would be able to make that small improvement to make it last longer then it would definitely be a 5star rated product.</li>
            <li> Unlike other kohl pencils this one glides on easily and is VERY dark.</li>
            <li> crease it pure black kohl eyeliner</li>
            <li> I usually wear it on my upper waterline without too much smudging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black and soft.</li>
            <li> This Prestige eye pencil I purchased a long time ago on a trip to Curacao.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it in the States until I searched it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I stopped using this eyeliner because I was concerned about the long term</li>
            <li> My eyes are highly sensitive and easily burn, water and itch from bad ingredients and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Would buy again, never going back to other pencils at this price-</li>
            <li> Solid black eyeliner-</li>
            <li> The product came in time and was sealed closed so it wasn&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that sometimes after I put it on, for some reason my vision gets a little blurry like some of the eyeliner on the bottom always gets in my eye after I put it on, which never happens to any other eyeliner I use.</li>
            <li> I will then do the other side, so they match</li>
            <li> you can buy and I am more than 90% you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again due to the running of the liner</li>
            <li> But other than that I would defiantly recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> If i attemp to apply on my water line with any other liner my eyes start pouring and turn bloodshot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pencils but it does not do the job.</li>
            <li> smearproof pencil but at half the cost.</li>
            <li> And then I ordered it again and got black brown when I ordered black.</li>
            <li> Very dark black.</li>
            <li> The black eyeliner color goes on very dark and seems to stay well despite my tendency to smear my makeup.</li>
            <li> it made my vision a little blurry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that down to the NIB!</li>
            <li> I usually have always used an eyeliner called Barry M Khol, in black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will usually pull my eyelid to the side</li>
            <li> (like i&#x27;m using liquid liner)across my eyelids close to the lashes and i usually do the cat eye flick at the side.</li>
            <li> I usually goes with Mabelline when it comes to eyeliner</li>
            <li> Some eyeliners get really messy when you try to sharpen them, but not this one!</li>
            <li> the color is dark, but I find it very hard.</li>
            <li> However it is really hard to take off.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> Silly me because this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> The packaging is awful; it took me a while to peel the plastic off the liner.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great eyeliner.  Goes on nice, blends earlier, stays on all day.  Happy I bought it</li>
            <li> never ends up under eyes!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s actually black and goes on smoothly, but I still like my Rimmel London Scandal Eyes 001black way more... I have somewhat watery eyes and this eyeliner seems to gradually disappear throughout the day. I end up using it on my top eyelid when I don&#x27;t want to put a super dark line on top because, again, I know it&#x27;ll fade away and look subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again, but it&#x27;s not a terrible item.</li>
            <li> good eyeliner does smudge a bit sometimes I look like a racoon at the end of the day..but good product</li>
            <li> When I lived in Seattle yhis was the only eyeliner I&#x27;d ever use. Now im on the east coast I could never find it. My opinion best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Glides easily and lasts so long. I ended up changing my whole order just so it&#x27;d be my add on item</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner for the price, i only have to reapply once towards the end of the day. Really creamy too.</li>
            <li> As a long time client of Prestige, I am still loyal to it.  Blends well and stays on longer with shadows, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but can be easily smudged.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is wonderful. It&#x27;s very smooth to apply and lasts just about all day, even with my oily skin. One of my favorite things about it is that it isn&#x27;t overly soft and doesn&#x27;t break off in my sharpener. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil.  Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Chanel, Nars and Lancome and I would put Prestige upside all of them. I</li>
            <li> Never heard of this brand but this eyeliner works for me</li>
            <li> I usually have always used an eyeliner called Barry M Khol, in black. I&#x27;ve used that down to the NIB! I had been on the lookout for a new replacement because i can&#x27;t seem to find Barry M in the US. So i recently found a review on here that pushed me to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking for an eyeliner, i like ones that don&#x27;t feel like im dragging a pencil across my eyes. That i&#x27;m able to draw a line across my lids and then smudge with my finger. I want it to stay all day and not end up looking like a panda!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this one seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will usually pull my eyelid to the side and i will draw a line (like i&#x27;m using liquid liner)across my eyelids close to the lashes and i usually do the cat eye flick at the side. I will then do the other side, so they match and then i will smudge to give a smokey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went on and it was creamy but not slippery. It was a bit sharp when i first used it, but it was because it was sharpened to a point and had not been used before. It&#x27;s a bit harder than my old khol, but it&#x27;s not llike some i&#x27;ve used. It does not seem to be a cheap quality. I will definitely buy this one again. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now and i also use it on my lower , inner lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers had said that it was MAC quality. I would have to agree and then some. I know people seem to love mac, and i will say that their eye shadows are the best (pigment wise), but i have never liked their eye liners. This is a great find and i will buy from no on!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner pencil ever!  Doesn&#x27;t pull or yank my eye lid when applying!</li>
            <li> Perfect Eyeliner. Great color, easy to apply, easy to remove, lasts all day, no irritation. Will be my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> Just ok- the color is dark, but I find it very hard. It needs to be warmed up before applying.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the Covergirl Liquidblast pencil I buy from Walmart for $8, which is the cheap knockoff of my Urban Decay 24/7 pencil which costs more than double that. It&#x27;s a high quality pencil, setting it apart from the many others I have used- making it easy to sharpen and get a good point. Would buy again, never going back to other pencils at this price- I paid $4. Amazing deal, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome basic, creamy, pencil liner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner is super creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; at all like other cheap eyeliners, so it doesn&#x27;t pull on your eyelids at all. It glides on very smooth. I usually wear it on my upper waterline without too much smudging. I will also layer it with a liquid eyeliner on top, and the results are fabulous. Could easily be smoked out for a quick and easy smokey eye on the go, since it&#x27;s so creamy! I have very sensitive, watery eyes (even flash photos make them go watery), but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. But because of my super watery eyes, I think my eyeliner is just naturally prone to more smudging than most women. If you don&#x27;t have a watery/super sensitive eyes, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in gold or some more metallic colors. I would buy it for sure!</li>
            <li> So happy with this eye liner! The shipping was pretty fast. And the eye liner was great! Exactly what I want. I put eye liner on my waterline, and its a problem for me to find an eye liner that with smoothly go on my waterline. Its black and smooth. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner..was not able to buy anymore at stores and was very very happy to be able to purchase here ,,,,</li>
            <li> goes on easily. very good product.</li>
            <li> Much better than those fake liquid eye liners. I like it you can buy and I am more than 90% you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Very nice eyeliner for a great price. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used! That color was great! No eye irritation and it was perfect when blending. The tip keeps it shape very well and takes several applications before it needs sharpening. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Awesome black however.... it runs very easily. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again due to the running of the liner</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it not so smooth and rich like other brands I had before, but for the price it pretty good.</li>
            <li> Best eye pencil I have tried! It goes on smooth, and I&#x27;m halfway through the pencil and am not even good about keeping the cap on it. It has stayed soft without any warming or wetting! It is easy to use, soft, smooth, and long lasting. It even comes off well with my oil free eye make up removal pads.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> It goes on really nice and sort of looks like a liquid eyeliner on your lids. The only downfall is that sometimes after I put it on, for some reason my vision gets a little blurry like some of the eyeliner on the bottom always gets in my eye after I put it on, which never happens to any other eyeliner I use. But other than that I would defiantly recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This Prestige eye pencil I purchased a long time ago on a trip to Curacao.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it in the States until I searched it on Amazon.  Awesome.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a product that cost over twice as much.  Silly me because this does the trick.  I would like it more when it is less pointy, and that shouldn&#x27;t take long as it is now my daily eyeliner.</li>
            <li> i bought many pencil eyeliners but all of them had a problem of creasing. i even bought highly reccemmonded urban decay eye pencil but it also crease. this is by far the best eye liner i ever had. dosen&#x27;t crease it pure black kohl eyeliner</li>
            <li> Solid black eyeliner- creamy feel, doesn&#x27;t smear or melt, and precise application for a pencil. Sharpens easily. Glides well; doesn&#x27;t snag. Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive eyes. It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonable, with free shipping (over $25) and it really goes on smooth and stays on.  Its an easy to sharpen pencil, and its now my go to eyeliner in the morning.  I would definitely get it again, and recommend it.</li>
            <li> goes on easy and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I usually goes with Mabelline when it comes to eyeliner and though I still like it i decided to try this one. I loved it. Really dark, goes on the waterline smooth and stays on for quite a while considering that my skin is oily. If you&#x27;re looking for something on the cheap side, i definitly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner stays put much better then most of the other pencils. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t need sharpened after every use. I love how it doesn&#x27;t end up smudging down during the day. Having very oily skin and sensitive eyes I can&#x27;t wear most eyeliners on the market. If i attemp to apply on my water line with any other liner my eyes start pouring and turn bloodshot. I will continue buying this brand as it works as good as sorm&amp;egrave; smearproof pencil but at half the cost.</li>
            <li> Unlike other kohl pencils this one glides on easily and is VERY dark. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good black eyeliner! Very dark black. It stays on all day. Does not smudge or run! Great price. It is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t impressed. starting to smug by mid day. Just like a 99 cent eye pencil - I wont buy again</li>
            <li> I used it already. it is good for me. The color is natural and not too dark, it is easy for me to use it</li>
            <li> Love this pencil.  Can no longer find in the stores.  Goes on smoothly and stays on for a decent amount of time.  This is the only place I could find this pencil.  I thought it was a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It stays on all day &amp; doesn&#x27;t smear. However it is really hard to take off. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. But I will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is great.  Does not smudge on me</li>
            <li> Great pencil and not tested on animals! Goox for you Prestige cosmetics! :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner but had to stop using it. The liner is exactly as stated in the description. It&#x27;s black and soft. But soft without being mushy. I can easily line my lower eyelid without having to apply any pressure. But it&#x27;s not so soft that I have to resharpen it every day. The problem I had with this eyeliner is the it made my vision a little blurry. The blurriness didn&#x27;t last all day or even more than an hour. I have always had perfect vision and I stopped using this eyeliner because I was concerned about the long term affects that it would have on my eyes. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it my eyes are fine.</li>
            <li> Easily smudges,no lasting power and black is way too light.</li>
            <li> Really love it! Is really intense and has a smooth application. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! My eyes are highly sensitive and easily burn, water and itch from bad ingredients and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all. The black eyeliner color goes on very dark and seems to stay well despite my tendency to smear my makeup. I wore it all day with no eye irritation. I even forgot to wash it off and still no irritation! I can&#x27;t guarantee it won&#x27;t bother your eyes, but for me it works flawlessly. I will buy this again and its money well paid for.</li>
            <li> I just got this! Amazing color, amazin pen. I totally recommend this</li>
            <li> The best eye linear ever. The product came in time and was sealed closed so it wasn&#x27;t used. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Smooth application always.  Best eyeliner !</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it isn&#x27;t hard like most pencil eyeliners. It goes on soft, so it doesn&#x27;t scratch as it goes on.  It does smudge a bit, but i have never found an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t. It lasts all day and looks as good as liquid liner, just easier to put on.</li>
            <li> The delivery was as expected, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in the stores, it was utmost favorite, it stayed on and it was reasonably priced, then they stopped selling it. I am glad I could find it on here:):):)</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.It is very pointed so have very applying it</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, and was sealed closed. It goes on really nice and sort of looks like a liquid eyeliner on your lids,It&#x27;s soft, smooth and long lasting pencil.</li>
            <li> This is great eyeliner! It does not run or smudge!</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and love this product!!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  Sharpens nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth line. Happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> This might always be my favorite eyeliner.  I recently decided to try a different, more expensive brand, and had to promptly order Prestige as a replacement.  Prestige always goes on really smooth and neat, it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re trying to get a thin line, and it&#x27;s easy to keep it sharp.  Some eyeliners get really messy when you try to sharpen them, but not this one!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed. Ordered it, got an email saying that they were actually out of stock.. And then I ordered it again and got black brown when I ordered black. This product is amazing though! I swear by Prestige eyeliner. It&#x27;s the best! Rite Aid carries it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner, however, I do have to reapply about 1/2 way through my day. The color is great though, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is REALLY black and glides on REALLY easy! I love it. but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well for me. If they would be able to make that small improvement to make it last longer then it would definitely be a 5star rated product. Almost perfect. Still on the hunt for the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Really like this eyeliner, it goes on easy and I like that it stays on all day without form any crease at the outside corner of eyes. Will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s super dark, doesn&#x27;t run, easy to apply, goes on smoothly and costs hardly anything!</li>
            <li> Bought it as replacement of Lancome eye pencil and like it so far.</li>
            <li> The packaging is awful; it took me a while to peel the plastic off the liner. Awful! It does, however, go on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li> Goes on very well, very smooth. Great vibrant black. The reason for 3 stars is that it makes my eyes water for an hour after I put it on!</li>
            <li> Smears unless you brush it in. I have oily eyes so I&#x27;m sensitive to smudging. But it is creamy going on. I researched all around the top ten sites for pencil eyeliner before I found bought this. It also melts in warm climates. I&#x27;m in VA and it&#x27;s summer. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner pencil. I mostly use it for my eyebrows and it&#x27;s so difficult to find. I&#x27;ve tried other pencils but it does not do the job. I&#x27;m glad I found this place to buy my pencil I will def. Purchase more through this person. Really happy!!!</li>
            <li> It works alright.. Although, if you put this in your water line it will not last at all.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far! Smooth glide. Application is easy.</li>
