            <li>I love this handcream.</li>
            <li>But sure as anything, I&#x27;ll get another crack;</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li>I love LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried just about everything in the market and this product is the best and the only one that cured a hand eczema.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion works.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this product for several years now and think it is the best around.</li>
            <li>works well for many things; smells good; reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I would easily rate this product</li>
            <li>This product was greasy and had too strong of a smell for me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited waiting for my order.</li>
            <li>I love to try new products and am always looking for better products so for me to be loyal to one product for 15 years</li>
            <li>Works great on your dry hands!</li>
            <li>This is a thick, rich cream with a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>Can not say enough good about this formulation.  </li>
            <li>opted for the almond not knowing how strong the smell may be (turns out it is very strong!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for feet and has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be reusing the container with my own homemade version in the future.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands really soft, but it has a strong (but not bad) smell that bothers a lot of people, so I can&#x27;t use it in a lot of places.</li>
            <li>First, I do not like the smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and the consistency is like a paste, but it does work for very dry skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was tricky to know which Hand Cream one to buy as my wife isn’t a huge fan of either of the flavours available via Burts Bees – the other option being</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it just for the smell -intensely almond but not perfume</li>
            <li>This has a really creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all I really care about these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s bees product but this hand cream is from far the most greasy cream I have ever tried and</li>
            <li>We use it on our feet and it really helps keep them soft.  </li>
            <li>This was the second Burt&#x27;s product I ever tried (lip balm was the first)</li>
            <li>/&gt;***P.S. If anyone reading knows of a similar product with a milder fragrance please comment below, thanks!</li>
            <li>This is what natural smells like, not</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but since its personal opinion, my wife wishes the hand creams were available in other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so rich and thick that one pot lasts meabout 3 months of daily use so it is affordable.</li>
            <li>It completely cured my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li>I am over fifty years old and have struggled with red dry cracked knuckles and flaky skin on my hands every winter of my life.  </li>

            <li> I am over fifty years old and have struggled with red dry cracked knuckles and flaky skin on my hands every winter of my life.  </li>
            <li> It stays on a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with my feet as they dry out all year long, and I load up on my Omega 3&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Discovered that the &#x27;milk&#x27; they use is non-fat dry milk.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hands dozens of times a day and during the winter, that leads to dry, cracking, and even bleeding skin.  </li>
            <li> lasting - a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It works well on my very dry hands.</li>
            <li> It is extremely oily and takes a long time to absorb, so you can really only put it on when you have at least 30 minutes where you can&#x27;t touch anything.  </li>
            <li> In THREE DAYS my hands were smoother than they have ever been with any other treatment.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it helped my skin anymore than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the fuss over the smell from these other reviews.  </li>
            <li> (I leave fingerprints on my black desk)</li>
            <li> If I were to use any less</li>
            <li> The entire items were damage and the jars are broken I have picture of that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit harsh I know</li>
            <li> It is thick, with a non-greasy, but just slightly waxy consistency that seems to seal moisture into your skin in even the most brutal winter conditions.</li>
            <li> usually apply a lima-bean sized amount to spread on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have not used a Burt&#x27;s Bees Product that I did not love.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves Burt’s Bees lip balm so I bought this for her as a small gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, two different people asked me if I was sick at work when I wore this because they thought I was sucking on a cough drop.  </li>
            <li> if I could stand what is, to my nose, its OVERPOWERINGLY CLOYING ARTIFICIAL ALMOND STENCH.</li>
            <li> but I find it smells bad and is &#x27;chalky&#x27; feeling and greasy as others have reported.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I usually am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s bees product but this hand cream is from far the most greasy cream I have ever tried and the smell just does not do it for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27; t go out without it! Just not convenient to carry in a pocket.</li>
            <li> Can not say enough good about this formulation.  It soothes just about anything on your skin.  Use it on feet as well as on hands.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The best on the market...</li>
            <li> Great list of ingredients, but I find it smells bad and is &#x27;chalky&#x27; feeling and greasy as others have reported. Discovered that the &#x27;milk&#x27; they use is non-fat dry milk. I&#x27;ll be reusing the container with my own homemade version in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was greasy and had too strong of a smell for me.</li>
            <li> I am over fifty years old and have struggled with red dry cracked knuckles and flaky skin on my hands every winter of my life.  Bottles of moisturizer are in every bathroom of my house, including brands recommended by my dermatologist.  Two weeks ago, my wife got me this Burt&#x27;s Bees Almond Milk Hand &amp;#34;Creme&amp;#34;, and I tried it just because I like the smell.  In THREE DAYS my hands were smoother than they have ever been with any other treatment.  The skin flakes are gone, and there are no cracks in the skin over my knuckles.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely dry skin and I work in a medical setting.  I have to wash my hands dozens of times a day and during the winter, that leads to dry, cracking, and even bleeding skin.  I bought some cotton gloves to put on with this cream.  First, I do not like the smell.  I love the smell of almond milk....this smells like a cough drop.  In fact, two different people asked me if I was sick at work when I wore this because they thought I was sucking on a cough drop.  Gross.  It is extremely oily and takes a long time to absorb, so you can really only put it on when you have at least 30 minutes where you can&#x27;t touch anything.  I didn&#x27;t think it helped my skin anymore than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Was a requested gift for friend! She loved it, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> works well for many things; smells good; reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This was the second Burt&#x27;s product I ever tried (lip balm was the first) and I think it is just the best choice in hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d buy it just for the smell -intensely almond but not perfume -y. It is so rich and thick that one pot lasts meabout 3 months of daily use so it is affordable. Any I just love the cute retro graphics on the jars. Bonus points for not using plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love to try new products and am always looking for better products so for me to be loyal to one product for 15 years it has to be great.</li>
            <li> I have issues with my feet as they dry out all year long, and I load up on my Omega 3&#x27;s.  This is a fantastic product for feet and has really helped.  I don&#x27;t understand the fuss over the smell from these other reviews.  This is what natural smells like, not some phony chemicals to get your noses off.  Get over yourselves, peoples!</li>
            <li> I use this hand creme every night.  It is wonderful and my favorite.  My husband will use it occasionally also.  He loves the fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> I love this handcream. My hands crack in the winter and this cream keeps them from cracking. Sometimes I think my hands are doing so good that I stop using the handcream. But sure as anything, I&#x27;ll get another crack; so on goes the cream which keeps it from burning. The ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> This has a really creamy consistency. I use this at night though unless I have time for it to soak in because it can be a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE LOVE the smell of this stuff. It&#x27;s like a sweet/almond/marzipan type smell. I have it on my desk and sometimes I pick it up and smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply a lima-bean sized amount to spread on my hands. I don&#x27;t like how it leaves my hands shiny, and sometimes greasy (I leave fingerprints on my black desk) If I were to use any less I wouldn&#x27;t feel like I was getting anywhere with it. I think I&#x27;m going to move it upstairs and use it after shower/before bed. Despite the greasy/shiny, my hands DO feel softer for using it.</li>
            <li> This product is miraculous.  It completely cured my extremely dry hands. I tried just about everything in the market and this product is the best and the only one that cured a hand eczema.  The smell is very strong and the consistency is like a paste, but it does work for very dry skin! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was so excited waiting for my order. When I received it. The entire items were damage and the jars are broken I have picture of that. I am so pissed !!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hands really soft, but it has a strong (but not bad) smell that bothers a lot of people, so I can&#x27;t use it in a lot of places.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, rich cream with a wonderful scent. It works well on my very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have not used a Burt&#x27;s Bees Product that I did not love.  This creme is doing wonders on my aging arms and hands.  I think the smell is delightful.</li>
            <li> Best pal during the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Great product to help relieve psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion works. It is thick, with a non-greasy, but just slightly waxy consistency that seems to seal moisture into your skin in even the most brutal winter conditions. I would easily rate this product 5-stars if I could stand what is, to my nose, its OVERPOWERINGLY CLOYING ARTIFICIAL ALMOND STENCH. Wow. Headache inducing. Just opening the jar of this stuff feels like being held hostage in a Yankee Candle Christmas sale for two hours. Which is a shame because the product functions so well. I wish Burt&#x27;s Bees made a scentless (or LESS-scented) version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***P.S. If anyone reading knows of a similar product with a milder fragrance please comment below, thanks!***</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about all I really care about these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a daytime cream. Rub it in well before going to bed. It will sink in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About as well as anything does.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Love this for my family!</li>
            <li> Works great on your dry hands!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for several years now and think it is the best around. We use it on our feet and it really helps keep them soft.  It stays on a long time, too.  Really good product.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to massage the greasy feeling into the skin</li>
            <li> My wife loves Burt’s Bees lip balm so I bought this for her as a small gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was tricky to know which Hand Cream one to buy as my wife isn’t a huge fan of either of the flavours available via Burts Bees – the other option being banana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for the almond not knowing how strong the smell may be (turns out it is very strong!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using the hand cream for over a year and it has made a noticeable difference to her hands in the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturising&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting - a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;If you like Almond – the smell is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit harsh I know but since its personal opinion, my wife wishes the hand creams were available in other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a brilliant hand cream if looking for something to soothe winter worn hands.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great.</li>
