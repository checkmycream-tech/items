            <li> I found the iPhone 6 a little too slick on the contoured edges for me to comfortably hold .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this case it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Sleek and still protects.</li>
            <li> Broke a couple weeks after i received it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I would recommend it for a back up. My phone has fell many times and never been damaged. The case just broke and it has not even been 60 days.</li>
            <li> cool bumper for the low price</li>
            <li> Is ok for the price I pay.</li>
            <li> I liked it but it was hard to get on my phone when it came out of the package at first.</li>
            <li> Very nice case although received wrong color. Kept anyway because case is attractive</li>
            <li> Overall the case is nice and looks really nice on the phone and I would give five stars but the case came with a scratch on the back that makes my apple logo look cracked which I don&#x27;t like but I can&#x27;t really do nothing about it but overall the case is nice and is good for someone who wants to show the back of their phone.</li>
            <li> Waited Weeks For It Got It To Be Disappointed Be Because It Wasn&#x27;t Hard It Rubber When It Say Hard! Smh.! It Says Plastic In The Description Box My Two Cases Aren&#x27;t Plastic They Are Ruber.!</li>
            <li> Nice look!! As well as protective</li>
            <li> Of course it looks nice but it was falling apart before I even opened it. I don&#x27;t see why it should and it is very poor quality. Of course you do get what you&#x27;re paying for</li>
            <li> Good case. Protects the phone and still looks good. Is plastic, but the color part around the edges is rubber so your phone can fit in it. It is hard to push the volume/power buttons though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good case for the price</li>
            <li> The black part around the case is glued together, so the second I put it in my phone it fell apart!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but definitely not the best. It gives your phone a sleek and aesthetically pleasing appearance. This item did take a very long time to ship and it is not of the best quality.</li>
            <li> Loved the case. Great for the price. But came apart rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this case! Hard plastic and I got the black which made the front of my phone all black since I have the grey iphone</li>
            <li> Not very good case, fell apart in 2 days</li>
            <li> Super cute and durable</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Buy this its such a great investment. I get a lot of compliments also it makes your phone feel thin.</li>
            <li> bumper feel off two days after getting game it.</li>
            <li> Worst case I have ever purchased on Amazon I know it was only 4.00 but waste of money. It took a month to receive and when I got it it was a thin piece of plastic I ended up throwing it away a couple days later so I would just save your money and not waste time on buying it</li>
            <li> Not what I thought It was gonna be. Case looks like it was put together real quick! If I could get my money back I would</li>
            <li> awesome product for the price, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a basic cover.</li>
            <li> This case is amazing, I&#x27;ve dropped my I phone 6 millions of times and never has my phone cracked!! Will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> Nice case but the black part ruins easily .</li>
            <li> I do not like this case. It broke the second day i had it. It&#x27;s s bad quality and I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Doinshop TPU case is ultra thin and seems rugged enough for most situations. I needed a case that would increase the durability of my iPhone 6 but let the color (gold) show through. I found the iPhone 6 a little too slick on the contoured edges for me to comfortably hold . The TPU edge provides just the right amount of tackiness to give a secure hold and a nice accent to the appearance.  Folks who know to the iPhone 6 are impressed that I have a case on mine because it doesn&#x27;t look like it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well and IS thin! The buttons on the side make it easier to use the phone.</li>
            <li> I love it. excellent price, fast ship and fashion accessory.</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but I love it thanks !</li>
            <li> No protection for your phone but it makes it look nice.</li>
            <li> No I did not like it because it was all strached up in the back. It was pretty strached up. I was not very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t beat the price, plus it&#x27;s a great case, it fits nice &amp; has a slim look, I really like the see thru look for my gold iPhone 6!!</li>
            <li> The case lasted about a week and a half when i started to notice that the rubber on the case had started to peele off. A week later all of the rubber had come off resulting in it being thrown away seeing as i had no use using a case that would not do what it was built to do.</li>
            <li> I love this case it fits my phone perfectly!!</li>
