            <li>this and strivectin is beyond amazing!</li>
            <li>And also strivectin eye cream is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best retinol product I have tried the best value as well!!!  </li>
            <li>I found this being sold by Payless Beauty for a good price, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li>The price was certainly good but the product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>probably buy again, but I believe that it may good to switch products sometimes</li>
            <li>I continue to get compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this, and it has a great price too.</li>
            <li>Skin never looked better!</li>
            <li>and I love that it is not oily!</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of this going on!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I tried this in the Customer Choice kit and liked it.</li>
            <li>The texture is very silky and is the perfect addition to my skincare routine for anti aging.</li>
            <li>I liked it, it is great, it is right for me</li>
            <li>Great Retinol product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I feel like there is more of a glow.  </li>
            <li>Skin wrinkles have diminished and skin looks better</li>
            <li>Does what it says and does not irritate like many retinoids</li>
            <li>Too many retinol products have added creams or oils which clog pores and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I just love this product, I have never purchased it here</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize and use a sunscreen always.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to give it more time</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most interesting thing about this product is the consistency.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a water based moisturizer on top of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>The product  felt like water on my skin and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Love this product it goes on silky smooth .</li>
            <li>but i think its not too strong and its great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Retinol stimulates cell production of your skin, so skin layers are pushed more quickly to the top, helping to prevent acne.</li>
            <li>Easily congested &amp; all that goodness.</li>
            <li>Easy ordering from website.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using a good moisturizer and sunscreen with this</li>
            <li>Did nothing to improve fine lines.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to combat fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall she is very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li>These bumps then became sore like huge pimples.  </li>
            <li>This product is oily and light, like a serum.</li>
            <li>This has serum helps to smooth my skin</li>
            <li>My face feels  smooth and silky all day after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  </li>
            <li>Best thing, though, is that it&#x27;s one of the few retinol products I&#x27;ve found that appears to not be tested on animals, so I recommend it for that reason, too.</li>
            <li>I smooth this on under my nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li>This is the highest non-prescription retinol available.</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and have had my fair share of sun damage.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of months now and its made a remarkable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Far better than most comparable retinol products.</li>
            <li>When I use this product, it keep my easily irritated skin calm and soothed, prevents breakouts, and decreases the life of those that make to the surface.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy finding a good, effective retinol.</li>
            <li>I love PTR&#x27;s products but haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.</li>
            <li>,Unfortunately i liked how my old skin looked</li>
            <li>Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff works - people have actually commented that my skin looks &#x27;better.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Some nights I add a light facial moisturizing oil (Josie Maran Light Argan oil or Clarins Lotus Face Treatment oil), and some nights the retinol is it!</li>
            <li>It feels good Very moist I will buy next</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw myself one day in the mirror at the mall with a fair, clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Lovely, light dry oil consistency that soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes my face smooth yet eliminate fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old and have fine lines around my eyes and hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li>First off, do not buy this from Payless Beauty.</li>
            <li>Tried it first as a sample.  </li>
            <li>Well the first thing I noticed was that it did even out my skin tone and minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li>and this makes my face feel soft and fresh and renewed!</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you are normal skin &amp; looking for an intense product - this is NOT it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Been using it for 3 months and this is one of the first products I seen with fast results</li>
            <li>Thanks, Peter, for a retinol that works quickly, gently and dramatically!</li>
            <li>so the skin doesn&#x27;t get used to one particular type (this is purely my theory, no science involved, and nothing touted by any company!)</li>
            <li>I have applied this product 3 times since receiving and after each application I have woken up in the morning with large, itchy bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>My 60 odd year old skin has never looked this good</li>
            <li>I gave it 4stars because I was hoping it would get rid of my tiny fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I can see that this stuff is really working.</li>
            <li>I transfer an ounce at a time into a smaller sample-size dropper (3.5ml) so as not to expose the whole bottle to too much air and light.</li>
            <li>This really does everything you could want.</li>
            <li>I have used the whole line of Peter Thomas Roth products including pads.</li>
            <li>It is very watery, so</li>
            <li>Really am upset because there was not a seal on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I really like it though .</li>
            <li>once well shaken, you can start to feel the serum-like liquid, but it&#x27;s still very viscous.  </li>
            <li>and it really has improved the elasticity of my skin.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely swears by this stuff.  </li>
            <li>more so then other products</li>
            <li>PTRoth seems to be on the cutting edge of skin technology and for a more reasonable price than many!</li>
            <li>It seems to make my skin glow more (not in the oily way), and lighten my dark spots and minimize my acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have only had a mild problem with redness</li>
            <li>I really can tell a difference, my face was scared from acme as a you adult and this product seems to have help smoothed my skin.</li>
            <li>Really worked to clear up my complexion, smooth away wrinkles and rough spots.</li>
            <li>will write another review after a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Firm and wrinkle free YES!</li>
            <li>I have found natural alternatives that give much better results for both the wrinkles and the dark</li>
            <li>I find it too caustic for fair skin.</li>
            <li>For very sensitive skin I would not recommend this line.</li>
            <li>the years my acne scars have cleared, I break out less, and it has mitigated the fine lines that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not leave any residue, oiliness, or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>If mild irritation or redness occur, use every other night until skin adjusts.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 months  and it completely changed the texture on my skin and feel of my skin</li>
            <li>made my skin soft as a baby</li>
            <li>, yes it made my skin firmer, soft, etc</li>
            <li>and I am 57 years old.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>You need to shake it very well or what you&#x27;ll get out of the dropper will feel like only water.  </li>
            <li>This products makes your skin so soft and even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other retinol and my skin is fair and needs &amp;#34;tender loving care&amp;#34; or it will rebel and be very unhappy.</li>
            <li>I have lovely northern european pale, large-pored skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the eye dropper lets you apply a small amount to your skin</li>
            <li>No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and</li>
            <li>It will drip right down your face if you drop it directly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not noted any redness with usual first application of retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;Price reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Put some right on your blackheads, and it will actually clear up your blackheads with a little bit of time.</li>
            <li>Hope this keeps working as these lines are about the only sign of aging thus far!</li>
            <li>It just gives this clear glowing look the next day.</li>
            <li>but it has already been 6 months and so far nothing different feeling/looking.</li>
            <li>so i stop using it and trying to get my old skin back</li>
            <li>I use it every night, now, without redness or any apparent problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>I have to be very careful not to spill out too much into my hand from the dropper.  </li>
            <li>This is a very thin, clear serum-which is very different from most retinols.</li>
            <li>As part of my overall skincare routine, I have found this helps keep my skin clear, hydrated, and minimally wrinkled.</li>

            <li> It absorbs very quickly and does not leave any residue, oiliness, or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> If mild irritation or redness occur, use every other night until skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months  and it completely changed the texture on my skin and feel of my skin</li>
            <li> made my skin soft as a baby</li>
            <li> , yes it made my skin firmer, soft, etc</li>
            <li> and I am 57 years old.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> You need to shake it very well or what you&#x27;ll get out of the dropper will feel like only water.  </li>
            <li> This products makes your skin so soft and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other retinol and my skin is fair and needs &amp;#34;tender loving care&amp;#34; or it will rebel and be very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have lovely northern european pale, large-pored skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the eye dropper lets you apply a small amount to your skin</li>
            <li> No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and</li>
            <li> It will drip right down your face if you drop it directly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not noted any redness with usual first application of retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;Price reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Put some right on your blackheads, and it will actually clear up your blackheads with a little bit of time.</li>
            <li> Hope this keeps working as these lines are about the only sign of aging thus far!</li>
            <li> It just gives this clear glowing look the next day.</li>
            <li> but it has already been 6 months and so far nothing different feeling/looking.</li>
            <li> so i stop using it and trying to get my old skin back</li>
            <li> I use it every night, now, without redness or any apparent problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful not to spill out too much into my hand from the dropper.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thin, clear serum-which is very different from most retinols.</li>
            <li> As part of my overall skincare routine, I have found this helps keep my skin clear, hydrated, and minimally wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I also think those marionette lines are less obvious if not almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> The product is very watery  and hard to use, it falls of your hand , I eventually got the hand of it</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as it takes for my desired results.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months (2 bottles) and never saw any improvement in my mature skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is very liquid - not like a gel or thick solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried prescription retinols and other brands as well, but always come back to PTR Retinol Fusion.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Also, my skin began to dry out, especially under my eyes to the point that I could not wear concealer on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> If it works as well for you, you should notice smoother, calmed down skin by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> so I am careful not to use products that are oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I started changing a few of my routines all at about the same time, but when I ran out of this stuff I noticed my skin reverting to wrinkles</li>
            <li> Absolutely no redness or flaking with this product.</li>
            <li> My over 40 acne prone skin is noticeably clearer and smoother after using this only a few times.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little oily and there is absolutely no irritation, not sure if that is good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Retinol products before, with redness &amp; flaking and with no positive results.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin and-unlike other skin care</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s a fairly-priced blend of retinol at 1.5% and vitamin C and other proven antioxidants.</li>
            <li> I am also having to do damage control due to the breakout.</li>
            <li> other wrinkles also have been diminished.  </li>
            <li> The other items in the package appeared to have been used or damaged, so I did not trust the integrity of the wrapper on this bottle and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that it is a serum and does not have other additives that can be counter productive.</li>
            <li> She said it not only made her skin look and feel smoother by eliminating small wrinkles</li>
            <li> Of all the different skin creams, oils, and washes on the market, this is one of the very few I would vouch for.</li>
            <li> I would have expected a little irritation with a 1.5% retinol product.</li>
            <li> After placing a few drops in my hand, I noticed it had a different feel and look than usual, so I promptly returned this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m looking at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing to improve my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I may have to wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and saw an improvement in skin resurfacing.</li>
            <li> There was no stinging/burning sensation..what a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> semi-pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne prone, a few lines</li>
            <li> I immediately began using it every night, and I noticed very little improvement.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this yet.</li>
            <li> Wondering if it is the &amp;#34;Real Deal!!&amp;#34;  Usually this product has a seal when bought at a beauty store.  </li>
            <li> If my skin looks dull</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I hated the dropper application but was swayed by the results I saw- smoother, clearer, brighter skin.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m thinking now that I&#x27;m up north in the dry cold</li>
            <li> I hated to see in the mirror to a much smoother complexion.  </li>
            <li> My face felt thin out out.</li>
            <li> On occasion, I have a bad reaction to this product and my skin gets a little read and flakey.</li>
            <li> , this product in conjunction with the Peter Thomas Roth Laser-free Resurfacing eye serum AND the Laser-free Regenerator moisturizing gel-cream have totally transformed my skin from horrible lines and wrinkles  </li>
            <li> but when i looked in the mirror idk, i just looked weird</li>
            <li> if you buy this product buy it from a authorized seller, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re probably getting a fake product.</li>
            <li> to so i can&#x27;t say anything bad about it</li>
            <li> If you are frustrated by your skin and prone to sensitivity or aging-acne, please try it out.</li>
            <li> Those 3 products have people complimenting me on my skin like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is the WORST skin care product I have ever used</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has lightened my brown spots, but I have some stubborn ones that I guess will take longer to lighten.  I will continue to use this as long as it takes for my desired results.</li>
            <li> This product is oily and light, like a serum. I do not see a noticeable difference in my appearance and I probably will not buy this again. I am going to go to Sephora and sample the product and compare it to the one I brought online to see if there is a difference in product.</li>
            <li> I love PTR&#x27;s products but haven&#x27;t seen much of a change. I may have to wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a month and I feel like it is helping the overall appearance of my skin.  I&#x27;m 41 years old and have fine lines around my eyes and hormonal breakouts.  This has serum helps to smooth my skin and I feel like there is more of a glow.  I would definitely continue using this.</li>
            <li> Skin wrinkles have diminished and skin looks better</li>
            <li> Will it be without this. It is wonderful. Skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best retinol product I have tried the best value as well!!!  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Does what it says and does not irritate like many retinoids</li>
            <li> Love this product it goes on silky smooth . I have only had a mild problem with redness but I have  already been using another Retinol product. My face feels  smooth and silky all day after use.&lt;br /&gt;I will write another review after a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I hated the dropper application but was swayed by the results I saw- smoother, clearer, brighter skin. I have oily, acne-prone skin and-unlike other skin care products- I can see that this stuff is really working. I transfer an ounce at a time into a smaller sample-size dropper (3.5ml) so as not to expose the whole bottle to too much air and light. I also like that it&#x27;s a fairly-priced blend of retinol at 1.5% and vitamin C and other proven antioxidants. Far better than most comparable retinol products.</li>
            <li> Great for retinol application to the face/skin.</li>
            <li> First off, do not buy this from Payless Beauty. I found this being sold by Payless Beauty for a good price, so I gave it a go. Upon arrival, the box was opened and the bottle was unsealed. After placing a few drops in my hand, I noticed it had a different feel and look than usual, so I promptly returned this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I buy this from Sephora but if you can find it for cheaper and sealed, I would recommend buying it that way as Sephora&#x27;s prices are steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over a year and not only has it smoothed out my skin, it has made my complexion visibly brighter and cleared away my acne and blackheads. This really does everything you could want. It absorbs very quickly and does not leave any residue, oiliness, or heavy feeling. I have oily skin so I am careful not to use products that are oily or greasy. Just apply this after washing your face at night, and it absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not necessarily get rid of acne you already have, but with regular use, you won&#x27;t have acne reappearing. Retinol stimulates cell production of your skin, so skin layers are pushed more quickly to the top, helping to prevent acne. It also helps with blackheads. Put some right on your blackheads, and it will actually clear up your blackheads with a little bit of time. It&#x27;s not easy finding a good, effective retinol. Too many retinol products have added creams or oils which clog pores and cause breakouts. I have nothing but great things to say about this. Of all the different skin creams, oils, and washes on the market, this is one of the very few I would vouch for.</li>
            <li> This product just continues to amaze me. I have a job in the skincare industry (not with PTR) and cannot abandon this item. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is acne-prone &amp; combination + aging. I have lovely northern european pale, large-pored skin. Easily congested &amp; all that goodness. When I use this product, it keep my easily irritated skin calm and soothed, prevents breakouts, and decreases the life of those that make to the surface. I&#x27;ve tried prescription retinols and other brands as well, but always come back to PTR Retinol Fusion. Lovely, light dry oil consistency that soaks in quickly. Some nights I add a light facial moisturizing oil (Josie Maran Light Argan oil or Clarins Lotus Face Treatment oil), and some nights the retinol is it! If it works as well for you, you should notice smoother, calmed down skin by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night after cleansing. If you are frustrated by your skin and prone to sensitivity or aging-acne, please try it out. Great deal on Amazon, as well. Oh, and if you are normal skin &amp; looking for an intense product - this is NOT it!! Trust me!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing to improve fine lines. My forehead lines got deeper while using this. I am also having to do damage control due to the breakout. I have been using retinol products for years. This one is not worth the money. Using up the remainder on my hands.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot!!  I&#x27;ve been using PTR products a year and I love that it is not oily!</li>
            <li> I have used the whole line of Peter Thomas Roth products including pads. I find it too caustic for fair skin.I cut the number of applications  to twice a week but then got no results. For very sensitive skin I would not recommend this line.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, I have never purchased it here but at nordstroms and it is amazing. If my skin looks dull I just once it and I can almost the very next day see a difference in my skin. I will not go without this product. It just gives this clear glowing look the next day. Make sure you moisturize and use a sunscreen always.</li>
            <li> The price was certainly good but the product did nothing for me. Perhaps I need to give it more time but it has already been 6 months and so far nothing different feeling/looking.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I really can tell a difference, my face was scared from acme as a you adult and this product seems to have help smoothed my skin.</li>
            <li> Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  And I&#x27;m thinking now that I&#x27;m up north in the dry cold I&#x27;m paying double fold for the follies of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this product in conjunction with the Peter Thomas Roth Laser-free Resurfacing eye serum AND the Laser-free Regenerator moisturizing gel-cream have totally transformed my skin from horrible lines and wrinkles  I hated to see in the mirror to a much smoother complexion.  Each morning as I now see myself in the mirror I am totally amazed and ever so thankful that I&#x27;ve come across this product that has made the world of difference to my face.  I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and I think I&#x27;m looking at least 10 years younger.  No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and other wrinkles also have been diminished.  I also think those marionette lines are less obvious if not almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27; and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  And thank you, Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> I liked it, it is great, it is right for me It feels good Very moist I will buy next</li>
            <li> Used it on my arms and so a noticeable difference in the smoothness of my arms. I am continuing to use it to try and get rid of some age spots. I do notice some fading of them.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months  and it completely changed the texture on my skin and feel of my skin made my skin soft as a baby,Unfortunately i liked how my old skin looked so i stop using it and trying to get my old skin back, yes it made my skin firmer, soft, etc but when i looked in the mirror idk, i just looked weird so i stop using it. My face felt thin out out. it did what retinol is supposed to so i can&#x27;t say anything bad about it maybe it just  wasen&#x27;t for me.  The product is very watery  and hard to use, it falls of your hand , I eventually got the hand of it eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you buy this product buy it from a authorized seller, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re probably getting a fake product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this yet. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see a difference. It feels a little oily and there is absolutely no irritation, not sure if that is good or bad. I would have expected a little irritation with a 1.5% retinol product.</li>
            <li> this is my holy grail retinol product. this and strivectin is beyond amazing! the strivectin creates collagen and firms up the skin and thickens it so it wont wrinkle  up. this stuff helps to create collagen to also tighten up skin to prevent and correct wrinkles. And also strivectin eye cream is truly amazing! Those 3 products have people complimenting me on my skin like crazy! Firm and wrinkle free YES!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to combat fine lines and wrinkles. I immediately began using it every night, and I noticed very little improvement. Also, my skin began to dry out, especially under my eyes to the point that I could not wear concealer on my dark circles. It did nothing to improve my dark circles. I noticed some improvement in the wrinkles, but not enough to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not have parabens in it; that is why I initially purchased it. I have since decided to switch to an all-natural beauty and anti-aging routine, and this unfinished bottle is still sitting on the shelf. I have found natural alternatives that give much better results for both the wrinkles and the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff works - people have actually commented that my skin looks &#x27;better.&#x27; I started changing a few of my routines all at about the same time, but when I ran out of this stuff I noticed my skin reverting to wrinkles so I think it&#x27;s making some difference. Best thing, though, is that it&#x27;s one of the few retinol products I&#x27;ve found that appears to not be tested on animals, so I recommend it for that reason, too.</li>
            <li> I have applied this product 3 times since receiving and after each application I have woken up in the morning with large, itchy bumps on my face.  These bumps then became sore like huge pimples.  This is the WORST skin care product I have ever used and I am 57 years old.</li>
            <li> I smooth this on under my nighttime moisturizer.  It is very watery, so I have to be very careful not to spill out too much into my hand from the dropper.  I like the product well enough, but it definitely does not act like a retinol product, in terms of exfoliating or brightening my skin.  I do like the moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> Really am upset because there was not a seal on the bottle.  Wondering if it is the &amp;#34;Real Deal!!&amp;#34;  Usually this product has a seal when bought at a beauty store.  Buyer BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> Tried it first as a sample.  Non-greasy. Moisturizes your skin. Does not irritate sensitive areas. I have not noted any redness with usual first application of retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;Price reasonable.  Easy ordering from website.  Arrived in 2 days.  Applicator allows for varying amounts.</li>
            <li> Have been a user for about two weeks and I swear I can see a difference in lines around the mouth! PTRoth seems to be on the cutting edge of skin technology and for a more reasonable price than many! Hope this keeps working as these lines are about the only sign of aging thus far!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Buy over and over!!!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every night. As part of my overall skincare routine, I have found this helps keep my skin clear, hydrated, and minimally wrinkled.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel of this going on!</li>
            <li> Love it.  The only thing that makes my face smooth yet eliminate fine lines.</li>
            <li> The other items in the package appeared to have been used or damaged, so I did not trust the integrity of the wrapper on this bottle and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Well the first thing I noticed was that it did even out my skin tone and minimizes my pores. It definitely is doing something. Although it doesn&#x27;t get rid of acne and I don&#x27;t think it causes it either. I really like it though . I&#x27;ve Been using it for 3 months and this is one of the first products I seen with fast results more so then other products and I&#x27;ve use a lot of different oils. I gave it 4stars because I was hoping it would get rid of my tiny fine lines under my eyes. It definitely does help soften them but i think its not too strong and its great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the Customer Choice kit and liked it. I&#x27;ve tried other Retinol products before, with redness &amp; flaking and with no positive results. I used this for a few weeks and saw an improvement in skin resurfacing. Absolutely no redness or flaking with this product. My results continue to improve with daily use. My 60 odd year old skin has never looked this good and I&#x27;m so pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Fusion PM is formulated to achieve the optimal benefits of microencapsulated retinol along with vitamins C and E to moisturize and fight free-radical attack. I shake the bottle well. Apply nightly to my cleansed face. Use SPF protection during the day. If mild irritation or redness occur, use every other night until skin adjusts. Gradually build to nightly use. I use it every night, now, without redness or any apparent problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 01-14</li>
            <li> The serum is very liquid - not like a gel or thick solution.  You need to shake it very well or what you&#x27;ll get out of the dropper will feel like only water.  once well shaken, you can start to feel the serum-like liquid, but it&#x27;s still very viscous.  It will drip right down your face if you drop it directly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do not feel any physical effect - no burning, sensitivity, or redness; but I do feel like it works.  It seems to make my skin glow more (not in the oily way), and lighten my dark spots and minimize my acne scars.  I was surprised when I saw myself one day in the mirror at the mall with a fair, clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will probably buy again, but I believe that it may good to switch products sometimes so the skin doesn&#x27;t get used to one particular type (this is purely my theory, no science involved, and nothing touted by any company!), so may try something else before I buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before and stand by my opinion that this is a great serum.  I continue to get compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This product has literally changed my skin!  My over 40 acne prone skin is noticeably clearer and smoother after using this only a few times.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of months now and its made a remarkable difference in my skin.  I don&#x27;t think I could be without this product now!</li>
            <li> Used this product for months and saw no improvement in my skin at all.  There was no stinging/burning sensation..what a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have had my fair share of sun damage. I have dry skin and this makes my face feel soft and fresh and renewed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other retinol and my skin is fair and needs &amp;#34;tender loving care&amp;#34; or it will rebel and be very unhappy. Thanks, Peter, for a retinol that works quickly, gently and dramatically!</li>
            <li> I have used and reviewed Peter Thomas Roth Retinal Fusion for years. This is the highest non-prescription retinol available. Please note, this is not for individuals that have not used retinol before. If you do decide to start with the product-please do a patch test, use sparling and only about once a week initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting thing about this product is the consistency. This is a very thin, clear serum-which is very different from most retinols. I suggest using a water based moisturizer on top of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my acne scars have cleared, I break out less, and it has mitigated the fine lines that were beginning to form. On occasion, I have a bad reaction to this product and my skin gets a little read and flakey. I highly recommend using a good moisturizer and sunscreen with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: 20-something, semi-pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne prone, a few lines</li>
            <li> Really worked to clear up my complexion, smooth away wrinkles and rough spots. Glad I found this, and it has a great price too.</li>
            <li> There is no seal if you buy from Beauty Innovation.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months (2 bottles) and never saw any improvement in my mature skin. The product  felt like water on my skin and nothing more.  I will definitely not purchase  again.</li>
            <li> This product was not sealed. Makes me suspicious. I have bought at regular retailers prior and the bottle was always sealed.</li>
            <li> This products makes your skin so soft and even. It&#x27;s even helped with my breakouts and darks spots from post acne. The texture is very silky and is the perfect addition to my skincare routine for anti aging.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 8+ months and it really has improved the elasticity of my skin. Love this product! I appreciate the fact that it is a serum and does not have other additives that can be counter productive. Great Retinol product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely swears by this stuff.  She said it not only made her skin look and feel smoother by eliminating small wrinkles but it also has done wonders keeping her face from breaking out.  It is easy to use, the eye dropper lets you apply a small amount to your skin and them you rub it in fully.  The bottle lasts about two months for her but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall she is very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
