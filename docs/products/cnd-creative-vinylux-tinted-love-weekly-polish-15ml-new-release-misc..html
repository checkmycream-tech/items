            <li>I love CND products.  </li>
            <li>I love the vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>I received one as a gift because I love to go to salon for shilac but was finding it time consuming and cost $$ every 2 weeks to change.  </li>
            <li>I think, I did not know that it would worknly with weekly top coat, so mine chipped after a day or two.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Need a polish that stays on for more than two days.  </li>
            <li>Love this Polish.</li>
            <li>Must use with there top coat to work.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t have the Vinylux color without the top coat.</li>
            <li>Looking for more of a variety of colors</li>
            <li>I love the color so rich .</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>By day two a huge chunk came off of two fingers.  </li>
            <li>The formula is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it .  </li>
            <li>I painted them with no topcoat since it claims to be a weekly polish on its own, but the next day most of my nails were significantly chipped.  </li>
            <li>Polish lasts close to a full week even after washing dishes, floors etc.</li>
            <li>Color was very pretty, true to description and picture.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty purply-pink.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, long lasting color.</li>

            <li>Still a pretty color.</li>
            <li>Decent price too!</li>
            <li>It does last a bit longer than regular polish, and has a nice sheen, however, it doesn&#x27;t easily come off with regular polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Really works..</li>
            <li>Going to exchange 2nd bottle for clear top coat.</li>
            <li>and I live at the beach and am in the sand a lot</li>
            <li>and i usef the polish recommended (vinylux clear)</li>
            <li>This is a very beautiful color, fast delivery, perfect seller, but it stays on nails disgusting, I spent 2:00 that would make up and after 1 day it came off of a finger, a complete disappointment</li>
            <li>I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t exactly live up to its promise of lasting 7 days.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the longest lasting nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> This is by far the longest lasting nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> not nearly like gel polish</li>
            <li> I had to buy the heavy duty, professional strength remover.  </li>
            <li> Some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old -</li>
            <li> From the picture it looks like it&#x27;s a pink but does not paint on as a pink.</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to remove but</li>
            <li> You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> On day one, it chipped in little places around the edges.  </li>
            <li> It had leaked in the packaging making it difficult to open, which was not a good start.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish fanatic and was so excited when I heard about this polish but have been very disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to try it on my fingernails, only to be disappointed once again.  </li>
            <li> tough sell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$ on this polish!!!!</li>
            <li> It lasts over a week and half to two weeks depending on how terrible I am with my nails.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed in this product :(</li>

            <li> I love CND products.  The Vinulyx polishes are great, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!  This is a very pretty purply-pink.  A great addition to my collection.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish fanatic and was so excited when I heard about this polish but have been very disappointed with it.  It had leaked in the packaging making it difficult to open, which was not a good start.  I painted my toes with it and I live at the beach and am in the sand a lot and it was chipped the next day.  I then decided to try it on my fingernails, only to be disappointed once again.  I painted them with no topcoat since it claims to be a weekly polish on its own, but the next day most of my nails were significantly chipped.  Soooo disappointed in this product :(</li>
            <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They definitely have lasting power!!! I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on! The Vinylux lasts about a week for me, which is amazing. Some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old - but it&#x27;s ok. Decent price too!</li>
            <li> Nice color...more red than shown in the picture, but not too much! I am happy with the color. Very fast service.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color.  The formula is fantastic.  It is a little harder to remove but not nearly like gel polish and I use both</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  I received one as a gift because I love to go to salon for shilac but was finding it time consuming and cost $$ every 2 weeks to change.  I also didn&#x27;t like how they scrapped the shilac off.  So a friend recommended this polish and now this is all I use.  It lasts over a week and half to two weeks depending on how terrible I am with my nails.</li>
            <li> Not so good as they says, after 3 days started to came out, and i usef the polish recommended (vinylux clear)</li>
            <li> I think, I did not know that it would worknly with weekly top coat, so mine chipped after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Tinted Love is an awesome pinky/red color!! Perfect for any time and looked great&lt;br /&gt;for work or play.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend at work got this polish and her nails looked great . I asked her were she got it and she said off of Amazon . I couldn&#x27;t wait to order it to . I was so excited to get it .  I love the color so rich . I want to order another color soon .</li>
            <li> Need a polish that stays on for more than two days.  Read in a magazine that this stuff was amazing. I went ahead and purchased Vinylux in three different colors and also the topcoat.  On day one, it chipped in little places around the edges.  By day two a huge chunk came off of two fingers.  I work in a retail clothing store, so I&#x27;m not scraping or pulling at things, just hanging, folding, register.  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$ on this polish!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Polish. Really works..Last for 2 weeks.. Must use with there top coat to work.</li>
            <li> From the picture it looks like it&#x27;s a pink but does not paint on as a pink. Still a pretty color. Accidentally bought 2 bottles of same color.  Going to exchange 2nd bottle for clear top coat. Can&#x27;t have the Vinylux color without the top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! It&lt;br /&gt;Lasts over a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, long lasting color. Easy to apply. I can&#x27;t use gel nail polish, the removal process wrecks my nails. I started using CND Vinylux about 3 months ago, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Color was very pretty, true to description and picture.  Polish lasts close to a full week even after washing dishes, floors etc. Looking for more of a variety of colors</li>
            <li> Great product and merchant</li>
            <li> I like this,  but it didn&#x27;t exactly live up to its promise of lasting 7 days.  I work at a keyboard all day and wash dishes by had. .... tough sell.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  Item as described and well packaged.  Def order again</li>
            <li> It does last a bit longer than regular polish, and has a nice sheen, however, it doesn&#x27;t easily come off with regular polish remover.  I had to buy the heavy duty, professional strength remover.  I won&#x27;t reorder</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful color, fast delivery, perfect seller, but it stays on nails disgusting, I spent 2:00 that would make up and after 1 day it came off of a finger, a complete disappointment</li>
