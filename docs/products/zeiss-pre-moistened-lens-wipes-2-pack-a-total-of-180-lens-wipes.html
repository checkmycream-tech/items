            <li>but this is the best one.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>give them a try  excellent product</li>
            <li>Not the best wipes I have used.</li>
            <li>But I took a chance on these and I am delighted!    </li>
            <li>and then i will get a not so moistened one but for the price at sams club it works out great for me.</li>
            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I can now order them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We also wear glasses and these also work great on them as well, leaving no streaking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for sunglasses as well.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Zeiss Lens Cloths\\&quot; are just about the best and most convenient lens cleaner I have found.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t feel you are trowing away a good thing.</li>
            <li>Perhaps one of the best products available to restore the sparkle to your eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comparing these to the pre-packaged wipes I get from Lenscrafters in the mall and the Zeiss wipes are not as good.</li>
            <li>They are as good as the Lenscrafter wipes.  </li>
            <li>clean perfectly, these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>And it was easy to boot!</li>
            <li>The product manufacturer sports one of the most famous and revered labels in the optical industry.</li>
            <li>I was really glad to see that I could get them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has a web site for this company, I sure could use it to let them know that the company packaging their product is messing up.</li>
            <li>I have used these for years and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear glasses, so I don&#x27;t know if they would be better for that or not.</li>
            <li>I love these--keep them in my purse--in car clove compartment--at my desk--just about anywhere----better than windex on my glasses----  </li>
            <li>the Flents wipes much better.  </li>
            <li>A better solution for my camera is a fine cloth with no seams, and a lens cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>The wipes clean the lenses OK but leaves lines where the alcohol dries.</li>
            <li>I even saw a residue when I cleaned my reading glasses, and I can easily see it on my camera lenses.  </li>
            <li>Theses little babies are the best.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if the haze would appear, but I&#x27;m not risking thousands of dollars of lens to a cheap wipe.     </li>
            <li>They clean your glasses so well and so easily.</li>
            <li>And they work great on our digital SLR camera.    </li>
            <li>I bought these primarily for my glasses as well as camera lenses</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed this product after using the wipes for a week.</li>
            <li>I originally went in search for deals on that product or to see if I could find savings by buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using reading glasses about 10 years ago, I&#x27;ve struggled with trying to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>Any residue evaporates immediately, leaving your glasses sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>I bought a box at three bucks, and low and behold these guys are near perfect.  </li>
            <li>I bought these exact wipes for about $2 at Wal-Mart and was excited to have found a pre-moistened wipe for my lenses when I&#x27;m on location that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost.. at sams club you can get 180 clothes for 8.50 cents.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I use them on clear safety glasses with no coating, the lens dries streak free.</li>
            <li>I have used these wipes for about 2 years for eyeglasses (never, ever, use them on camera lenses- more on that later!).  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product!</li>
            <li>Have been used exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>I immediately became interested.</li>
            <li>(I had better luck with the branded wipes from a local optical shop, See.)</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers wrote, I find them suitable for eyeglasses, barely.  </li>
            <li>Clean quick, dry fast!</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job of cleaning your lenses, but is kind of useless on its own.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast - 3 days from Arizona to California.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I consider this product to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>We use very high grade digital still and video cameras in our business and trust these cleaners to get the lenses clean without removing the protective coatings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use one cloth to clean my glasses and reading glasses, then wipe off my computer screen with the same cloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll email Zeiss to see if they will exchange this trash for some decent wipes.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It took me nearly 5 minutes with a number of lens cleaning tissue and solution just to get my lens clean and it usually only takes me 40 seconds.  </li>
            <li>i work in a lot of dirt and dust and constantly need to clean my glasses, and these actually get all the dirt and grime off pretty easly.  </li>
            <li>Per another reviewer here, I went to walmart to look for a generic brand that the reviewer had success with.  </li>
            <li>The Lens Cloths do a good job of cleaning, but they leave a residue behind.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are just right - moist enough to clean a couple of pairs of eyeglasses with a single wipe, but not so soggy that they leave smears or residue.</li>
            <li>The dry micro-fiber cloths, from Zeiss and other manufacturers, work much better.</li>
            <li>They work great on my glasses and my daughter&#x27;s, even though her&#x27;s get really dirty &amp; even greasy.    </li>
            <li>I have to wipe with another cloth, like my shirt, after cleaning to get a clear lens.</li>
            <li>One wipe and crystal clear.</li>
            <li>While the wipe will not destroy your lens, it will keep you busy for about an hour fixing the residue and streak issues.</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m not wasting money by paying about twice as much for the same thing...</li>
            <li>The fact that the towels are wrapped individually keeps them sanitized and ready to go.</li>
            <li>she ended up getting the last laugh after she discovered this product in a local department store.</li>
            <li>Have ready at least 2 or 3 glasses to clean</li>
            <li>The one that we got from Walmart, however, when dried, leaves a clean surface.  </li>
            <li>The problem I have is that the last two times I bought them, most of them were mostly dried out upon opening the individual packages.  </li>
            <li>His glasses are only two weeks old.  </li>
            <li>First, it did not react well with the lens coating, leaving streeks and the typical residue.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are as good as Lens Crafters are, but are less expensive.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> First, it did not react well with the lens coating, leaving streeks and the typical residue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are as good as Lens Crafters are, but are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> They streaked horribly and it took a bit of effort to get my lenses nice and clean again.  </li>
            <li> Due to this issue, there&#x27;s no way I would take these anywhere near my camera lenses.</li>
            <li> On bigger areas such as my Ray Bans, no problems whatsoever, I just use half of the tissue, and then quickly use the other half on my pda, phone, or whatever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned if I just use a small corner on my glasses and wipe gently until it dries, then no streaks whatsoever with the Bausch &amp; Lombs.  </li>
            <li> These also last a long time.  </li>
            <li> As a typical eyeglass wearer, I am a frequent user of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens cloths for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used one on my Wide Angle lens which is three hundred dollars and not only did it leave streaks, but a strange film as well.  </li>
            <li> I get very slight streaking (which is nowhere near what the Zeiss wipes leave)</li>
            <li> My guess is that these Lens Cloths have been sitting around in the warehouse at the company for a very long time to dry out like this when they haven&#x27;t even been opened.    </li>
            <li> If I use these on my eyeglasses though, I need to follow the wipe immediately with a tissue to dry them before the haze appears.     </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I still have a few of the Baush and Lomb wipes left to clean up the mess that Zeiss tissues left behind.    </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any such deals, so I went in search for something I hoped would work as well for less money.</li>
            <li> Some are nearly dry, others are so wet that I need to let them \\&quot;air</li>
            <li> These wipes are so wet that they leave streaks on my lenses.</li>
            <li> They work well if you keep them around for a second wipe once they&#x27;ve dried out a bit.</li>
            <li> This product cleaned off the dirty stuff, but then leave residues and streaks on the glasses, even for a surface that was initially clean.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands and have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> Other wipes out there</li>
            <li> These lens cloths are extremely convenient.  </li>
            <li> if I use the entire wipe on a small surface area</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this product is the residue left behind following typical use AND streaking (in my case).  </li>
            <li> I know from experience, cleaning delicate lenses with tissue or a shirt tail is likely to cause scratches.  </li>
            <li> After I complained to Zeiss about the streaking and scummy film this wipe left on my camera lens, I got this response:    </li>
            <li> I bought a box of these wipes at Costco and found that most were dried up and worthless.  </li>
            <li> Although the wipe clears away salt, body oils, and other grime, there always appears to be a film and streaks left behind.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they are about half the price (or maybe less) than the Bausch &amp; Lomb wipes!    </li>
            <li> It does leave some spots and a little bit of a film.</li>
            <li> No matter how well I wiped my lenses, it always dried with streaks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usung these for a few months now.</li>
            <li> With the Lenscrafters wipes, my lenses are completely transparent when I&#x27;m done (but they are expensive and require a trip to the mall).</li>
            <li> I bought these despite some of the negative reviews here due to streaking.  </li>
            <li> No more fooling with detergent and water or spray bottles and my wife always keeps a few in her purse to use when away from home.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I confess that I even resorted to trying to get my wife to do this nasty deed because she did a much better job than me.</li>
            <li> , I think that the lens and camera related tags on this product description are wrong and misleading.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; prior to use or the streaks they leave behind will be even worse.    </li>
            <li> and I had to use another cloth to finish the job (usually my shirt or a tissue!).</li>
            <li> I have been very unhappy with this product because all the cloths are dried out when I open them.  </li>
            <li> That does not help the price be less expensive.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even use this for my eyeglasses, much less for my expensive camera lens.</li>
            <li> It will remove oil and smudges, but it WILL leave behind a webbed film that can not be done away with.</li>
            <li> This is a poor product.  </li>
            <li> These inexpensive wipes have caused an expensive problem.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> I use a Nikon D200 with a number of very expensive lenses.  </li>
            <li> I am baffled by the bad reviews posted about these wipes.</li>
            <li> I almost got the Bausch &amp; Lomb wipes instead, even though they are about twice the price, because of some of the bad reviews.    </li>
            <li> It is so bad that I must review it again.</li>
            <li> After using them for appproximately two weeks, my glasses are badly scratched and so are my son&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, because it leaves a lot of smearing/residue on the glass.</li>
            <li> So I am really disappointed with this Zeiss product.  </li>
            <li> These tissues leave a disgusting, filmy residue that is almost impossible to get off the lens surface.  </li>

            <li> First and foremost.. at sams club you can get 180 clothes for 8.50 cents.  What a rip off it is on here!    That being said... i work in a lot of dirt and dust and constantly need to clean my glasses, and these actually get all the dirt and grime off pretty easly.  every now and then i will get a not so moistened one but for the price at sams club it works out great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these lens cloths because there were mixed reviews. I was hoping that perhaps my lenses were different and wouldn&#x27;t experience the hazing / film issue. Well, I have multiple coatings on my lenses for anti scratch and UV and the like, and these lenses do leave a film on the lens. I found that if I use them on clear safety glasses with no coating, the lens dries streak free. If I use these on my eyeglasses though, I need to follow the wipe immediately with a tissue to dry them before the haze appears.     Due to this issue, there&#x27;s no way I would take these anywhere near my camera lenses. I have no idea if the haze would appear, but I&#x27;m not risking thousands of dollars of lens to a cheap wipe.     Will I still use them? Yes. Until the 180 are all gone. Would I recommend them? No. They are only as convenient as sitting on my desk at work next to a box of tissues.</li>
            <li> No matter how well I wiped my lenses, it always dried with streaks and I had to use another cloth to finish the job (usually my shirt or a tissue!). I have used other brands and have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. They clean your glasses so well and so easily. No more fooling with detergent and water or spray bottles and my wife always keeps a few in her purse to use when away from home.</li>
            <li> I have used these wipes for about 2 years for eyeglasses (never, ever, use them on camera lenses- more on that later!).  As a typical eyeglass wearer, I am a frequent user of this product. As many other reviewers wrote, I find them suitable for eyeglasses, barely.  The biggest problem with this product is the residue left behind following typical use AND streaking (in my case).  Although the wipe clears away salt, body oils, and other grime, there always appears to be a film and streaks left behind.  Not sure what it is, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAMERA LENSES:  I use a Nikon D200 with a number of very expensive lenses.  I fall into the \\&quot;prosumer\\&quot; user of DSLR&#x27;s and related equipment. Believing the product was indeed a lens cloth and therefore usable on any lens, I used the product on a $1,200 Nikon lens.  First, it did not react well with the lens coating, leaving streeks and the typical residue.  I worked on that lens for another hour, reverting to a Nikon lens cloth (all I use now), which resolved the issue over time. Therefore, if you are thinking about buying this product for your camera lenses, save yourself the aggravation.  While the wipe will not destroy your lens, it will keep you busy for about an hour fixing the residue and streak issues.</li>
            <li> I am baffled by the bad reviews posted about these wipes. (?)    These wipes work perfectly.    They work great on my glasses and my daughter&#x27;s, even though her&#x27;s get really dirty &amp; even greasy.    And they work great on our digital SLR camera.    Plus, they are about half the price (or maybe less) than the Bausch &amp; Lomb wipes!    I cannot understand why some people have such problems with them.    I almost got the Bausch &amp; Lomb wipes instead, even though they are about twice the price, because of some of the bad reviews.    But I took a chance on these and I am delighted!    Plus, I&#x27;m not wasting money by paying about twice as much for the same thing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usung these for a few months now. I originally reviewed this product after using the wipes for a week. It is so bad that I must review it again. It will remove oil and smudges, but it WILL leave behind a webbed film that can not be done away with. Other wipes out there clean perfectly, these don&#x27;t. If Amazon would allow me to replace my 3 star review with one star, I would.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product - have ordered them before - arrived in timely manner - will do business again!</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job of cleaning your lenses, but is kind of useless on its own. No matter what I do, I have splotches and smears if I just use the pre-moistened cloth. I have to wipe with another cloth, like my shirt, after cleaning to get a clear lens.</li>
            <li> One goes around and around cleaning the glasses but this is the best one. Have ready at least 2 or 3 glasses to clean so you don&#x27;t feel you are trowing away a good thing. Get it!</li>
            <li> I have used Zeiss Pre-Moistened Lens cloths for a long time. They work great.  I&#x27;m happy that I can now order them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have had dirt and prints on my computer screen that would not come off until I used these.  The fact that the towels are wrapped individually keeps them sanitized and ready to go.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It cleans lenses without streaking and they are always moist.  Thanks for offering this product!</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the best products available to restore the sparkle to your eyeglasses.  The product manufacturer sports one of the most famous and revered labels in the optical industry. I have used their cameras and products for over 70 years.[[ASIN:B000J46LZU Zeiss-Pre-Moistened Lens Cloths, 180ct (2 Pack)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cloths for years but recently was having difficulty finding them in stores.  I was really glad to see that I could get them through Amazon.  These cloths do not scratch the lens and they stay moist forever.  Shipping was really fast - 3 days from Arizona to California.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are as good as Lens Crafters are, but are less expensive.  The problem I have is that the last two times I bought them, most of them were mostly dried out upon opening the individual packages.  That does not help the price be less expensive. If anyone has a web site for this company, I sure could use it to let them know that the company packaging their product is messing up. thanks</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Zeiss Lens Cloths\\&quot; are just about the best and most convenient lens cleaner I have found. We use very high grade digital still and video cameras in our business and trust these cleaners to get the lenses clean without removing the protective coatings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also wear glasses and these also work great on them as well, leaving no streaking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, because it leaves a lot of smearing/residue on the glass. I wouldn&#x27;t even use this for my eyeglasses, much less for my expensive camera lens. The dry micro-fiber cloths, from Zeiss and other manufacturers, work much better.</li>
            <li> Clean quick, dry fast! Have been used exactly as directed. No scratching!</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and have always been pleased.  They can be used for glasses, camera lenses, binocular lenses or anything you want cleaned.  I consider this product to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> These lens cloths are extremely convenient.  I keep them in my purse, my car, my camera bag and office at all times.  I know from experience, cleaning delicate lenses with tissue or a shirt tail is likely to cause scratches.  These also last a long time.  When I am at home I use one cloth to clean my glasses and reading glasses, then wipe off my computer screen with the same cloth.</li>
            <li> These wipes are just right - moist enough to clean a couple of pairs of eyeglasses with a single wipe, but not so soggy that they leave smears or residue.</li>
            <li> Each time I use these cloths, I get streaks on my glasses.  I&#x27;m going to toss them away.</li>
            <li> I have used another product called Ultra Clarity by Nanofilm. I originally went in search for deals on that product or to see if I could find savings by buying in bulk. I couldn&#x27;t find any such deals, so I went in search for something I hoped would work as well for less money. So I tried these. I can definitely say that the Zeiss cloths don&#x27;t work as well as the Ultra Clarity. It does leave some spots and a little bit of a film. It&#x27;s better than cloths I tried from Walgreens (1 star product), but not perfect and definitely not a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using reading glasses about 10 years ago, I&#x27;ve struggled with trying to keep them clean. I confess that I even resorted to trying to get my wife to do this nasty deed because she did a much better job than me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she ended up getting the last laugh after she discovered this product in a local department store. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The company I work for uses Zeiss equipment in its quality assurance department so when my wife brought home a product with the Zeiss logo on it I immediately became interested. I tried it and it worked! And it was easy to boot! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wipe it on, wipe it off. Any residue evaporates immediately, leaving your glasses sparkling clean. Great for sunglasses as well. I keep some at home, some at work, some in the car. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing these to the pre-packaged wipes I get from Lenscrafters in the mall and the Zeiss wipes are not as good. I have severe allergies in the springtime and find that the insides of my lenses get spotted with salt from all the blinking when my eyes get irritated. With the Zeiss wipe, I can get all the spots off, but it leaves a hazy film on the lens. With the Lenscrafters wipes, my lenses are completely transparent when I&#x27;m done (but they are expensive and require a trip to the mall). So, guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> These wipes are so wet that they leave streaks on my lenses. They work well if you keep them around for a second wipe once they&#x27;ve dried out a bit. (I had better luck with the branded wipes from a local optical shop, See.)</li>
            <li> I bought these despite some of the negative reviews here due to streaking.  I can confirm this.  I bought these primarily for my glasses as well as camera lenses and they do not deliver.  Every cleaning leaves streaks on my glasses.  I used one on my Wide Angle lens which is three hundred dollars and not only did it leave streaks, but a strange film as well.  It took me nearly 5 minutes with a number of lens cleaning tissue and solution just to get my lens clean and it usually only takes me 40 seconds.  Do not buy.  Per another reviewer here, I went to walmart to look for a generic brand that the reviewer had success with.  All they had was Bausch &amp; Lomb Sight Savers.  I bought a box at three bucks, and low and behold these guys are near perfect.  No streaking on my glasses or lenses and they are cheaper, 6 cents a piece vs 10 cents with the Zeiss (after shipping).  With the Bausch &amp; Lomb I get very slight streaking (which is nowhere near what the Zeiss wipes leave) if I use the entire wipe on a small surface area probably bc there is too much fluid.  I&#x27;ve learned if I just use a small corner on my glasses and wipe gently until it dries, then no streaks whatsoever with the Bausch &amp; Lombs.  On bigger areas such as my Ray Bans, no problems whatsoever, I just use half of the tissue, and then quickly use the other half on my pda, phone, or whatever.  Zero stars for the Zeiss Lens Cloths, but 5 stars for the Bausch &amp; Lomb.</li>
            <li> I bought these exact wipes for about $2 at Wal-Mart and was excited to have found a pre-moistened wipe for my lenses when I&#x27;m on location that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.  Well, I got what I paid for!  They streaked horribly and it took a bit of effort to get my lenses nice and clean again.  I don&#x27;t wear glasses, so I don&#x27;t know if they would be better for that or not.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I thought they would not put the Zeiss name on a substandard product.  Wrong!  These tissues leave a disgusting, filmy residue that is almost impossible to get off the lens surface.  Not only that, but there is a lot of moisture inconsistency from one package to the next.  Some are nearly dry, others are so wet that I need to let them \\&quot;air out\\&quot; prior to use or the streaks they leave behind will be even worse.    I can&#x27;t belive that Zeiss allowed their name to be attached to this  abomination of a lens wipe.      These wipes are not made by Zeiss, but some company called Nice-Pak Products in Orangeburg, NY.    I&#x27;ll email Zeiss to see if they will exchange this trash for some decent wipes.    Thankfully, I still have a few of the Baush and Lomb wipes left to clean up the mess that Zeiss tissues left behind.    Edited on 4/07/09 to add the following:    After I complained to Zeiss about the streaking and scummy film this wipe left on my camera lens, I got this response:    \\&quot;The product you refer to is sold by the Carl Zeiss Vision division and is intended for use on eyeglasses and not multi-coated camera lenses. I have forwarded your message to them for follow-up.\\&quot;    Based on Zeiss&#x27; response, I think that the lens and camera related tags on this product description are wrong and misleading.</li>
            <li> I love these--keep them in my purse--in car clove compartment--at my desk--just about anywhere----better than windex on my glasses----  give them a try  excellent product</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my glasses and my son&#x27;s because they were inexpensive.  After using them for appproximately two weeks, my glasses are badly scratched and so are my son&#x27;s.  His glasses are only two weeks old.  I now will have to have our lenses replaced, even though the lenses in both pairs of glasses are scratch resistant.  These inexpensive wipes have caused an expensive problem.</li>
            <li> I have been very unhappy with this product because all the cloths are dried out when I open them.  This should NOT be the case.  My guess is that these Lens Cloths have been sitting around in the warehouse at the company for a very long time to dry out like this when they haven&#x27;t even been opened.    I will not be purchasing from this company (USA Wholesale Club) in the future.  No wonder their cost was lower than their competitors.    [...]    [...]</li>
            <li> The wipes clean the lenses OK but leaves lines where the alcohol dries. Not the best wipes I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought a box of these wipes at Costco and found that most were dried up and worthless.  This is a poor product.  I like the Flents wipes much better.  They are as good as the Lenscrafter wipes.  You can get the Flents at Amazon.Com</li>
            <li> The Lens Cloths do a good job of cleaning, but they leave a residue behind.  I even saw a residue when I cleaned my reading glasses, and I can easily see it on my camera lenses.  A better solution for my camera is a fine cloth with no seams, and a lens cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Theses little babies are the best.  I use them for everything, Iphone, glasses, watchface, anything with a lens that can get grimey.  One wipe and crystal clear. Stays moist to do a number a clean-ups. I can&#x27;t be without them!</li>
            <li> Though carrying the big name Zeiss, I found that this product is not working as well as the one that we got from Walmart.  This product cleaned off the dirty stuff, but then leave residues and streaks on the glasses, even for a surface that was initially clean.  The one that we got from Walmart, however, when dried, leaves a clean surface.  So I am really disappointed with this Zeiss product.  The chemical they used will leave marking/streaks on the surface!</li>
