            <li>oh happy day!</li>
            <li>Have had excellent results with this product.</li>
            <li>, the bottom line is that this product is awesome and it works on eyebrows as well as eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>The hairs are growing in beautifully, and they are not prickly.  </li>
            <li>Great product after continued use</li>
            <li>I think, given time this treatment would successfully improve hair growth in the eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li>experienced amazing results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if the product is effective basically because I was growing out my brows anyway.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to say that it was amazing</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with this product and I am going to buy it again today.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve personally experienced no ill side effects</li>
            <li>After using the serum for three weeks I noticed A HUGE DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>They were able to make my brows more even at the time and then they sent me home with the Brow Job growth serum.</li>
            <li>After trying many products, this product works.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I feel like my brows are getting better.</li>
            <li>I will give it some more time.</li>
            <li>i hope I get more growth</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient like with everything else:)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s getting better every day.  </li>
            <li>I want to say that this product has for sure accelerated my brow growth and color.</li>
            <li>I think my eyebrows are probably about 30-40 percent thicker/darker but in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>Well it sure did.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product .  </li>
            <li>My brows have never been very full anyway, and they were 2 or 3 shades of blonde/light brown.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those who was born with light brown, fine, lackluster brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li>I already rated it  wrote long thing on how great it is</li>
            <li>They are the original color and texture.  </li>
            <li>and no matter what color you get when outside in the bright sunlight your eyebrows look just like they were painted on.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy about this product that I strongly recommend to anyone who needs a little help in the eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is helping tremendously</li>
            <li>: You will go through the formula quickly in the beginning as your eyebrows are growing in.</li>
            <li>I decided to see if there was anything more effective out there and ordered Boom Boom, not really expecting a difference.</li>
            <li>The only good thing i can say is that when they fell out they appeared to be very shiny and glossy!  </li>
            <li>Start with a cheaper one first l  Lesson learned !</li>
            <li>My brows are sprouting and growing, it&#x27;s pretty cool to see what a difference there is.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to see the difference after nearly one month.</li>
            <li>I love the results so far.</li>
            <li>I first started using the product, it took about a month for me to see the full extent of the growth.</li>
            <li>I can only give honest opinion on how it worked for me.....</li>
            <li>I am going to draw on brows when I can have my own back!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get overly excited and most likely will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but I DO know that this product started working right away.  </li>
            <li>It was a major splurge for me,  Maybe it could work better for you</li>
            <li>I had noticed my own brows were getting more and more sparse the last few months.  </li>
            <li>Just be mindful that the product is applied to clean and dry hairs and work the product not just on top of the hairs but at the root area.  </li>
            <li>They went from being fine to being considerably thicker and as a result they became deeper in color as well.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I tried this product before purchasing a more expensive brand ($100-$300 products out there) or trying something more permanent like tattooing.</li>
            <li>first week or two it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Nothing first 2 weeks and then BOOM BOOM.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>so I believe I&#x27;ll be purchasing more to spruce them back up.</li>
            <li>Definitely got more hair growth in spots where I had over-tweezed before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more brow and lash growth \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; products than you could possibly imagine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and the tube is small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Okay, so we&#x27;re not usually shooting for long eyebrow hairs, but what was fabulous was that the thickness of the brow hairs changed.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin and very sensitive eyelids, VERY sensitive eye area, and this does not cause any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for 6 weeks but am noticing the most new growth I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I could not believe 3 weeks later when I could actually see baby hairs growing - magic!  </li>
            <li>They have grown in so much since using this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I expected more from it...</li>
            <li>These results are promising.</li>
            <li>It lasted 3 weeks and did absolutely nothing .</li>
            <li>I really did see an improvement in my brows after using this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t having to fill them in as much.  </li>
            <li>So, if I want to change the thickness of my brows or have perhaps thinned them out too much they grow in so much faster</li>
            <li>In fact, sometimes I cannot even believe how much longer my lashes have grown.  </li>
            <li>After about a month i noticed more hair growth, this may have been due to the fact that i didn&#x27;t thread my eyebrows the whole time.</li>
            <li>Plus it cost more then a lot of other products out there .  </li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>, SO many different brow products and this is the only one that worked.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely transformed my eyebrows!!</li>
            <li>Brow job filled in the empty spaces and thickened the existing hairs.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a wand small tube which looks more like a trail sample size and if used twice daily it won&#x27;t last more then a month.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not have oils left on your brows or lashes and let the product dry and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I have not had new growth eyebrows in 18-19 years, since my teens.</li>
            <li>I grew new eyebrows and thicker eyebrows in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>After years and many dollars trying other brow growth products, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve actually found one that works.  </li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else noticed the same results, but literally by the next time you go get your brows done you&#x27;ll notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>My nice thick brows are finally back to normal</li>
            <li>And on an 86 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m busy don&#x27;t have time to keep rating what i already did</li>
            <li>I used to order this product directly from Boom Boom before Amazon started selling it.</li>
            <li>It helped my brows grow back in so much faster</li>
            <li>I bought it again to keep brows alive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my fifties and was losing the lateral portion of my brows, which is natural when a woman ages.  </li>
            <li>So far looks like it is working.</li>
            <li>There was still enough left to let me get by but still, over the past year or so I have become more aware of how they can shape a face.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone born with pitiful eyebrows and eyelashes knows that eyebrow pencils, powders, and gels can only do so much - - and no matter what you do</li>
            <li>Mascara can only do so much on a shorter lash as well.  </li>
            <li>These were the only few healthy ones that i had had for years before now falling out by themselves.  </li>
            <li>, my brows are kind of thin and lighter in color, so they need all the help they can get.  </li>
            <li>Money would be better spent on eyebrow pencil and given the cost of this product, that would buy quite a few brow pencils.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I need MORE!</li>
            <li>And the friend who recommended it me (a professional eyebrow artist) said the same thing.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve ran out of product, they&#x27;ve reverted back to their natural thinness</li>
            <li>The more mascara applied sometimes results in looking worse.  </li>
            <li>If it can cause new growth after no hair for that long it truly is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic, but paying $50 to then find out it doesn&#x27;t even last 4 months is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I may come back to this brand, but I&#x27;m going to try some of the cheaper options first to see if I can get similar results for less money.</li>

            <li> I noticed that a lot of the first reviews for this product were written within days of each other and then there were no other reviews for quite a while, causing me to believe that the positive reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> End of second week, my long pre-exising eyebrow lashes were falling out with no help, reason, or tug!</li>
            <li> Gotta find the positive in the negative.  </li>
            <li> It says 3-4 month supply on the label, but in no less than 2 weeks; the entire bottle dried up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a grey eyebrow hair yet.  </li>
            <li> but they did not grow in grey.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the eyes, but it is basically the same thing there too as well.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say the girl jacked me and left me with super thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li> After losing a lot of brow hair due to a thyroid condition, I am DEFINITELY starting to finally see some progress after trying other brands.</li>
            <li> The other one seems to be lasting longer but there is still no affect on my eyebrow growth whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The other products worked, but not enough to make a truly noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a day before I do my makeup, let it dry for 5 or 10 minutes and then apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much new growth, but one or two baby spikes.</li>
            <li> Not only are my brows growing, but they are growing in dark brown.  </li>
            <li> eyebrows began to thin as I got older, especially on the edges.</li>
            <li> YES YES YES&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror the other day and was a little startled, as my eye brows were definitely a shade or two darker than they have been for ten plus years.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> About another month or less after I finish this brow growth formula, my brows have grown enough that I don&#x27;t need a product like this anymore.</li>
            <li> Where they came out no new hair was growing !</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but I ordered this anyhow, and am glad I did!</li>
            <li> It was a major crisis seriously and I struggled for months trying to grow them back in...</li>
            <li> All these little hairs started growing in in places I thought were not even possible!!</li>
            <li> Lash extensions and other adaptations will eventually mess up your hair follicles and the last thing I want is fewer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so my eyebrows are having trouble growing back and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying until the tube is empty and if things change I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I tried several products before this and they ranged from worthless to moderately ok.</li>
            <li> It is far to expensive to not have major improvement.</li>
            <li> After a month or so of use I had to actually trim the long thick brow hairs with a scissor.  </li>
            <li> And you must screw on the cap tightly or it will dry up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll revert if it works so people who was as unlucky as me with this product can have a less expensive option that actually works; had high expectations with this product due the reviews ...</li>
            <li> Not impressed so far, and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am allergic to it, &amp; developed the usual symptoms: nasal drainage, a cough, &amp; swollen glands that didn&#x27;t clear up until I stopped using the product!</li>
            <li> I can maybe see a little (very little) improvement in growth but certainly not enough to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> One of them dried up and had no more liquid only after about 2-3 weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I went crazy overboard on the application - maybe more than one swipe per brow but not more than one &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; of the wand in the bottle.</li>
            <li> But maybe I need to use it a little longer because I&#x27;m not seeing the results the other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> Nor would i have ever plucked dead center of my brows!  </li>
            <li> Plus, the bottle was gone with once a day application in less than a month....</li>
            <li> I did see some results in about 3 weeks but the product was all gone in less than 30 days, I believe it was advertised as a 90 day supply.  </li>
            <li> Also, with one or two applications a day this product was gone in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Disappointed since it isn&#x27;t a cheap product.</li>
            <li> One brow was worse that the other, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to use products to fill in color when I was losing so much actual hair.  </li>
            <li> I started using another brand of growth serum, which helped a little.</li>
            <li> , it is a little spendy also which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> but I could tell they were a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> I see plenty of little hairs where I don&#x27;t want or need them, but where I place the growth formula...</li>
            <li> I was guilty of over tweezing and they ended up super thin and uneven.</li>
            <li> few tips</li>
            <li> I used another, well-known, non-Rx growth serum for quite some time and did not achieve the regrowth I did with Boom Boom Brow Job in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, in just a few weeks, I regrew the lateral portion of my brows, and my brows are now framing my eyes once again as they should be.</li>
            <li> within a few weeks or a month my family couldn&#x27;t believe that my eyebrows have returned and fuller then ever.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to run out quickly, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the maintenance stage (use it once every other day) and my eyebrows continue to be thick and luscious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received Amazon gift certificates this past Christmas and decided to splurge on a tube of this.  </li>
            <li> A lot of money for the small amount you receive.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Thick caked on spider lashes.  </li>
            <li> And yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but it becomes less so when you don&#x27;t have to use it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very thin and even missing in one spot brows.</li>
            <li> still my same brows :((</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> If anything, my eyebrow hair loss has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Well, based on my experience that is false.</li>
            <li> so I am clearly unhappy and sad with my purchase :/</li>
            <li> Not only is that aging, but it looks so hopelessly artificial and just plain horrible.  </li>
            <li> I really hate giving products bad reviews but; for the price of this and the amount that was in it, is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed because it was not a cheap purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unless something drastic happens before I run out, I will unlikely purchase again.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, as soon as I stopped they became very very thin again.</li>
            <li> So I made the mistake of walking in to some random place in desperate need of a brow wax while I was traveling.</li>
            <li> but the results were always disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I have MS no feeling in my fingers hard to type stop annoying me by making me rerate what I already rated!</li>
            <li> I attempted to contact the seller but they never responded to my concerns, nothing worst than poor customer service!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works wonders.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and it has lasted for a month.  My brows are sprouting and growing, it&#x27;s pretty cool to see what a difference there is.  If you want your eyebrows to grow don&#x27;t hesitate to order this product. It&#x27;s amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. My brows were so skinny from years of over tweezing. They have grown in so much since using this. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have went thru chemotherapy and so my eyebrows are having trouble growing back and this stuff is helping tremendously</li>
            <li> After losing a lot of brow hair due to a thyroid condition, I am DEFINITELY starting to finally see some progress after trying other brands.</li>
            <li> After years and many dollars trying other brow growth products, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve actually found one that works.  And on an 86 year old woman.  I received Amazon gift certificates this past Christmas and decided to splurge on a tube of this.  Not only are my brows growing, but they are growing in dark brown.  I haven&#x27;t seen a grey eyebrow hair yet.  I just wish it was a little less expensive.  Do  they make anything comparable for eyelashes?</li>
            <li> I had big hopes for this product. I did have some growth like two baby hairs on each brow. I wouldn&#x27;t get overly excited and most likely will not purchase it again. The product comes in a wand small tube which looks more like a trail sample size and if used twice daily it won&#x27;t last more then a month. I bought it based on a review from an 80 year woman who said it not only grew her brow but they did not grow in grey. Well, based on my experience that is false. A lot of money for the small amount you receive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed so far, and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past several weeks. I&#x27;m just disappointed because it was not a cheap purchase and I expected more from it... But maybe I need to use it a little longer because I&#x27;m not seeing the results the other reviewers did. I&#x27;ll keep trying until the tube is empty and if things change I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see the difference after nearly one month. I&#x27;m not impressed. Unless something drastic happens before I run out, I will unlikely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for 6 weeks but am noticing the most new growth I have ever seen. These results are promising. I had very thin and even missing in one spot brows. I have not had new growth eyebrows in 18-19 years, since my teens. If it can cause new growth after no hair for that long it truly is a miracle product. Now they look about 50% improved. I love the results so far. I am glad I tried this product before purchasing a more expensive brand ($100-$300 products out there) or trying something more permanent like tattooing.</li>
            <li> I already rated it  wrote long thing on how great it is did amazon delet it ? i&#x27;m busy don&#x27;t have time to keep rating what i already did I have MS no feeling in my fingers hard to type stop annoying me by making me rerate what I already rated!</li>
            <li> I used to order this product directly from Boom Boom before Amazon started selling it. And this does indeed work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using the product, it took about a month for me to see the full extent of the growth. I&#x27;m in the maintenance stage (use it once every other day) and my eyebrows continue to be thick and luscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips: You will go through the formula quickly in the beginning as your eyebrows are growing in. And you must screw on the cap tightly or it will dry up. And yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but it becomes less so when you don&#x27;t have to use it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows began to thin as I got older, especially on the edges. Brow job filled in the empty spaces and thickened the existing hairs. I don&#x27;t know how it will work on someone who over-plucked, but for thinning brows it works great!</li>
            <li> I understand products are miracle workers for some and horrid for others.  I can only give honest opinion on how it worked for me.....first week or two it seemed to work. Not much new growth, but one or two baby spikes. End of second week, my long pre-exising eyebrow lashes were falling out with no help, reason, or tug! These were the only few healthy ones that i had had for years before now falling out by themselves.  Where they came out no new hair was growing ! Now there are patches and i havent plucked for months.  Nor would i have ever plucked dead center of my brows!  The only good thing i can say is that when they fell out they appeared to be very shiny and glossy!  Wow ! Gotta find the positive in the negative.  Again, i can see if for others it does not cause your hair to fall out then this is great! It gives shine.  However, will not be purchasing again for my eyebrows.  Plus, the bottle was gone with once a day application in less than a month....</li>
            <li> I did see some results in about 3 weeks but the product was all gone in less than 30 days, I believe it was advertised as a 90 day supply.  I attempted to contact the seller but they never responded to my concerns, nothing worst than poor customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t live without this product! It&#x27;s completely transformed my eyebrows!! I was guilty of over tweezing and they ended up super thin and uneven. On my last visit to NYC I paid a visit to Boom Boom Brows and it changed my life. They were able to make my brows more even at the time and then they sent me home with the Brow Job growth serum. After using the serum for three weeks I noticed A HUGE DIFFERENCE! All these little hairs started growing in in places I thought were not even possible!! I will always use this serum, I&#x27;m scared not to! I can&#x27;t wait to go back to NYC next year and have them shaped at Boom Boom. All around AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> So I made the mistake of walking in to some random place in desperate need of a brow wax while I was traveling. Let&#x27;s just say the girl jacked me and left me with super thin eyebrows! It was a major crisis seriously and I struggled for months trying to grow them back in...all I can say is thank god I found this product! It helped my brows grow back in so much faster and this place does the best eyebrows. My nice thick brows are finally back to normal and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> I bought this in NYC at Boom Boom Brow Bar when I was visiting and could not believe how well it worked.  I went in for a brow shaping and they suggested Brow Job to help promote growth, my brows are kind of thin and lighter in color, so they need all the help they can get.  I could not believe 3 weeks later when I could actually see baby hairs growing - magic!  Needless to say, I need MORE!</li>
            <li> After trying many products, this product works.  Nothing first 2 weeks and then BOOM BOOM.  EYEBROWS!!!  I bought it again to keep brows alive.</li>
            <li> This product is a rip off in my opinion. Not only did it not thicken my brows, but my brows became thinner where I applied the product. Money would be better spent on eyebrow pencil and given the cost of this product, that would buy quite a few brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but I ordered this anyhow, and am glad I did! I didn&#x27;t over-tweeze. My eyebrows just thinned with age, like my hair--especially the outer ends--and I had to draw them on. Not any more. This product has made them grow in, so just a touch-up is all I need.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic, but paying $50 to then find out it doesn&#x27;t even last 4 months is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I used another, well-known, non-Rx growth serum for quite some time and did not achieve the regrowth I did with Boom Boom Brow Job in just a few weeks.  I&#x27;m in my fifties and was losing the lateral portion of my brows, which is natural when a woman ages.  I started using another brand of growth serum, which helped a little. I used this brand for a couple of years. I decided to see if there was anything more effective out there and ordered Boom Boom, not really expecting a difference. However, in just a few weeks, I regrew the lateral portion of my brows, and my brows are now framing my eyes once again as they should be. Am I going to reorder?  You betcha. I am going to draw on brows when I can have my own back!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 weeks. After about a month i noticed more hair growth, this may have been due to the fact that i didn&#x27;t thread my eyebrows the whole time. I did notice that my brows were fuller and darker. Great product after continued use</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I grew new eyebrows and thicker eyebrows in about 3 weeks. HOWEVER, as soon as I stopped they became very very thin again. Soooo I guess I&#x27;ll just keep buying it, it is a little spendy also which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> I ordered two tubes of this product. One of them dried up and had no more liquid only after about 2-3 weeks of using this product. The other one seems to be lasting longer but there is still no affect on my eyebrow growth whatsoever. If anything, my eyebrow hair loss has gotten worse. I noticed that a lot of the first reviews for this product were written within days of each other and then there were no other reviews for quite a while, causing me to believe that the positive reviews are fake. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this on February 2014...it&#x27;s August now...nothing happened. Disappointed since it isn&#x27;t a cheap product. I&#x27;m going to try Ardell&#x27;s in the following weeks and I&#x27;ll revert if it works so people who was as unlucky as me with this product can have a less expensive option that actually works; had high expectations with this product due the reviews ...so I am clearly unhappy and sad with my purchase :/</li>
            <li> I bought and used 5 of these. Used for months, morning and evening hoping I&#x27;d grow back my overplucked brows. Nope.</li>
            <li> Boom Boom Brow Job is the best eyebrow growth serum ever! I noticed fuller brows within 1 month!</li>
            <li> tube dries up before I can use it, doesn&#x27;t even last a month</li>
            <li> So far looks like it is working. I feel like my brows are getting better. But only time can tell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey for what you get. Can&#x27;t tell if the product is effective basically because I was growing out my brows anyway. Also, with one or two applications a day this product was gone in less than a month. And the friend who recommended it me (a professional eyebrow artist) said the same thing. About another month or less after I finish this brow growth formula, my brows have grown enough that I don&#x27;t need a product like this anymore. So, I wonder if I didn&#x27;t use the product would I still have had to be patient for two months anyway while waiting for my brows to grow out. It might have been smarter not to have use this chemical on my brows. but everyone has to decide for themselves.</li>
            <li> It seem maybe some growth.  I still have blank spots.  I will give it some more time. i hope I get more growth</li>
            <li> This product did not work ! It lasted 3 weeks and did absolutely nothing . Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> I really did see an improvement in my brows after using this product. I didn&#x27;t turn into Brooke Shields, mind you but I could tell they were a little thicker.  I wasn&#x27;t having to fill them in as much.  Since I&#x27;ve ran out of product, they&#x27;ve reverted back to their natural thinness so I believe I&#x27;ll be purchasing more to spruce them back up.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the planet for growing in rock star Ã¼ber glam &#x27;Hollywood-esq\\&quot; brows. I promise if you invest you will be convinced that it&#x27;s a miracle serum. It&#x27;s also leaves the area around the brows &amp; eyes hydrated &amp; youthful. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else noticed the same results, but literally by the next time you go get your brows done you&#x27;ll notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It says 3-4 month supply on the label, but in no less than 2 weeks; the entire bottle dried up. I really hate giving products bad reviews but; for the price of this and the amount that was in it, is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The best product for your brows out there!! I have tried SO, SO many different brow products and this is the only one that worked. You just have to be patient like with everything else:)</li>
            <li> I think, given time this treatment would successfully improve hair growth in the eyebrow area.  Unfortunately, I am allergic to it, &amp; developed the usual symptoms: nasal drainage, a cough, &amp; swollen glands that didn&#x27;t clear up until I stopped using the product!</li>
            <li> I am so happy about this product that I strongly recommend to anyone who needs a little help in the eyebrow area.  I had noticed my own brows were getting more and more sparse the last few months.  One brow was worse that the other, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to use products to fill in color when I was losing so much actual hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a thyroid problem or what, but I DO know that this product started working right away.  After 2 weeks I had noticed a big difference.  Now it&#x27;s 3 weeks and it&#x27;s getting better every day.  My brows have never been very full anyway, and they were 2 or 3 shades of blonde/light brown.  The hairs are growing in beautifully, and they are not prickly.  They are the original color and texture.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this product.  Now I can look in the mirror and actually see eyebrows without putting any color there at all.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product .  I&#x27;ve been using it religiously twice a day and have seen no results.  Plus it cost more then a lot of other products out there .  Start with a cheaper one first l  Lesson learned !</li>
            <li> YES YES YES&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror the other day and was a little startled, as my eye brows were definitely a shade or two darker than they have been for ten plus years.&lt;br /&gt;For my highschool pictures ages ago, I went to get my brows shaped-- this lady chemical burned me and some of the brow hair never grew back. Well it was not too noticeable over time as the redness and scabs healed but my brows where never the same after that. There was still enough left to let me get by but still, over the past year or so I have become more aware of how they can shape a face. I tried several products before this and they ranged from worthless to moderately ok. I want to say that this product has for sure accelerated my brow growth and color. I have been using it for about four weeks now. I think my eyebrows are probably about 30-40 percent thicker/darker but in a healthy way. I am going to keep using this and see what happens. I am pretty happy with this product and I am going to buy it again today. Also, I have sensitive skin and very sensitive eyelids, VERY sensitive eye area, and this does not cause any kind of irritation. oh happy day!</li>
            <li> Have had excellent results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product religiously twice a day since receiving it about a month ago.  I wanted to be able to say that it was amazing but I cannot. I can maybe see a little (very little) improvement in growth but certainly not enough to justify the cost.  It was a major splurge for me,  Maybe it could work better for you but I will not purchase again.  It is far to expensive to not have major improvement.</li>
            <li> Definitely got more hair growth in spots where I had over-tweezed before. I was disappointed to run out quickly, though. There is a disclaimer in the description that the brow serum only lasts 3 months if you use it once daily and just one swipe per brow. I don&#x27;t think that I went crazy overboard on the application - maybe more than one swipe per brow but not more than one &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; of the wand in the bottle. That said, it only lasted about a month for me. I may come back to this brand, but I&#x27;m going to try some of the cheaper options first to see if I can get similar results for less money.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who was born with light brown, fine, lackluster brows and lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried more brow and lash growth \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; products than you could possibly imagine but the results were always disappointing.  The other products worked, but not enough to make a truly noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then that all changed when I switched to Boom Boom Brow Job.  No kidding.  After a month or so of use I had to actually trim the long thick brow hairs with a scissor.  Okay, so we&#x27;re not usually shooting for long eyebrow hairs, but what was fabulous was that the thickness of the brow hairs changed.  They went from being fine to being considerably thicker and as a result they became deeper in color as well.  They also grow in faster.  So, if I want to change the thickness of my brows or have perhaps thinned them out too much they grow in so much faster that it&#x27;s not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, this product is for the eyebrows and not the eyelashes.  But I figured if it made my eyebrow hair grow longer and thicker it would also (in theory) do the same for my eyelashes.  Well it sure did.  In fact, sometimes I cannot even believe how much longer my lashes have grown.  Just like my brows my lashes are thicker as well.  Also, it does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it on my eyelashes for well over a month and I&#x27;ve personally experienced no ill side effects - - just be cautious about not getting it into your eyes.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror when I apply it so I know where it is going and where it isn&#x27;t going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone born with pitiful eyebrows and eyelashes knows that eyebrow pencils, powders, and gels can only do so much - - and no matter what you do and no matter what color you get when outside in the bright sunlight your eyebrows look just like they were painted on.  Not only is that aging, but it looks so hopelessly artificial and just plain horrible.  Mascara can only do so much on a shorter lash as well.  The more mascara applied sometimes results in looking worse.  Thick caked on spider lashes.  Lash extensions and other adaptations will eventually mess up your hair follicles and the last thing I want is fewer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the bottom line is that this product is awesome and it works on eyebrows as well as eyelashes.  Just be mindful that the product is applied to clean and dry hairs and work the product not just on top of the hairs but at the root area.  Some who have purchased this product and saw no results may have swept the product over the hairs and not into the root.  Work it at the root of the brow and onto the brow hairs.  Be careful with the eyes, but it is basically the same thing there too as well.  Make sure you do not have oils left on your brows or lashes and let the product dry and stay in place.  I apply mine once a day before I do my makeup, let it dry for 5 or 10 minutes and then apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that has ever truly delivered.  Watch the application tips and give it a try.</li>
            <li> experienced amazing results. within a few weeks or a month my family couldn&#x27;t believe that my eyebrows have returned and fuller then ever.</li>
            <li> I see plenty of little hairs where I don&#x27;t want or need them, but where I place the growth formula...still my same brows :((</li>
            <li> I am 60+, and my overplucked brows were getting sparse. Boom Boom Brow Job made them thicker and darker. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and the tube is small and easy to pack.</li>
