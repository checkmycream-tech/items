    <ol>
            <li>Good Luck!!</li>
            <li>I bought the Sensational kit and it is great</li>
            <li>and I loved the colors</li>
            <li>had I not needed 4-5 coats to make it look good.</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>but( Honestly after buying this kit I discovered  an easier way.  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true . . .</li>
            <li>This is very important, as it is what helps the polish adhere to your nail plate.</li>
            <li>Darker color is better than a lighter color.  </li>
            <li>If you want a lighter color, expect it to be more of a tint</li>
            <li>Seriously DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li>I used it with a high quality UV lamp, and had great results.</li>
            <li>Lets just say I&#x27;m glad I bout it here for cheaper than the site with free shipping.</li>
            <li>That is a really cool thing -- most salons have told me that they don&#x27;t do gel nails for toes.  </li>
            <li>I get about six days, which is just fine given my nail</li>
            <li>So since I already had the light and I saw the infomercial</li>
            <li>Just received my haute polish light kit at a cost of $14.95 but now find I am to pay an additional $33 a month for three months.  </li>
            <li>The light is designed to cure for 1 minute</li>
            <li>The customer service woman was very nice, but said they could not take nail polish back.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>First off I have the \\&quot;sensationail\\&quot; system and love it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw the colors cause</li>
            <li>If you think you&#x27;re ready to go, I would suggest holding the swab on for 10 MORE seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I tried the lighter shades several times and thought that the darker shade of classic red would work better - NOT!!!  </li>
            <li>The Polish is fine but the whole 14 day for 14.95 trial is very miss</li>
            <li>They are sending a replacement color, but I don&#x27;t see how it is likely to work any better.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting china glaze red on top</li>
            <li>and then a clear coat of gel polish from another company and cured it under the light.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your $!!!!</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you want nice coverage, you will need at least 3 or 4 coats and a lot of free time.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent product, with the right expectations.</li>
            <li>so it is pure.</li>
            <li>Warm up the polish in your hands, or set it in front of a heater for a little while.</li>
            <li>Very upset</li>
            <li>Ok.... you have to be a bit patient and a bit careful</li>
            <li>Even if you got two weeks, your nails would grow so much that you&#x27;d want to do a filler.  </li>
            <li>very careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you put too much polish on one digit, it runs.  </li>
            <li>Stirring the product really well before use helps it to regain its structure which will give you a deeper color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may be sheer and require more layers for your taste in the final color.</li>
            <li>This will help it be a little more</li>
            <li>DO NOT remove the sticky layer until you are completely finished!!</li>
            <li>sensationail is all deep metallics and these colors were fun.</li>
            <li>But the color betrayal holds true to it&#x27;s name because you feel betrayed and the fun shade of blue called \\&quot;paradise\\&quot; was green and not even a pretty one.  </li>
            <li>So the only good thing was it was thick on my nails as if I had gotten a gel set, it hasn&#x27;t chipped as of yet</li>
            <li>If you want complete coverage, do a darker color.  </li>
            <li>The idea that this system would require only one step of polish was so promising</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wipe with your alcohol swab until you are completely done painting and curing.</li>
            <li>I should have followed the age old advice of &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>As a professional in this industry I will not buy this..</li>
            <li>But sometimes it has to dry first</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure just how easy it will come off.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my nails for over 40 years and the only drawback is that the manicure does not last more than one week and less if I do any housework.  </li>
            <li>This product is very deceiving; the color does not nearly look as it does in bottle when applied to nails even after 5 coats.  </li>
            <li>I live at the beach in the summer and this actually holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She bought about 20 different colors for it too directly from the haute nails website.</li>
            <li>The classic red polish goes on so sheer and the lamp only accomodates 4 fingers at a time.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish never dry, i dont know what to do?</li>
            <li>You can apply many layers but all must be THIN to achieve proper cure.</li>
            <li>then they proceed to take 33$ for the next 3 month for the two light s that is the part that is ridiculous.</li>

            <li> Here are my tips for getting this sometimes frustrating polish, to work to its full potential.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry, colors are so sheer you have to do it 3 times to see any type of color on your nails.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what people are talking about in terms of drying time, it only takes 60 secs to dry people!</li>
            <li> STIR the polish with a long cuticle stick.</li>
            <li> It seems to separate when it sits for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> cured each coat in my UV lamp for about 120 seconds which was plenty long.</li>
            <li> but it did not live up to its promise.  </li>
            <li> Between the amount of time curing the polish under the lamp after each coat, applying the multiple coats and then reapplying polish after it comes off when you use the cleansing wipe, it&#x27;s just not worth all the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> The color was translucent took 4 coats where it was remotely dark enough and you can still see nail through it.</li>
            <li> only complain is that freaking annoying talking instructions led light, it should be a way to completely turn it off.</li>
            <li> Not true to the color, nor does it last two weeks.</li>
            <li> IT IS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> It is such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My nails dried instantly and you don&#x27;t need gel wipes just use alcohol to wipe</li>
            <li> I will continue to combine it with other polish to get color saturation.</li>
            <li> , apply 1 base coat, a polish,  maybe 2 coats of whatever color you choose and while still wet apply Rock&#x27;s top coat and sit under UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> you can only do 4 fingers at a time, which takes forever considering you need at least 3 coats.  </li>
            <li> because I used OPI or Mirage cotton candy just to have a tint of color and buy ROCK base and top coat</li>
            <li> It appealed to me because you don&#x27;t have to bother with the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> Do NOT apply any single layer thickly or it will NOT cure correctly.</li>
            <li> oh, and they charge you for missing items.</li>
            <li> I quit after four coats because it still looked blotchy and uneven.  </li>
            <li> The polish itself was really thick, not dried out thick, but thick.</li>
            <li> what a fiasco; with 3 coats the color is still pale and streaky.  </li>
            <li> I bought this polish because I thought a one coat polish would save time, but as other reviewers have indicated, it takes at least four coats before the color looks anything like it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer is fraudulent and not easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been charged over $160.00 for crappy nail polish and a lite that is very cheesy.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to spread on my nails neatly and it looks like a 5 yo did.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to need about 3 coats, so you want them to be thin, or they&#x27;ll just peel off after a little bit of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polish sucks-</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s too thick and breaks off.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!  </li>
            <li> The company sucks!  </li>
            <li> Do thin coats, even if you have to do three or four.  </li>
            <li> Thin coats.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so streaky and is not attractive either.</li>
            <li> Apply thin coats.</li>
            <li> the polish is sooo thin.</li>
            <li> There is some chemistry behind the working quality of this product..</li>
            <li> Price wouldn&#x27;t be bad</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> This was the worst polish created.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product i ever bought!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i purchased the trial pack which comes with several polishes, q tips, cleaners, and 2 lamps.  i was so excited to try it. what a fiasco; with 3 coats the color is still pale and streaky.  you can only do 4 fingers at a time, which takes forever considering you need at least 3 coats.  try to return it---you don&#x27;t get a human,  you get a mailbox.  one can only hope they call back. oh, and they charge you for missing items. how are you going to know if you like it or not if you don&#x27;t use some of it.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS. IT IS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry, colors are so sheer you have to do it 3 times to see any type of color on your nails. Do NOT waste your $!!!! Very upset and i wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Ok.... you have to be a bit patient and a bit careful and if you are those two things, this product works quite well.  Here are my tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Don&#x27;t expect two weeks.  Even if you got two weeks, your nails would grow so much that you&#x27;d want to do a filler.  I get about six days, which is just fine given my nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do thin coats, even if you have to do three or four.  The think coats also make it easier to just peel off the polish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Darker color is better than a lighter color.  If you want complete coverage, do a darker color.  If you want a lighter color, expect it to be more of a tint that an actual solid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  You can do your toes with this product!  That is a really cool thing -- most salons have told me that they don&#x27;t do gel nails for toes.  I live at the beach in the summer and this actually holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Thin coats.  I can&#x27;t say it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is saving me $30 every ten days. It is well worth the money and if I have an inadvertent chip (which happens even with salon nails), I can fix it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You nay-sayers.... I just have to say that you aren&#x27;t patient enough to get the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered from the mother company itself.  Do not give them your Credit Card Number because they keep charging your account.  Even though they say money back guarantee they refuse to refund your money. I didn&#x27;t realize I joined a club (very tiny font on bottom of website). They&#x27;ll tell you it was a sale item.  So far I&#x27;ve been charged over $160.00 for crappy nail polish and a lite that is very cheesy.  Looks like it&#x27;s something you pick up at the dollar store..&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my nails for over 40 years and the only drawback is that the manicure does not last more than one week and less if I do any housework.  The idea that this system would require only one step of polish was so promising but it did not live up to its promise.  The classic red polish goes on so sheer and the lamp only accomodates 4 fingers at a time.  If you put too much polish on one digit, it runs.  Bottom line, if you want nice coverage, you will need at least 3 or 4 coats and a lot of free time.  Between the amount of time curing the polish under the lamp after each coat, applying the multiple coats and then reapplying polish after it comes off when you use the cleansing wipe, it&#x27;s just not worth all the time and effort.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this for Christmas... She bought about 20 different colors for it too directly from the haute nails website. They are AWEFUL, when she got the package in the mail, they didn&#x27;t even send about 5 of the colors she ordered, she had to call and they sent them eventually.  It says the product evens itself out and it does not do that at ALL! It&#x27;s so streaky and is not attractive either. It&#x27;s also really sheer like everyone else says. It is such a waste of money. Seriously DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> First off I have the \\&quot;sensationail\\&quot; system and love it. So since I already had the light and I saw the infomercial and I loved the colors, I thought I&#x27;d give this polish a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frist off the colors weren&#x27;t as shown n the site not even close. But sometimes it has to dry first so I gave it ago. The polish itself was really thick, not dried out thick, but thick. It was hard to spread on my nails neatly and it looks like a 5 yo did. Even after I cleaned it up. The color was translucent took 4 coats where it was remotely dark enough and you can still see nail through it. 4 coats meant quadruple the time on both hands. I was so excited when I saw the colors cause sensationail is all deep metallics and these colors were fun. But the color betrayal holds true to it&#x27;s name because you feel betrayed and the fun shade of blue called \\&quot;paradise\\&quot; was green and not even a pretty one.  Price wouldn&#x27;t be bad had I not needed 4-5 coats to make it look good. So the only good thing was it was thick on my nails as if I had gotten a gel set, it hasn&#x27;t chipped as of yet but it&#x27;s only been a day and I&#x27;m not sure just how easy it will come off. Lets just say I&#x27;m glad I bout it here for cheaper than the site with free shipping. And since I work  12 hr mids on an assembly line and I&#x27;m not too worried how my nails look as long as they don&#x27;t break, if it holds up without chipping I probably won&#x27;t take the time to send it back.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!  The company sucks!  They sign you up for automatic shipments &amp; charge your credit card without you knowing and then don&#x27;t cancel it when you call to complain. Polish sucks- it&#x27;s too translucent. Takes 3-4 coats just to NOT see through your nail and then it&#x27;s too thick and breaks off.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it has all of the problems that you all have said so I bought the Sensational kit and it is great but( Honestly after buying this kit I discovered  an easier way.  Use any polish, it does not have to be gel  because I used OPI or Mirage cotton candy just to have a tint of color and buy ROCK base and top coat (I got it from Sally&#x27;s and I think amazon has it as well), apply 1 base coat, a polish,  maybe 2 coats of whatever color you choose and while still wet apply Rock&#x27;s top coat and sit under UV lamp.  My nails dried instantly and you don&#x27;t need gel wipes just use alcohol to wipe (because  in reality that is what your wipes in the kits are made of) and my nails lasted almost a month  so give it a try. I was amazed. Good Luck</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a retail store. It appealed to me because you don&#x27;t have to bother with the base and top coats. I used it with a high quality UV lamp, and had great results. Here are my tips for getting this sometimes frustrating polish, to work to its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Warm up the polish in your hands, or set it in front of a heater for a little while. This will help it be a little more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. STIR the polish with a long cuticle stick. It seems to separate when it sits for long periods of time. Stirring the product really well before use helps it to regain its structure which will give you a deeper color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Dehydrate your nails!! This is very important, as it is what helps the polish adhere to your nail plate. If you think you&#x27;re ready to go, I would suggest holding the swab on for 10 MORE seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply thin coats. You&#x27;re going to need about 3 coats, so you want them to be thin, or they&#x27;ll just peel off after a little bit of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cured each coat in my UV lamp for about 120 seconds which was plenty long. Don&#x27;t wipe with your alcohol swab until you are completely done painting and curing. Good Luck!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish never dry, i dont know what to do?</li>
            <li> The Polish is fine but the whole 14 day for 14.95 trial is very miss leading let alone you pay 14.95 for that then they proceed to take 33$ for the next 3 month for the two light s that is the part that is ridiculous. Save your $$</li>
            <li> I bought this polish because I thought a one coat polish would save time, but as other reviewers have indicated, it takes at least four coats before the color looks anything like it is supposed to.  I quit after four coats because it still looked blotchy and uneven.  I finally put regular nail polish in a similar color over the nails.  I called to complain.  The customer service woman was very nice, but said they could not take nail polish back.  They are sending a replacement color, but I don&#x27;t see how it is likely to work any better.</li>
            <li> This product is very deceiving; the color does not nearly look as it does in bottle when applied to nails even after 5 coats.  I purchased a kit from QVC with lighter colors that also sucked, even though I followed the instructions every step of the way.  I tried the lighter shades several times and thought that the darker shade of classic red would work better - NOT!!!  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was the worst polish created. The manufacturer is fraudulent and not easy to deal with.  Dont buy anything from this manufacturer!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product i ever bought! Very unhappy with the results. Not true to the color, nor does it last two weeks. Lasted a day before it started to peel. I followed the directions. This product is bogus! Save your money!</li>
            <li> Just received my haute polish light kit at a cost of $14.95 but now find I am to pay an additional $33 a month for three months.  Nowhere in the terms and conditions did I see anything about this additional cost.  Also, in order to return the items I need to call customer service and get an RA#.  Without that RA# the package will not be accepted and I will still need to pay the monthly fees.  I should have followed the age old advice of &amp;#34;if it sounds too good to be true . . . &amp;#34;  Never again!</li>
            <li> I just got my kit and I love it! It is a decent product, with the right expectations. I have no idea what people are talking about in terms of drying time, it only takes 60 secs to dry people! What&#x27;s the big deal? Still drys way faster and lasts longer then regular nail polish. Remember, gel nail polishes are chip resistant not chip proof.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that freaking annoying talking instructions led light, it should be a way to completely turn it off.</li>
            <li> the polish is sooo thin. 4 coats of red and I still see through to my nails.  I ended up putting china glaze red on top and then a clear coat of gel polish from another company and cured it under the light. I does last without chipping one week in a factory. I will continue to combine it with other polish to get color saturation.</li>
            <li> As a professional in this industry I will not buy this.. But I wanted to address some of these reviews! There is some chemistry behind the working quality of this product.. It leaves behind a sticky residue when cured in the light called an Inhibition Layer.. It sounds like they provided wipes for this, but when you&#x27;re out of them, you only need 99% alcohol and a pad or cotton. It needs to be 99% so it is pure. The light is designed to cure for 1 minute so you don&#x27;t overcure each layer. DO NOT remove the sticky layer until you are completely finished!! It may be sheer and require more layers for your taste in the final color. Do NOT apply any single layer thickly or it will NOT cure correctly. You can apply many layers but all must be THIN to achieve proper cure.</li>
