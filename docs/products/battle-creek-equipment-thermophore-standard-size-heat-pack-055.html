            <li>From your tailbone right up to the top of your neck, (unless you are 6&#x27;8\\&quot;!)</li>
            <li>This wet heating pad, is perfect for all my body parts!</li>
            <li>I DO NOT Recommend this heating pad -- the flimsy switch breaks too easily</li>
            <li>She was very happy that I could find the same item and is satisfied with the new one.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one since the original and we look forward to enjoying it for many years.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the heat pack for several years and think it is great.</li>
            <li>you are comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>, how did the package arrive, and told me that if any problems they will gladly replace it, that was the first time anyone other than Amazon contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It appears to be identical to the original and works just as well.</li>
            <li>In both cases I return for a full refund from, If they could resolved that issue, I would purchase it again..</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also wanted to say that I&#x27;ve purchased hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on Amazon and the seller</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to find it here on Amazon and have been so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled to get this replacement &amp; even more thrilled that it cost less than the previous one.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it frequently for help in recovering from workouts (although I also use ice just as much).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product which I use constantly for back discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the Thermofore heating pad 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE CORD SEEMS TO GET TANGLED UP ON MOST THE UNITS...</li>
            <li>I was given my heating pad by my surgeon after my first surgery.  </li>
            <li>This will be the first heating pad that I had to purchase.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be an upgrade and the trigger control has lasted longer than the first one I had.</li>
            <li>You will find them in most medical supply stores.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the great part about it is the controller.</li>
            <li>So yes it is worth EVERY penny and the amount of heat, the coverage on my back due to its size, and the longevity of its life span is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;deadman switch\\&quot; is so handy since you have to hold it down with your thumb in order for it to heat up and</li>
            <li>The Thermophore heating pad was quick was fast and quick acting.  </li>
            <li>The model with an automatic switch turns off the heat after a certain period of time</li>
            <li>I really like the PAD</li>
            <li>I have fusions at the L-5 and S-1 now and getting ready to have another fusion at my L-4.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace another which eventually wore out from so much use.</li>
            <li>We like ours so much that when our old one died, we immediately went to Amazon to search for another one exactly like it.  </li>
            <li>we had looked in local stores only to find it online for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like this model with the manual switch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like an older version that I had for</li>
            <li>she had paid much more for it at a local medical supply shop.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else delivers high moist heat like the thermophore.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the temperature goes as high as on the manual ones.  </li>
            <li>If you are in need of moist heat at a high temperature, the thermophore should do the trick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It took my back  pain away right away.  </li>
            <li>i had \\&quot;inherited\\&quot; the same heating pad many years ago and when it recently gave out my husband was disappointed as he had used it for many years for many ailments and because of it being so large and having the \\&quot;deadman switch\\</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on heating pads that only get warm.  </li>
            <li>No mess, just play and play!</li>
            <li>You can have as little heat or as much high heat as you want as you hold the switch on to heat, release to cool off.  </li>
            <li>Its large enough to cover your body wherever you need it.</li>
            <li>It really helps my aching back!  </li>
            <li>so you control how hot it gets and for how long.  </li>
            <li>Product is for use by professional therapists, bit wAs not advertised as such&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>old MIL.  </li>
            <li>If you want heat for only as long as you are willing to hold the \\&quot;on button\\&quot; in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, this may be a decent heating pad.</li>
            <li>BUT SMALL TROUBLE FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>it is reason enough to steer far clear of this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to cover the area that needs the deep moist heat.</li>
            <li>so I sacrificed mine and left it with him and ordered a new one for me.&lt;br /&gt;etc, etc., etc.</li>
            <li>Worked good for the first few days and then started going on and off and now after about 8-10 uses has totally failed.</li>
            <li>My old one finally broke so</li>
            <li>I have had to have 2 back surgeries so far because</li>
            <li>I live with this heating pad on my back every day for several hours a day.  </li>
            <li>We purchased an earlier model about 20 years ago and it just recently  stopped working prompting us to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>It may seem annoying that you have to hold the switch down, but it is a great safety feature because the pad does get very, very hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is different that the one I had before is that the new one is longer( no complaints about that) and that the switch looks a bit different that the other one other that that it functions and looks exactly like my old one.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one will last me just as long as my old one.</li>

            <li> Duct tape worked for only so long.</li>
            <li> so I can control how long the heat stays on.</li>
            <li> I can not believe it lasted this long with all the use it has been through.  </li>
            <li> This heating pad lasted me almost 13 years and with hours of use every single day</li>
            <li> It was only 1mm away from severing my spinal cord and would have paralyzed me from the waist down.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have health insurance and had to wait 4 months for my first surgery and 6 months for my second</li>
            <li> I had one of these heating pads previously and it last 18 years.  </li>
            <li> use my thermophone to lay on when my back tries to spasm... about a half hour</li>
            <li> I was extremely heartbroken when the switch went out and did not know if the company still made heating pads.</li>
            <li> wish i ordered the other one with 20 minute switch.</li>
            <li> My wife, for whom I bought this heating pad, and I would have given it a 1, but did not use it long enough to determine if it was really that bad.</li>
            <li> YOU must press the lever down to maintain the heat,  </li>
            <li> We like the ones that require holding down the control</li>
            <li> Hold down button for heat</li>
            <li> Moist heat at the push of a button without the mess.  </li>
            <li> This heating pad is fairly heavy</li>
            <li> It is heavy and cumbersome to use at home.</li>
            <li> She sleeps on this every night &amp; it helps her deal with her back pain as well as her tendency to be cold.  </li>
            <li> recently one of us had a very bad back problem.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with a bad back--I have scoliosis--this is essential equipment.  </li>
            <li> For a bad back, it is a must.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not great, so you can&#x27;t automatically just turn on and it stay on..  </li>
            <li> I used the pad on my work chair to apply heat off and on throughout the work day to alleviate my back pain and because of the switch mechanisms, I had to hold it on under my leg which eventually broke -- TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW in my opinion and the fact that the manufacture will not stand behind</li>
            <li> I was in a very bad car accident in 2003.  </li>

            <li> I really like the PAD, it has a nice feel to it and did the job while it lasted!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I purchase two of these pads with in a year. Each time the switch would malfunction, this has a switch that you need to hold or apply pressure to keep heat coming that&#x27;s not great, so you can&#x27;t automatically just turn on and it stay on..  YOU must press the lever down to maintain the heat,  In both cases I return for a full refund from, If they could resolved that issue, I would purchase it again..</li>
            <li> THIS THERMOPHORE IS THE BEST PRODUCT EVER... Its large enough to cover your body wherever you need it. Made in the USA  A must have product.....</li>
            <li> MY HEATING PAD WORKS PERFECTLY AND WAS SOLD TO ME AT A FAIR PRICE.  I APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS SENT IN A TIMELY FASHION.</li>
            <li> For anyone with a bad back--I have scoliosis--this is essential equipment.  From your tailbone right up to the top of your neck, (unless you are 6&#x27;8\\&quot;!) this is the perfect item to have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on heating pads that only get warm.  To recover an injury, you need heat and this pad delivers.  I love it and use it frequently for help in recovering from workouts (although I also use ice just as much).  My parents had a pad just like this (I think it was the same company) and we used it for years growing up.  This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best heating pad I have ever owned.  We like ours so much that when our old one died, we immediately went to Amazon to search for another one exactly like it.  Our daughter just recently needed a heating pad and asked us where we got ours and I said, \\&quot;Amazon.com!\\&quot;  She was thrilled it was so easy to order one just like ours.  She is very happy with her pad too.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the Thermofore heating pad 20 years ago.  I have bought or encouraged others to purchase a Thermofore.  My old one finally broke so I immediately replaced it.  I love the way it heats up taking moisture from the air.  It really helps my aching back!  I even like the switch that you have to hold for the Thermofore to heat up so you control how hot it gets and for how long.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Love the thermophore.  Been using them for over twenty years.  Nothing else delivers high moist heat like the thermophore.  I particularly like this model with the manual switch so I can control how long the heat stays on. The model with an automatic switch turns off the heat after a certain period of time and I don&#x27;t think the temperature goes as high as on the manual ones.  If you are in need of moist heat at a high temperature, the thermophore should do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have owned Thermophore heating pads since 1966 when I destroyed my knee.  Over the years I have replaced this heating pad, but when our house burned I forgot about it.  At my house we have back and knee problems and recently one of us had a very bad back problem.  It was then I realized we had no Thermophore!  I ordered this one and one of my children found another on Craigslist.  Ahhhhh, now we each have our own.  You can have as little heat or as much high heat as you want as you hold the switch on to heat, release to cool off.  It is the best.  Draws moisture from the air (no water needed) so you have that wonderful moist heat. This heating pad is fairly heavy so it stays in place which makes it better still.</li>
            <li> Came recommended by a friend who loaned us her heating pad and ended up buying one for husband who has back problems.  It may seem annoying that you have to hold the switch down, but it is a great safety feature because the pad does get very, very hot.</li>
            <li> Worked good for the first few days and then started going on and off and now after about 8-10 uses has totally failed. While working it was wonderful and will eventually replace it.</li>
            <li> THESE HEAT PACKS FROM BATTLE CREEK EQUIPMENT ARE THE BEST EVER. I HAVE A MASSAGE THERAPY BUSINESS AND I USE THESE ALL THE TIME WITH MY CLIENTS. THEY LAST FOREVER AND GIVE WONDERFUL HEAT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE CORD SEEMS TO GET TANGLED UP ON MOST THE UNITS...BUT SMALL TROUBLE FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT..BUY THESE ..THE BEST!</li>
            <li> i had \\&quot;inherited\\&quot; the same heating pad many years ago and when it recently gave out my husband was disappointed as he had used it for many years for many ailments and because of it being so large and having the \\&quot;deadman switch\\&quot; it was his \\&quot;go to\\&quot; solution for all his aches and pains.  we had looked in local stores only to find it online for a much more reasonable price.  The \\&quot;deadman switch\\&quot; is so handy since you have to hold it down with your thumb in order for it to heat up and if by chance you fall asleep it will automatically shut off as opposed to having the possibility of it burning the skin..........i have recommended this to many, many people!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS HEATING PAD!!!  I was in a very bad car accident in 2003.  I have had to have 2 back surgeries so far because my L-5, S-1 almost severed my spinal cord.  It was only 1mm away from severing my spinal cord and would have paralyzed me from the waist down.  My accident was in 6/2003 and my 2 back surgeries was in 10/2003 and 12/2003.  I have fusions at the L-5 and S-1 now and getting ready to have another fusion at my L-4.  Unfortunately I did not have health insurance and had to wait 4 months for my first surgery and 6 months for my second this caused me to have permanent and irreversible nerve damage in my lower back and legs.  I was given my heating pad by my surgeon after my first surgery.  I live with this heating pad on my back every day for several hours a day.  This will be the first heating pad that I had to purchase.  This heating pad lasted me almost 13 years and with hours of use every single day I can not complain.  I can not believe it lasted this long with all the use it has been through.  So yes it is worth EVERY penny and the amount of heat, the coverage on my back due to its size, and the longevity of its life span is remarkable.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product is for use by professional therapists, bit wAs not advertised as such&lt;br /&gt;. It is heavy and cumbersome to use at home.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. I&#x27;m on my second one. Second only because I stepped on the controller. Duct tape worked for only so long. Seriously, the great part about it is the controller. You control the heat. Heat when you want it.</li>
            <li> My son kept &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; my husbands thermophore... so I got one for my son for X-mas... Perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;I use my thermophone to lay on when my back tries to spasm... about a half hour and my back relaxes and I can work again.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is nice to cuddle with on a cold night and drift off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I left one with a friend I was visiting in NM... he loved it so I sacrificed mine and left it with him and ordered a new one for me.&lt;br /&gt;etc, etc., etc.</li>
            <li> We received a Thermophore Heating Pad as a wedding gift 37 years ago and loved it.  This is the first one since the original and we look forward to enjoying it for many years.</li>
            <li> The Thermophore Heat Pack 055 is an amazing product! We purchased an earlier model about 20 years ago and it just recently  stopped working prompting us to purchase a new one. That&#x27;s great value! I would recommend this product to anyone needing a moist heat therapy.</li>
            <li> The Thermophore heating pad was quick was fast and quick acting.  It took my back  pain away right away.  I love the length of this item as well.</li>
            <li> Works well but rather &amp;#34;oversize.&amp;#34; Should have searched for a smaller model as I only needed to place on my knee following surgery.</li>
            <li> very happy with the product</li>
            <li> This is a great product which I use constantly for back discomfort.  The trigger feature is wonderful because if I fall asleep using the heat pack (and it does get very hot), there is no danger of burning.  I bought this to replace another which eventually wore out from so much use. This seems to be an upgrade and the trigger control has lasted longer than the first one I had. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT Recommend this heating pad -- the flimsy switch breaks too easily and you&#x27;re out $80!! When I tried to call and get a refund, they told me that the manufacture does not cover it if you break the switch, which is bogus to me!  I used the pad on my work chair to apply heat off and on throughout the work day to alleviate my back pain and because of the switch mechanisms, I had to hold it on under my leg which eventually broke -- TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW in my opinion and the fact that the manufacture will not stand behind it is reason enough to steer far clear of this product!!</li>
            <li> The best I have ever owned so far.</li>
            <li> For a bad back, it is a must.  We like the ones that require holding down the control so if you drift off to sleep, the unit automatically goes off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the heat pack for several years and think it is great. I just purchased a second for my grandaughter to use.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this heating pad after the switch on my heating pad stopped functioning properly. That heating pad was given to me by my mother whom stated that it was purchased before I was born (26 years ago). I was extremely heartbroken when the switch went out and did not know if the company still made heating pads. I was lucky enough to find it here on Amazon and have been so pleased with the product. The only thing that is different that the one I had before is that the new one is longer( no complaints about that) and that the switch looks a bit different that the other one other that that it functions and looks exactly like my old one. Hopefully this one will last me just as long as my old one. Also wanted to say that I&#x27;ve purchased hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on Amazon and the seller actually sent me emails asking me how well the product works, how did the package arrive, and told me that if any problems they will gladly replace it, that was the first time anyone other than Amazon contacted me to make sure I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like an older version that I had for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Use all the time, it&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife, for whom I bought this heating pad, and I would have given it a 1, but did not use it long enough to determine if it was really that bad. If you want heat for only as long as you are willing to hold the \\&quot;on button\\&quot; in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, this may be a decent heating pad. If you have a youngster who will sit around and hold the button in the on position, you may want to give it a try, but only if you want to futz around with returning it eventually.</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the request of my 93 yr. old MIL.  She had one prior that finally broke - she had paid much more for it at a local medical supply shop.  She sleeps on this every night &amp; it helps her deal with her back pain as well as her tendency to be cold.  She was thrilled to get this replacement &amp; even more thrilled that it cost less than the previous one.</li>
            <li> I had one of these heating pads previously and it last 18 years.  It&#x27;s large enough to cover the area that needs the deep moist heat.</li>
            <li> Heating pad gathers moisture from the air and is a moist heat.  Hold down button for heat allows you to heat to whatever warmth you are comfortable with.  Best heating pad I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It gives out very good heat but i have to keep holding the switch.&lt;br /&gt;I wish i ordered the other one with 20 minute switch.</li>
            <li> Great heating pad .Heats up fast</li>
            <li> This product was ordered to replace the one my mother purchased in 1984.  She was very happy that I could find the same item and is satisfied with the new one.  It appears to be identical to the original and works just as well.</li>
            <li> This wet heating pad, is perfect for all my body parts! My husband has been using it, for his back, and I am tempted to buy another!</li>
            <li> If you have a regular need for a heating pad, don&#x27;t look at the price.  Moist heat at the push of a button without the mess.  I have lived with one of these on a daily basis since 1982 and won&#x27;t look at another heating pad.  You will not find these in pharmacies.  You will find them in most medical supply stores.</li>
            <li> No issue with it.  Works like it&#x27;s supposed to!  Will recommend to others &amp; buy again for my clinics.  No mess, just play and play!</li>
