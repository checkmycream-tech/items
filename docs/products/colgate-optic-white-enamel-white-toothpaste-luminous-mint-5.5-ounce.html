            <li>I love this toothpaste it whitens my teeth very well</li>
            <li>Since then, they came out with Cool Mild Mint.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a good daily toothpaste.  </li>

            <li>I saw the difference since the first use!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t eat, drink, can&#x27;t even talk or smile it seems...</li>
            <li>I only buy this kind of toothpaste now.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be effective at keeping my teeth white.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been to a big box discount store many times trying to find my new favorite toothpaste - they have been sold out.  </li>
            <li>I see many people have no bad effects with optic white</li>
            <li>Gets your teeth very clean, white and makes your mouth feel really fresh.</li>
            <li>the pain is too much!  </li>
            <li>but I alternate between that and others that have more whitening power.</li>
            <li>and at first thought my mouth was irritated from that).</li>
            <li>That is now my first choice in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing tickles my fancy about toothpaste i guess, but it does its job and the flavor isn&#x27;t too harsh, so its good.</li>
            <li>I drink red wine and coffee and it did make them very clean</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle paste that will give me movie star looking teeth but it effectively removes tea and other stains from the surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li>, salt tastes pretty much like nothing.</li>
            <li>Colgate Optic White Enamel Toothpaste is fresh tasting and leaves my teeth looking clean and whiter.</li>
            <li>That healed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent dry mouth, and I lost most of my sense of taste.</li>
            <li>It really does whiten.    </li>
            <li>I have all modern applicance for my teeth and thought this would be making a difference in the whiteness.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste really does help to whiten my tea stained teeth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy it very often because it&#x27;s quite pricey</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than at the drug store.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really do feel like it makes my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally released in Sparkling Mint, Optic White had a very powerful mint taste.</li>
            <li>I can no longer use any commercial toothpaste, and I just brush with water or special mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It felt like my entire mouth was full of cavities everywhere at the root,</li>
            <li>Will make sure to be careful with my sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips and Rembrandt, and this works as well as the others, without the cost, and with a much better flavor (regular mint, like a normal toothpaste).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you all to try it.</li>
            <li>This is one product true to whiteming your teeth , as I am a smoker and drink coffee and after I began using this tooth paste a huge difference in my teeth , at least 3 shades whiter ........</li>
            <li>I just want to feel normal again.  </li>
            <li>In dental care, I solidly believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</li>
            <li>I got the mouth wash and a new Sonicare toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>maybe it made my teeth sensitive or something?  </li>
            <li>but I guess some of us are sensitive to it and should avoid it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to feel very depressed--you don&#x27;t know how much pleasure and comfort the simple process of eating gives you until you lose that pleasure and comfort.</li>
            <li>It has reinvigorated my teeth brushing routine completely.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for 6 months so far.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who is serious about having a healthy mouth and who uses a whitening product.  </li>
            <li>, recently, have been using the new Enamel Luminous Mint.</li>
            <li>I generally go with Sensodyne</li>
            <li>I bought this only for the whitening action.  </li>
            <li>I never had sensitive teeth before this optic white of hell!</li>
            <li>My teeth got super white and pretty, but unfortunately now I have a piece of gum that has worn away from my entire tooth.</li>

            <li> so I do have to be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give it another try because my teeth feel clean after using it, but it does taste a little weird compared to other tooth pastes.</li>

            <li> I wish I had never set eyes on this toothpaste, as do the hundreds of people who have left negative reviews online</li>
            <li> I tried other whitening toothpastes before my dentist recommended Colgate Optic White, and while i did see a small improvement from the other toothpastes, nothing was as dramatic as Colgate Optic White.</li>
            <li> (typically those anti-bacterial/gingivitis chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with a dry-mouth condition that makes eating even mildly spicy food extremely painful, and I have reactions to acidic foods like vinegar or tomatoes.</li>
            <li> and they seems to be a little whiter.</li>
            <li> After three or four days the pain was less, but I developed a painful sore in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I sometimes find it a little irritating, so I tend to use it only in the morning before my coffee (seems to help the whitening to brush before morning coffee).</li>
            <li> He used it everyday with no improvement.  </li>
            <li> Then, after a few days of use, I go and buy myself an ice cream...</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks, the stains were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using that for the past year or so.</li>
            <li> No more wasting time and</li>
            <li> I used it for four days twice a day before I realized that it was the cause of my entire mouth and throat hurting (I also had a cold and was using cough drops/zinc,</li>
            <li> It was that bad...</li>
            <li> wondering what is wrong with my teeth!!!  </li>
            <li> and then the worst pain in my life starts...</li>

            <li> One of my favorites.  It really does whiten.    I&#x27;ll admit that I sometimes find it a little irritating, so I tend to use it only in the morning before my coffee (seems to help the whitening to brush before morning coffee).</li>
            <li> I always use the Optic White Toothpaste. It&#x27;s very good. Smooth and comfortable. Highly recommend you all to try it.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used--saw results in 3 days.</li>
            <li> mouth feels good after use. good $$$</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has yellow teeth from drinking coffee.  I bought this only for the whitening action.  We did not see any improvement in the whiteness of his teeth.  He used it everyday with no improvement.  Other than that, he said the taste and texture was fine.</li>
            <li> Love this brand and have seen great reviews from other people as well. Always used Colgate and have always been happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give it another try because my teeth feel clean after using it, but it does taste a little weird compared to other tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste recently...  I liked the whitening...Then, after a few days of use, I go and buy myself an ice cream...and then the worst pain in my life starts...I was in hell!!!  It felt like my entire mouth was full of cavities everywhere at the root, the nerve...  The pain was agonizing and went on hours!  I wanted to go to the dentist or the freaking hospital!!!  It was that bad...but I told myself to wait until tomorrow.  I managed to sleep with pain killers and a sleep aid!!!  The next day, I use the tooth paste again(grrr) and the pain returns...same agony.  I am at a loss...wondering what is wrong with my teeth!!!  I can&#x27;t eat, drink, can&#x27;t even talk or smile it seems...the pain is too much!  Then, I connect the dots...change of toothpaste...maybe it made my teeth sensitive or something?  Well, I threw away the toothpaste for good.  I&#x27;m using sensodyne now...I never had sensitive teeth before this optic white of hell! I see many people have no bad effects with optic white but I guess some of us are sensitive to it and should avoid it.  I know I will...  My teeth are ok now thank God...</li>
            <li> I have all modern applicance for my teeth and thought this would be making a difference in the whiteness. I drink red wine and coffee and it did make them very clean but I cannot say actually brighter</li>
            <li> This toothpaste really does help to whiten my tea stained teeth but it is quite pricey. I have sensitive teeth so I do have to be careful which toothpastes I use. I generally go with Sensodyne but I alternate between that and others that have more whitening power. Colgate Optic White Enamel Toothpaste is fresh tasting and leaves my teeth looking clean and whiter. It isn&#x27;t a miracle paste that will give me movie star looking teeth but it effectively removes tea and other stains from the surface of my teeth. I follow up with the brand&#x27;s whitening rinse and the two work well for me. I use activated charcoal as well for extra whiteness but this paste alone keeps dingy teeth at bay. I don&#x27;t buy it very often because it&#x27;s quite pricey but I have been using it on and off for a couple of years and like the results I get.</li>
            <li> saw an ad for this toothpaste at my dentist thought I would try it out and its real good. since i have braces on I can only use toothpaste and i let it sits for a bit on my teeth and they seems to be a little whiter. I would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for cavity prevention and maintaining a polished smile.  I recommend it for anyone who is serious about having a healthy mouth and who uses a whitening product.  This product truly seems to be a cavity preventative toothpaste; however, I brush faithfully three times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips and Rembrandt, and this works as well as the others, without the cost, and with a much better flavor (regular mint, like a normal toothpaste). I only buy this kind of toothpaste now.</li>
            <li> This is one product true to whiteming your teeth , as I am a smoker and drink coffee and after I began using this tooth paste a huge difference in my teeth , at least 3 shades whiter ........</li>
            <li> My teeth got super white and pretty, but unfortunately now I have a piece of gum that has worn away from my entire tooth. Will make sure to be careful with my sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> This is already my favorite product, but then I found out I could get it so much cheaper and even have it specially ordered to come every month, I fell in love! Absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> I like that it &amp;#34;foams-up&amp;#34; easily.  Taste is fine. Not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a good daily toothpaste.  Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I see whiter teeth already and I am a coffee drinker!  It has a great taste and my teeth feel cleaner, longer.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. Gets your teeth very clean, white and makes your mouth feel really fresh. Much cheaper than at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Seems to whiten well.  I got a really good deal on it with subscribe and save, don&#x27;t know if I&amp;#34;d spend extra on it if not.</li>
            <li> Nothing tickles my fancy about toothpaste i guess, but it does its job and the flavor isn&#x27;t too harsh, so its good.</li>
            <li> can tell too difference from any other tooth paste</li>
            <li> I wish I had never set eyes on this toothpaste, as do the hundreds of people who have left negative reviews online (google it!). I used it for four days twice a day before I realized that it was the cause of my entire mouth and throat hurting (I also had a cold and was using cough drops/zinc, and at first thought my mouth was irritated from that). It was like burning the roof of your mouth on pizza, but my entire mouth, even under my tongue. After three or four days the pain was less, but I developed a painful sore in the back of my throat. That healed, but I&#x27;ve had persistent dry mouth, and I lost most of my sense of taste. It&#x27;s been 2.5 weeks since I stopped using the toothpaste and sugar tastes like salt, salt tastes pretty much like nothing. I&#x27;m starting to feel very depressed--you don&#x27;t know how much pleasure and comfort the simple process of eating gives you until you lose that pleasure and comfort. I have no idea why this product is still on the market or why there hasn&#x27;t been a class-action suit about the damage it has done. I want my sense of taste back!! I just want to feel normal again.  UPDATE TO REVIEW: It&#x27;s a year later, and I have gone through three bouts of mouth pain and near-complete loss of taste that lasted 2-3 months each. I can no longer use any commercial toothpaste, and I just brush with water or special mouthwash. I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with a dry-mouth condition that makes eating even mildly spicy food extremely painful, and I have reactions to acidic foods like vinegar or tomatoes. I wish I&#x27;d never set eyes on this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference since the first use! Now, you might think this is just all subjective, but whatever it is, it made my son&#x27;s theeth look whiter. I drink a lot of coke and it tends to make my theeth yellow, by Optic White has helped me keep them clean.</li>
            <li> It works very well. I got the mouth wash and a new Sonicare toothbrush as well. It has reinvigorated my teeth brushing routine completely. My teeth are whiter, every thing is better.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve found it to be effective at keeping my teeth white.  I drink coffee every day but I&#x27;m always complimented on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I have been using Colgate Optic White toothpaste for the last few years. It is by far my favorite, with excellent cleaning and whitening results and which does not contain odd chemicals which dissolve my mouth (typically those anti-bacterial/gingivitis chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally released in Sparkling Mint, Optic White had a very powerful mint taste. Refreshing, but sometimes too minty to the point of almost burning your mouth, especially if you did something silly like accidentally bit your mouth. Since then, they came out with Cool Mild Mint. I have been using that for the past year or so. I like that better as it is not as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, recently, have been using the new Enamel Luminous Mint. That is the mildest of all three versions, but is still minty enough IMO. That is now my first choice in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Sonicare toothbrushes and try to really take good care of my teeth. In dental care, I solidly believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This toothpaste, Sonicare, and Crest 3D White rinse (along with flossing) are my twice-daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste is, quite possibly, the best whitening toothpaste out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were stained from drinking coffee and smoking. I tried other whitening toothpastes before my dentist recommended Colgate Optic White, and while i did see a small improvement from the other toothpastes, nothing was as dramatic as Colgate Optic White. In just a few weeks, the stains were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to solely use Colgate Optic White, and the stains have not come back, even though I am still a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> I have been to a big box discount store many times trying to find my new favorite toothpaste - they have been sold out.  I like its whitening properties and the fact that it is not really gritty like some brands.  No more wasting time and gas - Amazon.com Subscibe &amp; Save is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.  This toothpaste allows me to use a whitener without hurting my teeth.  I&#x27;m not certain how much it actually whitens, but it couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothpaste.  I really do feel like it makes my teeth whiter.  I notice the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  No need for teeth whitener, just use Optic White toothpaste.  Clean fresh taste too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for 6 months so far.  Very happy and pleased with my teeth color. The only issue was the vendor went up on the cost and it was removed for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste it whitens my teeth very well I use to use close up but like this a lot better now</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the way this product worked on my teeth</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Hope to get more...</li>
            <li> I think this whitens better than Crest whitening toothpastes.  It costs a bit more but worth it.  Worth the price.</li>
