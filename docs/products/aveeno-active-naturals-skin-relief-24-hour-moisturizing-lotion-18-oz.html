            <li>It has all the qualities of the best lotion you have ever wished for.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;cooling effect&#x27; feels great on the skin too!</li>
            <li>Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to deal with my face drying out during the day before I get home from work.  </li>
            <li>All Aveeno products are great.  </li>
            <li>so this works great</li>
            <li>Great Seller and a great product.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested to try some aveeno products, so I went and got a bottle of this, and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>great texture and nice smell.</li>
            <li>The difference in my skin is remarkable; friends and co-workers even comment on how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>It does work best right after toweling off.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Which, btw, made my hands feel amazing</li>
            <li>Honestly, this product is way too geasy for me, but it works for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>always good price overthere and love the design of it for body lotion.</li>
            <li>so I was super happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>When my hand got to this point, i would not be able to use any lotion - they would all just sting.</li>
            <li>We use it mornings and in the evening after bath time and can mostly keep them off prescription medications like Elidel and Elicon.</li>
            <li>(You always need SPF to have healthy skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, buy with confidence and smooth skin!</li>
            <li>i love this lotion but it leaves a sort of yellowish stain on my clothes even when i rub it in well and wait a while before dressing.  </li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion, particularly for eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li>I use it every day before bed, and I&#x27;m way more comfortable now.</li>
            <li>For example, I can turn door knobs just fine.</li>
            <li>he point they get so incredibly itchy and dry looking.</li>
            <li>The original product did not contain dimethicone which i don&#x27;t like using and it did contain derivatives of oatmeal which i liked very much.  </li>
            <li>Another positive for me is that this formula is fragrance free, and since I&#x27;ve always had a problem with reactions to fragrances (in lotions, detergents, etc...), it is nice to find a product that I don&#x27;t have to deal with that issue.  </li>
            <li>A bottle lasts me 4-5 months, and frankly, I feel like I&#x27;m worth spending the $35-$40 a year for softer, healthier, more comfortable skin.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>The picture and description provided looked like the original product.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t seem to really absorb well, but just disappear somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno: Definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I save money by just using it as a full body lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of products and they either wore off really quickly, got my skin \\&quot;addicted\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly and made my skin soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am willing to pimp this stuff out because I feel it is a great at moisturizing my dry skin without feeling oily or sticky afterwards...  </li>
            <li>My whole family, and in particular my two young boys, all have eczema and this works great to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>It would probably feel amazing on folks who are lucky enough to have normal hands. :)</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried many many lotions of all different brands.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m finishing this review, only 2 of my severest cuts are still burning a little, but the rest of my hands feel marvelous.  </li>
            <li>The bottle itself is aesthetically pleasing; the outside seems to be made of a soft rubber which feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li>B00005375C Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal, 8 oz]] is also a good lotion I use for my skin and when I got out.</li>
            <li>After searching for a suitable moisturizer for almost 1.5 years, trying more than 10 different brands and moisturizer, we finally found that Aveeno Moisturizer with Oatmeal Essence works for my husband.  </li>
            <li>So I got winter itch for the first time this year, and I had no idea</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance, save for a light, oatmeal like fragrance which is no doubt natural to the product.</li>
            <li>so for me, it&#x27;s really a God-send!  </li>
            <li>It is really creamy and feels so nice to put all over my body, not just on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This one felt a lot better, but it seemed kind of thin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is one of the few I&#x27;ve been able to find that keeps my mild eczema under control.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY lotions geared towards very dry skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; Spend a bit reasonably for something that works really well.</li>
            <li>but it was VERY oily and smelled...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My skin reacts well and can really feel the soothing effects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I cannot complain much.</li>
            <li>I like it for several unique reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit greasy but it absorbs quickly so that really doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>It does burn my cuts for some time after applying (still burning a little - but most lotions do)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Aveeno lotions (such as the calming cream &amp; the daily moisturizer) with less than spectaculor results, but this particular formula is just very good and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my old sun ruined skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and my skin has stopped itching, and it&#x27;s becoming smoother too.</li>
            <li>My arms especially would feel really hot because the lotion didn&#x27;t let my skin breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only get dry skin in the winter and this stuff is fantastic</li>
            <li>the only problem is the bottle runs out so fast because my wife who has VERY SENSITIVE skin uses it all the time.  </li>
            <li>However, it will feel like you have a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; of soft moisture.</li>
            <li>Almost like the feeling of soft rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve noticed that no-fragrance-added products seem to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to \\&quot;double A\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Few products help my skin especially in the winter, but this Aveeno product seems to help the most.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all over everyday, but I love it so much that is has actually replaced my daily facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I was searching a moisturing cream that will work for his eczema condition, I want to find something to replace the doctor precribled \\&quot;strong\\&quot; skin condi-cream, because I think it is not very good to apply strong cream all the time.    </li>
            <li>I have some itching problems (not as bad as Eczema), and it does a good job giving moisture without too much oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I could barely spread it over one arm or leg.  </li>
            <li>I actually like that it is still somewhat on the surface of my skin as I can continue to massage it into the severe dry skin, cracks etc., and really work it in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to move from using steroid creams every few days to weekly or less by using this lotion...</li>

            <li> Not only that it is moisturizing enough that will help his dry skin, it also stop his dry-itch, improving the skin condition day by day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a life time of extremely dry skin, especially around Fall or Winter.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days, not only was my skin no longer dry and flaky, but the itchiness was all gone.  </li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin, especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> On my shins it would look like my skin was \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; off into dry flakes and itched uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest annoyances of Diabetes is the dry skin that often comes with it.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I step out of the shower, I reach for the Aveeno Skin Relief, and give my face an all-over before blotting my face dry with a towel.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried Curel, St. Ives, and Aveeno lotions for extra dry skin (in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel: Made my skin feel trapped.  </li>
            <li> you are thinking about any of these brands or just need dry skin lotion and don&#x27;t know where to begin, choose Aveeno!</li>
            <li> very, very dry tot</li>
            <li> it dries dry and a little goes a long way for me.  </li>
            <li> what was wrong with my skin at first.</li>
            <li> Also, its not greasy like other 24 hrs lotions.</li>
            <li> So, i&#x27;ve moved on to other products.  </li>
            <li> And as the label says, it does indeed relieve itchy skin.... even without stigning or irritating cracked and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For years, I suffered dry itchy skin, never able to find relief from any product.  </li>
            <li> He proof that Aveeno works for him after half a bottle and his Eczema scars is also going away after using 2 bottles.    </li>
            <li> I was at my friends house once, and my hand was hurting from the dryness so bad, that I decided the sting of any lotion would be worth it.</li>
            <li> My guess is that they are reviewing the wrong product as its consistency is like greek yogurt.</li>
            <li> Not sure where the one reviewer got the idea that this lotion is greasy or menthol--</li>
            <li> It does leave a slick feeling but it penetrates and does help.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin softer, it just left an unpleasant greasiness feeling to my skin that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> I was waking up in the middle of the night scratching my legs and arms uncontrollably - it was that bad.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> It gets so bad that I would crack and bleed and get persistent \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; looking skin between the webbing of my hands.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it gets so bad that you start to see cracks in my skin and</li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> The menthol feeling was really annoying, I don&#x27;t want my skin feeling</li>
            <li> Very painful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> All Aveeno products are great.  It has really helped my old sun ruined skin.</li>
            <li> So I got winter itch for the first time this year, and I had no idea what was wrong with my skin at first. I was waking up in the middle of the night scratching my legs and arms uncontrollably - it was that bad. I tried using my regular vaseline lotion with petroleum jelly and  hydrocortisone (to no avail). A friend suggested to try some aveeno products, so I went and got a bottle of this, and it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and my skin has stopped itching, and it&#x27;s becoming smoother too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many many lotions of all different brands. This is by far the best. It has all the qualities of the best lotion you have ever wished for. Yes... its that amazing.(I even use it as a facial lotion) This is the only lotion i have ever used that actually lasts 24 hrs. I apply it every day after a shower and when i take a shower 24 hrs later, i can still feel the lotion on my skin. Also, its not greasy like other 24 hrs lotions. It is a tiny bit greasy but it absorbs quickly so that really doesnt bother me. And as the label says, it does indeed relieve itchy skin.... even without stigning or irritating cracked and sensitive skin. Thank goodness for a lotion that finally works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a life time of extremely dry skin, especially around Fall or Winter. It gets so bad that I would crack and bleed and get persistent \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; looking skin between the webbing of my hands. On my shins it would look like my skin was \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; off into dry flakes and itched uncontrollably. I tried a lot of products and they either wore off really quickly, got my skin \\&quot;addicted\\&quot; so it was constantly needing lotion or stained my clothes. I just got this and it has worked wonders! I like it for several unique reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t know why several reviewers say this product is greasy. My guess is that they are reviewing the wrong product as its consistency is like greek yogurt. After you work it in, your skin will not leave a greasy residue. For example, I can turn door knobs just fine. However, it will feel like you have a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; of soft moisture. Almost like the feeling of soft rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no fragrance, save for a light, oatmeal like fragrance which is no doubt natural to the product. I do not have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve noticed that no-fragrance-added products seem to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The moisture LASTS. You feel like you&#x27;ve just put lotion on even after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle itself is aesthetically pleasing; the outside seems to be made of a soft rubber which feels good to the touch. The spout itself twists to lock and \\&quot;close\\&quot; so you can carry it with you without it squeezing dollops in your bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy bargain lotions cause \\&quot;it worked for mom.\\&quot; Spend a bit reasonably for something that works really well. Try this.</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the few I&#x27;ve been able to find that keeps my mild eczema under control. It contains Allantoin (sp?)--something that seems to keep my eczema at bay (as does Jergens Ultra Healing, but doesn&#x27;t have the perfumey smells of Jergens...which gave me allergies...) so I was super happy to find this product. I&#x27;ve been able to move from using steroid creams every few days to weekly or less by using this lotion... so for me, it&#x27;s really a God-send!  The &#x27;cooling effect&#x27; feels great on the skin too!</li>
            <li> I was searching a moisturing cream that will work for his eczema condition, I want to find something to replace the doctor precribled \\&quot;strong\\&quot; skin condi-cream, because I think it is not very good to apply strong cream all the time.    After searching for a suitable moisturizer for almost 1.5 years, trying more than 10 different brands and moisturizer, we finally found that Aveeno Moisturizer with Oatmeal Essence works for my husband.  Not only that it is moisturizing enough that will help his dry skin, it also stop his dry-itch, improving the skin condition day by day.  He proof that Aveeno works for him after half a bottle and his Eczema scars is also going away after using 2 bottles.    Honestly, this product is way too geasy for me, but it works for my husband.  Thanks to \\&quot;double A\\&quot;... Amazon and Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I recently tried Curel, St. Ives, and Aveeno lotions for extra dry skin (in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel: Made my skin feel trapped.  My arms especially would feel really hot because the lotion didn&#x27;t let my skin breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives: This one felt a lot better, but it seemed kind of thin.  I would squeeze a bunch out and I could barely spread it over one arm or leg.  It also didn&#x27;t seem to really absorb well, but just disappear somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno: Definitely my favorite.  It is really creamy and feels so nice to put all over my body, not just on my dry skin.  It also absorbs quickly and made my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about any of these brands or just need dry skin lotion and don&#x27;t know where to begin, choose Aveeno!</li>
            <li> One of the biggest annoyances of Diabetes is the dry skin that often comes with it.  For years, I suffered dry itchy skin, never able to find relief from any product.  And yes, I have tried them all, from the cheapest to the most expensive.  One day, I saw a bottle of Aveeno Skin Relief on sale and thought, \\&quot;Well, it&#x27;s on sale, so I will give it a try\\&quot;.  Within a couple days, not only was my skin no longer dry and flaky, but the itchiness was all gone.  I don&#x27;t use it all over everyday, but I love it so much that is has actually replaced my daily facial moisturizer.  As soon as I step out of the shower, I reach for the Aveeno Skin Relief, and give my face an all-over before blotting my face dry with a towel.  The difference in my skin is remarkable; friends and co-workers even comment on how nice my skin looks.  Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to deal with my face drying out during the day before I get home from work.  A bottle lasts me 4-5 months, and frankly, I feel like I&#x27;m worth spending the $35-$40 a year for softer, healthier, more comfortable skin.  Another positive for me is that this formula is fragrance free, and since I&#x27;ve always had a problem with reactions to fragrances (in lotions, detergents, etc...), it is nice to find a product that I don&#x27;t have to deal with that issue.  I&#x27;ve tried other Aveeno lotions (such as the calming cream &amp; the daily moisturizer) with less than spectaculor results, but this particular formula is just very good and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin, especially on my hands. It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands. Sometimes, it gets so bad that you start to see cracks in my skin and my hand just looks like it has these tiny red lines (from the skin cracking apart). When my hand got to this point, i would not be able to use any lotion - they would all just sting. REALLY REALLY BAD. So i used to put some olive oil on my hand and wear plastic gloves to sleep. Which, btw, made my hands feel amazing but it was VERY oily and smelled... well, like olive oil.  I was at my friends house once, and my hand was hurting from the dryness so bad, that I decided the sting of any lotion would be worth it. i used it - and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! I was so amazed, that I bought this as soon as I got home. I am absolutely loving it. I don&#x27;t feel that it is greasy at all, and even if it was a bit greasy, it is nothing compared to olive oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, particularly for eczema sufferers. Not sure where the one reviewer got the idea that this lotion is greasy or menthol-- it&#x27;s neither. It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent at all. My whole family, and in particular my two young boys, all have eczema and this works great to keep it under control. We use it mornings and in the evening after bath time and can mostly keep them off prescription medications like Elidel and Elicon. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY lotions geared towards very dry skin. My skin on my legs get very, very dry tot he point they get so incredibly itchy and dry looking. This lotion worked MIRACLES on my skin. I had to write an email to avenoo letting them know how their product changed my life. I use it every day before bed, and I&#x27;m way more comfortable now. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> always good price overthere and love the design of it for body lotion. great texture and nice smell. nothing wrong</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. The menthol feeling was really annoying, I don&#x27;t want my skin feeling like I just rubbed it with vapor rub. The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling greasy and nasty. It didn&#x27;t make my skin softer, it just left an unpleasant greasiness feeling to my skin that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> All I can say is: Aveeno does it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno never seems to fail my skin and many others&#x27;. My skin reacts well and can really feel the soothing effects. I have some itching problems (not as bad as Eczema), and it does a good job giving moisture without too much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I cannot complain much. Once the lotion touches your skin, you will want more!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005375C Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal, 8 oz]] is also a good lotion I use for my skin and when I got out. (You always need SPF to have healthy skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, buy with confidence and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I noted some said there is a \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; scent. FYI - there is \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; also.  Try that. ~~ I have severe eczema on my hands. Have to where \\&quot;latex\\&quot; gloves all the time for work. I&#x27;m not allergic to latex, but possibly the \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; in the gloves, so...my hands are cut and bleed and crack. Very painful.  I must agree this product is greasy.  I have to wipe it from the palms of my hands to do anything.  I had to wipe it off my fingertips to type this.  I&#x27;ve had it on for about 15 minutes and it is still on the surface of my hands.  It does burn my cuts for some time after applying (still burning a little - but most lotions do) but.....with all this being said, it does give my hands relief.  I actually like that it is still somewhat on the surface of my skin as I can continue to massage it into the severe dry skin, cracks etc., and really work it in.  If it soaked in immediately, I would probably have to continuously reapply.  As I&#x27;m finishing this review, only 2 of my severest cuts are still burning a little, but the rest of my hands feel marvelous.  Enjoy this product.  It would probably feel amazing on folks who are lucky enough to have normal hands. :)</li>
            <li> The original product did not contain dimethicone which i don&#x27;t like using and it did contain derivatives of oatmeal which i liked very much.  So, i&#x27;ve moved on to other products.  The picture and description provided looked like the original product.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion but it leaves a sort of yellowish stain on my clothes even when i rub it in well and wait a while before dressing.  regretfully i&#x27;m going to have to stop using it beacuse of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone else with this problem??</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I do not put scented lotion on my face so this works great and I save money by just using it as a full body lotion.</li>
            <li> I only get dry skin in the winter and this stuff is fantastic it dries dry and a little goes a long way for me.  I like that there is no fragrance, it is not super thick and wipes on easily... the only problem is the bottle runs out so fast because my wife who has VERY SENSITIVE skin uses it all the time.  I am willing to pimp this stuff out because I feel it is a great at moisturizing my dry skin without feeling oily or sticky afterwards...  It does work best right after toweling off.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveeno. My son has eczema and it&#x27;s the only lotion that helps him at all. It does leave a slick feeling but it penetrates and does help.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin. Just love it.</li>
            <li> Few products help my skin especially in the winter, but this Aveeno product seems to help the most. I think it is the oatmeal ingredient. If nothing else helps, I&#x27;d recommend this specific lotion. Great Seller and a great product.</li>
            <li> Minha dermatologista me indicou esse hidratante, realmente ele é muito bom. minha pele é muito seca, mas com ele ficou muito hidratada e macia.</li>
