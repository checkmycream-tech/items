            <li> My nails still split and my fingers still feel dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked wonders on my dry nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> The artificial fragrance is too strong for me, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> like I found with a lot of other cuticle oils.</li>
            <li> No worth the excitement to receive such a small bottle-</li>
            <li> A little oily, but I apply at night to give my cuticles some moisture.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is glass with a dropper applicatior, and can stand upright, or tilt forward, I like little details like that one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s working as well as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Instead,  I received a small 0.5 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Too oily, it&#x27;s hard to apply it without it going all over your hands</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t so tough and cracking like they use to be.  </li>

            <li> I love this oil. It smells great and it rreally feels good on my toe nails. It has helped me care for my feet between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does the job well. Softens skin so well I wish it was a full body oil.</li>
            <li> A little oily, but I apply at night to give my cuticles some moisture.  Lotion just doesn&#x27;t do enough for my cuticles, so this oil provides a bit more for them.  I could see this being well received to manicure customers as well.</li>
            <li> The artificial fragrance is too strong for me, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent, reminds me of bitter cranberry perfumes, but some people love that. I knew the scent was a risk, but overall I like this product. The bottle is glass with a dropper applicatior, and can stand upright, or tilt forward, I like little details like that one. It does a really good job at hydrating your cuticles, I use it on my heels also, works wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly big, smells very nice and my cuticles are soft! Worth the price. Highly recommend this!!!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> This oil works very well and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very runny. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> First of all I recieced this in just a few days! The packaging was great, came in a box very protected. Product smells amazing and feels great! Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> It is so much better than the CMD one I was using.  Especially for acrylic nails.  No lifting or certainly a lot less. Love it.</li>
            <li> Too oily, it&#x27;s hard to apply it without it going all over your hands and then anything you touch.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is easy to apply but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s working as well as I was hoping. My nails still split and my fingers still feel dry. Although I will admit that I wash my hands a lot so I&#x27;m probably counterbalancing this working. I really like the smell though. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to though so that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells so good!</li>
            <li> This product saved my hands, I keep a bottle at home and one on my desk at work. My package came in a timely manner (3 weeks overseas time) and within a 5 days of using it the state of my hand improved greatly, my nail tech even noticed. The bottles are a pretty good size also ( a small tennis ball).</li>
            <li> Does what I want, I put it on just before bed every night. The smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It has made my cuticles so freaking soft and manageable.  I normally get manicures done at a nail salon but recently wanted to save some money and attempt it at home.  I love this stuff, I know I said that but I can&#x27;t help it.  I usually get my nails nice and smooth, remove my cuticle, finish my nails and apply this.  I also put this on daily and have noticed an awesome change.  They aren&#x27;t so tough and cracking like they use to be.  And by the way, this stuff smells great!</li>
            <li> Product is really good...love the scent</li>
            <li> Excellent cuticle oil! The bottle tilts so the oil is easy to retrieve  nice feature. The pomegranate fragrance provides a pleasant scent at your finger tips. The cuticle oil last for months. A little goes a long way. Moisturizes and hydrates cuticles. I use it every other day. I keep the bottle on my nightstand next to my bed in my bedroom. Large round bottle, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!i use it daily on my hands and feet</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and does not leave my nails/cuticles feeling funny like I found with a lot of other cuticle oils. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Excellent cuticle oil</li>
            <li> New. Took a couple weeks to get. Smells really good. A must when doing nails to keep cuticles from cracking.</li>
            <li> This was delivered very quickly and was secure in the box. It&#x27;s a very decent sized bottle (Bigger than I expected!) The smell is wonderful and not overpowering. When I applied to my cuticles it was absorbed within 30 seconds. I&#x27;m in love with this oil and I will never buy anything else!&lt;br /&gt;BIG PLUS: It&#x27;s NOT tested on Animals! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is contagious!</li>

            <li> I ordered a 2.5 ounce bottle of this Cuccio Revitalize Cuticle Oil, Pomegranate and Fig, and I was very excited to try it on and to receive the big round bottle that was advertised. Instead,  I received a small 0.5 ounce bottle. No worth the excitement to receive such a small bottle- don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and smells amazing!!! Would definitely buy again!!</li>
