            <li>Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance of this product.  </li>
            <li>I used to have so many pre-cancers on my face from sun damage.</li>
            <li>I calmed me, I slept better, and I felt more grounded.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a good product but for it&#x27;s size I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks at most.</li>
            <li>I love this oil so much!</li>
            <li>This is a superior essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert on frankincense, but I got lucky with this one.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a Naturopath that I see and she hit it right on the head.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a better company for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Very costly but worth it speedy shipping</li>
            <li>I like this one much better personally.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>First time in 15 years my skin was completely clear!  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I love the aroma that it gives off.</li>
            <li>I had a few spots that I am pretty sure were skin cancer, probably basel cell.  </li>
            <li>her coughing completely stopped!  </li>
            <li>It lifts my spirits as all young living oils do.</li>
            <li>I use it when I need to calm my racing self down!</li>
            <li>It is somewhat sweeter in fragrance than the regular Frankincense Oil from Young Living.  </li>
            <li>Some of the oil had apparently seeped onto the bubble wrap envelope because it was tacky/sticky.</li>
            <li>My chiropractor told me to use this in oil and use it topically, it has been known to reset cells back to normal.</li>
            <li>I plan on following up with the dermatologist and I am sure he will be shocked or maybe not ;)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Described as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a superior essential oil.  I have not found a better company for essential oils.  I have used oils for 30 years for my family and in my profession as a midwife (now retired).&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Leslie from Montana</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much! I rub it into my feet, wear it like perfume, and even use a bit on my face. I&#x27;m no expert on frankincense, but I got lucky with this one. The scent is perfectly balanced and just heavenly.</li>
            <li> I didnt receive the sacred, instead I receive the frankincense, not happy with it...</li>
            <li> Very costly but worth it speedy shipping</li>
            <li> I chose the 5 star because of the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; it&#x27;s heavenly! I use it when I need to calm my racing self down!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of this product.  It is somewhat sweeter in fragrance than the regular Frankincense Oil from Young Living.  I like this one much better personally.  Blends well with other fragrances also.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! I had a few spots that I am pretty sure were skin cancer, probably basel cell.  I have been putting this on the areas a couple of times a day for a couple of months and the areas have cleared up and are gone.  This is the second bottle I have bought.  I have had MOHS surgery in the past for skin cancer and there was no way I was going to get cut on again if I didn&#x27;t have to.  I plan on following up with the dermatologist and I am sure he will be shocked or maybe not ;)</li>
            <li> Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I used to have so many pre-cancers on my face from sun damage. My chiropractor told me to use this in oil and use it topically, it has been known to reset cells back to normal. I used it faithfully for 10 months and my skin Dr. was shocked. First time in 15 years my skin was completely clear!  No wonder the wise men brought this to baby Jesus!</li>
            <li> The tamper evident cap was broken when I received the product.  Some of the oil had apparently seeped onto the bubble wrap envelope because it was tacky/sticky. Given that you only get 5 ml for a very steep price, I was very disappointed and returned the product.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent soft musky smell. It lifts my spirits as all young living oils do. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a Naturopath that I see and she hit it right on the head.  I calmed me, I slept better, and I felt more grounded.  Good stuff.  :-)</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product but for it&#x27;s size I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth. I took it orally and it did not last very long. A couple of weeks at most. A product this size is short lived. In order to get the results I&#x27;m looking for I will have to spend a lot more! On the other hand, I love the aroma that it gives off. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my Papillion who has bladder cancer. It&#x27;s proven in studies to kill cancer cells. She also has congestive heart failure and goes into prolonged coughing fits off and on. I was shocked that after I gave her 1 dose (1 drop) her coughing completely stopped!  I&#x27;ve been giving her 1 drop every 12 hours and she just very occasionally coughs a bit. A dramatic change!</li>
            <li> Works but it smells SO bad</li>
            <li> Helping me with a number of skin ailments!  Love it!</li>
