            <li>I cannot believe how amazing the pigmentation is with this pallette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen saying the quality is AMAZING</li>
            <li>This is an amazing palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but the eyeshadow textures are rather course and in no way, shape, or form smooth.</li>
            <li>its nice and</li>
            <li>This is a nice palette to play around with.</li>
            <li>Great for the price -- awesome alternative to the Naked palette.</li>
            <li>This palette arrived in a reasonable time and was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>The colors are just as nice and the quality can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>The color payoff is excellent, not chalky, and very pigmented.</li>

            <li>Good palette:)</li>
            <li>Nice eyeshadows...</li>
            <li>The brush was nice</li>
            <li>Save your money I own all the UD palettes ordered this one just to see how it was</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying good brushes to make the most of this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying an eyelid primer to keep the product on better because there is a fair amount of fallout as well.</li>
            <li>Lots of blend-ability all the colors look nice</li>
            <li>I just wanted a nice neutral palette</li>
            <li>Now they are really,  really nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Very good quality, the eyeshadows are pigmented, and last a good amount of time w/o creasing ( I had a primer on!)</li>
            <li>Colors are awesome with decent pigment.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, package arrived faster than expected and in perfect condition!</li>

            <li>This is a great set of nude eye shadows for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I was also impressed with Lucky Girl sending my order so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Palette arrived over 2 weeks early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I was just expecting it to be more amazing from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>its better if you use your own.</li>
            <li>2 or 3 of the shades do need a bit more building up to get a nice result,  </li>
            <li>Colors are nice - but there aren&#x27;t as many matte shades as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>, they really are shimmery and beautiful.</li>
            <li>but otherwise, this is a pretty great palette.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors great packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a great makeup palette, much higher quality than the price suggests.  </li>
            <li>Delivered way faster than expected delivery date, best dupe I&#x27;ve seen for Naked2! Very pigmented, beautiful colors!</li>
            <li>The colors are light needs just alittle more pigmentation but goes on very nice n smooth.</li>
            <li>The pigments come out strong and they look amazing.</li>

            <li>For a knock off brand, I was extremely pleased with the way it turned out.  </li>
            <li>But for every day use, it is better than a lot of make up and eyeshadow out there.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li>When I came across an article about perfect dupes for higher-end makeup products, I was ecstatic to see a dupe for the Naked Palettes</li>
            <li>Love it :) use it daily, great price too!</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I like how i am able to to mix and match.</li>
            <li>However I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the tin case.</li>
            <li>The lasting power is impressive.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are just &#x27;muddy&#x27; looking on me.</li>
            <li>Just recieved my palled i deffenetly recomend this pallete for the girls who love nude shades</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Stunning Colors Work</li>
            <li>I love these colors and the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The PERFECT dupe for Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying using this palette.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Looking forward to using more colors and looking forward to ordering others..</li>
            <li>I ordered one for myself and now I&#x27;m ordering more for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Items were packed well and arrived safely.</li>
            <li>I have tried many palettes</li>
            <li>I guess it needed more bubble wrap</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I Expecially love the three matte colors.</li>
            <li>but I just love the colors and recommend this to many people. :)</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad i took my chance and bought it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow...</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>not as impressive as the naked pallet..</li>
            <li>I love the matte colors but recommend using a primer when using sparkle as some gets below eyes.</li>
            <li>Most colors took a bit of &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to build up &amp; to blend, where some didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done so many looks with this pallet &amp; get complients everytime i wear it, but its not a pallet that I reach for if I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li>Would of gave an A+ if there were more cushion inside of envelope.</li>
            <li>This might work ok as play makeup</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But some UD shades gave better pigmentation and some W7 shades gave better pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The pigment is great and it&#x27;s a good dupe for the naked pallets</li>
            <li>Im glad I looked on Amazon</li>
            <li>Just wish the quality was better alone than needing another product to enhance the wear.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a eye primer before applying.</li>
            <li>i love this eyeshadow</li>
            <li>so cute, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>but I mostly regret buying this.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan!!!:)</li>
            <li>Excellent colors, works as a substitute for the Urban Decay</li>
            <li>Except, the top was partly coming off.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>will purchase again for sure</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow...</li>
            <li>I love this makeup pallet and will definetly be purchasing it again</li>
            <li>Packaging is ok.  </li>
            <li>is something you want to try out to get started :)</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best dupe of the Naked 2 palette that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Very glad it came so quickly</li>
            <li>Not bad for under $10; a fair dupe for another popular palette, great if you&#x27;re on a budget or starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li>I saw the w7 palettes on YouTube and very quickly ordered all 3, the first one to arrive in the mail was &amp;#34;in the buff&amp;#34; I am in love!!</li>
            <li>LOVE this palette and use the light brown color a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong but nice.</li>
            <li>but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful natural nudes</li>
            <li>Beautiful, natural colors.  </li>
            <li>Although I won&#x27;t be using the brush, I&#x27;m so excited to use this!</li>
            <li>It is honestly worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I love it, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>A very good dupe of the Naked palette at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Got this in the mail 2 weeks before the expected shipping date which was great!</li>
            <li>This was a truly great experience and product was spot on for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Great for a natural look or smokey eye.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and they are fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li>You really have to layer the colors on to get a good pay-off.</li>
            <li>It does crease very easily and quickly though.</li>
            <li>i love this pallet so much!!!</li>
            <li>Other then that awesome</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are almost exactly like the named palet 2, absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>This company had fast shipping and the product I recieved is beautiful and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Great dupe for the Naked 2 palette :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply, however without a primer it fades and causes lines of the color where my eyelid crease is, and with a primers it doesn&#x27;t cause these lines but still fades a bit, however over the course of 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li>I received it within the estimated delivery time and the powder goes on and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li>I can now use perhaps 2 or 3 shades comfortably,  with the rest becoming patchy,  not there at all or too-much-work to blend.    </li>
            <li>The pigment is also pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Is really nice and came really fast!</li>
            <li>I absolute love love love it .....</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful and has the shadow colors named on the back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty nice and well</li>
            <li>The rest are fine.</li>
            <li>I especially love the black.  </li>
            <li>got it so quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased with the range of colors in the taupe range.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are really nice, and lay out the color very well.</li>
            <li>I would say this is like a cheap dollar store</li>
            <li>It is great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was from over seas and came faster than anticipated which was a definite</li>
            <li>Great quality case means the colors will last you even longer.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago and it is seriously awesome!</li>
            <li>The matte light shade goes on as pigmented as &#x27;</li>
            <li>Great dupe for the naked pallet.</li>
            <li>This is a great palette, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d not gone the cheap route and get this instead of the Nakeds.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the palette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll splurge on that or urban decay &amp; be guaranteed a great product.</li>
            <li>A couple were okay making it worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use my own brushes because the one given isn&#x27;t very helpful</li>
            <li>The colors are great and definetly comparable to the Naked 2 pallet that is way over priced.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pigmented and add a nice look to eyes.</li>
            <li>Never buy cheap makeup.</li>
            <li>Love it 😍😍😍 such good pigmentation and great dupe to UD Naked 2.</li>
            <li>The package came nicely secure and with no dings or breaks in the shadow.</li>
            <li>As a makeup junkie, I think the colors are a great comparison to the naked pallette</li>
            <li>it blends great with the brush and is great for natural looks or you can apply it more heavy for evening looks.</li>
            <li>The brush is a throwaway and the packaging is cheap as well.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy adding this to my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great dupe to the naked pallets!</li>
            <li>I love this palette just as good of quality as the naked eye shadow palettes!</li>
            <li>I loved this purchase so much, in fact, that I went ahead and ordered the &amp;#34;In the Nights&amp;#34; palette as well even though I rarely wear color on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>but I can say that wow, it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly, love the colors, good quality especially for its price!</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me since the actual product I&#x27;m using is perfect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare to UD because I don&#x27;t own it, but compared to other palettes in this price range, this one is superior.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>REALLY FAST!!!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to create a flattering look.  </li>
            <li>like I said this powder really does apply very easy to the brush and to your eye.</li>
            <li>I rarely touch it up!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>For the price, it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Give it a try; they are well worth it!</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty pigmented love that they stay on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautifully pigmented, and the product arrived before expected (about 8-10 days).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow; )</li>
            <li>the box top came off the first time  </li>
            <li>And with none of the guilt of spending way too much on the naked pallet:) great pigment and it arrived super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly think the colors are better than NAKED!</li>
            <li>but it was super cheap</li>
            <li>For the price being super low I was surprised that I got a great product!!!!</li>
            <li>The powders are so easily blend-able, and also they are easily placed on your brush and have so much coverage.</li>
            <li>Great shipping, it came well before it was expected.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why this palette has gotten so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>The shipping was a bit slow and there wasn&#x27;t any tracking information/#, but the palette arrived in perfect condition!  </li>
            <li>The is a wonderful nock off of naked 2 pallet while the brush that comes with it sucks if you don&#x27;t need a good brush or  name brand.</li>
            <li>this is just as good as that over priced naked brand</li>
            <li>are true.</li>
            <li>but all together its such a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice Natural Colors ...</li>
            <li>and I am in absolute love</li>
            <li>This palette is a really good dupe for the Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li>Well, this does look like a good dup of Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>but for the price.. not a bad substitute</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>This crumbled like chalk and isn&#x27;t as pigmented but for the price it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I love how much of a natural look I get and how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you can&#x27;t afford the big leagues but still want more sophisticated make-up.</li>
            <li>And super quick delivery</li>
            <li>The shimmery gold shade second in from the left is the perfect neutral.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, not to mention it arrived at my house within 6 days of ordering</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not all shades are usable to me, but the few that are (darker ones) are good</li>
            <li>I only wish more W7 products could be shipped to the US (for a better price).</li>
            <li>The shimmery shadows, especially, perform superbly and have terrific pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brush that came with it quickly fell apart. :</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product, and I hope to be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Looks good, stays on long time.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of shimmer in each color and the shades blend pretty easily.</li>
            <li>But even if I just use half--- still a great tool kit.</li>
            <li>looks exactly as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li>I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I thought the colors would be much more vivid.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t super pigmented, buy a primer for sure, but it is still a nice little palette.</li>
            <li>I bought two pallets, both came in fairly quickly, neither were damaged at all, pigmentation is amazing for the price of the palettes and I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li>Came quicker than the delivery estimate, and they are such great natural colors!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pigmented, and smooth and buttery to the touch.</li>
            <li>This reminds me of cheap eye shadow you buy because you think you are getting a good deal, and in reality you just wasted a buck.</li>
            <li>It is a dupe for the Naked 2 palette and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Lifted the lid the whole thing fell apart, thanks for a great Christmas present for my daughter, so embarrassed to give it to her</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all very pigmented and goes on decently smooth.</li>
            <li>This experience was worth taking the time to highlight</li>
            <li>I like the golden colors</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to own any of the Naked Palettes, but I have always been hesitant because of the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect and I got it earlier than expected</li>
            <li>I bought this as it was reviewed on a popular site referencing Naked shadow knockoffs.</li>
            <li>Way worth the price and wait.</li>
            <li>Shadows are pigmented and soft, and the range of colors is really lovely.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and love the quality of the shadows.</li>
            <li>I almost brought another popular product duo tone neutral when this palette is the same price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great colors, they look as nice the expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Really good product for the price, read reviews that this product was comparable to the Naked brand pallet and it really is.</li>
            <li>nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li>it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is wonderful, but the case was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>- I would say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s great quality, and much much much better than W7&#x27;s other &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; of UD Naked palettes.</li>
            <li>The colors, as other reviews have noted, are absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>i bought these because of another post saying these are really good and almost like the urban decay without the high price.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadows are amazing: highly pigmented, easy application, long wear.</li>
            <li>Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap, I highly recommend ☺</li>
            <li>do not expect quality equal to high end makeup, but for $6 its pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>I have the other W7 palettes (in the Nudes and Lightly Toasted, lightly toasted being the least pigmented of the three) and this one has the best texture of the three.</li>
            <li>The colors barely come out on my skin, and i&#x27;m light skinned!</li>
            <li>The colors are true to the picture and stay on very well with or without primer.</li>
            <li>This is a good, cheap alternative to the Naked Palletes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy trying out new products.</li>
            <li>This is a great Dupe to the Urban Decay Naked 2 Palate!</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette especially are fairly pigmented and have a soft texture.</li>
            <li>Not as great as the NAKED palletes by urban decay but simialr.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping...and works awesome😁</li>
            <li>Definitely would buy more.</li>
            <li>The colors blend well, and are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My package came in exactly one week (from the UK to the US), and it was not damaged at all.</li>
            <li>My only con to this is that I was expecting the tin to be more of a metal material, and instead it is fully plastic.</li>
            <li>Better deals for the same product.</li>
            <li>and they are sooooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Just As Well As My Higher End Shadows</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>and this is exactly how it was when I opened it.</li>
            <li>if only it had more matte colors....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s UD 2 exact dupe product.</li>
            <li>but I the quality is fitting to the price it is VERY low end makeup and</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>I compared it with my UD palette all three to all three of the UD Naked palettes and for the most part they give identical pigmentation.</li>
            <li>However the top was messed up , there supposed to be connected but no big deal.</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer through the day!</li>
            <li>I believe this palette is way better than the naked palette.</li>
            <li>The glitters are not chunky at all, and the metallic sheen in the shadows can compare to higher end shadows.</li>
            <li>The back of the top had come off.</li>
            <li>But this palette is so pigmented and nice that I&#x27;m curious now to see how it compares.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more palettes in the future.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ve got a sophisticated look that will last you all day.  </li>
            <li>this is an exact duplicate</li>
            <li>I was suprised how fast it came in!</li>
            <li>For ten bucks, this is a STEAL! :)</li>
            <li>But based on my experience, it would be better to save up and buy the Urban Decay</li>
            <li>These colors are great for everyday use!!</li>
            <li>It comes with a little brush, but it&#x27;s not that great, which is usual with products that have their own brushes with them.</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect for someone that loves subtle looks or just nude colors in general.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you want to try these kinds of colors but aren&#x27;t willing to shell out a weeks worth of groceries to do so.</li>
            <li>Really nice colors, but pretty low on color pigmentation, especially on the eyelid, and super chalky and powdery.  </li>
            <li>It is just as good as the more expensive name brand eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because some of the shadows have a texture as if it were kind of old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dupe for UD, but a little chalky.very pigmented and holds on all day!</li>
            <li>Only down side is that the brush isn&#x27;t very good and the actual container is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Came before the due date and am excited to use it!!</li>
            <li>The first color, which I thought was a white, is actually a really light yellow, and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great long lasting and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>I really like it, its so pretty.</li>
            <li>Colors are sooooo pretty and its just like the Naked2 from &amp;#34;UD&amp;#34; but SOOOO much cheaper</li>
            <li>The product itself is a mix of hit or miss, just like any palette some colors are surprisingly buttery while others are just powdery with the usual amount of fallout.</li>
            <li>The packaging is lightweight (could be a plus) and has a certain manufacturing scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LIVE by this palette!!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the lighter colors aren&#x27;t as opaque as I would like them to be but the darker colors are amazing!!</li>
            <li>This is honest to God the exact duplicate of the Urban Decay Naked 2 eyeshadow pallet.</li>
            <li>The lid broke off after only a few uses but the colors are great and they stay on well.</li>
            <li>The shipping also was a lot better than expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I recommend to someone who wants UD but cant afford it?</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>The colors are very blendable and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The quality of these shadows is really a &amp;</li>
            <li>Colors are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The palette is very pigmented on my skin color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really close that well to be secured.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and I can tell I&#x27;m going to use this palette a lot.</li>
            <li>Delivery was so much faster than the estimate</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have much shimmer at all..</li>
            <li>I really like this a lot ...</li>
            <li>Its much prettier in person then the picture shows.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t have that much money to purchase it.</li>
            <li>but none seem to stay on or have the really pigmented color.</li>
            <li>However, the shadows are very powdery &amp; chalky.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow palette was better than i expected.</li>
            <li>but I dont really care about that.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending a whole lot of money on palettes</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend the $54 on the real Naked2, give this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found applying them with a wet brush is better</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The quality of the items have been very satisfactory for their purpose.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>shadows have too much shimmer for a 40 something...</li>
            <li>Thank you, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>But as time has passed (and it&#x27;s not that much time),   </li>
            <li>,  I really can&#x27;t complain.    </li>
            <li>Colors are fantastic, go on easy, blend well and last long.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>I matched two of the colors to Urban Decay&#x27;s &#x27;Foxy&#x27; and &#x27;Blackout&#x27; since I don&#x27;t have the other colors and they are good matches.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and very pigmented and both palettes together cost less than 1/2 of what one Urban Decay Naked palette costs and work just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>The case is not the same as the original.</li>
            <li>34;Lightly Toasted&amp;#34; which is like the original UD Naked palette, and &amp;#34;In The Nude&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was so excited that it finally arrived after 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I love this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as soft/buttery as LORAC,  but they do go on lovely and blend extremely well,  and if you use a primer</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find my package arrive later that week</li>
            <li>Great colors, very subtle</li>
            <li>This is hands down just as good as the urban decay one!</li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re used to high end products the novelty of it may wear off fast.</li>
            <li>It came fast probably less than 2 weeks. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  want to give a negative view of this product bcuz I really do like it and would purchase more products from this brand!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a decent amount time usage out of it.</li>
            <li>You may have to apply double or triple layers for the colors to match the naked palette, but I love working my way up on the intensity of the colors.</li>
            <li>Made me a bit uncomfortable but glad my palette came in and glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>but i think the naked palette is definitly better quality and will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>decent pigmentation, quite a bit of fallout though.</li>
            <li>But main problem is the chalky powder.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very nice, but a little lighter than expected</li>
            <li>There are a lot of shimmery shades and all of them are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>Talk about high expectations.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The brush in the palette is cheap quality and the packaging is cheap and not comparable to the Urban Decay Naked2 palette, but the colors are high quality and comparable to the actual Urban Decay version.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and its very similar to the naked palette if your looking for strong neutrals.</li>
            <li>All I know is that the colors in this palette are vibrant, silky and easily compliment each other.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be a little more aggressive with your application.</li>
            <li>The palette is definitely a little more darker than the photo displays the eyeshadows</li>
            <li>There are two that have a little more fallout than normal, but they are the lighter shades.</li>
            <li>Box came a little dented, but who cares when you get a great palette for such a low price!</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for, with a great (expensive)</li>
            <li>Love all the colors, and use this palette everyday.</li>
            <li>I do think it was worth it, just for the sheer amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend trying it, the price alone is worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth only the price charged.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my choice to spend less than $6 rather than over $50 for Naked 2.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent UD Naked dupe..</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented, go on smooth and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I live this and would recommend to people who like bronzey shimmery colors</li>
            <li>And now I absolutely live it.</li>
            <li>Came in VERY early.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an exact dupe for the UD Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li>Anywho, the colors are vivid and pigmented and the case and shadows themselves came undamaged.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly like naked eye-shadow.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it came earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li>So far I like this palette because of the colors, the pigment, the price, and how i do not have to keep adding layer after layer to get the color that it looks like in the tin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pigmented and the colors are almost exactly the same as the Naked2.</li>
            <li>it has such pretty colors.</li>
            <li>No cracked palettes, arrived 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li>Colors are almost exact to the naked palette.</li>
            <li>this is literally an exact copy of the Naked 2 palette which I already had.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d love it, but I doesn&#x27;t stay on long, its not high pigments, and i have to use a lot to achieve the depth of color I want.</li>
            <li>the colors last for a decent amount of time but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented so you have to layer.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I bought this set and the Natural Nudes set because I have been trying to decide between the UD Naked 2 and 3 palettes.</li>
            <li>I got it in yesterday with another order and I was so surprised it came in early!</li>
            <li>They are really well pigmented, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of the naked palette and saved my self a few bucks!</li>
            <li>problem is that the eye-shadows them-selves are not as pigmented as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;It took quite a few applications to get the color to look like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the palette is fine.</li>
            <li>The quality of the eyeshadow is to be expected, there is a little fall out, and you need to really build it up to get a better effect.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast, only took a week.</li>
            <li>It applies well (it does crease sometimes by the end of the night), but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to get away from eyeshadows that contain talc and parabens like this one, but I&#x27;m really liking this palette and the price I paid and will continue to use it from time time to time.</li>
            <li>I have really been wanting the naked palette from ulta for a while now</li>
            <li>It really works just the same.</li>
            <li>I use the light brown everyday and I&#x27;m bound to run out of it soon</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last very well.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Naked palette...</li>
            <li>Knock off of NAKED????&lt;br /&gt;So far this has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Use all the time to get a dolled up look, natural or even smokey eye.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, but as a Naked palette owner, don&#x27;t expect this to be equivalent to the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more bucks and buy the Naked Basics Pallete for $27.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no clue why - they&#x27;re treated no differently than any other palette I own.     </li>
            <li>Now with that said,  this is a marvellous little palette and it IS worth buying if for no other reason than you want to experiment with nude colors but aren&#x27;t ready to shell out $50.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of urban decay and other pricey makeup</li>
            <li>Naked 2 full for $50 or the Urban Decay Naked 2 essentials for $30.  </li>
            <li>The applicator included is so small and flimsy, but is fine considering the price.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this pallet and although the colors are pretty, it is nothing like the Naked pallet.</li>
            <li>It works for younger children first starting out or adults.</li>
            <li>My original Urban Decay Naked 2 lasted for a long time</li>
            <li>You paid $6.99, of course it isnt Urban Decay quality nor anything high end.</li>
            <li>So fun to be able to approximate the naked 3 experience for a tiny price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>What follows is an update;   the original is further down after the asterisks.    </li>
            <li>That said, the price is right for experimentation, especially if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying its more expensive dupe.</li>
            <li>so I was definitely looking into buying a new one or just singles to try to get through.  </li>
            <li>Very comparable to Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
            <li>Dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Palette and very pigmented</li>
            <li>A few people wrote that it wore off quickly-</li>
            <li>She originally had the Urban Decay little nude pallet and she returned it cause it was too chalky.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to stay on at least 6 hours perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I thought there would be more pigmentation but the only colors that are pigmented are the gold and the black other than that</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are creamy &amp; very pigmented with minimal fallout.</li>
            <li>It lacks pigmentation and it barely lasts.</li>
            <li>but the quality isn&#x27;t near Naked.</li>
            <li>Alot like the Naked Natural Palette</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this nice mix of colors.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a little better quality from reading previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Just like other reviews said, it is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s very patchy and hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this pallete to someone who is wishing for very pigmented shadows.</li>
            <li>As far as lasting power, I used my NYX white jumbo eye pencil as a primer</li>
            <li>and I in no way expected this to perform like high end eyeshadows, but</li>
            <li>Ive been wanting the naked pallet and this is an almost exact of it for much much less.</li>
            <li>Also, I received my order 2 weeks earlier than expected (they had it shipped and ready to go the next business day)!</li>
            <li>Much like a previous reviewer posted, my lid was also unattached at one side of the tin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;there was all kinds of good and bad reviews about this palette</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I cannot believe how amazing the pigmentation is with this pallette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen saying the quality is AMAZING</li>
            <li> This is an amazing palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but the eyeshadow textures are rather course and in no way, shape, or form smooth.</li>
            <li> its nice and</li>
            <li> This is a nice palette to play around with.</li>
            <li> Great for the price -- awesome alternative to the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> This palette arrived in a reasonable time and was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> The colors are just as nice and the quality can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>

            <li> The brush was nice</li>
            <li> Save your money I own all the UD palettes ordered this one just to see how it was</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying good brushes to make the most of this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying an eyelid primer to keep the product on better because there is a fair amount of fallout as well.</li>
            <li> Lots of blend-ability all the colors look nice</li>
            <li> I just wanted a nice neutral palette</li>
            <li> Now they are really,  really nice.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Very good quality, the eyeshadows are pigmented, and last a good amount of time w/o creasing ( I had a primer on!)</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome with decent pigment.</li>

            <li> I was also impressed with Lucky Girl sending my order so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Palette arrived over 2 weeks early in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I was just expecting it to be more amazing from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> its better if you use your own.</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 of the shades do need a bit more building up to get a nice result,  </li>
            <li> Colors are nice - but there aren&#x27;t as many matte shades as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> , they really are shimmery and beautiful.</li>
            <li> but otherwise, this is a pretty great palette.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors great packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup palette, much higher quality than the price suggests.  </li>

            <li> The colors are light needs just alittle more pigmentation but goes on very nice n smooth.</li>
            <li> The pigments come out strong and they look amazing.</li>
            <li> also want to put in a good word for Lucky Girl as a seller.</li>

            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> For a knock off brand, I was extremely pleased with the way it turned out.  </li>
            <li> But for every day use, it is better than a lot of make up and eyeshadow out there.  </li>
            <li> Great eyeshadows very pigmented not chalky great price for such good quality.</li>

            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I like how i am able to to mix and match.</li>
            <li> However I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the tin case.</li>
            <li> The lasting power is impressive.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are just &#x27;muddy&#x27; looking on me.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my palled i deffenetly recomend this pallete for the girls who love nude shades</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Stunning Colors Work</li>
            <li> I love these colors and the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> The PERFECT dupe for Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this palette.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using more colors and looking forward to ordering others..</li>
            <li> I ordered one for myself and now I&#x27;m ordering more for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Items were packed well and arrived safely.</li>
            <li> I have tried many palettes</li>
            <li> I guess it needed more bubble wrap</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I Expecially love the three matte colors.</li>
            <li> but I just love the colors and recommend this to many people. :)</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m glad i took my chance and bought it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> not as impressive as the naked pallet..</li>
            <li> I love the matte colors but recommend using a primer when using sparkle as some gets below eyes.</li>
            <li> Most colors took a bit of &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to build up &amp; to blend, where some didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so many looks with this pallet &amp; get complients everytime i wear it, but its not a pallet that I reach for if I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li> Would of gave an A+ if there were more cushion inside of envelope.</li>
            <li> This might work ok as play makeup</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> But some UD shades gave better pigmentation and some W7 shades gave better pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The pigment is great and it&#x27;s a good dupe for the naked pallets</li>
            <li> Im glad I looked on Amazon</li>
            <li> Just wish the quality was better alone than needing another product to enhance the wear.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a eye primer before applying.</li>
            <li> i love this eyeshadow</li>
            <li> so cute, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> but I mostly regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan!!!:)</li>
            <li> Excellent colors, works as a substitute for the Urban Decay</li>
            <li> Except, the top was partly coming off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> will purchase again for sure</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow...</li>

            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best dupe of the Naked 2 palette that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Very glad it came so quickly</li>
            <li> Not bad for under $10; a fair dupe for another popular palette, great if you&#x27;re on a budget or starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> I saw the w7 palettes on YouTube and very quickly ordered all 3, the first one to arrive in the mail was &amp;#34;in the buff&amp;#34; I am in love!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this palette and use the light brown color a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong but nice.</li>
            <li> but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful natural nudes</li>
            <li> Beautiful, natural colors.  </li>
            <li> Although I won&#x27;t be using the brush, I&#x27;m so excited to use this!</li>
            <li> It is honestly worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love it, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> A very good dupe of the Naked palette at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Got this in the mail 2 weeks before the expected shipping date which was great!</li>
            <li> This was a truly great experience and product was spot on for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Great for a natural look or smokey eye.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and they are fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li> You really have to layer the colors on to get a good pay-off.</li>
            <li> It does crease very easily and quickly though.</li>
            <li> i love this pallet so much!!!</li>
            <li> Other then that awesome</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are almost exactly like the named palet 2, absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> This company had fast shipping and the product I recieved is beautiful and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the Naked 2 palette :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply, however without a primer it fades and causes lines of the color where my eyelid crease is, and with a primers it doesn&#x27;t cause these lines but still fades a bit, however over the course of 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> I received it within the estimated delivery time and the powder goes on and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I can now use perhaps 2 or 3 shades comfortably,  with the rest becoming patchy,  not there at all or too-much-work to blend.    </li>
            <li> The pigment is also pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Is really nice and came really fast!</li>
            <li> I absolute love love love it .....</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and has the shadow colors named on the back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty nice and well</li>
            <li> The rest are fine.</li>
            <li> I especially love the black.  </li>
            <li> got it so quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with the range of colors in the taupe range.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice, and lay out the color very well.</li>
            <li> I would say this is like a cheap dollar store</li>
            <li> It is great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was from over seas and came faster than anticipated which was a definite</li>
            <li> Great quality case means the colors will last you even longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and it is seriously awesome!</li>
            <li> The matte light shade goes on as pigmented as &#x27;</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the naked pallet.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d not gone the cheap route and get this instead of the Nakeds.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the palette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll splurge on that or urban decay &amp; be guaranteed a great product.</li>
            <li> A couple were okay making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use my own brushes because the one given isn&#x27;t very helpful</li>
            <li> The colors are great and definetly comparable to the Naked 2 pallet that is way over priced.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pigmented and add a nice look to eyes.</li>
            <li> Never buy cheap makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it 😍😍😍 such good pigmentation and great dupe to UD Naked 2.</li>
            <li> The package came nicely secure and with no dings or breaks in the shadow.</li>
            <li> As a makeup junkie, I think the colors are a great comparison to the naked pallette</li>
            <li> it blends great with the brush and is great for natural looks or you can apply it more heavy for evening looks.</li>
            <li> The brush is a throwaway and the packaging is cheap as well.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy adding this to my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great dupe to the naked pallets!</li>
            <li> I love this palette just as good of quality as the naked eye shadow palettes!</li>
            <li> I loved this purchase so much, in fact, that I went ahead and ordered the &amp;#34;In the Nights&amp;#34; palette as well even though I rarely wear color on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> but I can say that wow, it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly, love the colors, good quality especially for its price!</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me since the actual product I&#x27;m using is perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to UD because I don&#x27;t own it, but compared to other palettes in this price range, this one is superior.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> REALLY FAST!!!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to create a flattering look.  </li>
            <li> like I said this powder really does apply very easy to the brush and to your eye.</li>
            <li> I rarely touch it up!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Give it a try; they are well worth it!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty pigmented love that they stay on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautifully pigmented, and the product arrived before expected (about 8-10 days).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow; )</li>
            <li> the box top came off the first time  </li>
            <li> And with none of the guilt of spending way too much on the naked pallet:) great pigment and it arrived super fast!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly think the colors are better than NAKED!</li>
            <li> but it was super cheap</li>
            <li> For the price being super low I was surprised that I got a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> The powders are so easily blend-able, and also they are easily placed on your brush and have so much coverage.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, it came well before it was expected.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this palette has gotten so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a bit slow and there wasn&#x27;t any tracking information/#, but the palette arrived in perfect condition!  </li>
            <li> The is a wonderful nock off of naked 2 pallet while the brush that comes with it sucks if you don&#x27;t need a good brush or  name brand.</li>
            <li> this is just as good as that over priced naked brand</li>
            <li> are true.</li>
            <li> but all together its such a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice Natural Colors ...</li>
            <li> and I am in absolute love</li>
            <li> This palette is a really good dupe for the Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> Well, this does look like a good dup of Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li> but for the price.. not a bad substitute</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This crumbled like chalk and isn&#x27;t as pigmented but for the price it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I love how much of a natural look I get and how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you can&#x27;t afford the big leagues but still want more sophisticated make-up.</li>
            <li> And super quick delivery</li>
            <li> The shimmery gold shade second in from the left is the perfect neutral.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, not to mention it arrived at my house within 6 days of ordering</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not all shades are usable to me, but the few that are (darker ones) are good</li>
            <li> I only wish more W7 products could be shipped to the US (for a better price).</li>
            <li> The shimmery shadows, especially, perform superbly and have terrific pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brush that came with it quickly fell apart. :</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product, and I hope to be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Looks good, stays on long time.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of shimmer in each color and the shades blend pretty easily.</li>
            <li> But even if I just use half--- still a great tool kit.</li>
            <li> looks exactly as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li> I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I thought the colors would be much more vivid.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t super pigmented, buy a primer for sure, but it is still a nice little palette.</li>
            <li> I bought two pallets, both came in fairly quickly, neither were damaged at all, pigmentation is amazing for the price of the palettes and I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Came quicker than the delivery estimate, and they are such great natural colors!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pigmented, and smooth and buttery to the touch.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of cheap eye shadow you buy because you think you are getting a good deal, and in reality you just wasted a buck.</li>
            <li> It is a dupe for the Naked 2 palette and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Lifted the lid the whole thing fell apart, thanks for a great Christmas present for my daughter, so embarrassed to give it to her</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all very pigmented and goes on decently smooth.</li>
            <li> This experience was worth taking the time to highlight</li>
            <li> I like the golden colors</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to own any of the Naked Palettes, but I have always been hesitant because of the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect and I got it earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was reviewed on a popular site referencing Naked shadow knockoffs.</li>
            <li> Way worth the price and wait.</li>
            <li> Shadows are pigmented and soft, and the range of colors is really lovely.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and love the quality of the shadows.</li>
            <li> I almost brought another popular product duo tone neutral when this palette is the same price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great colors, they look as nice the expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Really good product for the price, read reviews that this product was comparable to the Naked brand pallet and it really is.</li>
            <li> nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li> it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is wonderful, but the case was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> - I would say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s great quality, and much much much better than W7&#x27;s other &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; of UD Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> The colors, as other reviews have noted, are absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> i bought these because of another post saying these are really good and almost like the urban decay without the high price.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadows are amazing: highly pigmented, easy application, long wear.</li>
            <li> Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap, I highly recommend ☺</li>
            <li> do not expect quality equal to high end makeup, but for $6 its pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> I have the other W7 palettes (in the Nudes and Lightly Toasted, lightly toasted being the least pigmented of the three) and this one has the best texture of the three.</li>
            <li> The colors barely come out on my skin, and i&#x27;m light skinned!</li>
            <li> The colors are true to the picture and stay on very well with or without primer.</li>
            <li> This is a good, cheap alternative to the Naked Palletes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy trying out new products.</li>
            <li> This is a great Dupe to the Urban Decay Naked 2 Palate!</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette especially are fairly pigmented and have a soft texture.</li>
            <li> Not as great as the NAKED palletes by urban decay but simialr.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping...and works awesome😁</li>
            <li> Definitely would buy more.</li>
            <li> The colors blend well, and are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My package came in exactly one week (from the UK to the US), and it was not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> My only con to this is that I was expecting the tin to be more of a metal material, and instead it is fully plastic.</li>
            <li> Better deals for the same product.</li>
            <li> and they are sooooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Just As Well As My Higher End Shadows</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> and this is exactly how it was when I opened it.</li>
            <li> if only it had more matte colors....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s UD 2 exact dupe product.</li>
            <li> but I the quality is fitting to the price it is VERY low end makeup and</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> I compared it with my UD palette all three to all three of the UD Naked palettes and for the most part they give identical pigmentation.</li>
            <li> However the top was messed up , there supposed to be connected but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer through the day!</li>
            <li> I believe this palette is way better than the naked palette.</li>
            <li> The glitters are not chunky at all, and the metallic sheen in the shadows can compare to higher end shadows.</li>
            <li> The back of the top had come off.</li>
            <li> But this palette is so pigmented and nice that I&#x27;m curious now to see how it compares.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more palettes in the future.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ve got a sophisticated look that will last you all day.  </li>
            <li> this is an exact duplicate</li>
            <li> I was suprised how fast it came in!</li>
            <li> For ten bucks, this is a STEAL! :)</li>
            <li> But based on my experience, it would be better to save up and buy the Urban Decay</li>
            <li> These colors are great for everyday use!!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush, but it&#x27;s not that great, which is usual with products that have their own brushes with them.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect for someone that loves subtle looks or just nude colors in general.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you want to try these kinds of colors but aren&#x27;t willing to shell out a weeks worth of groceries to do so.</li>
            <li> Really nice colors, but pretty low on color pigmentation, especially on the eyelid, and super chalky and powdery.  </li>
            <li> It is just as good as the more expensive name brand eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because some of the shadows have a texture as if it were kind of old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dupe for UD, but a little chalky.very pigmented and holds on all day!</li>
            <li> Only down side is that the brush isn&#x27;t very good and the actual container is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Came before the due date and am excited to use it!!</li>
            <li> The first color, which I thought was a white, is actually a really light yellow, and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great long lasting and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> I really like it, its so pretty.</li>
            <li> Colors are sooooo pretty and its just like the Naked2 from &amp;#34;UD&amp;#34; but SOOOO much cheaper</li>
            <li> The product itself is a mix of hit or miss, just like any palette some colors are surprisingly buttery while others are just powdery with the usual amount of fallout.</li>
            <li> The packaging is lightweight (could be a plus) and has a certain manufacturing scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LIVE by this palette!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the lighter colors aren&#x27;t as opaque as I would like them to be but the darker colors are amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is honest to God the exact duplicate of the Urban Decay Naked 2 eyeshadow pallet.</li>
            <li> The lid broke off after only a few uses but the colors are great and they stay on well.</li>
            <li> The shipping also was a lot better than expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would I recommend to someone who wants UD but cant afford it?</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> The colors are very blendable and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The quality of these shadows is really a &amp;</li>
            <li> Colors are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The palette is very pigmented on my skin color</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really close that well to be secured.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and I can tell I&#x27;m going to use this palette a lot.</li>
            <li> Delivery was so much faster than the estimate</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have much shimmer at all..</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot ...</li>
            <li> Its much prettier in person then the picture shows.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t have that much money to purchase it.</li>
            <li> but none seem to stay on or have the really pigmented color.</li>
            <li> However, the shadows are very powdery &amp; chalky.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow palette was better than i expected.</li>
            <li> but I dont really care about that.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending a whole lot of money on palettes</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend the $54 on the real Naked2, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found applying them with a wet brush is better</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The quality of the items have been very satisfactory for their purpose.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> shadows have too much shimmer for a 40 something...</li>
            <li> Thank you, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> But as time has passed (and it&#x27;s not that much time),   </li>
            <li> ,  I really can&#x27;t complain.    </li>
            <li> Colors are fantastic, go on easy, blend well and last long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> I matched two of the colors to Urban Decay&#x27;s &#x27;Foxy&#x27; and &#x27;Blackout&#x27; since I don&#x27;t have the other colors and they are good matches.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and very pigmented and both palettes together cost less than 1/2 of what one Urban Decay Naked palette costs and work just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> The case is not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> 34;Lightly Toasted&amp;#34; which is like the original UD Naked palette, and &amp;#34;In The Nude&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was so excited that it finally arrived after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I love this eye shadow!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as soft/buttery as LORAC,  but they do go on lovely and blend extremely well,  and if you use a primer</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to find my package arrive later that week</li>
            <li> Great colors, very subtle</li>
            <li> This is hands down just as good as the urban decay one!</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re used to high end products the novelty of it may wear off fast.</li>
            <li> It came fast probably less than 2 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  want to give a negative view of this product bcuz I really do like it and would purchase more products from this brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get a decent amount time usage out of it.</li>
            <li> You may have to apply double or triple layers for the colors to match the naked palette, but I love working my way up on the intensity of the colors.</li>
            <li> Made me a bit uncomfortable but glad my palette came in and glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> but i think the naked palette is definitly better quality and will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> decent pigmentation, quite a bit of fallout though.</li>
            <li> But main problem is the chalky powder.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very nice, but a little lighter than expected</li>
            <li> There are a lot of shimmery shades and all of them are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> Talk about high expectations.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brush in the palette is cheap quality and the packaging is cheap and not comparable to the Urban Decay Naked2 palette, but the colors are high quality and comparable to the actual Urban Decay version.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and its very similar to the naked palette if your looking for strong neutrals.</li>
            <li> All I know is that the colors in this palette are vibrant, silky and easily compliment each other.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be a little more aggressive with your application.</li>
            <li> The palette is definitely a little more darker than the photo displays the eyeshadows</li>
            <li> There are two that have a little more fallout than normal, but they are the lighter shades.</li>
            <li> Box came a little dented, but who cares when you get a great palette for such a low price!</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for, with a great (expensive)</li>
            <li> Love all the colors, and use this palette everyday.</li>
            <li> I do think it was worth it, just for the sheer amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend trying it, the price alone is worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth only the price charged.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my choice to spend less than $6 rather than over $50 for Naked 2.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent UD Naked dupe..</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented, go on smooth and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I live this and would recommend to people who like bronzey shimmery colors</li>
            <li> And now I absolutely live it.</li>
            <li> Came in VERY early.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an exact dupe for the UD Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> Anywho, the colors are vivid and pigmented and the case and shadows themselves came undamaged.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like naked eye-shadow.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it came earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> So far I like this palette because of the colors, the pigment, the price, and how i do not have to keep adding layer after layer to get the color that it looks like in the tin!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pigmented and the colors are almost exactly the same as the Naked2.</li>
            <li> it has such pretty colors.</li>
            <li> No cracked palettes, arrived 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> Colors are almost exact to the naked palette.</li>
            <li> this is literally an exact copy of the Naked 2 palette which I already had.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d love it, but I doesn&#x27;t stay on long, its not high pigments, and i have to use a lot to achieve the depth of color I want.</li>
            <li> the colors last for a decent amount of time but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented so you have to layer.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I bought this set and the Natural Nudes set because I have been trying to decide between the UD Naked 2 and 3 palettes.</li>
            <li> I got it in yesterday with another order and I was so surprised it came in early!</li>
            <li> They are really well pigmented, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of the naked palette and saved my self a few bucks!</li>
            <li> problem is that the eye-shadows them-selves are not as pigmented as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;It took quite a few applications to get the color to look like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the palette is fine.</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeshadow is to be expected, there is a little fall out, and you need to really build it up to get a better effect.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast, only took a week.</li>
            <li> It applies well (it does crease sometimes by the end of the night), but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get away from eyeshadows that contain talc and parabens like this one, but I&#x27;m really liking this palette and the price I paid and will continue to use it from time time to time.</li>
            <li> I have really been wanting the naked palette from ulta for a while now</li>
            <li> It really works just the same.</li>
            <li> I use the light brown everyday and I&#x27;m bound to run out of it soon</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very well.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Naked palette...</li>
            <li> Knock off of NAKED????&lt;br /&gt;So far this has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Use all the time to get a dolled up look, natural or even smokey eye.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, but as a Naked palette owner, don&#x27;t expect this to be equivalent to the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more bucks and buy the Naked Basics Pallete for $27.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no clue why - they&#x27;re treated no differently than any other palette I own.     </li>
            <li> Now with that said,  this is a marvellous little palette and it IS worth buying if for no other reason than you want to experiment with nude colors but aren&#x27;t ready to shell out $50.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of urban decay and other pricey makeup</li>
            <li> Naked 2 full for $50 or the Urban Decay Naked 2 essentials for $30.  </li>
            <li> The applicator included is so small and flimsy, but is fine considering the price.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this pallet and although the colors are pretty, it is nothing like the Naked pallet.</li>
            <li> It works for younger children first starting out or adults.</li>
            <li> My original Urban Decay Naked 2 lasted for a long time</li>
            <li> You paid $6.99, of course it isnt Urban Decay quality nor anything high end.</li>
            <li> So fun to be able to approximate the naked 3 experience for a tiny price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> What follows is an update;   the original is further down after the asterisks.    </li>
            <li> That said, the price is right for experimentation, especially if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying its more expensive dupe.</li>
            <li> so I was definitely looking into buying a new one or just singles to try to get through.  </li>
            <li> Very comparable to Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
            <li> Dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Palette and very pigmented</li>
            <li> A few people wrote that it wore off quickly-</li>
            <li> She originally had the Urban Decay little nude pallet and she returned it cause it was too chalky.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to stay on at least 6 hours perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more pigmentation but the only colors that are pigmented are the gold and the black other than that</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are creamy &amp; very pigmented with minimal fallout.</li>
            <li> It lacks pigmentation and it barely lasts.</li>
            <li> but the quality isn&#x27;t near Naked.</li>
            <li> Alot like the Naked Natural Palette</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this nice mix of colors.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a little better quality from reading previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews said, it is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very patchy and hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this pallete to someone who is wishing for very pigmented shadows.</li>
            <li> As far as lasting power, I used my NYX white jumbo eye pencil as a primer</li>
            <li> and I in no way expected this to perform like high end eyeshadows, but</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting the naked pallet and this is an almost exact of it for much much less.</li>
            <li> Also, I received my order 2 weeks earlier than expected (they had it shipped and ready to go the next business day)!</li>
            <li> Much like a previous reviewer posted, my lid was also unattached at one side of the tin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;there was all kinds of good and bad reviews about this palette</li>
            <li> A couple of them are a little hard and don&#x27;t go on as easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The last a considerably long time</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but the powder is chalky which makes blending or controlling areas very difficult.  </li>
            <li> Last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Very similar to the Naked 2 palette, but the colors are not exact.</li>
            <li> comes with a long handled brush.</li>
            <li> Came in 4 weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Actually faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I also always use a primer which helps the colors stay on all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m not ready to break the bank on a Naked palette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found in a long long time!</li>
            <li> The colors are consistent through the day, and it never looks dull!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin and cheap, but I was expecting that based on the price.  </li>
            <li> I have never loved eyeshadow so much in my life.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth spending the money on Naked eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product which made my eyelids swell up and didnt go down for several days.</li>
            <li> The only one that shows up on my eye is the black shade.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something similar to the Naked pallet, I would suggest looking past this one</li>
            <li> My lid was firmly attached, had a small dent in the bottom and no broken eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality and very cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the shimmer shadows transfer just a little bit, and resist water relatively well if not messed with while wet.</li>
            <li> this palette was beyond than what i expected to be...</li>
            <li> The colors are as expected from the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite flaky but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Came in way before time expected which is a plus in my book .</li>
            <li> Came faster than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> It came weeks before it was expected</li>
            <li> Certainly not.  </li>
            <li> Easily crumbles in the tin, and it is nearly impossible to blend the darker colors.  </li>
            <li> I might have to get some of the other palettes now.</li>
            <li> Unlike other pallets I feel like the case is tougher too.</li>
            <li> The dark colors are not very pigmented (tbh they are pretty much useless) but the medium/light ones work as all-over-lid colors.</li>
            <li> My case was not damaged like a lot of other reviewers stated.  </li>
            <li> and I think the colors work well with each other</li>
            <li> With 12 colors, day to night look options are endless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think other reviews</li>
            <li> : Would definatly buy other pallets/products from this brand &amp; would buy from the seller again as well.</li>
            <li> hopefully this brand does not go away for i plan to try out some other makeup they make</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a NAKED palette, or any other high-quality palette, so I&#x27;m not able to compare the two.  </li>
            <li> The shadows are not as powdery compared to W7&#x27;s other palettes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also added the update to the other palette I bought.      </li>
            <li> As other stated don&#x27;t buy this thinking</li>
            <li> Just warning the Onyx is a deep black and can cause a little bit of a mess,</li>
            <li> I have a very pale complexion and I&#x27;m a bit of a honey blonde.</li>
            <li> bonus.&lt;br /&gt;You really cant go wrong with these...</li>
            <li> and I have med dark skin.</li>
            <li> not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> and it seems to stay on longer than any of my other eyeshadows too!</li>
            <li> but I would recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> Going to order some of the other colors too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to order the other palettes!</li>
            <li> and I would deff suggest this product to other buyers!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting the exact same quality because you&#x27;ll be disappointed.    </li>
            <li> This make up smears and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Did take a little while to ship</li>
            <li> It took a little under a month to get here, it arrived in a bubble-lined envelope.</li>
            <li> When I recvd it two of the colors were broken out and it was such a mess</li>
            <li> I just received the other two palettes, THE COLORS!!</li>
            <li> It came damaged and messy.</li>
            <li> , they are a bit powdery and messy</li>
            <li> I bought one a few months ago and have been using it nearly everyday since.  </li>
            <li> I use this palette almost everyday,  </li>
            <li> And Is Now Part Of My Everyday Makeup Routine.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> As for the brush, just throw it out because the only thing you are going to accomplish by using it is frustrating yourself.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for day and night looks.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anone who purchases the Naked Pallette from urban decay which is way too expensive in sephora!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped other pallets once only to open them and find them all destroyed :(</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty bad, so I&#x27;d get a high-quality one.</li>
            <li> but they need a base because the colors won&#x27;t look as bold on your skin.</li>
            <li> Very little fall out, none of I use primer.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> As someone that was obsessed with the Urban Decay</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually dont care for the brushes that come with pallets</li>
            <li> Colors are lovely, but the consistency of the shadows is awful.  </li>
            <li> and I use the palette everyday!</li>
            <li> Tin box has a small Dent on 1 end but that probably happened during shipping.</li>
            <li> find the only reason I decided to give three stars is because if worn with a WHITE eye shadow base it will show.</li>
            <li> , I used sand as a base, Camel as a second color in the middle and on the outer corner I used onyx.</li>
            <li> Although I came to order another one and its 3 times as much as it was when I bought it :((</li>
            <li> I found some of the colors to be a bit dull when applied.</li>
            <li> I already have the legitimate Naked3 Palette and was getting a little tired of all of the rose-tones.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is a lot of fall out from the product than expected....</li>
            <li> The matte shadows, as in the other palettes, are disappointing and have little pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I had seriously been thinking about sucking it up and buying the Naked2, but I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> the shadows have taken on an odd chalkiness and a weird texture.   </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to where I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> but it only lasts 2 to 3 hours  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> but once fixed with mac fix plus spray then its not that bad!</li>
            <li> Not great</li>
            <li> The case came broken which was a bummer</li>
            <li> a was slightly broken when I got it</li>
            <li> bcuz mine was obly in a thin bubbled manilla evelope coming all the way from the UK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im not impressed, for the reasons I&#x27;m going to state below.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush/applicator is useless.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive and was looking for something comparable.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was broken.</li>
            <li> Even applying the makeup was bad.</li>
            <li> I dont understand why people buy it and complain about its quality while giving it a bad rating?</li>
            <li> but I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.   </li>
            <li> i was seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an idiot.</li>
            <li> When paired with the Maybeline color tattoo as a base, i don&#x27;t need to reapply</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Love all the colors, and use this palette everyday. It comes with a little brush, but it&#x27;s not that great, which is usual with products that have their own brushes with them. If you use an eye primer the colors stay on, and go on very nicely. The first color, which I thought was a white, is actually a really light yellow, and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that. Over all it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This palette is absolutely wonderful. The colors are very pigmented and its very similar to the naked palette if your looking for strong neutrals.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice.  The quality of the makeup is not what you would get from a name brand.  It&#x27;s a little thin and cheap, but I was expecting that based on the price.  I do think it was worth it, just for the sheer amount of colors you get.</li>
            <li> looks exactly as shown in the picture! loved it!</li>
            <li> its nice and i love the brush that comes along with it</li>
            <li> Love this palette, so many colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> My girls have similar eye color pallets that cost quite a bit.  I wanted something for myself without spending $50+ and this set of eye color is perfect!  I love the colors and the way it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> It came in about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good for the price! Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Love!! Good quality for the price you pay! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Definitely not worth spending the money on Naked eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail 2 weeks before the expected shipping date which was great! Beautiful colors and a lovely brush that comes with it. This is a great Dupe to the Urban Decay Naked 2 Palate! I would recommend this to ALL!</li>
            <li> I love the color of eye shadow!!! Definitely would buy more.</li>
            <li> For a knock off brand, I was extremely pleased with the way it turned out.  Would it be good stage makeup? Certainly not.  But for every day use, it is better than a lot of make up and eyeshadow out there.  The colors blend well, and are exactly what I was looking for.  I might have to get some of the other palettes now.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best eye shadow I&#x27;ve found in a long long time! Definitely a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> in great condition! shipping was fast, only took a week. The colors are perfect for my taste because it very natural and the pigmentation is great. I would buy this again</li>
            <li> I LOVE my palette!!!!!! I honestly think the colors are better than NAKED! I use this everyday! I am so impressed by this and the price! My eyeshadow lasts all day and night. I rarely touch it up! It&#x27;s a must buy!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LIVE by this palette!! It&#x27;s just like the Naked 2 but slightly different. There are a lot of shimmery shades and all of them are highly pigmented. The shipping also was a lot better than expected. I received my product only about a week after ordering instead of 3. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadows very pigmented not chalky great price for such good quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, beautiful colors, work great!</li>
            <li> Daughter loved it. High quality.  Came for the UK (we are in the US) and it was prompt.  This was a truly great experience and product was spot on for my 13 year old daughter.  Will definitely deal with the vendor again.  This experience was worth taking the time to highlight</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYE SHADOW!!!!! SUCK GOOD QUALITY AND IT SHIPPING REALLY FAST!!!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!!! There are a lot of shimmer colors, and only 3 mattes. The brushes are really nice, and lay out the color very well. This is a great product for the price, and I would recommend this for any beginner. This is a nice palette to play around with. I like the golden colors, they really are shimmery and beautiful. Buy this!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more pigmentation but the only colors that are pigmented are the gold and the black other than that I would say this is like a cheap dollar store find the only reason I decided to give three stars is because if worn with a WHITE eye shadow base it will show. this product is just okay and I would say best for a beginner learning to do makeup or better their skills.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I bought this set and the Natural Nudes set because I have been trying to decide between the UD Naked 2 and 3 palettes. Before I paid the $50+ for the UD set, I wanted to see which tonal set (taupe or rose) would be best for me. I saw these sets on Amazon, read the reviews saying they were basically the UD set colors and thought for $17 combined for the 2 with shipping I&#x27;d give them a try.. I&#x27;m glad I did. These are terrific. They come in a nice container and the colors are fabulous. I have no problem using them they go on nicely (with a good eye shadow primer and using a brush) and last no problem with no creasing. The pigments was better than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;Did I buy this with the expectation that they would be as good as UD? No. I&#x27;m not an idiot. They are $7.&lt;br /&gt;Am I happy with the product? Absolutely. I still plan to invest in the UD palette but can wait to see which of these I use more so I know which to get.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to someone who wants UD but cant afford it? Absolutely. It is great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was from over seas and came faster than anticipated which was a definite bonus.&lt;br /&gt;You really cant go wrong with these... they are great.</li>
            <li> This is horrible I recieved this today and I would not suggested spending your money on it</li>
            <li> Great for the price -- awesome alternative to the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> I love it.The price was great.it shipped on time and it came in one piece.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased! Palette arrived over 2 weeks early in perfect condition. The eye shadows are creamy &amp; very pigmented with minimal fallout. The shades are comparable to the Naked 2 palette. I am thrilled with my choice to spend less than $6 rather than over $50 for Naked 2. My husband bought me the Naked 3 last year &amp; I wish I would of known about these dupes back then. I will be purchasing the In the Nude palette next.</li>
            <li> Such a good product!!</li>
            <li> Love them! I have all the Naked palettes &amp; decided to give these a try... Very good alternative for those that can&#x27;t go the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; route. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to UD because I don&#x27;t own it, but compared to other palettes in this price range, this one is superior. I love it.</li>
            <li> This palette arrived in a reasonable time and was in perfect condition.  The colors are very blendable and creamy.  Very comparable to Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
            <li> Looks good, stays on long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette! It came in perfect condition, none of the powder was cracked and the brush is a great new tool. I recommend this if you can&#x27;t afford the big leagues but still want more sophisticated make-up.</li>
            <li> The case is not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> As someone that was obsessed with the Urban Decay Naked Pallets- I can say this is an amazing alternative! The colors are just as nice and the quality can&#x27;t be beat for the price. A few people wrote that it wore off quickly- I use an eyeshadow primer from a department store and it stays put all day! Unlike other pallets I feel like the case is tougher too. I&#x27;ve dropped other pallets once only to open them and find them all destroyed :( Not this one! Great quality case means the colors will last you even longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing a couple of YouTube videos comparing them to the Urban Decay Naked palettes.  I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  These are very nice with cute packaging and good color payoff.  Also, the shipping on these was super-fast (about 1 week) considering they were coming from overseas.  I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The staying power isn&#x27;t amazing but otherwise, this is a pretty great palette. For this price though, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and it is seriously awesome! Although I came to order another one and its 3 times as much as it was when I bought it :((</li>
            <li> this palette was beyond than what i expected to be... so nicely pigmented, beautiful colors, it lasts aaaall day on my eyes and overall it was a awesome purchuse for the value!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This make up smears and makes a mess. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dupe for UD, but a little chalky.very pigmented and holds on all day!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet. Ive been wanting the naked pallet and this is an almost exact of it for much much less. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I love this palette just as good of quality as the naked eye shadow palettes! And super quick delivery</li>
            <li> Im not impressed, for the reasons I&#x27;m going to state below.&lt;br /&gt;⋅&lt;br /&gt;⋅&lt;br /&gt;The shadows aren&#x27;t very pigmented what so ever. The only one that shows up on my eye is the black shade. Although it&#x27;s very patchy and hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this pallete to someone who is wishing for very pigmented shadows.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette especially are fairly pigmented and have a soft texture. I have the other W7 palettes (in the Nudes and Lightly Toasted, lightly toasted being the least pigmented of the three) and this one has the best texture of the three. I matched two of the colors to Urban Decay&#x27;s &#x27;Foxy&#x27; and &#x27;Blackout&#x27; since I don&#x27;t have the other colors and they are good matches. The matte light shade goes on as pigmented as &#x27;foxy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette has a jasmine-like scent and lasts great with a primer.  I highly recommend this if you want to try these kinds of colors but aren&#x27;t willing to shell out a weeks worth of groceries to do so.</li>
            <li> Dupe for the Urban Decay Naked Palette and very pigmented</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows! My package came in exactly one week (from the UK to the US), and it was not damaged at all. I ordered &amp;#34;In The Buff&amp;#34; off of Bislinks, and I will be buying again! My only con to this is that I was expecting the tin to be more of a metal material, and instead it is fully plastic. I don&#x27;t mind though!</li>
            <li> Came in VERY early. Great colors, very pigmented. Great dupe for the naked pallet. Defiantly would recommend.</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you pay for but I was highly disappointed.It came damaged and messy. Even applying the makeup was bad.It lacks pigmentation and it barely lasts. Just save you money to buy an authentic one. I want a refund</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! I love nude tones and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Got this for my best friend and she looooves it! She originally had the Urban Decay little nude pallet and she returned it cause it was too chalky. She prefers this one much more.</li>
            <li> I use the 5th color all the time. The dark colors are not very pigmented (tbh they are pretty much useless) but the medium/light ones work as all-over-lid colors. Worth the money, but as a Naked palette owner, don&#x27;t expect this to be equivalent to the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> I just got yesterday havnt used it yet but very impressed will buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing! Great price and everything I need.</li>
            <li> i love this pallet so much!!! Best thing I have ever got on Amazon 😘</li>
            <li> Pretty colors great packaging. Great for a natural look or smokey eye.</li>
            <li> The case is plastic and the colors don&#x27;t stick to my eyelid the way I&#x27;d like them to, but it is an alright palette for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette, especially for the price! I ordered &amp;#34;In The Buff&amp;#34; and it arrived earlier than the shipping date anticipated that it would. The color payoff is excellent, not chalky, and very pigmented. I haven&#x27;t tried all the colors but I have swatched them on my hand and they are beautiful! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This company had fast shipping and the product I recieved is beautiful and looks exactly like the picture. Although I won&#x27;t be using the brush, I&#x27;m so excited to use this!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it everyday! I recommend it to anyone looking for a pallet at a great price</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for the naked palette. I like the colors they are pigmented however, they are a bit powdery and messy but  that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and stays on</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup palette, much higher quality than the price suggests.  I bought one a few months ago and have been using it nearly everyday since.  The shimmery gold shade second in from the left is the perfect neutral.</li>
            <li> These colors are great for everyday use!! Use them. Love them!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is well worth it! Compared it to the real Naked 2 and it is almost identical. Came in about 2 weeks. Looking forward to trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> Omg. I almost died when I opened it. It is so pigmented😭 this is the stuff we need at the drugstore; and the price?!? I think it&#x27;s way easier to shop for makeup on Amazon than buying it at CVS or Rite Aid. Better deals for the same product.</li>
            <li> GREAT pigment. Not disappointed at all!!!</li>
            <li> comes with a long handled brush. I liked that.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent UD Naked dupe.. but some of the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as the appear. But, a primer definitely helped with color and longevity. For this price, it&#x27;s a great dupe and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition and I have had no troubles with it. The colors are as expected from the price. It&#x27;s quite flaky but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected. I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I bought two pallets, both came in fairly quickly, neither were damaged at all, pigmentation is amazing for the price of the palettes and I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> For the price this is unbeatable. It applies well (it does crease sometimes by the end of the night), but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love love love these eye shadows!!!</li>
            <li> I have this W7 palette in the &amp;#34;In The Buff&amp;#34; shade. It&#x27;s amazing, and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s an exact dupe for the UD Naked 2 palette. I suggest saving your money and just get this instead. The colors are identical, even in the same order. They&#x27;re very pigmented, and smooth and buttery to the touch. They have a couple mire shades too called &amp;#34;Lightly Toasted&amp;#34; which is like the original UD Naked palette, and &amp;#34;In The Nude&amp;#34; which is like the Naked 3. It&#x27;s definitely worth it and they are sooooo much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to own any of the Naked Palettes, but I have always been hesitant because of the price. When I came across an article about perfect dupes for higher-end makeup products, I was ecstatic to see a dupe for the Naked Palettes so I decided to check them out. All I can say is &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;! I LOOOOOOOOVE this W7 Pallete! The colors, as other reviews have noted, are absolutely gorgeous. The quality of these shadows is really a &amp;#34;must have to believe&amp;#34; type of thing, despite there being a number of reviews of this palette on YouTube. Also, I received my order 2 weeks earlier than expected (they had it shipped and ready to go the next business day)! I loved this purchase so much, in fact, that I went ahead and ordered the &amp;#34;In the Nights&amp;#34; palette as well even though I rarely wear color on my eyelids. Give it a try; they are well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it :) use it daily, great price too!</li>
            <li> I love this set. I like how i am able to to mix and match. Thank you for sending them in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It has neutral colors just as described. They do have shimmer so if you don&#x27;t like the shimmer on eye shadows then don&#x27;t buy this. Colors are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li> wonderful. When paired with the Maybeline color tattoo as a base, i don&#x27;t need to reapply</li>
            <li> Perfect purchase. Excellent service/</li>
            <li> Simply excellent great palette for price. Comes on time.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. The colors barely come out on my skin, and i&#x27;m light skinned! This reminds me of cheap eye shadow you buy because you think you are getting a good deal, and in reality you just wasted a buck.</li>
            <li> The W7 &#x27;In The Buff&#x27; eye-shadow palette is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the eye-shadows them-selves are not as pigmented as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;It took quite a few applications to get the color to look like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the palette is fine.</li>
            <li> I have never loved eyeshadow so much in my life. I used to only wear the stuff from Ulta, but I came across this on Amazon instead. It is honestly worth every penny!! I love how much of a natural look I get and how easy it is to apply. The colors are so similar to the naked pallet! This is also a great price☺️</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Though it took a couple of weeks to get to me, ever since I got it I&#x27;ve loved it! The pigments come out strong and they look amazing. Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  Very good quality, the eyeshadows are pigmented, and last a good amount of time w/o creasing ( I had a primer on!) This palette has about 3 matte shades and the rest have a shimmery finish. I use this palette almost everyday,  there are many looks that can be achieved!  The shipping was a bit slow and there wasn&#x27;t any tracking information/#, but the palette arrived in perfect condition!  I would recommend this product, great kit</li>
            <li> ALL THE COLORS LOOKED THE SAME. NO PIGMENTATION. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty pigmented love that they stay on throughout the day. i am planning on buying every pallet they have. Did take a little while to ship but it came in perfect condition. I usually dont care for the brushes that come with pallets but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, it came well before it was expected. The quality of the eyeshadow is to be expected, there is a little fall out, and you need to really build it up to get a better effect.</li>
            <li> Colors are lovely, but the consistency of the shadows is awful.  Easily crumbles in the tin, and it is nearly impossible to blend the darker colors.  The brush/applicator is useless.  I wish I&#x27;d not gone the cheap route and get this instead of the Nakeds.  You truly do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I want to get myself one of these. It was a gift for my best friend. She loves it! I</li>
            <li> Delivered way faster than expected delivery date, best dupe I&#x27;ve seen for Naked2! Very pigmented, beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> The colors are pigmented and long lasting. I&#x27;d never spend over $50 on any eye shadow palette so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> A great inexpensive palette to have. The palette is very pigmented on my skin color and I have med dark skin. However I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the tin case. It doesn&#x27;t really close that well to be secured. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the palette.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors really lasts and shows great. Came in way before time expected which is a plus in my book .</li>
            <li> Love this product, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping...and works awesome😁</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome with decent pigment. I&#x27;m absolutely loving this palette!</li>
            <li> Bought this to try the colors before I bought the UD Pallet. I actually like the colors and the texture. The pigment is also pretty nice.</li>
            <li> One of the best investments! It is a dupe for the Naked 2 palette and it is amazing. The pigmentation is wonderful! The lasting power is impressive. I work 12 hour shifts and it works.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was broken. Lifted the lid the whole thing fell apart, thanks for a great Christmas present for my daughter, so embarrassed to give it to her</li>
            <li> Came faster than the expected delivery date. Very good quality and great price!</li>
            <li> Is really nice and came really fast! Love the colors!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette on Saturday, Sept 13th and got it today, Friday 19th. It is AMAZING. The case feels cheapy but who cares??? The colors are perfect for someone that loves subtle looks or just nude colors in general. I dont understand why people buy it and complain about its quality while giving it a bad rating? You paid $6.99, of course it isnt Urban Decay quality nor anything high end. Talk about high expectations. Anywho, the colors are vivid and pigmented and the case and shadows themselves came undamaged. It definately does resemble the Naked2 palette though!! You definately get a great deal for $7, worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, very subtle</li>
            <li> Not great pigmentaton- I&#x27;d rather save up my money for the actual Naked pallette.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice, but a little lighter than expected so you have to be a little more aggressive with your application.</li>
            <li> The case came broken which was a bummer but it was super cheap so I can&#x27;t really complain. The colors are very pigmented and I can tell I&#x27;m going to use this palette a lot. Save your money, and get this!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup! Great quality. Great price. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is honest to God the exact duplicate of the Urban Decay Naked 2 eyeshadow pallet. I loveeee it! I have used the naked 2 pallet and I can say. This is hands down just as good as the urban decay one!</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted the Urban Decay pallet but it&#x27;s too expensive and was looking for something comparable. After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d love it, but I doesn&#x27;t stay on long, its not high pigments, and i have to use a lot to achieve the depth of color I want. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have Greek olive skin and darker lids. Maybe it works better for lighter skin tones. I don&#x27;t know but im used to Mac eyeshadow, so I&#x27;ll splurge on that or urban decay &amp; be guaranteed a great product.</li>
            <li> I thought the colors would be much more vivid. Most of the colors are just &#x27;muddy&#x27; looking on me. A couple were okay making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> Delivery was so much faster than the estimate and it was in great shape. The eye shadows are amazing: highly pigmented, easy application, long wear. I use this palette every day now. It really is the best Naked2 dupe!</li>
            <li> Just recieved my palled i deffenetly recomend this pallete for the girls who love nude shades its a must  for your makeup collection</li>
            <li> Just like the Naked 2 palette!! Came quicker than the delivery estimate, and they are such great natural colors!</li>
            <li> This pallet is amazing! I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I absolute love love love it ..... it&#x27;s perfect and I got it earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Love it! Looks just like the Decay one</li>
            <li> Grindy and not pigmented</li>
            <li> Really liked the quality. Good palette:) I love it</li>
            <li> The different color shades it comes with is good , I like that . it came in a week from ordering. I am happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Bad quality and very cheap. It doesn&#x27;t stay on my eyelids. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s great long lasting and the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> An Absolutely Incredible Pallete.I Got This Before Time Stated And Although It Did Have A Tiny Dig I Was Very Pleased With It. Stunning Colors Work Just As Well As My Higher End Shadows And Is Now Part Of My Everyday Makeup Routine. I Def Recommend This Pallete And Buyer</li>
            <li> I love these colors and the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this pallet and although the colors are pretty, it is nothing like the Naked pallet. I found some of the colors to be a bit dull when applied. They didn&#x27;t have much shimmer at all.. If you are looking for something similar to the Naked pallet, I would suggest looking past this one</li>
            <li> love the colors, great price</li>
            <li> The PERFECT dupe for Urban Decay. I cannot believe how amazing the pigmentation is with this pallette. For the price, I wasn&#x27;t getting my hopes up but this product surpassed my expectations. The brush that comes with it is one of the best blending brushes I have used. It stays on all day and is easy to remove. I will be purchasing this procut again.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadows...a good variety of neutral shades</li>
            <li> The colors are beautifully pigmented, and the product arrived before expected (about 8-10 days). I am very happy with this product, and a steal for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, I would defiantly rank it up there with the urban decay palettes(:</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful palette it has amazing colors in it and most of then a shimmery I live this and would recommend to people who like bronzey shimmery colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this palette.  The colors are very pigmented, go on smooth and last a long time.  My case was not damaged like a lot of other reviewers stated.  My lid was firmly attached, had a small dent in the bottom and no broken eyeshadows.  I&#x27;m starting to get away from eyeshadows that contain talc and parabens like this one, but I&#x27;m really liking this palette and the price I paid and will continue to use it from time time to time.</li>
            <li> It only took alittle over a week to ship to me...I really like this a lot ...</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!! And with none of the guilt of spending way too much on the naked pallet:) great pigment and it arrived super fast!!! Will definitely purchase again from this seller</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was reviewed on a popular site referencing Naked shadow knockoffs. The colors are pretty but you get what you pay for, with a great (expensive) primer the colors last for a decent amount of time but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented so you have to layer. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often so for the money I&#x27;ll probably get a decent amount time usage out of it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Super pigmented, not to mention it arrived at my house within 6 days of ordering (estimated shipping time was 1-2 months) - unreal!! Great dupe for the Naked 2 palette :)</li>
            <li> I really like it, its so pretty. the only problem is that the lid doesnt stay close. Other then that awesome</li>
            <li> i love it. im doing my friends wedding makeip with this palette</li>
            <li> I love it (: no problems</li>
            <li> Just got this 2 days ago... I really love the colors! and it seems to stay on longer than any of my other eyeshadows too! Also was a great price! will buy again!</li>
            <li> Just got this today, it came a couple weeks earlier then said it would.  Its much prettier in person then the picture shows. Looking forward to using more colors and looking forward to ordering others.. Way worth the price and wait.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to Naked but I can say that wow, it&#x27;s gorgeous. Shadows are pigmented and soft, and the range of colors is really lovely. I ordered one for myself and now I&#x27;m ordering more for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to put in a good word for Lucky Girl as a seller. Items were packed well and arrived safely.</li>
            <li> Nice shades; good value for the quality of shadow.</li>
            <li> I have really been wanting the naked palette from ulta for a while now but I really don&#x27;t have that much money to purchase it. I have tried many palettes tht are suppose to be similar to it but none seem to stay on or have the really pigmented color. I was looking on here one day and I read the review on it  decided to try it out. It&#x27;s only 10 dollars so what the heck I&#x27;ll give it a try. And now I absolutely live it. I would not spend all that money on the naked palette when you can get the same result with this. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all, no pigmentation at all</li>
            <li> So fun to be able to approximate the naked 3 experience for a tiny price.</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome! Came in quicker than stated.. Like 26 days quicker.</li>
            <li> LOVE this palette and use the light brown color a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong but nice. The brush was nice and I think the colors work well with each other and it&#x27;s easy to apply, however without a primer it fades and causes lines of the color where my eyelid crease is, and with a primers it doesn&#x27;t cause these lines but still fades a bit, however over the course of 5-6 hours. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It came weeks before it was expected and I use the palette everyday! I use my own brushes because the one given isn&#x27;t very helpful but I would recommend this product to other people! (Photos were taken after using)</li>
            <li> I just got this palette in the mail and I can already say that I love it! I got &amp;#34;In the buff&amp;#34; and it reminds me of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the eyeshadow a was slightly broken when I got it but it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to where I couldn&#x27;t use it. Also, the lighter colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as the darker ones but they look beautiful nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing! Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Perfect array of neutrals!</li>
            <li> When I recvd it two of the colors were broken out and it was such a mess</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with his palette. I received it within the estimated delivery time and the powder goes on and comes off easily. The colors are beautiful natural nudes and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It took a little under a month to get here, it arrived in a bubble-lined envelope. I guess it needed more bubble wrap because the eyeshadow &amp;#34;Camel&amp;#34; came busted up, shimmer everywhere. The rest are fine. The colors aren&#x27;t super pigmented, buy a primer for sure, but it is still a nice little palette.</li>
            <li> The is a wonderful nock off of naked 2 pallet while the brush that comes with it sucks if you don&#x27;t need a good brush or  name brand. Get this. It really works just the same. Good color pay off.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that it finally arrived after 3 weeks and this is exactly how it was when I opened it. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Love it and it&#x27;s very nice. I Expecially love the three matte colors. I use the light brown everyday and I&#x27;m bound to run out of it soon but I just love the colors and recommend this to many people. :)</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is there. However, the shadows are very powdery &amp; chalky. They don&#x27;t last very well.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great a price&lt;br /&gt;Its just some colors look similar when applied</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I love this eye shadow! I&#x27;m in Wisconsin, US and I got it so quickly! I ordered it Sept. 3rd and I got it Sept 10th. The pallet is a great quality too. The colors are great and definetly comparable to the Naked 2 pallet that is way over priced.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow palette was better than i expected. it also arrived 2 weeks earlier so that was a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;there was all kinds of good and bad reviews about this palette but i&#x27;m glad i took my chance and bought it. if only it had more matte colors....</li>
            <li> They are really well pigmented, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of the naked palette and saved my self a few bucks! I like the colors and they last on me all day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow... it goes on very smooth and looks great.. I will be purchasing this again. I like Urban Decay and this is a great substitute.</li>
            <li> Colors are sooooo pretty and its just like the Naked2 from &amp;#34;UD&amp;#34; but SOOOO much cheaper lol. When I opened it the lid broke but I dont really care about that. It came in about 2 weeks after I ordered and the estimate was about a month so good on them.</li>
            <li> Awesome !  Great colors , great pigmentation. metal case is substantial.  Very comparable to the Naked palette...only at a bargan price. Shipped fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I don&#x27;t like spending a whole lot of money on palettes so I settled for this one not knowing what to fully expect. I was pleasantly surprised and love the quality of the shadows. They&#x27;re very pigmented and add a nice look to eyes. I used the lighter tones for my brown eyes and it just looks great. Love.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Spend a few more bucks and buy the Naked Basics Pallete for $27. These are not pigmented and get everywhere when you put them off. Even with a primer it took layer upon layer to see the shadow. Returning this.</li>
            <li> It great. It is just as good as the more expensive name brand eye shadows.  I have 3 of this brand and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great price and this is just as good as that over priced naked brand</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and very pigmented. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product (in the buff ) on june 23 and received it june 30 using standard shipping. Very glad it came so quickly and the product was not damaged and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and they are fairly pigmented. As for the brush, just throw it out because the only thing you are going to accomplish by using it is frustrating yourself. Much like a previous reviewer posted, my lid was also unattached at one side of the tin. No biggie, just don&#x27;t let it roll around in your purse. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s UD 2 exact dupe product. A must have and works like it too for 1/8 of the price!!</li>
            <li> Came in today. Absolutely beautiful and has the shadow colors named on the back. Tin box has a small Dent on 1 end but that probably happened during shipping. All the colors are perfect. I ordered this palette on Sept 6th, received it on the 13th. Way faster then estimated (Oct 2-12.) I&#x27;m super thrilled with the shipping speed &amp; very happy with the colors. I can&#x27;t wait to try these out. With 12 colors, day to night look options are endless. I definitely recommend trying it, the price alone is worth it.</li>
            <li> Very good product !!!</li>
            <li> I like the colors and the way the eyeshadow goes on but it only lasts 2 to 3 hours  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great value f the money</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like naked eye-shadow.</li>
            <li> I use this palatte every day! Just like other reviews said, it is very pigmented. The brush included works great, and is perfect for crease work. I would definitely repurchase or purchase another product from this brand. Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this eyeshadow! The colors are beautiful for a smoky eye/natural look. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it came earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow; ) I recommend this to anone who purchases the Naked Pallette from urban decay which is way too expensive in sephora!</li>
            <li> I really like these but they need a base because the colors won&#x27;t look as bold on your skin.</li>
            <li> Came in 4 weeks earlier than expected. I am beyond happy with the product... I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow. Going to order some of the other colors too!</li>
            <li> This is the quality of MAC makeup I will be buying a lot more from them !!!</li>
            <li> blends easily and great nuetral palette! Just wish there were more mattes in it!</li>
            <li> Could be a bit more pigmented, otherwise colours are nice!</li>
            <li> The colors are true to the picture and stay on very well with or without primer. There are two that have a little more fallout than normal, but they are the lighter shades. Very good pallette.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! Just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> not as impressive as the naked pallet.. but for the price.. not a bad substitute</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this nice mix of colors. There are both matte and sparkle. I&#x27;m not a fan of sparkle but this does not have a lot in it. I love the matte colors but recommend using a primer when using sparkle as some gets below eyes. It comes with a great eye shadow brush. I would buy that alone if I could!</li>
            <li> Kinda like my naked palate but the shadow would wear off after 4-5 hours of the day......Good colors though for the price</li>
            <li> Was expecting a little better quality from reading previous reviews. Quality is consiatant with price. Colors are hit or miss for blendability, pigmentation &amp; fall-out. Would definately buy more palets from this brand for the price you cant beat it! I don&#x27;t think other reviews I&#x27;ve seen saying the quality is AMAZING are true. Most colors took a bit of &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to build up &amp; to blend, where some didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t  want to give a negative view of this product bcuz I really do like it and would purchase more products from this brand! I was just expecting it to be more amazing from reading the reviews. I&#x27;ve done so many looks with this pallet &amp; get complients everytime i wear it, but its not a pallet that I reach for if I&#x27;m in a hurry bcuz of the reasons I stated earlier. Packaging is great for the price! Outter packaging is a &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34; type metal.&lt;br /&gt;Would give my seller an A- Would of gave an A+ if there were more cushion inside of envelope. My item arrived well before the estimated shippind date &amp; was not damaged in any way at all. I can understand how some reviewers said their item was dented or broke bcuz mine was obly in a thin bubbled manilla evelope coming all the way from the UK.&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: Would definatly buy other pallets/products from this brand &amp; would buy from the seller again as well.</li>
            <li> Save your money I own all the UD palettes ordered this one just to see how it was and it&#x27;s just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this palette has gotten so many great reviews. The palette has great colors but when applied they has no pigment. This might work ok as play makeup but I the quality is fitting to the price it is VERY low end makeup and not worth purchasing. I am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly. Actually faster than I expected. I used it for the first time today and I love it. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from W7 again.</li>
            <li> It has great pigmentation. I compared it with my UD palette all three to all three of the UD Naked palettes and for the most part they give identical pigmentation. But some UD shades gave better pigmentation and some W7 shades gave better pigmentation. I would recommend and buy again for those who are on a budget. It came fast probably less than 2 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not all shades are usable to me, but the few that are (darker ones) are good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great eyeshadow. The pigment is great and it&#x27;s a good dupe for the naked pallets</li>
            <li> Very quick , pallete looks great . However the top was messed up , there supposed to be connected but no big deal.</li>
            <li> A very nice nude palette for the eyes.  Im glad I looked on Amazon I almost brought another popular product duo tone neutral when this palette is the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome  product!  Great pigment &amp; nice colors.  Would definitely  buy again.  Oh yeah &amp; the shipping was speedy!</li>
            <li> I got it in yesterday with another order and I was so surprised it came in early! And I love it! I can&#x27;t wait to order the other palettes!</li>
            <li> Great colors, they look as nice the expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product which made my eyelids swell up and didnt go down for several days. Never buy cheap makeup. You get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> awesome palette!  i bought these because of another post saying these are really good and almost like the urban decay without the high price.  So far I like this palette because of the colors, the pigment, the price, and how i do not have to keep adding layer after layer to get the color that it looks like in the tin!  Awesome make-up..value price..I bought another colour palette &amp;#34;in the nude&amp;#34; and am also happy with that one...hopefully this brand does not go away for i plan to try out some other makeup they make</li>
            <li> I love this set!  I use it every day, for different looks.  It was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I received this palette yesterday and I love it! I already have the legitimate Naked3 Palette and was getting a little tired of all of the rose-tones. I had seriously been thinking about sucking it up and buying the Naked2, but I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. The brush in the palette is cheap quality and the packaging is cheap and not comparable to the Urban Decay Naked2 palette, but the colors are high quality and comparable to the actual Urban Decay version. I would suggest buying good brushes to make the most of this product. I would recommend buying an eyelid primer to keep the product on better because there is a fair amount of fallout as well. If you don&#x27;t want to spend the $54 on the real Naked2, give this a try. It&#x27;s very similar and I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;in the nude&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;in the buff&amp;#34; pallets I received both pallets within a week! I am a huge fan of urban decay and other pricey makeup but I enjoy trying out new products. Both of these pallets have excellent pigment. I also always use a primer which helps the colors stay on all day long. This was an excellent but and I would deff suggest this product to other buyers!</li>
            <li> The product looked so beautiful for an affordable price so I had to get my hands on it! The palette is definitely a little more darker than the photo displays the eyeshadows but all together its such a good product for the price. Unfortunately, there is a lot of fall out from the product than expected....but once fixed with mac fix plus spray then its not that bad! Just wish the quality was better alone than needing another product to enhance the wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a NAKED palette, or any other high-quality palette, so I&#x27;m not able to compare the two.  All I know is that the colors in this palette are vibrant, silky and easily compliment each other.  I especially love the black.  The brush is pretty bad, so I&#x27;d get a high-quality one.</li>
            <li> Great colors for a great price! Similar to Urban Decay palette. Be sure to use a eye primer before applying. Lasts much longer through the day!</li>
            <li> This palette is perfect for those who want that nude look. It&#x27;s so pigmented and the colors are almost exactly the same as the Naked2. Of course the quality of it can&#x27;t be compared to the Naked2,  it&#x27;s a steal for $7.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this pallet!! Came before the due date and am excited to use it!!</li>
            <li> i love this eyeshadow it has such pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Lots of blend-ability all the colors look nice but I have some favorites. I have a very pale complexion and I&#x27;m a bit of a honey blonde. Blue eyes. Nudes look good on me. Great set.</li>
            <li> so cute, I love it. perfect pigmentation, I&#x27;d suggest it to anyone</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup palette I have ever ordered off of Amazon! I believe this palette is way better than the naked palette. I defenetly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really good product for the price, read reviews that this product was comparable to the Naked brand pallet and it really is. I only wish more W7 products could be shipped to the US (for a better price).</li>
            <li> Very similar to the Naked 2 palette, but the colors are not exact. The applicator included is so small and flimsy, but is fine considering the price. I wish the container had a mirror, but otherwise this product is great.</li>
            <li> Love the eye shadows. Great pigmentation and wonderful value!</li>
            <li> For the price being super low I was surprised that I got a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors.  Good quality</li>
            <li> Really nice colors, but pretty low on color pigmentation, especially on the eyelid, and super chalky and powdery.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for an urban decay dupe, just something with similar colors that I could work with.  I just wanted a nice neutral palette and I&#x27;m finding that this is not it.  I&#x27;ve found applying them with a wet brush is better but I mostly regret buying this.</li>
            <li> The powders are so easily blend-able, and also they are easily placed on your brush and have so much coverage. I put some on as a smoky eye and it worked so well, I used sand as a base, Camel as a second color in the middle and on the outer corner I used onyx. Just warning the Onyx is a deep black and can cause a little bit of a mess, like I said this powder really does apply very easy to the brush and to your eye. This is an amazing palette. I love it a very nice dupe&amp;#60;3 Also its very easily rubbed off as well, so again warning!</li>
            <li> No cracked palettes, arrived 2 weeks early!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors I love this palette stays on great as well</li>
            <li> Will purchase again - I LOVE the colors and am having a great time playing with them all!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, natural colors.  A very good dupe of the Naked palette at a fraction of the cost.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Got it quickly, love the colors, good quality especially for its price! I&#x27;m a fan!!!:)</li>
            <li> Excellent colors, works as a substitute for the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette. You may have to apply double or triple layers for the colors to match the naked palette, but I love working my way up on the intensity of the colors. It stays all day and cause no irritation on my skin. The brush doesn&#x27;t work well at all!! its better if you use your own.</li>
            <li> The shadows are not as powdery compared to W7&#x27;s other palettes. The shimmery shadows, especially, perform superbly and have terrific pigmentation. The glitters are not chunky at all, and the metallic sheen in the shadows can compare to higher end shadows. The matte shadows, as in the other palettes, are disappointing and have little pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shimmer shadows transfer just a little bit, and resist water relatively well if not messed with while wet. The matte shadows and lighter shades immediately fade, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s great quality, and much much much better than W7&#x27;s other &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; of UD Naked palettes. This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. It does crease very easily and quickly though.</li>
            <li> Nice Natural Colors ... The quality of the items have been very satisfactory for their purpose.</li>
            <li> Love this Dup! Colors are fantastic, go on easy, blend well and last long. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Palette came in just as described. Except, the top was partly coming off. The back of the top had come off. Also, brush inside palette was a bit bent (separated) at tip. Made me a bit uncomfortable but glad my palette came in and glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li> Love it! &amp; I still have it from over a year ago. Last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and the colors look great on eyes. I&#x27;m glad that I got something really good, for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Knock off of NAKED????&lt;br /&gt;So far this has worked for me.  The eyeshadow brush that came with it quickly fell apart. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the tin is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The shadows have too much shimmer for a 40 something... I like matte.  But even if I just use half--- still a great tool kit.</li>
            <li> Love it 😍😍😍 such good pigmentation and great dupe to UD Naked 2. Only complain is that the eyeshadow isn&#x27;t as velvety but it&#x27;s okay for the price it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, awesome palette! Box came a little dented, but who cares when you get a great palette for such a low price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased with the range of colors in the taupe range.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to create a flattering look.  Great item very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m not ready to break the bank on a Naked palette. But this palette is so pigmented and nice that I&#x27;m curious now to see how it compares. I definitely recommend this palette! I&#x27;m a huge fan of shimmer! I got the Buff palette and only 2 or 3 colors are matte, the rest is shimmer for days. Will be buying more palettes in the future.</li>
            <li> Colors are so beautiful!</li>
            <li> Colors are almost exact to the naked palette. I have never tried the naked palette but i think the naked palette is definitly better quality and will last a lot longer. But for the price, This is a GREAT dupe!! Thank you, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I loveee this palette! I use this everyday for day and night looks. Great quality for amazing price.</li>
            <li> What follows is an update;   the original is further down after the asterisks.    I&#x27;ve also added the update to the other palette I bought.      I am so,  so disappointed.   Initially it seemed like a heavenly dupe.    But as time has passed (and it&#x27;s not that much time),   the shadows have taken on an odd chalkiness and a weird texture.   I have absolutely no clue why - they&#x27;re treated no differently than any other palette I own.     I can now use perhaps 2 or 3 shades comfortably,  with the rest becoming patchy,  not there at all or too-much-work to blend.    I can&#x27;t give it more than 2 stars,  sadly.      ********************    For $10 (which included shipping from the UK!),  I really can&#x27;t complain.    So,  it&#x27;s not LORAC and it&#x27;s not UD.  Don&#x27;t go into this thinking you&#x27;re getting the exact same quality because you&#x27;ll be disappointed.    Now with that said,  this is a marvellous little palette and it IS worth buying if for no other reason than you want to experiment with nude colors but aren&#x27;t ready to shell out $50.  The brush?  Pretend it&#x27;s not there.  You need a proper brush.  The colours?  Now they are really,  really nice.  They&#x27;re not as soft/buttery as LORAC,  but they do go on lovely and blend extremely well,  and if you use a primer then you&#x27;ve got a sophisticated look that will last you all day.  2 or 3 of the shades do need a bit more building up to get a nice result,  but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.    All in all,  I&#x27;d have no hesitation buying again or recommending this palette.  Treat yourself - it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is wonderful, but the case was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  Colors are nice - but there aren&#x27;t as many matte shades as I&#x27;d hoped.  Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> The package came nicely secure and with no dings or breaks in the shadow. As a makeup junkie, I think the colors are a great comparison to the naked pallette but the quality isn&#x27;t near Naked. This crumbled like chalk and isn&#x27;t as pigmented but for the price it&#x27;s not bad at all. As other stated don&#x27;t buy this thinking this is an exact duplicate but it&#x27;s still a great buy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, package arrived faster than expected and in perfect condition! Very happy</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to ship, but the product is great! The colors are beautiful and mix well. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Good quality shadows. VERY happy with this item</li>
            <li> This is a great eye shadow palette. Very similar to the one I have seen in beauty stores. The colors are great and the shipping was quick! I recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> decent pigmentation, quite a bit of fallout though. do not expect quality equal to high end makeup, but for $6 its pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> The item was good I gave this a 4 star because the packaging was damaged but the colors worked perfectly</li>
            <li> This product shipped way faster than anticipated. Very good product, easy on the eyes. You&#x27;re welcome for the pun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but the eyeshadow textures are rather course and in no way, shape, or form smooth. The last a considerably long time and I in no way expected this to perform like high end eyeshadows, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> this is literally an exact copy of the Naked 2 palette which I already had. but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Very good quality glad I bought it ty!!</li>
            <li> I love this! It looks like it does in the picture. The colors are consistent through the day, and it never looks dull! This is a good, cheap alternative to the Naked Palletes by Urban Decay. It works for younger children first starting out or adults. Any age group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product, and I hope to be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Works all day. Love the colors and especially love the price !!! Awesome product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love it! I was suprised how fast it came in! I have no complaints. I can&#x27;t wait to order the rest of the collections ☺️</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are almost exactly like the named palet 2, absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Colors are identical to the urban decay 2 pallette. I was so impressed I want to buy the others. Only down side is that the brush isn&#x27;t very good and the actual container is cheaply made. But that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me since the actual product I&#x27;m using is perfect. Awesome buy.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful!  LOVE</li>
            <li> ordered 2 of these and I am in absolute love will purchase again for sure</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow... it blends great with the brush and is great for natural looks or you can apply it more heavy for evening looks. Versatile and beautiful</li>
            <li> Alot like the Naked Natural Palette but it&#x27;s just as good.Use all the time to get a dolled up look, natural or even smokey eye. Good for day or even looks.</li>
            <li> Not bad for under $10; a fair dupe for another popular palette, great if you&#x27;re on a budget or starting out with makeup. However if you&#x27;re used to high end products the novelty of it may wear off fast. The packaging is lightweight (could be a plus) and has a certain manufacturing scent. The product itself is a mix of hit or miss, just like any palette some colors are surprisingly buttery while others are just powdery with the usual amount of fallout. That said, the price is right for experimentation, especially if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying its more expensive dupe.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this pallet! The pigmentation is really good! And it&#x27;s cheap, I highly recommend ☺</li>
            <li> It came earlier than it said it would. I just have no words for it, it seems like something you would pay $30+ for. The brush on it&#x27;s own is something you would spend $10 on. I love this makeup pallet and will definetly be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> I decided to try the w7 &amp;#34;In the Buff&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;In the Nude&amp;#34; palettes.  I could not be any happier! The colors are beautiful and very pigmented and both palettes together cost less than 1/2 of what one Urban Decay Naked palette costs and work just as good if not better.  I was also impressed with Lucky Girl sending my order so quickly.  I was told my estimated delivery would be towards the end of September and I was so excited to find my package arrive later that week I purchased it (Not to mention the package was shipped from the UK). Some places in the U.S. take longer to ship and arrive.  All in all great product and great seller!</li>
            <li> Great for the wife and Daughter. They love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, arrived very quickly. The colors are light needs just alittle more pigmentation but goes on very nice n smooth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why people are saying this so so great and pigmented. i was seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it great prices for amazing products</li>
            <li> Not as great as the NAKED palletes by urban decay but simialr. You really have to layer the colors on to get a good pay-off.</li>
            <li> You are buying a knock off of Urban Decay Naked palettes for a fraction of the price.  I bought In the Nude and In the Night.  Packaging is ok.  Great colors in both.  Buy a good primer.  These are a great deal for the price.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
            <li> This palette is a really good dupe for the Naked 2 palette. Although the quality isn&#x27;t the same, it still does the job. My only complaint is that the lighter colors aren&#x27;t as opaque as I would like them to be but the darker colors are amazing!! As far as lasting power, I used my NYX white jumbo eye pencil as a primer and it seemed to stay on at least 6 hours perfectly fine. For ten bucks, this is a STEAL! :)</li>
            <li> Well, this does look like a good dup of Urban Decay.  But based on my experience, it would be better to save up and buy the Urban Decay Naked 2 full for $50 or the Urban Decay Naked 2 essentials for $30.  My original Urban Decay Naked 2 lasted for a long time so I was definitely looking into buying a new one or just singles to try to get through.  But I saw this and thought, even with shipping a fifth of the price!  It was worth only the price charged.  The colors are nice but the powder is chalky which makes blending or controlling areas very difficult.  The brush is a throwaway and the packaging is cheap as well.  But main problem is the chalky powder.  Now I wished I had saved the money towards a replacement from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> the box top came off the first time  I opened..... no biggie.  shadows  are  good.</li>
            <li> Good price. Great size. Awesome colors!! And the palette it comes in is nice! I enjoy adding this to my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Came before estimated and blended very nicely</li>
            <li> This is a great set of nude eye shadows for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The lid broke off after only a few uses but the colors are great and they stay on well. Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great dupe to the naked pallets! Great colors and quality!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty nice and well pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;If you are starting with make-up this is something you want to try out to get started :)</li>
            <li> Love the colors. They&#x27;re all very pigmented and goes on decently smooth. The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because some of the shadows have a texture as if it were kind of old. A couple of them are a little hard and don&#x27;t go on as easily.</li>
            <li> Every time I walk into ulta I drool over the urban decay naked palettes, as a sahm of 4 kids I can&#x27;t justify spending $50 on eyeshadow. I saw the w7 palettes on YouTube and very quickly ordered all 3, the first one to arrive in the mail was &amp;#34;in the buff&amp;#34; I am in love!! Very little fall out, none of I use primer. I just received the other two palettes, THE COLORS!! My oh my! Beautiful, swatches are perfect, I&#x27;m so excited!! Can you tell...?</li>
            <li> This is probably the best dupe of the Naked 2 palette that I&#x27;ve come across. It&#x27;s not as pigmented as the Naked 2 Palette, but nonetheless - given the price - I would say it&#x27;s worth every penny. It has just the right amount of shimmer in each color and the shades blend pretty easily.</li>
