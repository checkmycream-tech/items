            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love all their products!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This has great reviews for being natural and hypoallergenic but it doesn&#x27;t smell very good and doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of suds.</li>
            <li>Amazing products by earth mama.</li>
            <li>I now make my own</li>
            <li>It smells like soap, not the fragrant kind, but non-scented soap (as advertised).</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not over powering</li>
            <li>I still did not make the connection until I ran out of my own body wash and just decided to use this one.</li>
            <li>Best natural product for babies!!!</li>
            <li>My children and I are very sensitive to fragrances and soaps - and this soap has worked out perfectly for us.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Best product for sensitive skin and eczema..</li>
            <li>Great lather and very gentle.  </li>
            <li>At first I was happy with this product and used it almost every day since my baby turned 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very important to use safe products in your children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I love Earth Mama products.</li>
            <li>Really Love this.</li>
            <li>I love earth</li>
            <li>Not in love with the scent</li>
            <li>I love earth</li>
            <li>Really nice soap with a light scent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, for myself, my baby, and my toddler girls.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>All the ingredients for these products are on the label, and you won&#x27;t find a better alternative - except for using a baking soda wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She outgrew the oily hair stage, but even then her hair always felt nice and clean after being washed with this soap.</li>
            <li>Seems to not irritate her skin but gets her nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I also love the pump dispenser - makes it easy to use when i&#x27;m holding a wriggly bathing babe in one hand and trying to lather her up in another.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo that lasted me 6 months with my 1yr old.  </li>
            <li>Also it does not leave hair with a manageable feeling, easy to move a comb through.</li>
            <li>but I had just assumed all baby shampoo would be tear free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a tear free formula</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not supposed to be tear free</li>
            <li>I guess that depends on the type of hair, as hair can vary greatly from person to person and at different life stages.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Love that they are rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; in EWG&#x27;s skin deep guide (lower is better!).</li>
            <li>I am a frugal person - but this soap is worth the splurge to keep us all from itching!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, especially for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and she smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I even use it to clean her toys.</li>
            <li>I love the whole EMAB line of organic products.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact it&#x27;s natural and gentle; however, the smell could be better.</li>
            <li>Love this product and this whole line.</li>
            <li>It is a mild soap so it may irritate baby&#x27;s eyes, but it&#x27;s safer than J&amp;J baby products, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Were looking for a mild body wash and shampoo for our infant, without any harmful chemicals, scents etc.</li>
            <li>I came across this product while researching home made recipes for baby wipes - and I quickly realized that my apprehension to shampoo, conditioner, and soap use was warranted.</li>
            <li>comes out foam, rinses very easily and natural</li>
            <li>Amazing, natural shampoo and body wash which I use for my baby girl since the first day she is born.</li>
            <li>No smell really, foams up nicely, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, great ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is natural stuff and makes your baby smell like an orange creamsicle!  :]</li>
            <li>This shampoo/wash works great for my little one who suffer from ezema.  </li>
            <li>I love how natural this product is, but it is basically just castile soap.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this soap but my 10-month old who hasn&#x27;t reacted to anything (granted, I try to use non-toxic products so he hasn&#x27;t been exposed to a lot) got a rash from this.  </li>
            <li>It says this right on the bottle</li>
            <li>love earth mama in general.</li>
            <li>It feels great afterwards - clean, soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Gentle for sensitive skin and the ingredients are safe</li>
            <li>and I love that it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Think I will try something more moisturizing though next time.</li>
            <li>and this worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Next time I think I may try the scented version since my daughter love the foaming soap.</li>
            <li>I do not like smell first of all, and It give a rush to my baby&#x27;s body</li>
            <li>Vinegar and honey will do the same thing safely of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our baby was born with a full head of long, wavy hair, and for some reason it gets oily very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so natural with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Very drying, but like the foaming pump system while handling squirming baby.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is not tear free.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>it really hurts her.</li>
            <li>but it is still just castile soap and therefore does not feel like it is really cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>I will have to see it there is a conditioner that is equally chemical free somewhere to compensate for this product&#x27;s downfalls.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves a clean dry feeling without the itchyness of bar soaps - so many people including my husband still feel the need to use conditioner although it is not necessary.</li>
            <li>I switched to Mustela body wash a few days before she turned two months and the bumps seemed to melt away of their own accord.</li>
            <li>mama baby wash soothes their skin and got rid of the dry patches that the honest co. Products left on their skin.</li>
            <li>: Hard water makes this product more useful.</li>
            <li>Stays out of her little face better.</li>
            <li>This line is consistently rated highly by EWG.org (a website rating the healthiness of different products).  </li>
            <li>Our baby had super dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be careful with the eyes than have a bunch of extra chemicals in there for the magical tear-free formula (which doesn&#x27;t come for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one was highly recommended on the web and it has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 for our first and second baby.</li>
            <li>im all for natural stuff for my baby!</li>
            <li>I have to be very careful and quick when washing her, as I don&#x27;t want her to eat soap.</li>
            <li>We have tried this product twice, once when my son was young and once for my daughter.</li>
            <li>mama angel baby and have used their products since my 3 year old was born.</li>
            <li>and it is comforting knowing that these products have listed ALL of the ingredients and they are all organic, natural and contain no parabens or sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li>I had used this on my baby without realizing that it was sucking all the natural moisture from her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter because she has food allergies and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>She is 2 years old</li>
            <li>It still does not leave hair comb-able or conditioned but this shampoo was gentle enough for use during henna applications and I will continue to use it that way.</li>
            <li>This is what I use head to toe on my 7 mo old baby.  </li>
            <li>ALot easier to use and direct than baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her hair clean and soft without the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Having had issues with hard water and laundry, I feel somewhat confident in saying that the Earth Mama Angel Baby shampoo does not wash out well due to the higher mineral content in the water.</li>
            <li>We only use these products on my daughter as she inherited my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it though - after all, I chose it because it was so bare bones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hubby doesn&#x27;t like the natural smell of the soap without scents, so next time we will be trying the vanilla orange.</li>
            <li>Incidentally you need two hands to dispense the shampoo, one to hold the light weight cylindrical bottle and the other to push down the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is what I use head to toe on my 7 mo old baby.  </li>
            <li> ALot easier to use and direct than baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It keeps her hair clean and soft without the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Having had issues with hard water and laundry, I feel somewhat confident in saying that the Earth Mama Angel Baby shampoo does not wash out well due to the higher mineral content in the water.</li>
            <li> We only use these products on my daughter as she inherited my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it though - after all, I chose it because it was so bare bones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hubby doesn&#x27;t like the natural smell of the soap without scents, so next time we will be trying the vanilla orange.</li>
            <li> Incidentally you need two hands to dispense the shampoo, one to hold the light weight cylindrical bottle and the other to push down the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At one month, I started noticing small reddish bumps all over her body and attributed it to eczema ( the doctor later confirmed that it was due to dry skin).</li>
            <li> Given all the horrible chemicals out there, I feel pretty good about using Earth Mama products on my baby.  </li>
            <li> Far too much debris is left behind and this shampoo helps remove it without removing the color.</li>
            <li> Works on my newborn &amp; like everyone has said, no major suds for a bubble bath</li>
            <li> Most of the US has hard water; we have very hard, and it&#x27;s caused numerous issues in our house.</li>
            <li> only thing to keep in mind is that this is not a tear-free shampoo, so be careful with the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving two stars because I appreciate the company&#x27;s efforts and do think that there&#x27;s potential in other water conditions.</li>
            <li> One strange thing I noticed is that she likes licking it!</li>
            <li> I have recently switched all of our products at home to non-harmful substances due to the rise in cancer prevalence as well as poisoning that occurs when children accidentally consume or get into chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I plan to use it with our new baby due in a few weeks as well.  </li>
            <li> I used it after applying henna and the loose henna still stayed on my scalp after shampooing twice.</li>
            <li> I have used the nipple butter from this brand and love that one, but very disappointed with this particular product).</li>
            <li> It is extremely drying (my kiddo itches his head constantly now), and leaves a harsh soap smell for days.</li>
            <li> so you need to be careful not to get it in the eyes!</li>
            <li> We wash it every other day with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had forgotten why we disliked it the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful around her eyes, but even when some soapy water drips down occasionally, she has never cried, so I guess it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for past 2 years for my Baby Daughter..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately needed to go back to J&amp;J baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or fumes!</li>
            <li> We moved and found that hard water situations require a shampoo like this.</li>
            <li> For something that is supposed to be scent free it smelt horrible.</li>
            <li> That at least is tear-free.</li>
            <li> Which is weird because it&#x27;s bitter</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how dry it made my skin.</li>
            <li> It just felt dirty and tangled after using this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Earth Mama products. Love that they are rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; in EWG&#x27;s skin deep guide (lower is better!). Cleans well, does not stink or leave residue on baby. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Very drying, but like the foaming pump system while handling squirming baby. Like that it is rated zero by the EWG. Think I will try something more moisturizing though next time.</li>
            <li> For something that is supposed to be scent free it smelt horrible. It made my kid throw up in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> Best natural product for babies!!! I now make my own but if I dont have time I just buy this one!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that lasted me 6 months with my 1yr old.  The only problem is that it is not tear free.  It says this right on the bottle but I had just assumed all baby shampoo would be tear free.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my GG&#x27;s skin and easy to wash out of her hair too!</li>
            <li> I love how natural this product is, but it is basically just castile soap. It is extremely drying (my kiddo itches his head constantly now), and leaves a harsh soap smell for days.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin! Not drying  and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the job done. I love that it&#x27;s so natural with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this soap but my 10-month old who hasn&#x27;t reacted to anything (granted, I try to use non-toxic products so he hasn&#x27;t been exposed to a lot) got a rash from this.  (We think it was this, if it turns out not to be, I will update my review!)</li>
            <li> Great product! It is a mild soap so it may irritate baby&#x27;s eyes, but it&#x27;s safer than J&amp;J baby products, in my opinion. This is natural stuff and makes your baby smell like an orange creamsicle!  :]</li>
            <li> My children and I are very sensitive to fragrances and soaps - and this soap has worked out perfectly for us. I am a frugal person - but this soap is worth the splurge to keep us all from itching! It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the whole EMAB line of organic products. This is no exception. Just don&#x27;t get it in baby&#x27;s eyes!!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact it&#x27;s natural and gentle; however, the smell could be better.</li>
            <li> Feel good using this product on my baby.  It&#x27;s not a tear free formula so you need to be careful not to get it in the eyes!</li>
            <li> Love it! Amazing, natural shampoo and body wash which I use for my baby girl since the first day she is born.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for past 2 years for my Baby Daughter.. Really Love this.</li>
            <li> Burns eyes. Leaves &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; or something on eyelids even after rinsing face with a lot of water. Haven&#x27;t figured it out but this is definitely NOT tear-free. Unfortunately needed to go back to J&amp;J baby shampoo. That at least is tear-free.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 for our first and second baby. Gentle for sensitive skin and the ingredients are safe</li>
            <li> Love this non-toxic (EWG rating is great) shampoo and body wash. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent which could irritate my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> We have tried this product twice, once when my son was young and once for my daughter. Unfortunately, I had forgotten why we disliked it the first time. Hair smells after using this. It smells like soap, not the fragrant kind, but non-scented soap (as advertised). Having had issues with hard water and laundry, I feel somewhat confident in saying that the Earth Mama Angel Baby shampoo does not wash out well due to the higher mineral content in the water. If the shampoo is not washing out, the dirt is not washing out. Most of the US has hard water; we have very hard, and it&#x27;s caused numerous issues in our house. I&#x27;m giving two stars because I appreciate the company&#x27;s efforts and do think that there&#x27;s potential in other water conditions.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very important to use safe products in your children&#x27;s skin. I love earth mama angel baby and have used their products since my 3 year old was born. It smells nice but not over powering and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals or fumes!</li>
            <li> great organic option if you do not have time to make your own.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase overall. Were looking for a mild body wash and shampoo for our infant, without any harmful chemicals, scents etc. This one was highly recommended on the web and it has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> Not in love with the scent</li>
            <li> im all for natural stuff for my baby! have used this since birth. my son is almost 7 months now. highly recommend this product! love earth mama in general.</li>
            <li> We only use these products on my daughter as she inherited my sensitive skin and it is comforting knowing that these products have listed ALL of the ingredients and they are all organic, natural and contain no parabens or sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li> Amazing products by earth mama. Works best compared to the honest co. Products&lt;br /&gt;My kids have eczema and earth mama baby wash soothes their skin and got rid of the dry patches that the honest co. Products left on their skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, especially for sensitive skin! I used Johnson and Johnson,  California baby, Aveeno. They all gave my lo baby acne. I have used this and the lotion since he was a nb and never looked back. It lasts forever too.</li>
            <li> Used this in my baby&#x27;s bottom wash, in leiu of baby wipe solution. Works great.</li>
            <li> At first I was happy with this product and used it almost every day since my baby turned 3 weeks. At one month, I started noticing small reddish bumps all over her body and attributed it to eczema ( the doctor later confirmed that it was due to dry skin). I switched to Mustela body wash a few days before she turned two months and the bumps seemed to melt away of their own accord. I still did not make the connection until I ran out of my own body wash and just decided to use this one. I was shocked at how dry it made my skin. I had used this on my baby without realizing that it was sucking all the natural moisture from her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learnt: Always try the products on yourself before putting them on your baby. I will not be ordering this product again (Note: I have used the nipple butter from this brand and love that one, but very disappointed with this particular product).</li>
            <li> I love earth mama angel baby!  This line is consistently rated highly by EWG.org (a website rating the healthiness of different products).  Given all the horrible chemicals out there, I feel pretty good about using Earth Mama products on my baby.  I&#x27;ve used this non-scented version as well as the scented citrusy version and both are good.  I also love the pump dispenser - makes it easy to use when i&#x27;m holding a wriggly bathing babe in one hand and trying to lather her up in another.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really nice soap with a light scent. Our baby had super dry skin and this worked pretty well. It&#x27;s not supposed to be tear free but it hasn&#x27;t bothered our kid when it gets into his face and eyes.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo but if it gets in my babies eyes it really hurts her.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Next time I think I may try the scented version since my daughter love the foaming soap.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this whole line.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter because she has food allergies and extremely sensitive skin.  She is 2 years old and I plan to use it with our new baby due in a few weeks as well.  The soap is unscented but, works great and she smells clean.  I find it works well in her hair also.  I was unsure of it after reading some reviews,  but I am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, for myself, my baby, and my toddler girls. No smell really, foams up nicely, mild, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, great ingredients.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works on my newborn &amp; like everyone has said, no major suds for a bubble bath</li>
            <li> This shampoo/wash works great for my little one who suffer from ezema.  It keeps her hair clean and soft without the harsh chemicals.  Love it!</li>
            <li> great product! stoked!</li>
            <li> I do not like it at all,  I do not like smell first of all, and It give a rush to my baby&#x27;s body</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  This was a baby gift, and the mother loves it for her child.</li>
            <li> This has great reviews for being natural and hypoallergenic but it doesn&#x27;t smell very good and doesn&#x27;t produce a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before settling on a shampoo/soap for our baby. I wanted something as simple and free of unnecessary chemicals as possible. So I feel good using this product. It also works great for us - it does its job, and is very easy to apply in its foamy state. Some reviews say that hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel washed afterwards. I guess that depends on the type of hair, as hair can vary greatly from person to person and at different life stages. Our baby was born with a full head of long, wavy hair, and for some reason it gets oily very quickly. We wash it every other day with this shampoo. It feels great afterwards - clean, soft and fluffy. We&#x27;ve been using the product on both her hair and body with no problems. Somebody mentioned a smell - yes, if you don&#x27;t rinse well enough and there&#x27;s soap residue left in the hair, it does smell a bit soapy. But now I make a point to rinse well, and after that there&#x27;s no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to keep in mind is that this is not a tear-free shampoo, so be careful with the eyes. I don&#x27;t mind it though - after all, I chose it because it was so bare bones. I&#x27;d rather be careful with the eyes than have a bunch of extra chemicals in there for the magical tear-free formula (which doesn&#x27;t come for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: We&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;cosmetics&amp;#34; product I have ever used on my baby, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it, so I&#x27;m very happy! She outgrew the oily hair stage, but even then her hair always felt nice and clean after being washed with this soap. We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it not being a tear-free formula. I&#x27;m careful around her eyes, but even when some soapy water drips down occasionally, she has never cried, so I guess it&#x27;s not too bad. One strange thing I noticed is that she likes licking it! Which is weird because it&#x27;s bitter (I tried it). I have to be very careful and quick when washing her, as I don&#x27;t want her to eat soap. Babies don&#x27;t make sense.on&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> Love all their products!</li>
            <li> Best product for sensitive skin and eczema.. I use it as well from time to time and I love that it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> The pump bottle for this product creates a foamy shampoo-ish type lather but it is still just castile soap and therefore does not feel like it is really cleaning my hair. I used it after applying henna and the loose henna still stayed on my scalp after shampooing twice. Also it does not leave hair with a manageable feeling, easy to move a comb through. It just felt dirty and tangled after using this product. I will have to see it there is a conditioner that is equally chemical free somewhere to compensate for this product&#x27;s downfalls. Incidentally you need two hands to dispense the shampoo, one to hold the light weight cylindrical bottle and the other to push down the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Hard water makes this product more useful. We moved and found that hard water situations require a shampoo like this. It still does not leave hair comb-able or conditioned but this shampoo was gentle enough for use during henna applications and I will continue to use it that way. I always ignore henna instructions to just rinse the application out with water. Far too much debris is left behind and this shampoo helps remove it without removing the color.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  This is what I use head to toe on my 7 mo old baby.  I&#x27;ve used it on her since she was born.  Great lather and very gentle.  I even use it to clean her toys.</li>
            <li> I like this foam.  ALot easier to use and direct than baby shampoo.  Stays out of her little face better. Seems to not irritate her skin but gets her nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! comes out foam, rinses very easily and natural</li>
            <li> I have recently switched all of our products at home to non-harmful substances due to the rise in cancer prevalence as well as poisoning that occurs when children accidentally consume or get into chemicals. I came across this product while researching home made recipes for baby wipes - and I quickly realized that my apprehension to shampoo, conditioner, and soap use was warranted. All the ingredients for these products are on the label, and you won&#x27;t find a better alternative - except for using a baking soda wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this same bottle for about six months on our toddler and on us occasionally. The shampoo leaves a clean dry feeling without the itchyness of bar soaps - so many people including my husband still feel the need to use conditioner although it is not necessary. Vinegar and honey will do the same thing safely of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby doesn&#x27;t like the natural smell of the soap without scents, so next time we will be trying the vanilla orange.</li>
