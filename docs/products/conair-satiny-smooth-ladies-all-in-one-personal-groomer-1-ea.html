            <li>A good purchase and glad I found this model.</li>
            <li>I really liked this item while it worked.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews looking for one I could use for this purpose and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li>nice hair removal product for the money.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>Well I really liked this product ....</li>
            <li>Shaves efficiently and effectively.</li>
            <li>This is a nice design and has two attachments.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest after using this razor</li>
            <li>I really liked the eyebrow trimming tool.  </li>
            <li>Good, but could be better.</li>
            <li>I just wanted something that would tidy up, without causing injury.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for the price.</li>
            <li>But if you need neat and tidy with no pain plus a nice eyebrow grooming, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I ran across this one and she could not be mored thrilled.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it for this great price!</li>
            <li>Best option for this old gal, but need better tools!</li>
            <li>Not bad great shipping</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t elaborate much on this one, but my wife seems to be very happy with it</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change and the product feels like good quality.</li>
            <li>Great razor and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shaver, simply, easy to plug in, charge, etc.</li>
            <li>Very easy to care for.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to to use .</li>
            <li>this one is by far the best and cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Perfect so far, like using in shower</li>
            <li>We thought it might be that the hair was too course or too fine, so I let someone else try the item, just to be sure I was giving it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, the eyebrow trimmer isn&#x27;t what I expected but still a good product.</li>
            <li>Top just twists off very easy.  </li>
            <li>first couple of times I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>This has a lot of handy attachments and they are easy to take on and off the unit.  </li>
            <li>Good products and quick shipping</li>
            <li>Good for quick shave.</li>
            <li>Great for fine facial hair but doesn&#x27;t work so great on coarser hair  plus</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable and has so many attachments.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the choice I made.  </li>
            <li>i kept using it, hoping i would get better results</li>
            <li>Love all the attachments.  </li>
            <li>Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li>Too many interchangeable pieces.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s removes most of the hair on your body.</li>
            <li>love it they got here on time</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>wife love this</li>
            <li>While this one is more gentile, it lacks the power that the razors designed for men&#x27;s beards have.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I think I like the shape of this trimmer better, it is easier to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll update as I try it more, but for now, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>This thing does the job for sure.  </li>
            <li>Now I use this much better.</li>
            <li>To shave that area, however, it works well, but you may have to do it more often.</li>
            <li>They seem to have more problems.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>Enjoying using in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I decided also I needed more options.  </li>
            <li>It took me awhile to choose another model and I am so glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>I love the additional attachments.</li>
            <li>So I am glad I gave it to her for Christmas</li>
            <li>I had more luck with a pair of tweezers</li>
            <li>I wanted an electric razor to be able to use on my legs if I didn&#x27;t have time to use a razor.</li>
            <li>This personal groomer is wonderful on my bikini line.  </li>
            <li>I mostly purchased this to keep the downstairs trimmed (TMI?).</li>
            <li>I was mostly attracted to this by the price.</li>
            <li>Will stick with the Remington Shower Safe shaver I bought 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a better one, I did.</li>
            <li>I should have read more reviews before I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It has all the tools I need for a silky smooth Brazilian, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or pull like some others I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li>My husbands Wahl beard trimmer is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>creams are more comfortable!</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted it for the eyebrow attachment,</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Very functional, works great.</li>
            <li>It really works great.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does more than she needs it for</li>
            <li>Glad to find it again here at amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>So glad I chose this one from all the ones I looked at.  </li>
            <li>She is no longer able to shave in the shower as she doesn&#x27;t see all that well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but I am glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li>I went over and over many times.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for trimming but thats about it</li>
            <li>Great and fast to use</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.</li>
            <li>I only just received this today, and whereas the instructions say to wait for 12 uses to truly see good results, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Works great really like it.</li>
            <li>Love it works wonders</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Great for bikini area not so much for the legs</li>
            <li>The attachment for trimming eyebrows is great and  gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>this multi use beauty kit is so cute.</li>
            <li>I love my  shaver.</li>
            <li>The top of the shaver would fall off each and every time I used it...  </li>
            <li>I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>I chose this over a Remington model based on slightly better reviews and regretted it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a better rating if it maintained a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I have use/used many electric razors including the epilator.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the bikini trimmer worked wonderfully, and that is ultimately what I intended this product for.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I bought it to trim my girlfriend&#x27;s pubic hair as a part of love making ritual.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my bikini area but it works well on my legs too.</li>
            <li>I wish women had more, and better choices for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic works much better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this razor</li>
            <li>I think that this was one very useful groomer without the burn from shaving!</li>
            <li>I can easily go a month for my legs, and what hair I do get (along the shin bone) is very fine.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this groomer, but it never even turned on despite it being charged for 16+ hours.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Nice grasp friendly size.</li>
            <li>and yes it even comes with a brush to clean it and some kind of oil idk wut its for yet but</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, packing was great, and the charging station holds all attachment pieces for easy use.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>At first this product worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>Battery life is long and it works great in the shower!</li>
            <li>The first two times I used it were good.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good, not a close shave, so don&#x27;t throw out your disposable razors you will need to use it for the stubbles to get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>The top comes off easily, but for a first its a good start</li>
            <li>the top does indeed pop off rather easily.</li>
            <li>There are many attachments, which make it easy to use.</li>
            <li>This Conair Satiny Smooth Ladie&#x27;s Personal Groomer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and is ready to use and clean</li>
            <li>So far the shave has been great.</li>
            <li>Great for an old lady who never has a man touch her legs.</li>
            <li>But so far, it works great</li>
            <li>If you want cheap, cheap is what you get!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin totally soft, all accesories worked great.</li>
            <li>it works really good - for fast results and no razor burns.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really have a good comparison to compare this to.</li>
            <li>Works good, BUT is not water proof if it gets too much water</li>
            <li>This is a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>its nice and arrived at right time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too thrilled about, never have been, maybe I just don&#x27;t use it right, but to me, it doesnt let the razor do its job.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably a better product for people with light and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Other then that though it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I searched online and this one seemed like the best option due to the reviews and price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this razor and having fun using all the attachments!</li>
            <li>It is not bad!</li>
            <li>Easy to change out the heads even though I tend to just use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Head falls off easily.</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to hold and to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch trimmer heads.</li>
            <li>so I figured this would be easy, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Says it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easy, can be used in the shower, and it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, in delacate areas.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle; I just hope the motor holds up over the years.</li>
            <li>I really liked how the product worked, but I really think I should have gotten more than 5 or 6 uses out of it...</li>
            <li>This is great so many different attachments &amp; the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>Easy for her to use.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to configure.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy, no &amp;#34;maintenance,&amp;#34; no pain.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li>Love this shiver compact and easy to clean</li>
            <li>Charges easy</li>
            <li>this is easy</li>
            <li>Easy on tender skin</li>
            <li>I liked it, but the first time I used it, it wouldn&#x27;t catch a charge.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to be precise as there are two sizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first and second use it worked great!</li>
            <li>Verry smooth and easy to use</li>
            <li>This seemed to work just fine until my daughter needed an electric razor</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine for the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It would probably e fine for underarms or bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I use one now that never cuts me, never dies, and shaves much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to add I was pleased to get it so quickly.</li>
            <li>but it does ok for a quick job.</li>
            <li>I love all the attachments and it works great in the shower or dry.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this when I received it, it functioned great for about a month and a half</li>
            <li>Love this shaver it gets all the hair the first use!</li>
            <li>This little shaver is wonderful for the price!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to give you smooth legs, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>This is a great personal groomer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charges great and lasts the entire session.</li>
            <li>but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The versatility from all the different heads is great, and it keeps a charge well.  </li>
            <li>Grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It was great to trim up smaller areas.</li>
            <li>Leaves my legs smooth</li>
            <li>if it seems not quite as smooth it will get there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>its a cheap product.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use primarily as a bikini shaver.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>I used it once or twice and got a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Yeah it&#x27;ll trim ya up but don&#x27;t expect it to make you silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor is light and has a comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>Great idea, but the head came off the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>The light is on that shows it is charging</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>I tried every attachment and none of them offered a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has all kinds of attachments, and it is easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li>The light on the razor works showing me that it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>The razor is comfortable to hold..</li>
            <li>The comb also blocks quite a bit of the razor and prevents smooth, efficient hedge-trimming.  </li>
            <li>It was a cheap buy</li>
            <li>I use a shaver primarily to touch up my legs and for my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Parts seemed cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work great - especially with soapy water.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, doesn&#x27;t nick, pull or pinch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;IT is smooth and does not pinch or bind.  </li>
            <li>The stroke is just as smooth</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t stay attached, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smooth shave the head pops off with any pressure applied.</li>
            <li>Thats what I get for being cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li>LEAVES THE BODY SMOOTH</li>
            <li>It did not give anything close to a smooth shave on any level for legs or bikini line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in my hand, which I also like.</li>
            <li>Because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too cheap.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>but I was primarily buying for bikini trimmer</li>
            <li>I am happy with it, especially bikini trimmer</li>
            <li>Worked great but stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li>but like people said, dont expect it to get completely smooth and don&#x27;t even bother using on legs because it doesnt work.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job, it quiet and cleans so nicely.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old one</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>i wasent expecting it to be so good, but was greatly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far it has not done a good job shaving my legs, but I am willing to give it a shot and be sure it is not operator error.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and will replace it with the same model when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>First time use the top came off.</li>
            <li>Great for under arms but causes minor irritation on bikini area if close attention is not paid.</li>
            <li>The price was friendly.</li>
            <li>I returned it and got the Remington which is the manufacturer of the model I was originally replacing.</li>
            <li>The first unit stopped holding a charge after about 3 years, but other than that is was perfect.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly, powerful, and effective.  </li>
            <li>But it will eventually clean the area being shaved.</li>
            <li>It said it comes with oil to clean it</li>
            <li>You just aren&#x27;t going to get those super smooth results with this device.</li>
            <li>it shaved my legs in one clean stoke</li>
            <li>It keeps me clean and close and has never hurt me.</li>
            <li>the best part about it other than it being gentle is the color.</li>
            <li>just wish it came with a bag or pouch to carry it in  to make it easy to throw in my travel bag, since I live out of a suitcase most of the time.</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviewers that it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for shaving legs because it&#x27;s so small, but it&#x27;s perfect for my bikini area.</li>
            <li>I liked this razor at first, but it stopped giving me much of a shave at all after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li>The stand is sort of cool too.</li>
            <li>Overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li>But overall this is a good product and the charge lasts.</li>
            <li>good selection of attachments that allow you to use on various parts of the body.</li>
            <li>We have purchased three different Conair clippers and have loved each one.</li>
            <li>it cost more to replace the battery than it did to just replace the whole product.</li>
            <li>Overall and for the price a good buy.</li>
            <li>This personal razor works really good.  </li>
            <li>Def good enough though.</li>
            <li>As the headline states, not bad.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s time consuming to clean the blades, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love being able to take this in the shower and then use it outside the shower too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using this on your legs because it doesn&#x27;t do a super close job.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a product that could get a super close shave without pinching but thats not the case with this product.</li>
            <li>I found out quickly</li>
            <li>The blades wore out really quick.</li>
            <li>I didnt feel comfortable with the teeth on this touching sensitive parts</li>
            <li>The battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li>love the extras especially the one for eyebrows love it</li>
            <li>Overall it is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t shave very clean</li>
            <li>ran very hot after a while but pouring water on it helps</li>
            <li>Great for about 6 months or less.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s first razor and she lives it!  </li>
            <li>but im not mad since it&#x27;s not meant for shaving.</li>
            <li>The razor lost all its sharpness before it was even time to charge it for the first time!</li>
            <li>, It does EXACTLY what I need it to do!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t replaced a wet shave but is good in between for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>The price is right at about how much I wanted to spend and am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>Was really hoping this could be used easily for quick touch ups,  unfortunately not</li>
            <li>It worked great for a few minutes til the head won&#x27;t stay on at all now.</li>
            <li>I simply love the close soft shave of this razor.  </li>
            <li>Really useful tool.</li>
            <li>Extra attachments are nice too</li>
            <li>The shaving head spontaneously pops off in the middle of use.</li>
            <li>and the says it&#x27;s better than her old one.</li>
            <li>Cannot seem to find anything worth, well... anything anymore.</li>
            <li>I hope the shaver will be useful for taking the pilling off my cashmere this winter.  </li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer is definitely useful for maintaining minute hairs in practically any place.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like I had a months worth of growth to cut.</li>
            <li>touched the blade and not even worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more compact replacement for my old Panasonic shaver, and for the price, it was worth taking a risk on this one.  </li>
            <li>The different pieces that fit on are ok.</li>
            <li>I would say that you get what you pay for, but this product wasn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this razor so far.</li>
            <li>This one was purchased for a young teen who is also happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>Gives a decent shave and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Satiny Smooth is stretching it, however it is far superior and comfortable than any other.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because it is supposedly a reliable brand and due to good reviews.</li>
            <li>This package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>I was excited t get this as I have had other Conair products and liked them.</li>
            <li>The best wet dry shaver under $40.</li>
            <li>And with summer in full swing, get that bikini area ready ladies.</li>
            <li>This shaver is more for face, bikini, underarm, and general touch ups.</li>
            <li>this works great no more in the bath and all that pain in the</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not pull the hair while shaving, Great little kit and charges fast.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this product to use as a trimmer for my bikini area, and was excited to use it as a shaver for my legs as well.</li>
            <li>This simple little shaver is perfect for bikini area.</li>
            <li>Great little razor for cleaning up the lady parts, but not so much the legs...</li>
            <li>and it made quick work of my whole body.</li>
            <li>For the most part I don&#x27;t get much irritation and for my sensitive skin that is saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, rechargeable and comes with a lot of attachments so you can use it for multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li>This is a good razor but it gets hot when I use some if the attachments and leaves black marks in my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>the first couple times i used it</li>
            <li>Very unsanitary!</li>
            <li>Wish it got a closer shave, but this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>I actually had a cheaper type that was better.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, a men&#x27;s Gillette disposable razor does a better job.</li>
            <li>The mesh attachment broke after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My first try with this</li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Broke after first three uses (part attached to the blade fell off and did not stay on).</li>
            <li>This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First let me start off saying it takes 16 hours to charge the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely matter and looks exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>This is the first device that I&#x27;ve ever had like this.</li>
            <li>First off it tells you to give it 14 days to allow your hair to be use to electric shaving</li>
            <li>worked the first time and then it doesn&#x27;t wish I had the box to return  </li>
            <li>bought it as my daughter&#x27;s first razor.  </li>
            <li>I only use this on my bikini area and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric trimmer I ever bought.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver!  </li>
            <li>Awesome...tried many different razors for the bikini area..</li>
            <li>Works better on a man&#x27;s back than a woman&#x27;s bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a decent job for quick shaves.</li>
            <li>First 16hr charge did not turn on razor even though instructions said 30 minutesof use&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works ok, smaller than I thought.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try a different one with better ratings.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it in the entire bikini area without any issues.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As other reviews have said, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t damp!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and it&#x27;s getting the job done</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews and it was a mixed pool.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it seems like a good choice.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Definitely not for legs more for bikini area underarms too&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed-</li>
            <li>My favorite attachment is the trimmer, the second largest head.</li>
            <li>Broke the first day that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>We were attempting to replace a 10 year old electric razor that is in need of the foil and the blades to be replaced, and that razor STILL works better than this brand new one.</li>
            <li>I have used two other groomers in the last 5 years, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I like it for many little grooming tasks and for them it does just fine.</li>
            <li>It has different heads for whatever you need to clean up and gets very close for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>clean it, brush the hair out of the mechanisms, and use it only when full charged.</li>
            <li>I also love to use it on certain facial features.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea but wish i&#x27;d paid a few more dollars for something of higher quality instead of going with the cheap option.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter and she was so excited with it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for shaving legs, you are better off with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>The razor is good for smaller areas such as armpits or bikini, however, does not work for legs.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product if you plan on using it mostly as a bikini/eyebrow trimmer, not so much if you plan on using it to actually shave your legs.</li>
            <li>This is the only ladies multi use razor I have found available right now.  </li>
            <li>What a shame because I really did like it at first.</li>
            <li>It worked really well when i first got it.</li>
            <li>I will have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth it to replace the blade or to just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and comes with several attachments.</li>
            <li>but it is solidly built and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and has all the attachments needed for personal care.</li>
            <li>The various shaver heads etc pop on &amp; off easily.</li>
            <li>Some shavers will not even cut certain hair types...</li>
            <li>then it missed large areas and pulled the hairs rather than shaving them.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it might perform for large areas like legs.  </li>
            <li>I am really amazed at some of the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>Received it on time and it works great dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>Great for both wet and dry shaving.</li>
            <li>It is fine as a regular razor for legs.</li>
            <li>But other then that it works great and has a long charge on it too.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, she had course, and the third had in between hair....</li>
            <li>It has a nice little trimmer you can use on your eyebrows, adn I have used it</li>
            <li>really like the product.</li>
            <li>Also very convenient that it is a wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and the blades actually scratches my skin when shaving.  </li>
            <li>I do no have very course hair</li>
            <li>I came already charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for legs which is what i really wanted it for.</li>
            <li>and i am especially surprised knowing it from conair.</li>
            <li>Works well, compact, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>one really meets my needs.</li>
            <li>But it works really well on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my legs and bikini area and it grooms very well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li>Too much work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always ready for me to use.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and for the price has a lot of attachments</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a smooth feel like a razor does.  </li>
            <li>It shaved closely and in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>and it does not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well for her.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say too much at this time as I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>It provided a really close shave on the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Comb attachment doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>This is a very efficient product.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver, but the nose shaver is not working.  </li>
            <li>It gave me an acceptably smooth bikini shave (obviously not as close as with a razor, but way closer/smoother than I anticipated) and the parts are well made.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>It trims evenly and doesn&#x27;t tug too much.  </li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lose its charge, doesn&#x27;t rip up my skin, works very well.  </li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it too much, as I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cut thicker hair that well.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>Tank you for getting here as fast as you did.</li>
            <li>I like it better on a wet shave.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I hope it keeps working, because I really do like it.</li>
            <li>It has a charging stand with spots for all the accessories and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it as much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like this much, but then again I&#x27;m used to plastic razors.</li>
            <li>It does everything I want it to, charges well, and doesn&#x27;t take much cleaning between shaves.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this, just be careful not to catch any hairs in the corner</li>
            <li>It comes all ready charged.</li>
            <li>It works really well, again...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much luck with the eyebrow trimmer attachment</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about the product is that it has different heads that do different things.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it has different heads for different purposes, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>She says it is so much better than the old blade and especially loves the trimmer function.</li>
            <li>She can use it in the full light and sitting down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty small so very easy to hide discretely.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected!  </li>
            <li>I have had other electric razors that were a 100 times better.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for other body parts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend opting for a higher quality device even if it means spending a little more money.</li>
            <li>It also likes to catch and pull on some of the more unruly pieces, causing sharp pain in the lady bits.  </li>
            <li>OK Not a real close shave!</li>
            <li>I find other methods to be unsatisfactory as most of them require letting the hair grow out long enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>it does not have a short or clean cut.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to buy shavers and shaving cream every so often, and I get a clean enough shave.</li>
            <li>It works wet or dry and does a consistently good job.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close enough that you can go out and feel confident, but you may have to shave more often if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li>Fits on my small counter nicely.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it occasionally snags on my skin, but for the most part it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>Granted, don&#x27;t expect it to be like waxing or shaving, but it trims everything down to make it more manageable for waxing/shaving.</li>
            <li>The product is good for your armpits and private areas , but not a clean shave for your legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle, even when wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product is decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a decent time.</li>
            <li>It has been years since I have used an electric shaver, but as I have grown older this item is a necessity.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the attachments, but the part on the main head that is for longer hair doesn&#x27;t cut me the way some others have.</li>
            <li>(Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s decent return</li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon still carries the replacement foils and cutters and has a decent return policy.</li>
            <li>When I went back to reviews I found many saying the same thing.</li>
            <li>Better safe that sorry.</li>
            <li>Rated this as just OK because it does not cut well on coarse hair, it takes several passes to achieve a close shave.</li>
            <li>I mainly chose this unit based on reviews and size.  </li>
            <li>The main razor does not shave as close as I would like</li>
            <li>Eyebrow trimmer is a little tricky and gets hot on your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I think if I had the purchase to do over again, I would buy a highly rated razor and a separate highly rated trimmer, rather than a &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Quality is high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Works fine as I expected</li>
            <li>This did not work nearly as well as many of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li>Better than the little trimmers you buy in the drugstores for $10.  </li>
            <li>I love this little electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the little holder it comes with to charge the razor, and to hold all the heads.</li>
            <li>Wish they have a better way of storing the attachments as the little wanna be holder is not suffiencient.</li>
            <li>I love this little shaver.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This was for my 93 year old mother and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, but shaves closely and has lasted a while so far.</li>
            <li>that was so top heavy</li>
            <li>is that it seems like the blades are moving more slowly than when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 smaller Remington groomers that were just the right size, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small and fits nicely in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also handy that they provide not only the cleaning brush, but the little container of oil.</li>
            <li>I can live with it, but it has made me bleed.</li>
            <li>It does say in the packaging it can take your body a couple weeks to adjust to the new shaving method, so</li>
            <li>Know I have to look for a new one.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer works really good, the only downfall on it, is with the curved handle, its too bulky, so hard to manuever to trim, the comb attachement for the eyebrows</li>
            <li>It is ok but definitely not what was expected...</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t stand to feel stubble,) and so far it is holding a decent charge.  </li>
            <li>I will never again trust any positive reviews of any product as far as there are so many negative reviews of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for a very old remmington one that broke.</li>
            <li>This is the second Conair I have purchased and have never had any problem besides damaging the first one when I dropped it from a 10 foot height.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>ok, it took ALOT of research to find a trimmer that... A: fits snugly in my wife&#x27;s small feminine hands...</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to save some grey hairs form Grandma.</li>
            <li>it is better than any other personal groomer I have used.</li>
            <li>My old electric shaver quit so it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I completely regret buying this item and now have to search for something new.</li>
            <li>It does ok around the knees but is not good for a whole leg.</li>
            <li>It took several passes to clean completely, and depending on the direction you move the shaver in across the skin, the attachment will twist off in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li>I had not noticed how loose the connection is before I started shaving but after 2 or 3 minuets the shaver head popped off and the connection was even more loose.</li>
            <li>Works well, no nicks in &#x27;sensitive&#x27; (read &#x27;very sensitive&#x27;) areas.  </li>
            <li>Bought it to replace an old one (that wasn&#x27;t very old) that had started snagging and pulling hairs for some reason.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s those little fine hairs under the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and I am able to groom in last that half the time.  </li>
            <li>Only the large trimmer attachment works well.</li>
            <li>The little pieces don&#x27;t fit well in the stand and are a nuisance to store.</li>
            <li>This razor feels a little cheap, but it does the job</li>
            <li>I love this little shaver especially for the armpits and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I shaved half my eyebrow clean off.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I get a close shave, even in sensitive areas without any irritation.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving so much easier, such as trimming then going over the area.</li>
            <li>No way am I taking a razor blade to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9year old.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because I like to keep the playground well-landscaped while keeping some of the beauty and protection of the natural terrain.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the foil shaver really works because I use the triple blade things for my legs and underarms, and I don&#x27;t have long/crazy enough growth on my face to need the eyebrow shaping stuff.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the tray that comes with this tool set doesn&#x27;t really keep everything organized.  </li>
            <li>The last one I purchased tugged too much and hurt to use in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with this razor.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that it coud be improved if the cradle mounted directly to the outlet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a lot of problems shaving because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>My old Remington lasted about 6 years and still worked well until the rechargeable battery stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I already really like it.</li>
            <li>Yeah ladies, this is what you have to look forward to in old age.  </li>
            <li>I made sure i took it out of the shower after each use, dried it, and set it back on the charging the charging station.</li>
            <li>I let the good reviews for this razor talk me into getting one, but I&#x27;m sorry I did.  </li>
            <li>and my skin was a little dry at first but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Other then that, for the price, its well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>But for small use its fine.</li>
            <li>I was told by the instructions that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to the razor, but it does not give you a clean cut or feel.</li>
            <li>Bought it for mom and it works much better than any small trimmer for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Without the detail comb, the shaver works better but occasionally bites you and continues to create small divots on the field.  </li>
            <li>However, this little thing does a nice job on legs and delicate areas and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the sink.  </li>
            <li>Attachments do not fit properly and break easily.</li>
            <li>Plus the design of the comb makes it so that you actually have to be super careful about pinching yourself.</li>
            <li>I normally use this Personal Groomer just trim the hedges and a razor for any ground work.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on my legs a few times but it will never be a true razor.</li>
            <li>Wish I would of spent a little more money and got something that worked.</li>
            <li>(except did not come in a cute little pink case).</li>
            <li>With several different attaching heads, it&#x27;s very versatile.  </li>
            <li>Also, I bought this because it had a tidy solution for the attachments but not all of the attachments fit on the base.</li>
            <li>My two complaints are first: the handle heats up after a short time, secondly: it doesn&#x27;t cut the coarse hair as well as I needed it to.  </li>
            <li>Used it several times on coarser hair and it has worked well thus far!</li>
            <li>The foil does not cover sharp cutters, so it does not provide a close shave even on the first use.</li>
            <li>How come that something that apparently worked so wonderful for some, did a totally crap job for me, and from the negative reviews I can tell for many other people.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to the other attachments as I haven&#x27;t used them and probably won&#x27;t, but they appear to fit and function about like any other grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>I actually threw this shaver in the garbage after both my 12 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I would buy again, thus far - have only infrequent uses since it was purchased.</li>
            <li>I got it for my young granddaughter who scared me to death using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>It works like a champ even when I decide to be perfectly bare</li>
            <li>After two uses, this barely works.</li>
            <li>Go careful with the short size, it gets a VERY close shave!  </li>
            <li>I have better luck with the bikini attachment, but it is not great.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a more expensive Remington which was a good shaver but a lousy</li>
            <li>But it seems like perhaps it really isn&#x27;t going to last very long.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, works wet or dry, on long or short hair</li>
            <li>The battery runs out after about 20 minutes of continual use, but I&#x27;ve found that to be pretty typical for electric shavers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li>The only part worth a fart is the little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The charge stays active for much longer than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>As far as trimming in the bikini area, it gave a rudimentary trim that was tolerable, but there is only one attachment, so you only can have one trim length.</li>
            <li>I only use electric razors for my thighs and bikini area as these areas are too sensitive for a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I am able to do the whole \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; style bikini grooming with this having no problems with pinching or cutting.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the 2 position adjustable comb does not stay in the longer position, so if you want to look like an adult, you have to trim it back further than you probably want to and wait a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The size is smaller than other shavers I&#x27;ve used so I can really do a thorough job below the belt.  </li>
            <li>I barely used it twice since I bought it in mid June</li>
            <li>This one was reviewed better but was pretty much useless after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I may be giving a review a little too early as we have only used the one part so far.  </li>
            <li>Can a product be so good and so bad at the same time?</li>
            <li>I carefully took it apart to clear away hair.  </li>

            <li> Pleased with this and hope it lasts longer than others have after being dropped!</li>
            <li> disposable razors are better than this!</li>
            <li> The heads on this product need to be replaced quite often but the first 3 or 4 times of use they fuction perfectly</li>

            <li> Its great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great shaver is easy to use, very portable, and perfect for use all over.  </li>
            <li> This price and product look and sound great if you have a week to do your legs.</li>
            <li> It gives a great smooth shave</li>
            <li> A good purchase and glad I found this model.</li>
            <li> I really liked this item while it worked.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews looking for one I could use for this purpose and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li> nice hair removal product for the money.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> Well I really liked this product ....</li>
            <li> Shaves efficiently and effectively.</li>
            <li> This is a nice design and has two attachments.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest after using this razor</li>
            <li> I really liked the eyebrow trimming tool.  </li>
            <li> Good, but could be better.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something that would tidy up, without causing injury.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price.</li>
            <li> But if you need neat and tidy with no pain plus a nice eyebrow grooming, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I ran across this one and she could not be mored thrilled.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it for this great price!</li>
            <li> Best option for this old gal, but need better tools!</li>
            <li> Not bad great shipping</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t elaborate much on this one, but my wife seems to be very happy with it</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change and the product feels like good quality.</li>
            <li> Great razor and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shaver, simply, easy to plug in, charge, etc.</li>
            <li> Very easy to care for.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to to use .</li>
            <li> this one is by far the best and cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Perfect so far, like using in shower</li>
            <li> We thought it might be that the hair was too course or too fine, so I let someone else try the item, just to be sure I was giving it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the eyebrow trimmer isn&#x27;t what I expected but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Top just twists off very easy.  </li>
            <li> first couple of times I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> This has a lot of handy attachments and they are easy to take on and off the unit.  </li>
            <li> Good products and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Good for quick shave.</li>
            <li> Great for fine facial hair but doesn&#x27;t work so great on coarser hair  plus</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable and has so many attachments.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the choice I made.  </li>
            <li> i kept using it, hoping i would get better results</li>
            <li> Love all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li> Too many interchangeable pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s removes most of the hair on your body.</li>
            <li> love it they got here on time</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> wife love this</li>
            <li> While this one is more gentile, it lacks the power that the razors designed for men&#x27;s beards have.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I think I like the shape of this trimmer better, it is easier to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll update as I try it more, but for now, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> This thing does the job for sure.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this much better.</li>
            <li> To shave that area, however, it works well, but you may have to do it more often.</li>
            <li> They seem to have more problems.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> Enjoying using in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I decided also I needed more options.  </li>
            <li> It took me awhile to choose another model and I am so glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I love the additional attachments.</li>
            <li> So I am glad I gave it to her for Christmas</li>
            <li> I had more luck with a pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric razor to be able to use on my legs if I didn&#x27;t have time to use a razor.</li>
            <li> This personal groomer is wonderful on my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I mostly purchased this to keep the downstairs trimmed (TMI?).</li>
            <li> I was mostly attracted to this by the price.</li>
            <li> Will stick with the Remington Shower Safe shaver I bought 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a better one, I did.</li>
            <li> I should have read more reviews before I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It has all the tools I need for a silky smooth Brazilian, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or pull like some others I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> My husbands Wahl beard trimmer is much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> creams are more comfortable!</li>
            <li> I mostly wanted it for the eyebrow attachment,</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Very functional, works great.</li>
            <li> It really works great.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does more than she needs it for</li>
            <li> Glad to find it again here at amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> So glad I chose this one from all the ones I looked at.  </li>
            <li> She is no longer able to shave in the shower as she doesn&#x27;t see all that well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but I am glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I went over and over many times.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for trimming but thats about it</li>
            <li> Great and fast to use</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.</li>
            <li> I only just received this today, and whereas the instructions say to wait for 12 uses to truly see good results, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great really like it.</li>
            <li> Love it works wonders</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini area not so much for the legs</li>
            <li> The attachment for trimming eyebrows is great and  gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> this multi use beauty kit is so cute.</li>
            <li> I love my  shaver.</li>
            <li> The top of the shaver would fall off each and every time I used it...  </li>
            <li> I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this over a Remington model based on slightly better reviews and regretted it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a better rating if it maintained a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have use/used many electric razors including the epilator.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bikini trimmer worked wonderfully, and that is ultimately what I intended this product for.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I bought it to trim my girlfriend&#x27;s pubic hair as a part of love making ritual.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it for my bikini area but it works well on my legs too.</li>
            <li> I wish women had more, and better choices for hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works much better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this razor</li>
            <li> I think that this was one very useful groomer without the burn from shaving!</li>
            <li> I can easily go a month for my legs, and what hair I do get (along the shin bone) is very fine.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this groomer, but it never even turned on despite it being charged for 16+ hours.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> Nice grasp friendly size.</li>
            <li> and yes it even comes with a brush to clean it and some kind of oil idk wut its for yet but</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, packing was great, and the charging station holds all attachment pieces for easy use.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> At first this product worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> Battery life is long and it works great in the shower!</li>
            <li> The first two times I used it were good.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good, not a close shave, so don&#x27;t throw out your disposable razors you will need to use it for the stubbles to get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> The top comes off easily, but for a first its a good start</li>
            <li> the top does indeed pop off rather easily.</li>
            <li> There are many attachments, which make it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This Conair Satiny Smooth Ladie&#x27;s Personal Groomer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and is ready to use and clean</li>
            <li> So far the shave has been great.</li>
            <li> Great for an old lady who never has a man touch her legs.</li>
            <li> But so far, it works great</li>
            <li> If you want cheap, cheap is what you get!</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin totally soft, all accesories worked great.</li>
            <li> it works really good - for fast results and no razor burns.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really have a good comparison to compare this to.</li>
            <li> Works good, BUT is not water proof if it gets too much water</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> its nice and arrived at right time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too thrilled about, never have been, maybe I just don&#x27;t use it right, but to me, it doesnt let the razor do its job.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s probably a better product for people with light and fine hair.</li>
            <li> Other then that though it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I searched online and this one seemed like the best option due to the reviews and price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this razor and having fun using all the attachments!</li>
            <li> It is not bad!</li>
            <li> Easy to change out the heads even though I tend to just use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Head falls off easily.</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to hold and to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to switch trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> so I figured this would be easy, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Says it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easy, can be used in the shower, and it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, in delacate areas.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle; I just hope the motor holds up over the years.</li>
            <li> I really liked how the product worked, but I really think I should have gotten more than 5 or 6 uses out of it...</li>
            <li> This is great so many different attachments &amp; the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> Easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to configure.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy, no &amp;#34;maintenance,&amp;#34; no pain.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> Love this shiver compact and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Charges easy</li>
            <li> this is easy</li>
            <li> Easy on tender skin</li>
            <li> I liked it, but the first time I used it, it wouldn&#x27;t catch a charge.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to be precise as there are two sizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first and second use it worked great!</li>
            <li> Verry smooth and easy to use</li>
            <li> This seemed to work just fine until my daughter needed an electric razor</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine for the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It would probably e fine for underarms or bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I use one now that never cuts me, never dies, and shaves much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to add I was pleased to get it so quickly.</li>
            <li> but it does ok for a quick job.</li>
            <li> I love all the attachments and it works great in the shower or dry.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this when I received it, it functioned great for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> Love this shaver it gets all the hair the first use!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is wonderful for the price!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to give you smooth legs, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This is a great personal groomer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charges great and lasts the entire session.</li>
            <li> but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The versatility from all the different heads is great, and it keeps a charge well.  </li>
            <li> Grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was great to trim up smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Leaves my legs smooth</li>
            <li> if it seems not quite as smooth it will get there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> its a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use primarily as a bikini shaver.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice and got a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Yeah it&#x27;ll trim ya up but don&#x27;t expect it to make you silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor is light and has a comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but the head came off the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> The light is on that shows it is charging</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> I tried every attachment and none of them offered a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has all kinds of attachments, and it is easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> The light on the razor works showing me that it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable to hold..</li>
            <li> The comb also blocks quite a bit of the razor and prevents smooth, efficient hedge-trimming.  </li>
            <li> It was a cheap buy</li>
            <li> I use a shaver primarily to touch up my legs and for my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Parts seemed cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work great - especially with soapy water.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, doesn&#x27;t nick, pull or pinch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;IT is smooth and does not pinch or bind.  </li>
            <li> The stroke is just as smooth</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t stay attached, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smooth shave the head pops off with any pressure applied.</li>
            <li> Thats what I get for being cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li> LEAVES THE BODY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> It did not give anything close to a smooth shave on any level for legs or bikini line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in my hand, which I also like.</li>
            <li> Because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> My legs feel smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too cheap.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> but I was primarily buying for bikini trimmer</li>
            <li> I am happy with it, especially bikini trimmer</li>
            <li> Worked great but stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> but like people said, dont expect it to get completely smooth and don&#x27;t even bother using on legs because it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job, it quiet and cleans so nicely.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old one</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> i wasent expecting it to be so good, but was greatly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far it has not done a good job shaving my legs, but I am willing to give it a shot and be sure it is not operator error.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and will replace it with the same model when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> First time use the top came off.</li>
            <li> Great for under arms but causes minor irritation on bikini area if close attention is not paid.</li>
            <li> The price was friendly.</li>
            <li> I returned it and got the Remington which is the manufacturer of the model I was originally replacing.</li>
            <li> The first unit stopped holding a charge after about 3 years, but other than that is was perfect.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly, powerful, and effective.  </li>
            <li> But it will eventually clean the area being shaved.</li>
            <li> It said it comes with oil to clean it</li>
            <li> You just aren&#x27;t going to get those super smooth results with this device.</li>
            <li> it shaved my legs in one clean stoke</li>
            <li> It keeps me clean and close and has never hurt me.</li>
            <li> the best part about it other than it being gentle is the color.</li>
            <li> just wish it came with a bag or pouch to carry it in  to make it easy to throw in my travel bag, since I live out of a suitcase most of the time.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for shaving legs because it&#x27;s so small, but it&#x27;s perfect for my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor at first, but it stopped giving me much of a shave at all after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li> The stand is sort of cool too.</li>
            <li> Overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li> But overall this is a good product and the charge lasts.</li>
            <li> good selection of attachments that allow you to use on various parts of the body.</li>
            <li> We have purchased three different Conair clippers and have loved each one.</li>
            <li> it cost more to replace the battery than it did to just replace the whole product.</li>
            <li> Overall and for the price a good buy.</li>
            <li> This personal razor works really good.  </li>
            <li> Def good enough though.</li>
            <li> As the headline states, not bad.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s time consuming to clean the blades, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love being able to take this in the shower and then use it outside the shower too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using this on your legs because it doesn&#x27;t do a super close job.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that could get a super close shave without pinching but thats not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> I found out quickly</li>
            <li> The blades wore out really quick.</li>
            <li> I didnt feel comfortable with the teeth on this touching sensitive parts</li>
            <li> The battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li> love the extras especially the one for eyebrows love it</li>
            <li> Overall it is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t shave very clean</li>
            <li> ran very hot after a while but pouring water on it helps</li>
            <li> Great for about 6 months or less.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s first razor and she lives it!  </li>
            <li> but im not mad since it&#x27;s not meant for shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor lost all its sharpness before it was even time to charge it for the first time!</li>
            <li> , It does EXACTLY what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t replaced a wet shave but is good in between for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> The price is right at about how much I wanted to spend and am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this could be used easily for quick touch ups,  unfortunately not</li>
            <li> It worked great for a few minutes til the head won&#x27;t stay on at all now.</li>
            <li> I simply love the close soft shave of this razor.  </li>
            <li> Really useful tool.</li>
            <li> Extra attachments are nice too</li>
            <li> The shaving head spontaneously pops off in the middle of use.</li>
            <li> and the says it&#x27;s better than her old one.</li>
            <li> Cannot seem to find anything worth, well... anything anymore.</li>
            <li> I hope the shaver will be useful for taking the pilling off my cashmere this winter.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer is definitely useful for maintaining minute hairs in practically any place.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like I had a months worth of growth to cut.</li>
            <li> touched the blade and not even worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more compact replacement for my old Panasonic shaver, and for the price, it was worth taking a risk on this one.  </li>
            <li> The different pieces that fit on are ok.</li>
            <li> I would say that you get what you pay for, but this product wasn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this razor so far.</li>
            <li> This one was purchased for a young teen who is also happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Satiny Smooth is stretching it, however it is far superior and comfortable than any other.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is supposedly a reliable brand and due to good reviews.</li>
            <li> This package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> I was excited t get this as I have had other Conair products and liked them.</li>
            <li> The best wet dry shaver under $40.</li>
            <li> And with summer in full swing, get that bikini area ready ladies.</li>
            <li> This shaver is more for face, bikini, underarm, and general touch ups.</li>
            <li> this works great no more in the bath and all that pain in the</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not pull the hair while shaving, Great little kit and charges fast.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this product to use as a trimmer for my bikini area, and was excited to use it as a shaver for my legs as well.</li>
            <li> This simple little shaver is perfect for bikini area.</li>
            <li> Great little razor for cleaning up the lady parts, but not so much the legs...</li>
            <li> and it made quick work of my whole body.</li>
            <li> For the most part I don&#x27;t get much irritation and for my sensitive skin that is saying a lot.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, rechargeable and comes with a lot of attachments so you can use it for multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li> This is a good razor but it gets hot when I use some if the attachments and leaves black marks in my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> the first couple times i used it</li>
            <li> Very unsanitary!</li>
            <li> Wish it got a closer shave, but this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> I actually had a cheaper type that was better.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, a men&#x27;s Gillette disposable razor does a better job.</li>
            <li> The mesh attachment broke after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My first try with this</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Broke after first three uses (part attached to the blade fell off and did not stay on).</li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First let me start off saying it takes 16 hours to charge the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely matter and looks exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> This is the first device that I&#x27;ve ever had like this.</li>
            <li> First off it tells you to give it 14 days to allow your hair to be use to electric shaving</li>
            <li> worked the first time and then it doesn&#x27;t wish I had the box to return  </li>
            <li> bought it as my daughter&#x27;s first razor.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on my bikini area and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric trimmer I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver!  </li>
            <li> Awesome...tried many different razors for the bikini area..</li>
            <li> Works better on a man&#x27;s back than a woman&#x27;s bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> First 16hr charge did not turn on razor even though instructions said 30 minutesof use&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works ok, smaller than I thought.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try a different one with better ratings.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it in the entire bikini area without any issues.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t damp!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and it&#x27;s getting the job done</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and it was a mixed pool.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it seems like a good choice.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Definitely not for legs more for bikini area underarms too&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed-</li>
            <li> My favorite attachment is the trimmer, the second largest head.</li>
            <li> Broke the first day that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> We were attempting to replace a 10 year old electric razor that is in need of the foil and the blades to be replaced, and that razor STILL works better than this brand new one.</li>
            <li> I have used two other groomers in the last 5 years, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I like it for many little grooming tasks and for them it does just fine.</li>
            <li> It has different heads for whatever you need to clean up and gets very close for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> clean it, brush the hair out of the mechanisms, and use it only when full charged.</li>
            <li> I also love to use it on certain facial features.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea but wish i&#x27;d paid a few more dollars for something of higher quality instead of going with the cheap option.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter and she was so excited with it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for shaving legs, you are better off with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is good for smaller areas such as armpits or bikini, however, does not work for legs.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product if you plan on using it mostly as a bikini/eyebrow trimmer, not so much if you plan on using it to actually shave your legs.</li>
            <li> This is the only ladies multi use razor I have found available right now.  </li>
            <li> What a shame because I really did like it at first.</li>
            <li> It worked really well when i first got it.</li>
            <li> I will have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth it to replace the blade or to just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and comes with several attachments.</li>
            <li> but it is solidly built and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and has all the attachments needed for personal care.</li>
            <li> The various shaver heads etc pop on &amp; off easily.</li>
            <li> Some shavers will not even cut certain hair types...</li>
            <li> then it missed large areas and pulled the hairs rather than shaving them.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how it might perform for large areas like legs.  </li>
            <li> I am really amazed at some of the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and it works great dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> Great for both wet and dry shaving.</li>
            <li> It is fine as a regular razor for legs.</li>
            <li> But other then that it works great and has a long charge on it too.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, she had course, and the third had in between hair....</li>
            <li> It has a nice little trimmer you can use on your eyebrows, adn I have used it</li>
            <li> really like the product.</li>
            <li> Also very convenient that it is a wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and the blades actually scratches my skin when shaving.  </li>
            <li> I do no have very course hair</li>
            <li> I came already charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for legs which is what i really wanted it for.</li>
            <li> and i am especially surprised knowing it from conair.</li>
            <li> Works well, compact, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> one really meets my needs.</li>
            <li> But it works really well on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my legs and bikini area and it grooms very well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li> Too much work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always ready for me to use.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and for the price has a lot of attachments</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a smooth feel like a razor does.  </li>
            <li> It shaved closely and in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> and it does not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> and it works really well for her.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say too much at this time as I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> It provided a really close shave on the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Comb attachment doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, but the nose shaver is not working.  </li>
            <li> It gave me an acceptably smooth bikini shave (obviously not as close as with a razor, but way closer/smoother than I anticipated) and the parts are well made.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> It trims evenly and doesn&#x27;t tug too much.  </li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lose its charge, doesn&#x27;t rip up my skin, works very well.  </li>
            <li> This works very well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too much, as I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cut thicker hair that well.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> Tank you for getting here as fast as you did.</li>
            <li> I like it better on a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I hope it keeps working, because I really do like it.</li>
            <li> It has a charging stand with spots for all the accessories and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it as much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this much, but then again I&#x27;m used to plastic razors.</li>
            <li> It does everything I want it to, charges well, and doesn&#x27;t take much cleaning between shaves.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, just be careful not to catch any hairs in the corner</li>
            <li> It comes all ready charged.</li>
            <li> It works really well, again...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have much luck with the eyebrow trimmer attachment</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about the product is that it has different heads that do different things.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it has different heads for different purposes, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> She says it is so much better than the old blade and especially loves the trimmer function.</li>
            <li> She can use it in the full light and sitting down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty small so very easy to hide discretely.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected!  </li>
            <li> I have had other electric razors that were a 100 times better.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for other body parts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend opting for a higher quality device even if it means spending a little more money.</li>
            <li> It also likes to catch and pull on some of the more unruly pieces, causing sharp pain in the lady bits.  </li>
            <li> OK Not a real close shave!</li>
            <li> I find other methods to be unsatisfactory as most of them require letting the hair grow out long enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> it does not have a short or clean cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to buy shavers and shaving cream every so often, and I get a clean enough shave.</li>
            <li> It works wet or dry and does a consistently good job.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close enough that you can go out and feel confident, but you may have to shave more often if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> Fits on my small counter nicely.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it occasionally snags on my skin, but for the most part it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Granted, don&#x27;t expect it to be like waxing or shaving, but it trims everything down to make it more manageable for waxing/shaving.</li>
            <li> The product is good for your armpits and private areas , but not a clean shave for your legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle, even when wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This product is decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a decent time.</li>
            <li> It has been years since I have used an electric shaver, but as I have grown older this item is a necessity.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the attachments, but the part on the main head that is for longer hair doesn&#x27;t cut me the way some others have.</li>
            <li> (Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s decent return</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon still carries the replacement foils and cutters and has a decent return policy.</li>
            <li> When I went back to reviews I found many saying the same thing.</li>
            <li> Better safe that sorry.</li>
            <li> Rated this as just OK because it does not cut well on coarse hair, it takes several passes to achieve a close shave.</li>
            <li> I mainly chose this unit based on reviews and size.  </li>
            <li> The main razor does not shave as close as I would like</li>
            <li> Eyebrow trimmer is a little tricky and gets hot on your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I think if I had the purchase to do over again, I would buy a highly rated razor and a separate highly rated trimmer, rather than a &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Quality is high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works fine as I expected</li>
            <li> This did not work nearly as well as many of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> Better than the little trimmers you buy in the drugstores for $10.  </li>
            <li> I love this little electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the little holder it comes with to charge the razor, and to hold all the heads.</li>
            <li> Wish they have a better way of storing the attachments as the little wanna be holder is not suffiencient.</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This was for my 93 year old mother and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, but shaves closely and has lasted a while so far.</li>
            <li> that was so top heavy</li>
            <li> is that it seems like the blades are moving more slowly than when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 smaller Remington groomers that were just the right size, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and fits nicely in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also handy that they provide not only the cleaning brush, but the little container of oil.</li>
            <li> I can live with it, but it has made me bleed.</li>
            <li> It does say in the packaging it can take your body a couple weeks to adjust to the new shaving method, so</li>
            <li> Know I have to look for a new one.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer works really good, the only downfall on it, is with the curved handle, its too bulky, so hard to manuever to trim, the comb attachement for the eyebrows</li>
            <li> It is ok but definitely not what was expected...</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand to feel stubble,) and so far it is holding a decent charge.  </li>
            <li> I will never again trust any positive reviews of any product as far as there are so many negative reviews of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a very old remmington one that broke.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair I have purchased and have never had any problem besides damaging the first one when I dropped it from a 10 foot height.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> ok, it took ALOT of research to find a trimmer that... A: fits snugly in my wife&#x27;s small feminine hands...</li>
            <li> Worth every penny to save some grey hairs form Grandma.</li>
            <li> it is better than any other personal groomer I have used.</li>
            <li> My old electric shaver quit so it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I completely regret buying this item and now have to search for something new.</li>
            <li> It does ok around the knees but is not good for a whole leg.</li>
            <li> It took several passes to clean completely, and depending on the direction you move the shaver in across the skin, the attachment will twist off in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li> I had not noticed how loose the connection is before I started shaving but after 2 or 3 minuets the shaver head popped off and the connection was even more loose.</li>
            <li> Works well, no nicks in &#x27;sensitive&#x27; (read &#x27;very sensitive&#x27;) areas.  </li>
            <li> Bought it to replace an old one (that wasn&#x27;t very old) that had started snagging and pulling hairs for some reason.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s those little fine hairs under the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and I am able to groom in last that half the time.  </li>
            <li> Only the large trimmer attachment works well.</li>
            <li> The little pieces don&#x27;t fit well in the stand and are a nuisance to store.</li>
            <li> This razor feels a little cheap, but it does the job</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver especially for the armpits and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I shaved half my eyebrow clean off.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I get a close shave, even in sensitive areas without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving so much easier, such as trimming then going over the area.</li>
            <li> No way am I taking a razor blade to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9year old.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I like to keep the playground well-landscaped while keeping some of the beauty and protection of the natural terrain.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the foil shaver really works because I use the triple blade things for my legs and underarms, and I don&#x27;t have long/crazy enough growth on my face to need the eyebrow shaping stuff.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the tray that comes with this tool set doesn&#x27;t really keep everything organized.  </li>
            <li> The last one I purchased tugged too much and hurt to use in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with this razor.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that it coud be improved if the cradle mounted directly to the outlet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a lot of problems shaving because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> My old Remington lasted about 6 years and still worked well until the rechargeable battery stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I already really like it.</li>
            <li> Yeah ladies, this is what you have to look forward to in old age.  </li>
            <li> I made sure i took it out of the shower after each use, dried it, and set it back on the charging the charging station.</li>
            <li> I let the good reviews for this razor talk me into getting one, but I&#x27;m sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was a little dry at first but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Other then that, for the price, its well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> But for small use its fine.</li>
            <li> I was told by the instructions that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to the razor, but it does not give you a clean cut or feel.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mom and it works much better than any small trimmer for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Without the detail comb, the shaver works better but occasionally bites you and continues to create small divots on the field.  </li>
            <li> However, this little thing does a nice job on legs and delicate areas and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the sink.  </li>
            <li> Attachments do not fit properly and break easily.</li>
            <li> Plus the design of the comb makes it so that you actually have to be super careful about pinching yourself.</li>
            <li> I normally use this Personal Groomer just trim the hedges and a razor for any ground work.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on my legs a few times but it will never be a true razor.</li>
            <li> Wish I would of spent a little more money and got something that worked.</li>
            <li> (except did not come in a cute little pink case).</li>
            <li> With several different attaching heads, it&#x27;s very versatile.  </li>
            <li> Also, I bought this because it had a tidy solution for the attachments but not all of the attachments fit on the base.</li>
            <li> My two complaints are first: the handle heats up after a short time, secondly: it doesn&#x27;t cut the coarse hair as well as I needed it to.  </li>
            <li> Used it several times on coarser hair and it has worked well thus far!</li>
            <li> The foil does not cover sharp cutters, so it does not provide a close shave even on the first use.</li>
            <li> How come that something that apparently worked so wonderful for some, did a totally crap job for me, and from the negative reviews I can tell for many other people.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to the other attachments as I haven&#x27;t used them and probably won&#x27;t, but they appear to fit and function about like any other grooming tools.  </li>
            <li> I actually threw this shaver in the garbage after both my 12 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I would buy again, thus far - have only infrequent uses since it was purchased.</li>
            <li> I got it for my young granddaughter who scared me to death using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> It works like a champ even when I decide to be perfectly bare</li>
            <li> After two uses, this barely works.</li>
            <li> Go careful with the short size, it gets a VERY close shave!  </li>
            <li> I have better luck with the bikini attachment, but it is not great.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a more expensive Remington which was a good shaver but a lousy</li>
            <li> But it seems like perhaps it really isn&#x27;t going to last very long.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, works wet or dry, on long or short hair</li>
            <li> The battery runs out after about 20 minutes of continual use, but I&#x27;ve found that to be pretty typical for electric shavers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The only part worth a fart is the little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The charge stays active for much longer than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> As far as trimming in the bikini area, it gave a rudimentary trim that was tolerable, but there is only one attachment, so you only can have one trim length.</li>
            <li> I only use electric razors for my thighs and bikini area as these areas are too sensitive for a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I am able to do the whole \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; style bikini grooming with this having no problems with pinching or cutting.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the 2 position adjustable comb does not stay in the longer position, so if you want to look like an adult, you have to trim it back further than you probably want to and wait a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The size is smaller than other shavers I&#x27;ve used so I can really do a thorough job below the belt.  </li>
            <li> I barely used it twice since I bought it in mid June</li>
            <li> This one was reviewed better but was pretty much useless after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I may be giving a review a little too early as we have only used the one part so far.  </li>
            <li> Can a product be so good and so bad at the same time?</li>
            <li> I carefully took it apart to clear away hair.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is that the pieces don&#x27;t all fit perfectly in the base and the main shaver can not be stored in the base while not in use.</li>
            <li> It worked well at the first and second days, but not very good after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than the other bulky shavers and won&#x27;t cut sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Sisters Christmas was complete with this gift her other died and</li>
            <li> Shaves close with sharp blades that do not pull at sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is because the interchangeable tops come off if I twist the razor while applying pressure and have dropped it in the toilet twice.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to charge it even when I first received it, because the charger is at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get super close on the legs, but takes away noticeable hair at least!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried a total shave, just trimming, and only used it dry.</li>
            <li> Then the battery dies and it won&#x27;t stay charged long enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> device has a relatively short battery life and took a long time to recharge.</li>
            <li> At home she tells me she loves the way the battery will last a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> When the shaver housing broke off after I accidently bumped it on the shower wall, I was almost relieved to have an excuse to just buy a different one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long, did not give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this to last very long.</li>
            <li> Its good enough that I wont look for another one, and bad enough that I resent myself a little every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I can use it with or without water, and as long as I go over the sections a few times slowly, I get just as smooth a shave as I would with a razor -</li>
            <li> They use batteries and run down very quickly plus those are poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my wife&#x27;s other Conair that recently died after only 6 months.</li>
            <li> After purchasing several other brands that didn&#x27;t shave close enough, including some men&#x27;s electric razors, I found this one.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I searched for one for a long time before buying this one</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t had it long, I still have yet to see the longevity of its performance</li>
            <li> but I think as long as I take care of it as per the instructions</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for plenty of time, but needs to because it has to run for a long time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been too long..</li>
            <li> Only two stars because my wife make only half Brazilian</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly, sturdiness and or durability is questionable, but still using it daily.</li>
            <li> Each charge lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> A little more complicated to use than what I would like and it bites/pulls the hair a lot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut properly, and takes too long to charge after only a few minutes of working.</li>
            <li> AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO OTHER BUYERS.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Andis model that&#x27;s no longer made and the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> However, the first time using this product, I noticed that the design of the comb makes it very hard to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m headed to the beach, I just use the trimmer and shaver dry.</li>
            <li> i rlly did i shaved them dry and it wrked like a beauty.</li>
            <li> and this can&#x27;t remove a single hair.</li>
            <li> I use a lot when I am limited on time.</li>
            <li> i have coarse dark hair.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with product, the base holds all the attachments neatly in place.</li>
            <li> When I lost the charger for my older conair model, I bought this one and it was a diappointment, it was thin and flimsy and even stopped working during the second use.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to shave down there, because it itches when hair grows back.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but didn&#x27;t last very long :(</li>
            <li> Luckily this thing wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but still...</li>
            <li> It says you can use wet or dry although I have not tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the charging time is a little long and it would be nice if it would charge without the stand and charge through a direct plug in because it&#x27;s annoying to always have to take the stand with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be living in another country for 2 years on a very limited budget</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old groomer since it was getting dull and pulling at my hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also been looking for a more efficient/less painful way of dealing with my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $$$</li>
            <li> Just what I expected a trimmer would be.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It was also extremely rough on teh skin and gave me alot of cuts.</li>
            <li> I went over and over my lower leg and minimal hair was removed.</li>
            <li> a feminine pink for my feminine pink parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few personal shavers-</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this shaver for not being too harsh and getting the job done.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The pink is a must.</li>
            <li> Threw it away after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> And depilatories are too harsh for (old) thin, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this on wet skin, as it does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, that is something I need to be careful of &amp; that was the reason I went to this razor.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Then... It just became a feminine pink display on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> In summary, I don&#x27;t like it, and I wish I&#x27;d spent my money on something else.</li>
            <li> To get any body hairs down to stumble was a 2-3 day process.</li>
            <li> I do not like this all in one personal groomer, not easy to use at all.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had such trouble with other products.</li>
            <li> I let the hair get a little long</li>
            <li> All I can say is: I spent about 20 minutes in the shower going over and over the same area, and all I achieved was a patchy, uneven mess.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the little pieces are not well supported in the back of the charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any skin pinching or bleeding like I read about with other products</li>
            <li> This one does pull a bit with the one attachment...same as what other reviewers had seen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so big that you can&#x27;t get into those nooks and cranies, but not so small that  </li>
            <li> Compared to some other hair buzzers out there (i.e the Wahl Peanut)</li>
            <li> If all you need is a bikini area trimmer I would suggest one that specializes just for that area and not worry about the other attachments</li>
            <li> This shaver may work for other body areas, but would not shave the hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> so irritation may be due to adjusting to foil shaver from years of razor use.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works in other areas.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the cradle or the shaver, but I had to send it back and didn&#x27;t want to try my luck</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that I shave every other day</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than 10 times :(</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel!</li>
            <li> she let me use it the other day</li>
            <li> The other reviews saying that it tugs are correct.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used any of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> bought it due to reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut hair; legs, bikini, nothing....</li>
            <li> All the other times, it has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall you really can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product, the only reason it is a four star rating is you do have to constantly charge it like literally after every shave.</li>
            <li> The charger for the Panasonic takes up both slots of an outlet, but I&#x27;m finding it a small price to pay for a razor that actually works.</li>
            <li> the only thing it&#x27;s missing is a little travel pouch.</li>
            <li> This one did a poor job on my legs, making me go over the same spot multiple times.  </li>
            <li> shaver absolutely does not cut hair at any length on legs and does a very poor job on even very slight women&#x27;s upper lip hair.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on my dark hair, as with every other electic razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a&lt;br /&gt;good inexpensive shaver---you have to be careful about cleaning and not use the little cleaning brush on the foil,</li>
            <li> It is how ever hard to use on the armpits and legs, I would recommend a razor for ultimate smoothness.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it handles a lot of hair very well.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that after a while (20 minutes and on) it starts to heat up.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case for storage.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;casing&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t appear broken, it just didn&#x27;t snap closed securely enough to keep it closed when the unit started vibrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t hold a charge, (barely a few minutes,) and didn&#x27;t hold up very long to everyday use.  </li>
            <li> she hurt herself and we needed to shave it down to apply the antibiotics.</li>
            <li> I was using a portable electric razor marketed for men for down there before purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> Nothing gets done before it slows down.</li>
            <li> I use it on my girly parts and it gets the hair down to about 1/16 of an inch.</li>
            <li> I can feel it scratching as I go up and down.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as other shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The close to skin \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; can give blisters, but much less than a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman, by the way.</li>
            <li> I can get closer to my skin than my previous electric razors without worry of getting nicked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times now (a month and a half) and it works well.</li>
            <li> (I have never seen this in shaver directions before so should have took this as an odd sign).</li>
            <li> To not accidently lose charge half way through a shave, I charge it after each use.</li>
            <li> I was using previously.</li>
            <li> The razor should glide over your skin, and be less app for you to get cut or the head come off..</li>
            <li> Had it less than a year.</li>
            <li> so it stays all together, and that is also your charging stand, my only complaint is a couple items don&#x27;t snap lightly into the base so that they don&#x27;t fall</li>
            <li> It was so bad that after I found the charger I just went back to using the much older model.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this little trimmer for all of her hair trimming jobs.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can do an update after I&#x27;ve had it a little longer</li>
            <li> I still am not very sure about the charging stand and all the compartments they don&#x27;t hold all the attachments as well as they should.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow attachment is way too rough and difficult to control for such precision work.  </li>
            <li> the cut is never close enough and the blades are some poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It worked a few times, then wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair any longer.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Now the downstairs area looks like theres uneven patches of hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too narrow to cover all the surface of the legs efficiently.</li>
            <li> , after she finished may I I put another few stars.</li>
            <li> keeps charge for a few days.</li>
            <li> There was always stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My old Conair electric razor broke and unfortunately they no longer make that model.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor; try anything else.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The Conair is not a great shaver, so if you are looking for an all-in-one device for trimming, facial hair, plus pits &#x27;n&#x27; legs, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this before but misplaced it.</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks for it to go away</li>
            <li> Not a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> after a few months of owning, I had to duct tape</li>
            <li> I have returned this, as it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Other electric shavers really pinch and cut me badly, so I took a chance on this one.</li>
            <li> The head is a little small for the legs.</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be from pushing down too hard.</li>
            <li> I can usually get a few uses out of it before needing a re-charge.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair to begin with that needs shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the second item of this type that I&#x27;ve had and after one charge it will no longer charge at all, rendering the item completely useless.</li>
            <li> I had to use it to shave a small area on my husky cause</li>
            <li> i dont usually like conair products</li>
            <li> what a waste!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a 4.5 just because it is a bit small, and I know that might bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, boo!</li>
            <li> One of the few shavers I have found that I can shave under my arms and around delicate areas, without be nicked.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is ok but the attachment for legs is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m buying this one after trying another one out that was more expensive but just terrible.</li>
            <li> It cut me once, which was upsetting because this has never been a problem with electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn/bumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a forever chore to shave even small areas on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Mostly usually on my knees</li>
            <li> It may be better than its peers, but they would have to be truly awful if that is so.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not work well for me as a shaver, it left quite a bit of stubble even after going over my legs</li>
            <li> the small amount of money that was paid.</li>
            <li> There were hairs on the trimmer and it was very evident that the trimmer was previously used as there was oil on each trimmer set and the base had a broken piece on the bottom along with a two cracks on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I find the base to be a little flimsy and the attachments don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use especially in awkward areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the blades were too dull and would hardly cut any hairs.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it has a really dull blade.</li>
            <li> But be careful while using if you use it wrong way it might hurt.</li>
            <li> I got a bit of pinching and it made me afraid to use it without extra caution.</li>
            <li> at least they give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but worthless!</li>
            <li> No pulling or pinching in delicate areas</li>
            <li> However the battery died immediately after it was too late for me to return/replace it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is not effective.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten Panasonic ES2207 razors for years, and got another one when this one was such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> A real waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The directions are written very small and are confusing.</li>
            <li> While charging, the charging stand doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the counter because the wire plugs in underneath and awkwardly sticks out under the edge of the charging</li>
            <li> But seriously-</li>
            <li> are a little vague.  </li>
            <li> It is as bad as the last time I tried an automatic shaver 20 or 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> it is not good for shaving legs.  </li>
            <li> The razor isn&#x27;t the problem, as I got frustrated and took the comb off and used it with only the razor part.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use this to shave my legs without digging the razor into the bone, and even then, it is not a good shave.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely no good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch and pull the hairs out painfully (like other electric razors I&#x27;ve had have done in the past).</li>
            <li> This is the most worthless piece of crap that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I hate that I paid this much for a mediocre razor.  </li>
            <li> For the bikini area, I thought it was extremely weak and could not compare to the men&#x27;s one at all.  </li>
            <li> The blades were VERY dull.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> but i suppose they&#x27;re stepping their game up.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  </li>
            <li> This razor leaves it all behind.</li>
            <li> I am on the hunt again for an electric razor simply because I hate using disposable items.</li>
            <li> Pick Up, which is not the game</li>
            <li> All-in-all, there are some positives, but the negatives are worse.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to buy this product, so I&#x27;m disappointed it&#x27;s not working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs with poor results, so do not expect to use it for that.</li>
            <li> It leaves stubs behind.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Spent over an hour just to get an uneven, spotty, and miserable trim in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It was weak and relatively useless when it came to shaving.  </li>
            <li> This product is not ideal for shaving legs or underarms.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave, not ideal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was even worse on my underarms, where it nicked me again and again despite my contortionist efforts to prevent it.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Not too complicated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again sometime if I get bored...</li>
            <li> and I use it for every hair on my body and for some difficult to reach places.  </li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Attachments are difficult to use and it does not provide a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> well it doesn&#x27;t remove my, eyebrow stragglers in the wrong places, either.</li>
            <li> It also scrapes, and is uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Does not work well and the wrong charger was sent with the razor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it died on me a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I went over my legs 3 times and the razor was still unable to pickup some of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Tried to return it but was past my 30 days :(</li>
            <li> the gauge comb was useless and not adjustable, but when I removed it became a torture device which I stopped using because it always bit me</li>
            <li> (change is difficult for me)</li>
            <li> This pulled the hairs and was uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using a traditional Venus razor for years and years and always had the worst razor burn bumps all along my bikini line.</li>
            <li> bc batteries can be expensive.</li>
            <li> ill figure it out.</li>
            <li> If you choose to purchase this, I hope that it works for you, it failed all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> Awful, do not waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> wad disappointed with both the poor shaving abilities of this razor and the quality of the material.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving a bad review, but unfortunately, this deserves it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> After that, it stopped cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> That one worked once and then stopped cutting.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> This is in my opinion, a terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it wasnt very expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is very poorly made and the blade attachment falls off when used!  </li>
            <li> No matter which removable head you use, it&#x27;s impossible to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about the product is that the heads don&#x27;t lock into place.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no sissy, this thing hurt me bad.</li>
            <li> I get really bad razor burn, even when I use a ton of shaving cream and lotion afterward.</li>
            <li> PAINFUL and INEFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> very disappointing... has a bad odor smell.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this item from con-air.</li>
            <li> and she was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re buying this as a replacement for your razor, you will definitely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> or it HURTS :(</li>
            <li> (sorry, Honey!!).</li>
            <li> That happens a lot in the bath for me and considerably annoying.</li>
            <li> the storage base has places for everything</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for crap.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> So, sometimes while using the product the heads twist off the base.</li>
            <li> This is a completely worthless razor.</li>
            <li> , it wouldn&#x27;t stay on its plug in base.</li>
            <li> I hate the hassle of returning something</li>
            <li> Bummer, hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and wish I bought another product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> one of the worst shavers i have come upon.</li>
            <li> horrible trimming for every piece but the eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but this razor was so terrible</li>
            <li> Terrible product !!</li>
            <li> I found that to be really awful.</li>
            <li> It just did a terrible, patchy shaving job!  </li>
            <li> I hated this product!</li>
            <li> This thing is awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This however was one of the worst electric razors I have ever had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this item for trimming purposes. It&#x27;s great for that and feel that portion of the product works great. So 5 starts for that.&lt;br /&gt;1 star for actually giving you &amp;#34;Satiny Smooth&amp;#34; legs. It does not give you that. If you&#x27;re looking for something to give you smooth legs, don&#x27;t buy this. You want to trim, buy this.</li>
            <li> This works great! I love being able to take this in the shower and then use it outside the shower too. Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is decent for the price. It hasn&#x27;t replaced a wet shave but is good in between for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> I simply love the close soft shave of this razor.  I searched for one for a long time before buying this one and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Really useful tool. Great value. Easy to change out the heads even though I tend to just use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week but I love it. With summer coming up, a lady has to be especially vigilant about landscaping and this is just the tool to do it with. Since I haven&#x27;t had it long, I still have yet to see the longevity of its performance but I think as long as I take care of it as per the instructions suggest, I should get a lot of miles out of it. The price is right at about how much I wanted to spend and am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I could never get this thing to work properly. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to replace my electric razor and I tried this one.  No luck.  It hurt my legs when I used and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I would not recommend this razor.  I am still searching.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable and has so many attachments. I love it and I highly recommend it for this great price!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on electric shavers before purchasing this product.  I&#x27;m glad I made the choice I made.  I bought it for the bikini shave but have used it on my legs and under arms as well.  I&#x27;ve never had any skin pinching or bleeding like I read about with other products and I think it does a good job for an electric shaver.  It holds a charge well, too.</li>
            <li> Works well, no nicks in &#x27;sensitive&#x27; (read &#x27;very sensitive&#x27;) areas.  Charge lasts a decent time.</li>
            <li> Have to go over area several times to get the job done</li>
            <li> bought these as gifts, exactly what I was looking for an good price!!</li>
            <li> one of the worst shavers i have come upon. it does not have a short or clean cut. the first couple times i used it i had red cuts all over me after. i kept using it, hoping i would get better results but i saw no change. the cut is never close enough and the blades are some poor quality.  i will be buying a different razor.</li>
            <li> Head falls off easily. Works great otherwise</li>
            <li> PAINFUL and INEFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> This is the only ladies multi use razor I have found available right now.  This is the second Conair I have purchased and have never had any problem besides damaging the first one when I dropped it from a 10 foot height.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s first razor and she lives it!  Extra attachments are nice too</li>
            <li> I switched to this after using a men&#x27;s shaver for several years.  For the bikini area, I thought it was extremely weak and could not compare to the men&#x27;s one at all.  I think beard grooming technology has come a lot further than bikini area grooming.  I&#x27;m returning this and plan to buy a men&#x27;s one again.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Love all the attachments.  Highly recommend.  Have had for over a year with no issues.</li>
            <li> I received a used and repackaged product. There were hairs on the trimmer and it was very evident that the trimmer was previously used as there was oil on each trimmer set and the base had a broken piece on the bottom along with a two cracks on the trimmer. Very unsanitary!</li>
            <li> This actually works as advertised. Pleased with this and hope it lasts longer than others have after being dropped!</li>
            <li> This is a great personal groomer. Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li> the all in one personal shaver does not work. when I shave my legs or underarms the hair does not come off</li>
            <li> This is the second item of this type that I&#x27;ve had and after one charge it will no longer charge at all, rendering the item completely useless.</li>
            <li> This is the most worthless piece of crap that I have ever seen. It will not cut the hairs at all. I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t use it for a while after I got it and just tried it and awful-awful-awful. I don&#x27;t know how they can make and sell something like this.</li>
            <li> Love this no pulling great for my lady region....wouldnt reccommend for legs.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Best razor I have purchased to date. Ladies, you could shave a bear with this if you wanted to. I had to use it to shave a small area on my husky cause she hurt herself and we needed to shave it down to apply the antibiotics. THIS THING STILL WORKS WONDERS.</li>
            <li> worked once and never held a charge after that.  I tossed it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price. Wish it got a closer shave, but this is my first electric shaver so I have only regular razors to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges great and lasts the entire session. May try a more expensive shaver to compare but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not remove hair well at all...disposable razors are better than this! Total waste of $$$</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 months of use... only used 4 times before the motor died.  Tossed it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would..... horrible trimming for every piece but the eyebrow trimmer. So disappointed in this item from con-air.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  I sent to my mother in the nursing home and she was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t real effective for the chin hairs. I actually had a cheaper type that was better.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected a trimmer would be. The battery lasts pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The close to skin \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; can give blisters, but much less than a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Too many interchangeable pieces.</li>
            <li> It comes with different attachments so you can get a closer shave. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using this on your legs because it doesn&#x27;t do a super close job. But for bikini area, say goodbye to razor burn!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close.  I have to go over the same areas three or four times. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very user friendly, powerful, and effective.  Takes care of legs, arms, underarms, and works great with the bikini area.  Haven&#x27;t needed to use it on my eyebrows.  I have fine hair and VERY sensitive skin.  I have no bumps, cuts, nicks, or burns from this product, even with the bikini area which I&#x27;ve always struggled with.  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.  The versatility from all the different heads is great, and it keeps a charge well.  Also very convenient that it is a wet/dry shaver.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it and it is a great size and perfect for many uses.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming, and thats it. Doesn&#x27;t do much for shaving legs, you are better off with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of handy attachments and they are easy to take on and off the unit.  My two complaints are first: the handle heats up after a short time, secondly: it doesn&#x27;t cut the coarse hair as well as I needed it to.  I do like the different sizes of the attachments. The unit is easy to hold and to use.  This package arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for trimming.  Better than the little trimmers you buy in the drugstores for $10.  They use batteries and run down very quickly plus those are poorly made.  This one is good.</li>
            <li> The heads on this product need to be replaced quite often but the first 3 or 4 times of use they fuction perfectly</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on my dark hair, as with every other electic razor.  I thought by reading th reviews it would be great.  It&#x27;s not.  The little pieces don&#x27;t fit well in the stand and are a nuisance to store.</li>
            <li> Its great and easy to use. Excellent! It&#x27;s removes most of the hair on your body. But be careful while using if you use it wrong way it might hurt.</li>
            <li> No issues so far. Works as expected. Easy to switch trimmer heads. Not too complicated. Grip is comfortable. Buy it!</li>
            <li> When I lost the charger for my older conair model, I bought this one and it was a diappointment, it was thin and flimsy and even stopped working during the second use. It was also extremely rough on teh skin and gave me alot of cuts. It was so bad that after I found the charger I just went back to using the much older model.</li>
            <li> Overall doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Great ladies shaver.  Have been using for a while and works perfectly.  With several different attaching heads, it&#x27;s very versatile.  A good purchase and glad I found this model.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not used to electric shavers, but this doesn&#x27;t give a close shave on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;Also, not a close shave in the bikini area either. I used it once, then went back to my regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again sometime if I get bored...</li>
            <li> It has been years since I have used an electric shaver, but as I have grown older this item is a necessity.  So far I have no complaints.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking to purchase an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor with lots of attachments.  It says you can use wet or dry although I have not tried it wet.  The charge lasts a really long time but I still have not figured out how to store all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> She likes the close shave with no irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and the blades actually scratches my skin when shaving.  Attachments do not fit properly and break easily.</li>
            <li> Satisfied and happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked this item while it worked. It was great to trim up smaller areas. I bought this item in October 2014- it died by January 2015. I only used it 5 times. Sat on the charger for 2 days and never charged.</li>
            <li> First time use the top came off.</li>
            <li> It appears there was a cover guard not included.</li>
            <li> Pretty convenient to have but not the best.</li>
            <li> As the headline states, not bad. Not good. Just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I do no have very course hair so I figured this would be easy, but it wasn&#x27;t. It took several passes to clean completely, and depending on the direction you move the shaver in across the skin, the attachment will twist off in the middle of shaving. That happens a lot in the bath for me and considerably annoying. But it will eventually clean the area being shaved. Personally, a men&#x27;s Gillette disposable razor does a better job. I&#x27;m a black woman, by the way.</li>
            <li> that not working at all</li>
            <li> Works well. My only complaint is that the little pieces are not well supported in the back of the charger. I struggled to figure out the correct arrangement, but even then the pieces fall out of place with the slightest bump.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed. Only the large trimmer attachment works well. This product is not ideal for shaving legs or underarms.</li>
            <li> It worked a few times, then wouldn&#x27;t cut the hair any longer.  It didn&#x27;t provide a close shave when it worked either.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My product worked well for awhile, but after six months it no longer charges and I cannot use it anymore.</li>
            <li> love it they got here on time</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife.  She said that it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I came already charged and ready to go.  Easy to use especially in awkward areas.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came with a bag or pouch to carry it in  to make it easy to throw in my travel bag, since I live out of a suitcase most of the time.</li>
            <li> This product will never give you razor burn - it works wonders especially for legs and the bikini area.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for armpits since the razor doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for that.  Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this personal groomer and bought one for my daughter and granddaughter.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and will replace it with the same model when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> wife love this ,it was a great xmas gift!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst shaver I have used. The shaving head spontaneously pops off in the middle of use. I had not noticed how loose the connection is before I started shaving but after 2 or 3 minuets the shaver head popped off and the connection was even more loose.</li>
            <li> The razor is good for smaller areas such as armpits or bikini, however, does not work for legs. It does ok around the knees but is not good for a whole leg. I went over and over my lower leg and minimal hair was removed. I let the hair get a little long but it still won&#x27;t cut it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for legs which is what i really wanted it for.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. The different attachments allow for versatility when grooming.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. i have coarse dark hair. I can get closer to my skin than my previous electric razors without worry of getting nicked. it&#x27;s great for a trim but not for shaving. but im not mad since it&#x27;s not meant for shaving. it&#x27;s very gentle. the best part about it other than it being gentle is the color. it&#x27;s so cute!! a feminine pink for my feminine pink parts. LOL. it comes with everything you need. multiple attachment heads, a charging dock, a cleaning brush, and oil for the blades. the only thing it&#x27;s missing is a little travel pouch. i recommend this. and i am especially surprised knowing it from conair. i dont usually like conair products but i suppose they&#x27;re stepping their game up. this razor is great!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my wife&#x27;s other Conair that recently died after only 6 months. This one was reviewed better but was pretty much useless after a few weeks of use. The head attachments would not stay on without tape and the razor just did not work  at what it was designed to do. Save your time, frustration and cash and try anything else.</li>
            <li> I use it for under arms. It worked well at the first and second days, but not very good after that.</li>
            <li> Overall it is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t shave very clean</li>
            <li> I was using a portable electric razor marketed for men for down there before purchasing this.  While this one is more gentile, it lacks the power that the razors designed for men&#x27;s beards have.  The mesh attachment broke after the first use.  No joke, just broke like that.  I hate that I paid this much for a mediocre razor.  Its good enough that I wont look for another one, and bad enough that I resent myself a little every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this electric razor for a couple of months and it is a great product. I get a close shave, even in sensitive areas without any irritation. It has a bikini trimmer, and eyebrow trimmer as well. I keep it charged all the time and have not had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and quality this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Works well, compact, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> there great I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them. I love the color</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my legs smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this for feminine area trimming. I had the Remington one for years, but it stopped charging. My first try with this I got a bit of pinching and it made me afraid to use it without extra caution. In contrast, I never had to be cautious with my Remington. I think I like the shape of this trimmer better, it is easier to hold and maneuver. The stand is sort of cool too. Maybe I&#x27;ll update as I try it more, but for now, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but this razor was so terrible I wanted to save others from making the mistake of purchasing it. I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s electric razors before with no problem. This is the first &amp;#34;ladies&amp;#34; electric razor/trimmer I&#x27;ve tried. All I can say is: I spent about 20 minutes in the shower going over and over the same area, and all I achieved was a patchy, uneven mess. The plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; is cumbersome and blocks hair from reaching the razor blades, which seem to be too short/small to actually cut any hair. Luckily this thing wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but still... what a waste! I&#x27;d recommend trying another product.</li>
            <li> its nice and arrived at right time</li>
            <li> I had another brand but I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;This one really meets my needs.</li>
            <li> This is great!  It works wet or dry and does a consistently good job.  Each charge lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> This thing does the job for sure.  Go careful with the short size, it gets a VERY close shave!  But it works really well on the bikini area.  I had been using a regular razor for years.  Now I use this much better.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  Did not cut well and ended up having to do it over with a razor.  Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor/trimmer for over three years. It is fine as a regular razor for legs. It shaves close enough that you can go out and feel confident, but you may have to shave more often if your hair is thick. For bikini trimming, I did not find it the best. It often pulls the hair, which hurts, and it did not give me an even trim. To shave that area, however, it works well, but you may have to do it more often. I think if I had the purchase to do over again, I would buy a highly rated razor and a separate highly rated trimmer, rather than a &amp;#34;do it all&amp;#34; product. They seem to have more problems.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I like all the options.  It does still pinch/pull hair on occasion.  I can live with it, but it has made me bleed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few personal shavers- this one beats them all! Obviously take care of it- clean it, brush the hair out of the mechanisms, and use it only when full charged. But seriously- no nicks, cuts or pulled hairs when used correctly!</li>
            <li> Several attachments to trim different areas. Charge lasts a decent amount of time. I do not keep this on its stand and plugged in all the time so I wish it had a storage bag but very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  Broke after first three uses (part attached to the blade fell off and did not stay on).</li>
            <li> This one does pull a bit with the one attachment...same as what other reviewers had seen.  It will do the job though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a 4.5 just because it is a bit small, and I know that might bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent though. It has a nice little trimmer you can use on your eyebrows, adn I have used it and it was easy to be precise as there are two sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving attachment works well. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way. It does say in the packaging it can take your body a couple weeks to adjust to the new shaving method, so if it seems not quite as smooth it will get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bikini trimmer works very nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am incredibly impressed with this item, and it&#x27;s versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the storage base has places for everything so it stays all together, and that is also your charging stand, my only complaint is a couple items don&#x27;t snap lightly into the base so that they don&#x27;t fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice item, will recommend to others!!</li>
            <li> Enjoying using in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the attachments, but the part on the main head that is for longer hair doesn&#x27;t cut me the way some others have.</li>
            <li> ...if it worked. The razor will not charge. The entire thing feels flimsy. I like the idea but wish i&#x27;d paid a few more dollars for something of higher quality instead of going with the cheap option.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Andis model that&#x27;s no longer made and the blades were dull.  I decided also I needed more options.  It took me awhile to choose another model and I am so glad I chose this one.  I haven&#x27;t managed to cut or pinch myself since this purchase and I use it for every hair on my body and for some difficult to reach places.  The foil blade gives an excellent close trim.  I clippers are great!  I&#x27;ve also used the eyebrow tool as well.  I think that this was one very useful groomer without the burn from shaving!</li>
            <li> This shaver is exactly what I was looking for. I love the additional attachments. I would definitely recommend to my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I have neglected shaving over the winter so I got this and it made quick work of my whole body. One thing I would say it to definitely use the face attachment to shave the bikini area because the body one will nick.</li>
            <li> Was just as described.  Works better than expected!  Will recommend to others who are looking for quality at a fair price.</li>
            <li> She said it was the best razor for shaving her legs.  So I am glad I gave it to her for Christmas and it isn&#x27;t expensive either.&lt;br /&gt;Good stocking stuffer or birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Terrible product !! It hurt me!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> I do not like this all in one personal groomer, not easy to use at all. I won&#x27;t buy again. I prefer my Remington.</li>
            <li> I like it for many little grooming tasks and for them it does just fine. Except 1. And that&#x27;s those little fine hairs under the eyebrows. It just doiesn&#x27;t want to seem to pick them up and cut them off. I had more luck with a pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to shave your legs with it! I wanted an electric razor to be able to use on my legs if I didn&#x27;t have time to use a razor. Even if I shaved the night beforehand and my leg hairs were very short this razor did NOT work on my legs. Great for fine facial hair but doesn&#x27;t work so great on coarser hair  plus the top does indeed pop off rather easily.</li>
            <li> Product does the job.</li>
            <li> I use this for my legs and bikini area and it grooms very well.  The size is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so big that you can&#x27;t get into those nooks and cranies, but not so small that  it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be living in another country for 2 years on a very limited budget so I wanted to buy an electric razor and trimmer so that I don&#x27;t have to spend money on disposable razors later. It&#x27;s perfect on my legs and underarms. And the bikini trimmer is just what I wanted. Definitely a great purchase!</li>
            <li> very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> This personal groomer is wonderful on my bikini line.  I also love to use it on certain facial features.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great...happy customer!</li>
            <li> First let me start off saying it takes 16 hours to charge the first time you use it. I found that to be really awful. I&#x27;ve used this product three times now (a month and a half) and it works well. I use it as a trimmer for bikini and beyond. Needless to say it handles a lot of hair very well. It arrived in a timely matter and looks exactly like the photo. It is easy to clean as well. The only negative is that after a while (20 minutes and on) it starts to heat up. Overall, good purchase. I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t elaborate much on this one, but my wife seems to be very happy with it and the says it&#x27;s better than her old one.</li>
            <li> This is the first device that I&#x27;ve ever had like this. I think it works great.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this shaver for not being too harsh and getting the job done.  Not as heavy as other shavers.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a dude. I mostly purchased this to keep the downstairs trimmed (TMI?). I was mostly attracted to this by the price. Compared to some other hair buzzers out there (i.e the Wahl Peanut) its a cheap product. However, the first time using this product, I noticed that the design of the comb makes it very hard to get an even trim. Now the downstairs area looks like theres uneven patches of hair. Plus the design of the comb makes it so that you actually have to be super careful about pinching yourself. I was hoping for a product that could get a super close shave without pinching but thats not the case with this product. Does not get as close of a shave as a disposable razor + shaving cream. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I actually threw this shaver in the garbage after both my 12 year old daughter and I went rounds trying to get this shaver to work before coming to my senses and deciding to fish out all the parts to return to Amazon.  (Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s decent return policy.)&lt;br /&gt;This shaver absolutely does not cut hair at any length on legs and does a very poor job on even very slight women&#x27;s upper lip hair.  Will stick with the Remington Shower Safe shaver I bought 5 years ago.  Thank goodness Amazon still carries the replacement foils and cutters and has a decent return policy.</li>
            <li> Prompt service, arrived as noted. I am very satisfied with product, the base holds all the attachments neatly in place. The price was right and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Good products and quick shipping +++</li>
            <li> My wife did not like this.  Attachments are difficult to use and it does not provide a close shave.  I would not recommend.  Stick to razors...at least they give a close shave.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the charging time is a little long and it would be nice if it would charge without the stand and charge through a direct plug in because it&#x27;s annoying to always have to take the stand with you when traveling. Other then that though it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This price and product look and sound great if you have a week to do your legs. Doesn&#x27;t work for crap.</li>
            <li> This Conair Satiny Smooth Ladie&#x27;s Personal Groomer is wonderful.  It does a nice job, it quiet and cleans so nicely.  I was happy I made this choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use primarily as a bikini shaver. The first and second use it worked great! And then the head started to pop off and it just wouldn&#x27;t shave as close, and then eventually not at all; made a lot of noise without shaving anything. I only used it 5 or 6 times all together, once or twice a month. I used to have the panasonic version for the same price and I&#x27;m going back asap. Waste of money, boo!</li>
            <li> This works well as a trimmer--which is why I bought it. I tried using it on my legs though, and it takes forever to shave. Doesn&#x27;t give you a perfect shave either. So if you&#x27;re buying this as a replacement for your razor, you will definitely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but worthless! Save your money and buy a better one, I did.</li>
            <li> I should have read more reviews before I ordered it.  I found out quickly it is not good for shaving legs.  Good for trimming eyebrows &amp; bikini area.  When I went back to reviews I found many saying the same thing.</li>
            <li> One of the few shavers I have found that I can shave under my arms and around delicate areas, without be nicked.</li>
            <li> Does not work good at all</li>
            <li> I bought this product for shaving the bikini area.  I love all the attachments and it works great in the shower or dry.  I find the base to be a little flimsy and the attachments don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  But overall this is a good product and the charge lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this little electric shaver. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for shaving legs because it&#x27;s so small, but it&#x27;s perfect for my bikini area. It has all the tools I need for a silky smooth Brazilian, and it doesn&#x27;t cut or pull like some others I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> A little more complicated to use than what I would like and it bites/pulls the hair a lot.</li>
            <li> Great for about 6 months or less. Then the battery dies and it won&#x27;t stay charged long enough to do the job. Boo. My husbands Wahl beard trimmer is much better.</li>
            <li> Only used once but it definitely got the job done! No pulling or pinching in delicate areas</li>
            <li> Definitely does not get all the hair.  Too much work.  It&#x27;s a struggle to get each section.  I have had other electric razors that were a 100 times better.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. Just received. Used once. Love it. Great price. Can&#x27;t go wrong. I hope it holds up!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut hair good!</li>
            <li> Good for quick shave. Just don&#x27;t ever drop it lol</li>
            <li> not totally pain free...feels king of like tweezing....creams are more comfortable!</li>
            <li> Makes shaving so much easier, such as trimming then going over the area. It works great got touch up on the eyebrows and lips. It is how ever hard to use on the armpits and legs, I would recommend a razor for ultimate smoothness. I also LOVE the little holder it comes with to charge the razor, and to hold all the heads. I would recommend this to a friend as it also saves money on waxing/threading.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is ok but the attachment for legs is horrible.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for legs.  If all you need is a bikini area trimmer I would suggest one that specializes just for that area and not worry about the other attachments</li>
            <li> I detest this shaver. First off it tells you to give it 14 days to allow your hair to be use to electric shaving (I have never seen this in shaver directions before so should have took this as an odd sign). Well, it&#x27;s been 6 weeks and this can&#x27;t remove a single hair. I have very little hair to begin with that needs shaving. I can easily go a month for my legs, and what hair I do get (along the shin bone) is very fine. This razor leaves it all behind. I mostly wanted it for the eyebrow attachment, well it doesn&#x27;t remove my, eyebrow stragglers in the wrong places, either. It also scrapes, and is uncomfortable to use. It takes forever to charge, but I gave up on it so it&#x27;s taking up space on my counter, and I will be throwing it away. A real waste of my money. I am on the hunt again for an electric razor simply because I hate using disposable items. This is in my opinion, a terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Does not work well and the wrong charger was sent with the razor.</li>
            <li> So far the shave has been great. It&#x27;s always ready for me to use. I love it</li>
            <li> It worked ok but didn&#x27;t last very long :(</li>
            <li> Verry smooth and easy to use</li>
            <li> This shaver does not get close enough to the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great great. I love it I use it to trim, and it works perfect. Great buy. Fantastic</li>
            <li> I tried using this once, and threw it away!  Right off the bat the blades were too dull and would hardly cut any hairs.  It just did a terrible, patchy shaving job!  Awful, do not waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It is easy to use and comes with several attachments. The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I would recommend it. My wife loves this product. Says it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this razor is that it turns on.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to shave your legs, forget it.  Maybe it works better for other body parts.</li>
            <li> I hated this product! Spent over an hour just to get an uneven, spotty, and miserable trim in the bikini area. It just pushed the hair around unless I held it taught. Promptly returned it!</li>
            <li> This shaver may work for other body areas, but would not shave the hair on my legs. Going over and over the same areas did not seem to help.</li>
            <li> The only part worth a fart is the little trimmer.  I regret purchasing this product.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Guess I will continue using a regular razor.  Was really hoping this could be used easily for quick touch ups,  unfortunately not</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving kit. All the parts you need to shave and trim. Cleans up easy, can be used in the shower, and it&#x27;s rechargeable. Only thing I would change is that the pieces don&#x27;t all fit perfectly in the base and the main shaver can not be stored in the base while not in use.</li>
            <li> Very functional, works great.</li>
            <li> I do not like this at all.  The head will just pop off while shaving and it doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave.  Wish I would of spent a little more money and got something that worked.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  worked the first time and then it doesn&#x27;t wish I had the box to return  so disappointed. I hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple months ago.  So far so good!  I&#x27;ll post again if I have problems with it.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave beneath my unmentionables and it works great. I read many reviews looking for one I could use for this purpose and this one had good reviews. I back those reviews up. And with summer in full swing, get that bikini area ready ladies.</li>
            <li> Great convenient shaver.</li>
            <li> this shaver does everything it says.  very sturdy and for the price has a lot of attachments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. I use it to trim my eyebrows and the attachment to shave my bikini area. It really works great. Nice and smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly without bruising or chafing. My husband uses it too...No brainer to use and it just works prefectly.  Wish they have a better way of storing the attachments as the little wanna be holder is not suffiencient.</li>
            <li> nice hair removal product for the money. good selection of attachments that allow you to use on various parts of the body.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, in delacate areas. I don&#x27;t like the way the additional razor head are stored, they can just fall out. They should desgin a cover to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> bought it as my daughter&#x27;s first razor.  The top comes off easily, but for a first its a good start</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver especially for the armpits and bikini area.  I am able to do the whole \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; style bikini grooming with this having no problems with pinching or cutting.  For the most part I don&#x27;t get much irritation and for my sensitive skin that is saying a lot.  I do recommend this for the bikini area not the legs it&#x27;s too narrow to cover all the surface of the legs efficiently.</li>
            <li> I like the multiple heads so now I can use this shaver for bikini, face, and underarm areas.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle, even when wet in the shower.  The size is smaller than other shavers I&#x27;ve used so I can really do a thorough job below the belt.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months so we&#x27;ll see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my bikini area and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very small and fits nicely in the palm of my hand. It doesn&#x27;t pinch and pull the hairs out painfully (like other electric razors I&#x27;ve had have done in the past). Gives a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> It is what I was looking for. Thank you for delivering on time.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed at some of the positive reviews for this product. How come that something that apparently worked so wonderful for some, did a totally crap job for me, and from the negative reviews I can tell for many other people. Can a product be so good and so bad at the same time? I will never again trust any positive reviews of any product as far as there are so many negative reviews of it. Better safe that sorry.</li>
            <li> works great! i have no complaints at all!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 uses</li>
            <li> The wife loves this tool, great value.</li>
            <li> it works really good - for fast results and no razor burns.  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a smooth feel like a razor does.  I use a lot when I am limited on time.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has the four different accessories. It only holds its charge for 2 hours and has to charge for 16... thats the only downfall</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice and got a smooth shave.  I carefully took it apart to clear away hair.  I put it back together and it does not work well at all.  Very disappointed and wish I bought another product.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric trimmer I ever bought. So I don&#x27;t really have a good comparison to compare this to. But I will share my experience. If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave, not ideal. Yeah it&#x27;ll trim ya up but don&#x27;t expect it to make you silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about the product is that it has different heads that do different things.  The bad thing about the product is that the heads don&#x27;t lock into place.  So, sometimes while using the product the heads twist off the base.</li>
            <li> This razor is light and has a comfortable to grip. The directions are written very small and are confusing. The storage compartment is a jig saw puzzle to use. So far it has not done a good job shaving my legs, but I am willing to give it a shot and be sure it is not operator error.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mom and it works much better than any small trimmer for removing facial hair.  It does more than she needs it for but it is solidly built and easy to maintain.  Rechargeable stand is perfect.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver!  Very handy.  I used to find it in stores but can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore.  Glad to find it again here at amazon.  Thank You</li>
            <li> Only two stars because my wife make only half Brazilian, after she finished may I I put another few stars.</li>
            <li> Well I really liked this product ....before it stopped working. The product is good for your armpits and private areas , but not a clean shave for your legs. It was really hard to charge it even when I first received it, because the charger is at the bottom. But it was good while it lasted</li>
            <li> Great idea, but the head came off the second time I used it. It worked great for a few minutes til the head won&#x27;t stay on at all now. Know I have to look for a new one.</li>
            <li> Awesome...tried many different razors for the bikini area..this one is by far the best and cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> So far so good. I only use it in my bikini area and it has occasional tugging but it&#x27;s not too bad - perhaps I was rushing through the process. It is easy to handle; I just hope the motor holds up over the years. I would buy again, thus far - have only infrequent uses since it was purchased. I like that this Conair version has a wall charger instead of constantly replacing AAA batteries like my former one which finally died.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver it gets all the hair the first use! keeps charge for a few days. Also, a good space saver!</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave like i was expecting.</li>
            <li> The best wet dry shaver under $40. It&#x27;s smaller than the other bulky shavers and won&#x27;t cut sensitive skin. Some shavers will not even cut certain hair types...this one will. This is the second time I&#x27;m buying this one after trying another one out that was more expensive but just terrible. I&#x27;m so glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut properly, and takes too long to charge after only a few minutes of working.</li>
            <li> I have used two other groomers in the last 5 years, and this is by far the best.  It is easy to use, and has all the attachments needed for personal care.</li>
            <li> The product died after only a handful of uses. The light is on that shows it is charging but it simply won&#x27;t turn on. I really liked how the product worked, but I really think I should have gotten more than 5 or 6 uses out of it... I only had it for a couple of months, but now I can&#x27;t even return it or get a refund since that option expired just a couple of weeks ago. I don&#x27;t like leaving a bad review, but unfortunately, this deserves it.</li>
            <li> This is used by both a man and a woman in our house.  The man uses it to groom his facial hair, sideburns, and eyebrows.  The woman uses it for her legs.  Works great for both and the charging stand is convenient for storing everything in one place.</li>
            <li> I do wish this came with a guide, with different levels of hair length. Otherwise, it works well.  Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> At first this product worked fairly well. It shaved closely and in a reasonable amount of time. It cut me once, which was upsetting because this has never been a problem with electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. However the battery died immediately after it was too late for me to return/replace it. After only about two months I had to throw it away. It was a total waste of money. My recommendation is to buy a men&#x27;s electric razor- I use one now that never cuts me, never dies, and shaves much more quickly.</li>
            <li> My old electric shaver quit so it was time for a new one.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out all the attachments as the directions are a little vague.  However, this little thing does a nice job on legs and delicate areas and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the sink.  No way am I taking a razor blade to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is great so many different attachments &amp; the battery lasts forever!</li>
            <li> It said it comes with oil to clean it but it didn&#x27;t. Works well.</li>
            <li> Love it!  No more razor burn/bumps.  Even on the bikini line.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing!  So glad I chose this one from all the ones I looked at.  Bought it to replace an old one (that wasn&#x27;t very old) that had started snagging and pulling hairs for some reason.</li>
            <li> Does not work very good</li>
            <li> Satiny Smooth is stretching it, however it is far superior and comfortable than any other.  Easy to use wet or dry.  Very easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I really liked this when I received it, it functioned great for about a month and a half and then the attachments became too lose and the unit sounds like a lawnmowe. I have the option of sending the unit to the retailer with 3.00 shipping for them to either fix or replace and wait for a replacement but was faster to just order a different product. What a shame because I really did like it at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a forever chore to shave even small areas on my legs.  Mostly usually on my knees and it does not work very well at all.  Cannot recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! And the shipping was on time!!!</li>
            <li> It does not pull the hair while shaving, Great little kit and charges fast. Every girl should have one of these.</li>
            <li> Great for under arms but causes minor irritation on bikini area if close attention is not paid. I&#x27;ve been using it for one month now so irritation may be due to adjusting to foil shaver from years of razor use. Have not used the eyebrow shaping attachment yet.</li>
            <li> This thing is awful. I&#x27;ve used it twice with the comb attachment on, and both times, the comb just causes the hair to get tangled and stuck and nothing gets cut.  The razor isn&#x27;t the problem, as I got frustrated and took the comb off and used it with only the razor part.  I wish I&#x27;d just sucked it up and bought a more expensive one that would actually work.</li>
            <li> It works great on my arm pits but my legs feel like there is a days growth after I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of pros and cons that I read when looking for an electric razor for my wife.  She is no longer able to shave in the shower as she doesn&#x27;t see all that well and she looses her balance when bending over.  I went ahead a purchased this one and it works really well for her.  She can use it in the full light and sitting down.  It is easy to clean and use.  She has arthritic hands and it poses no problem for her.  I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but I am glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> Works better on a man&#x27;s back than a woman&#x27;s bikini area.  I know it because I tried it... My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> the second time I used it, it cut me. I was using the trimmer and I ended up bleeding. Dont get this</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described. Can&#x27;t say too much at this time as I haven&#x27;t used it much. Seems to do a decent job for quick shaves.</li>
            <li> Not bad great shipping</li>
            <li> It worked really well when i first got it. It provided a really close shave on the bikini area. Unfortunately it died on me a couple weeks ago. I have had it for 7 months total. I made sure i took it out of the shower after each use, dried it, and set it back on the charging the charging station.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this groomer, but it never even turned on despite it being charged for 16+ hours.</li>
            <li> I tried every attachment and none of them offered a smooth shave. There was always stubble left behind. I went over my legs 3 times and the razor was still unable to pickup some of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has a relatively short battery life and took a long time to recharge. The charging station is flimsy. While charging, the charging stand doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the counter because the wire plugs in underneath and awkwardly sticks out under the edge of the charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wad disappointed with both the poor shaving abilities of this razor and the quality of the material. I would recommend opting for a higher quality device even if it means spending a little more money. You just aren&#x27;t going to get those super smooth results with this device.</li>
            <li> Cannot seem to find anything worth, well... anything anymore. It is ok but definitely not what was expected... hasnt died yet like some have said... so we will see.</li>
            <li> Very low quality,  and doesn&#x27;t get close at all.</li>
            <li> I went over and over many times. It misses hairs and leaves stubble. Great for an old lady who never has a man touch her legs.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to clean. Fits in my hand well</li>
            <li> Does the job  need it to do.</li>
            <li> The shaver is not effective.  It is as bad as the last time I tried an automatic shaver 20 or 30 years ago.  It may be better than its peers, but they would have to be truly awful if that is so.  The eyebrow attachment is way too rough and difficult to control for such precision work.  I hope the shaver will be useful for taking the pilling off my cashmere this winter.  If it does, I will be delighted.</li>
            <li> Loved this because it worked great, but stopped working by the 4th time I used it.</li>
            <li> Power switch is sort of touchy. First 16hr charge did not turn on razor even though instructions said 30 minutesof use&lt;br /&gt; It turned on after second 16 hr charge.  Comb attachment doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> Used it several times on coarser hair and it has worked well thus far! Haven&#x27;t tried a total shave, just trimming, and only used it dry.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to shave with. Has a couple of different heads for maneuvering different areas.  Shaves efficiently and effectively. I have saved money using this instead of disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor but it gets hot when I use some if the attachments and leaves black marks in my skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do. I bought this to trim my bikini area. I havent tried it on my legs or anywhere else so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works in other areas. The attachments are easy to change and the product feels like good quality. Can&#x27;t go wrong, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a trimmer and it works well.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is very easy to to use . It has all kinds of attachments, and it is easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Only had it a week and it isn&#x27;t charging anymore.</li>
            <li> Works ok, smaller than I thought.  I don&#x27;t know I would brag about it or recommend it either.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient product. The shaver doesn&#x27;t come as close to the skin as a razor, but is definitely a blessing in a rush (and as a college student, this happens often!). The eyebrow trimmer is definitely useful for maintaining minute hairs in practically any place. The trimmer does as it claims - trims. Overall, this has virtually replaced my need for my epilator, which I still use, but not as often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for trimming but thats about it</li>
            <li> I liked this razor at first, but it stopped giving me much of a shave at all after about 5 uses. The razor lost all its sharpness before it was even time to charge it for the first time! I suspect it has a really dull blade. I will have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth it to replace the blade or to just buy a new one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great and fast to use</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, but the nose shaver is not working.  I won&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Best for bikini area. Doesn&#x27;t get super close on the legs, but takes away noticeable hair at least! Battery life is long and it works great in the shower! Used for about 2 years and haven&#x27;t had to replace anything! The included lubricant for inside the razor is a great addition.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even go there, I had razor burn in places we don&#x27;t want to talk about. And the pain... Horrible. I&#x27;m no sissy, this thing hurt me bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9year old. I was scared to let her use a razor. This was a good solution. Easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric razor so I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it. This one is great-easy to hold,love that it&#x27;s PINK--works great. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work just fine until my daughter needed an electric razor so I gave it to her.  Nice grasp friendly size.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but the first time I used it, it wouldn&#x27;t catch a charge. Not sure if it was the cradle or the shaver, but I had to send it back and didn&#x27;t want to try my luck</li>
            <li> Received it on time and it works great dry or wet.  Didn&#x27;t end up with the pimples like I do with a razor.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Purchased for the wife, she does like it but says that she has to go over same area 3 or 4 times. Holds charge for plenty of time, but needs to because it has to run for a long time.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is wonderful for the price!  It gave me an acceptably smooth bikini shave (obviously not as close as with a razor, but way closer/smoother than I anticipated) and the parts are well made.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair products for about 10 years and never had any problems with them. I use their electric razors on my bikini line as it prevents me from getting ingrown hairs vs. using a regular razor. My old Conair electric razor broke and unfortunately they no longer make that model. I searched online and this one seemed like the best option due to the reviews and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it, it worked great. After that, it stopped cutting the hair. I tried taking it apart, cleaning it, etc. and nothing worked so I tried a different attachment. That one worked once and then stopped cutting. Please keep in mind that I shave every other day so it&#x27;s not like I had a months worth of growth to cut. I even tried waiting an extra day so the hair would be longer but it still would not cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get a razor that lasts longer than a week.</li>
            <li> This razor works well. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is because the interchangeable tops come off if I twist the razor while applying pressure and have dropped it in the toilet twice.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a closer shave like a razor. But it does what I need it to in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;Update: it died on me. I bought it one year ago. I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than 10 times :( I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I thought it would have lasted longer. The light on the razor works showing me that it&#x27;s charging. But when I switch it on, the blades don&#x27;t move. Even after a cleaning. Wish I could get a refund but it&#x27;s been too long.. I&#x27;m gonna try a different one with better ratings.</li>
            <li> The girl I have purchsed this for likes it a lot. The attachments are good too. The pink is a must.</li>
            <li> I made a perfect choice on this item.  The razor is comfortable to hold..The attachments are easy to configure. The charge stays active for much longer than I thought it would.  The price was friendly. Quality is high.</li>
            <li> I only just received this today, and whereas the instructions say to wait for 12 uses to truly see good results, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch back to regular razors!</li>
            <li> Very good product. It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The blades wore out really quick. Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> I love this groomer! It has different heads for whatever you need to clean up and gets very close for a smooth finish. Used it on my arms and biking line and it&#x27;s awesome. I like that it comes with a stand also.</li>
            <li> Works great really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I like to keep the playground well-landscaped while keeping some of the beauty and protection of the natural terrain.  The razor fits well in my hand, and, over time, the switch gets easier to turn it on.  I liked that it has different heads for different purposes, but that&#x27;s about it.  First of all, the 2 position adjustable comb does not stay in the longer position, so if you want to look like an adult, you have to trim it back further than you probably want to and wait a few weeks.  The comb also blocks quite a bit of the razor and prevents smooth, efficient hedge-trimming.  It also likes to catch and pull on some of the more unruly pieces, causing sharp pain in the lady bits.  Without the detail comb, the shaver works better but occasionally bites you and continues to create small divots on the field.  I don&#x27;t know if the foil shaver really works because I use the triple blade things for my legs and underarms, and I don&#x27;t have long/crazy enough growth on my face to need the eyebrow shaping stuff.  Finally, the tray that comes with this tool set doesn&#x27;t really keep everything organized.  One bump and it&#x27;s like playing 52-Card Pick Up, which is not the game I bought this razor for. All-in-all, there are some positives, but the negatives are worse.</li>
            <li> It get the job done..not great. It was a cheap buy so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Only use one attachment...but I like it. Easy to hold, easy to clean, easy to charge. To not accidently lose charge half way through a shave, I charge it after each use.</li>
            <li> if you want a low trim without removing all the hair follicle, don&#x27;t use the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Love it works wonders</li>
            <li> My wife loves this little trimmer for all of her hair trimming jobs. She even uses it to shave her legs when we go on vacation. At home she tells me she loves the way the battery will last a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male yes and I guess that&#x27;s why this shaver did nothing for me?! To get any body hairs down to stumble was a 2-3 day process. I didnt feel comfortable with the teeth on this touching sensitive parts but I gave it a try. After 2 weeks I went back to using a store bought 5 blade razor for men. WASTE OF MONEY!!!! The only use I get is using the smaller attachments to trim nose hairs. This product is unforgivable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly.. I threw it out when i got home and open the package.. very disappointing... has a bad odor smell. touched the blade and not even worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I literally have no pain or pulling whatsoever using this.</li>
            <li> It works so good I shaved half my eyebrow clean off. Beware! Its quality!</li>
            <li> Works great for bikini area and no skin irritation like a razor!</li>
            <li> ok, it took ALOT of research to find a trimmer that... A: fits snugly in my wife&#x27;s small feminine hands... B: DOESN&#x27;T SNAG OR RIP OUT THE HAIR...C: has NOT been ANY problems with razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  its as if this product was SPECIFICALLY designed with pubic hair trimming and sculpting in mind.  gotta admit, I TRIED IT ONCE TOO.  and um...it works for us dudes as well</li>
            <li> I LOVE this ladies shaver!  The last one I purchased tugged too much and hurt to use in the bikini area.  So I tried this one after reading the reviews and I am so happy.  It trims evenly and doesn&#x27;t tug too much.  I was able to use it in the entire bikini area without any issues.  Easy to clean, rechargeable and comes with a lot of attachments so you can use it for multiple purposes.  I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Works fine as I expected</li>
            <li> Love it. Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Best Lady&#x27;s razor ever.  Doesn&#x27;t lose its charge, doesn&#x27;t rip up my skin, works very well.  Outshines the lady remington electric I was using previously.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini area not so much for the legs</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. I use it for facial hair. There are many attachments, which make it easy to use. Fits on my small counter nicely.</li>
            <li> Nifty! This is a nice design and has two attachments. Small enough to travel! Sits beside my sonic care toothbrush on the counter and I just grab it before I step into the shower!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, keeps its charge for days at a time.  The attachment for trimming eyebrows is great and  gentle on the skin. I normally use this Personal Groomer just trim the hedges and a razor for any ground work. So if you are looking for a close shave try something else.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more compact replacement for my old Panasonic shaver, and for the price, it was worth taking a risk on this one.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I use a shaver primarily to touch up my legs and for my underarms.  This one did a poor job on my legs, making me go over the same spot multiple times.  Unfortunately, it was even worse on my underarms, where it nicked me again and again despite my contortionist efforts to prevent it.  When the shaver housing broke off after I accidently bumped it on the shower wall, I was almost relieved to have an excuse to just buy a different one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long, did not give a close shave.  Parts seemed cheaply made.  I will not be re-buying this one.</li>
            <li> This is a completely worthless razor. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this razor; try anything else. No matter which removable head you use, it&#x27;s impossible to get a close shave. I can&#x27;t even use this to shave my legs without digging the razor into the bone, and even then, it is not a good shave. It also rips hairs out, making the follicle bleed. I completely regret buying this item and now have to search for something new. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this.  she let me use it the other day and i also lobe</li>
            <li> the head kept popping off, and the spring disappeared so it no longer works.</li>
            <li> Very good !! excellent! to shave everything!</li>
            <li> I had bought a rechargeable a couple of years ago that was so top heavy, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on its plug in base. This works very well and I like the attachments.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great - especially with soapy water.  I haven&#x27;t used it too much, as I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity.  But so far, it works great and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great razor and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way it should ..wldnt recommend</li>
            <li> I may be giving a review a little too early as we have only used the one part so far.  I got it for my young granddaughter who scared me to death using a regular razor.  This one is easy to use.  She&#x27;s crazy about it.  Worth every penny to save some grey hairs form Grandma.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cut thicker hair that well.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly, sturdiness and or durability is questionable, but still using it daily. Will consider purhasing a more expensive item next time.</li>
            <li> this multi use beauty kit is so cute. and it meets my needs in the trip of Cancun. i really like it.</li>
            <li> This was for my 93 year old mother and she really likes it.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> good quality. exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The other reviews saying that it tugs are correct.  I have better luck with the bikini attachment, but it is not great.  Have already replaced it with another product.</li>
            <li> will not remove hair.</li>
            <li> I love my  shaver. I have been wanting one for awhile and now I have. One. It works great and does what I need. Tank you for getting here as fast as you did. Thank you  ottilie boris</li>
            <li> Perfect so far, like using in shower</li>
            <li> Threw this out after one week. The top of the shaver would fall off each and every time I used it...  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a women&#x27;s shaver as using razors wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I wanted. Didnt like having to re-shave every couple of days. I came across this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ladies razor and read the reviews.. A lot of them mixed.. I have to be honest after using this razor I am kicking myself for not doing it sooner.. I love it!!!. Their were some reviews that the foil head would fall off , and some were getting cut.. I have no trouble with this razor. I fully charged it beforw I used it and put some oil on it. Maybe it could be from pushing down too hard. The razor should glide over your skin, and be less app for you to get cut or the head come off.. hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the eyebrow trimmer isn&#x27;t what I expected but still a good product. Also it&#x27;s time consuming to clean the blades, but it&#x27;s worth it. Also it arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> This All-in-One Personal Groomer gets the job done ! The attachments are great and they cover every need, plus its cute. Easy to use and clean, doesn&#x27;t nick, pull or pinch.  The only negative thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case for storage. Great product, great price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shaver, simply, easy to plug in, charge, etc. I travel in a motorhome, so don&#x27;t want it to take up to me room. This thing is great! Fits in your and just perfect and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest razors/groomers that I have ever used and I have used a great many in that I am 70 years old.&lt;br /&gt;IT is smooth and does not pinch or bind.  The stroke is just as smooth and I am able to groom in last that half the time.  That is saying something, considering I just had open heart surgery 8 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;PaddyCake.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my wife and she says it works great. She mentioned that it coud be improved if the cradle mounted directly to the outlet.</li>
            <li> ran very hot after a while but pouring water on it helps</li>
            <li> The razor worked well twice then it missed large areas and pulled the hairs rather than shaving them.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver.  I&#x27;d also like to add I was pleased to get it so quickly.</li>
            <li> Broke after 1 use!!  Tried to return it but was past my 30 days :(</li>
            <li> It works well and I like all the attachments. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that it cannot be used in water. It is not bad! Not as good as my old one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a lot of problems shaving because my skin is so sensitive. I get really bad razor burn, even when I use a ton of shaving cream and lotion afterward. I&#x27;d also been looking for a more efficient/less painful way of dealing with my bikini area. I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about two weeks now, and it&#x27;s a godsend. I can use it with or without water, and as long as I go over the sections a few times slowly, I get just as smooth a shave as I would with a razor - but without the burn. The trimmer attachment is also great for bikini needs. I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesvwondersvon the skin, it gets call the hair doesn&#x27;t leave any marks ?</li>
            <li> We have purchased three different Conair clippers and have loved each one.</li>
            <li> I love this little shaver. Gets the job done with an amazing price! Def recommend!!! It&#x27;s can be used in the shower or out!!</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric shaver prior to this, so I don&#x27;t have a comparison. For me it&#x27;s convenient. I don&#x27;t have to buy shavers and shaving cream every so often, and I get a clean enough shave. I like it better on a wet shave.</li>
            <li> Sisters Christmas was complete with this gift her other died and it cost more to replace the battery than it did to just replace the whole product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well at all. Scraps my legs and dosent cut the hair</li>
            <li> Terrible. The heads don&#x27;t stay attached, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smooth shave the head pops off with any pressure applied. Two stars because the battery stays charged for a while.</li>
            <li> It only holds a charge for about 2 mins... Nothing gets done before it slows down. Thats what I get for being cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li> Some attachments will not remove hair. I waited a long time to buy this product, so I&#x27;m disappointed it&#x27;s not working well.</li>
            <li> I bought then returned it. I chose this over a Remington model based on slightly better reviews and regretted it. The brow trimmer kept splitting open every time I turned it on. The &amp;#34;casing&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t appear broken, it just didn&#x27;t snap closed securely enough to keep it closed when the unit started vibrating. I returned it and got the Remington which is the manufacturer of the model I was originally replacing. My old Remington lasted about 6 years and still worked well until the rechargeable battery stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li> Works good, BUT is not water proof if it gets too much water it stops working I had mine for only 2 weeks and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor feels a little cheap, but it does the job well.  I really liked the eyebrow trimming tool.  Follow product directions for best result.  It&#x27;s not as close a shave on the legs as a bladed razor, but for a, electric cordless razor, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine for the reason I purchased it. I&#x27;d give it a better rating if it maintained a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old groomer since it was getting dull and pulling at my hairs. This has worked great! I still am not very sure about the charging stand and all the compartments they don&#x27;t hold all the attachments as well as they should.</li>
            <li> I have use/used many electric razors including the epilator. This razor works so well! It sits on a charging station, comes with every attachment, and gets a close shave. This shaver is more for face, bikini, underarm, and general touch ups. But you can still use it on your legs. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. The shipping was fast, packing was great, and the charging station holds all attachment pieces for easy use. So you don&#x27;t have to dig around to find different attachments when you need them</li>
            <li> Good, but could be better. Vibration actually causes heads to spin off during use. Threw it away after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Got this after my personal trimmer died. I have to say it&#x27;s a good replacement! I use it on my girly parts and it gets the hair down to about 1/16 of an inch. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it occasionally snags on my skin, but for the most part it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and having fun using all the attachments!</li>
            <li> i got this one cause i need another personal shaver and this one was the closest to the one i used to have.</li>
            <li> WORKS AS STATED.. MY WIFE LOVES THIS ITEM AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO OTHER BUYERS. LEAVES THE BODY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> It was weak and relatively useless when it came to shaving.  It did not give anything close to a smooth shave on any level for legs or bikini line. As far as trimming in the bikini area, it gave a rudimentary trim that was tolerable, but there is only one attachment, so you only can have one trim length. I think it&#x27;s probably a better product for people with light and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this strictly as a way to trim the nether-regions. Other electric shavers really pinch and cut me badly, so I took a chance on this one. So far so good. I haven&#x27;t even used any of the other attachments. It trims close enough, but obviously not like a razor. I just wanted something that would tidy up, without causing injury. The only problem I think I&#x27;m seeing already is that it seems like the blades are moving more slowly than when I first bought it. I don&#x27;t expect this to last very long. Maybe I can do an update after I&#x27;ve had it a little longer (I&#x27;ve only had this about one month). I hope it keeps working, because I really do like it. But it seems like perhaps it really isn&#x27;t going to last very long.</li>
            <li> bought it due to reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut hair; legs, bikini, nothing.... and I haven&#x27;t had such trouble with other products. this is absolutely no good. I threw it in the trash. It just doesn&#x27;t cut. At all.</li>
            <li> Received this shaver last week. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I already really like it. The various shaver heads etc pop on &amp; off easily. It&#x27;s light in my hand, which I also like. It&#x27;s also handy that they provide not only the cleaning brush, but the little container of oil.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Close Shaves!</li>
            <li> this is the best thing I ever used nice for bikini area</li>
            <li> It gives a great smooth shave it is better than any other personal groomer I have used. I just returned another one I got in case this one didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it wasnt very expensive.  Long story short it doesnt work anymore and one of the attatchments never worked.  I hate the hassle of returning something so I just kept it.  If you want cheap, cheap is what you get!</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this product to use as a trimmer for my bikini area, and was excited to use it as a shaver for my legs as well. Unfortunately, it does not work well for me as a shaver, it left quite a bit of stubble even after going over my legs many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bikini trimmer worked wonderfully, and that is ultimately what I intended this product for. The eyebrow attachment is also great, it&#x27;s just the shaver that I&#x27;m not too thrilled with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you plan on using it mostly as a bikini/eyebrow trimmer, not so much if you plan on using it to actually shave your legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price. If you need a good one spring for it. But for small use its fine. Just don&#x27;t expect to do your legs or anything.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a reasonable price. I had recently used Schick Quatro bikini trimmer, which can&#x27;t even compare to this. I bought it and use it for the bikini zone, which it works well. Granted, don&#x27;t expect it to be like waxing or shaving, but it trims everything down to make it more manageable for waxing/shaving. I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs with poor results, so do not expect to use it for that. I haven&#x27;t tried the &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; extension. As other reviews have said, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t damp! I forgot one time and it did pull hair out and cause bleeding. All the other times, it has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable. It&#x27;s also pretty small so very easy to hide discretely. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works in there. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and it&#x27;s getting the job done that I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Love! Received timely.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Conair trimmer set. The first unit stopped holding a charge after about 3 years, but other than that is was perfect. This set is similar (except did not come in a cute little pink case). It has a charging stand with spots for all the accessories and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. This is the best trimmer ever. When the last one went belly up I replaced it with a more expensive Remington which was a good shaver but a lousy trimmer-- the gauge comb was useless and not adjustable, but when I removed it became a torture device which I stopped using because it always bit me (sorry, Honey!!). The Conair is not a great shaver, so if you are looking for an all-in-one device for trimming, facial hair, plus pits &#x27;n&#x27; legs, this is not it. If you&#x27;re looking for Brazilian results, this is also not it. But if you need neat and tidy with no pain plus a nice eyebrow grooming, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This product is very poorly made and the blade attachment falls off when used!  Save your money!! It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> and I am almost 55!, this order came on the day it said. it is what it was explained to be, and works for me. thank you. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first electric razor. (change is difficult for me)</li>
            <li> I was excited t get this as I have had other Conair products and liked them. This however was one of the worst electric razors I have ever had. The first two times I used it were good. It worked well. The third time however....it did not work well at all. The blades were VERY dull.  I do not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Items were satisfactory.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t used all the features of this product but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the wife and she gives it a thumbs up. Accessory tray seems a bit kludgy and could benefit from a redesign.</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> This simple little shaver is perfect for bikini area. When I&#x27;m headed to the beach, I just use the trimmer and shaver dry. Easy, no &amp;#34;maintenance,&amp;#34; no pain.</li>
            <li> OMG this is a wonderful time saving shaver.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well.  I read many of the reviews and it was a mixed pool.  I didn&#x27;t care for it as much. It&#x27;s not worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought it to trim my girlfriend&#x27;s pubic hair as a part of love making ritual.  It works pretty well.  You don&#x27;t want to shave down there, because it itches when hair grows back. it&#x27;s very good for the money.</li>
            <li> I didnt thought it was going to be so awesome. It leaves your skin totally soft, all accesories worked great. Because it was so cheap i wasent expecting it to be so good, but was greatly surprised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this much, but then again I&#x27;m used to plastic razors. This pulled the hairs and was uncomfortable to use.Ended up giving this to Goodwill</li>
            <li> Great little razor for cleaning up the lady parts, but not so much the legs... Dosent get close enough and I always have stubble. But for &#x27;her&#x27; it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Quality product. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> My wifes razor stop working. So I went looking on amazon to find a replacement. I ran across this one and she could not be mored thrilled.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Rated this as just OK because it does not cut well on coarse hair, it takes several passes to achieve a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does everything I want it to, charges well, and doesn&#x27;t take much cleaning between shaves. I mostly use it for my bikini area but it works well on my legs too.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. Additional items are helpful. Every thing you need in one kit. Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but so far it seems like a good choice.  I have had 2 smaller Remington groomers that were just the right size, etc. but they didn&#x27;t hold a charge, (barely a few minutes,) and didn&#x27;t hold up very long to everyday use.  I mainly chose this unit based on reviews and size.  I have no idea how it might perform for large areas like legs.  It would probably e fine for underarms or bikini area.  I use it to shave facial hair &#x3D; lip and chin.  Yeah ladies, this is what you have to look forward to in old age.  I would prefer a smaller shaving head and no adjacent trimmer, but it shaves well, (I can&#x27;t stand to feel stubble,) and so far it is holding a decent charge.  Can&#x27;t speak to the other attachments as I haven&#x27;t used them and probably won&#x27;t, but they appear to fit and function about like any other grooming tools.  I wish women had more, and better choices for hair removal.  I find other methods to be unsatisfactory as most of them require letting the hair grow out long enough to be effective.  NOT an option!!!  And depilatories are too harsh for (old) thin, sensitive skin.  I was spending hours tweezing, and finally gave up and started shaving.  Best option for this old gal, but need better tools!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. My legs feel smooth to the touch. Eyebrow trimmer is a little tricky and gets hot on your skin very quickly. Overall and for the price a good buy.</li>
            <li> Shaves close with sharp blades that do not pull at sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a very old remmington one that broke. Its a nice size and charges well! Works perfect!</li>
            <li> Works well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews. I think it&#x27;s too cheap. The different pieces that fit on are ok. The battery dies quickly. I would not recommend using this on wet skin, as it does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, just be careful not to catch any hairs in the corner or it HURTS :(</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is supposedly a reliable brand and due to good reviews. But, I got a lemon. I barely used it twice since I bought it in mid June and it no longer charges, and of course I can no longer return it or exchange it. Bummer, hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> great shaver! I love it! It beats using the disposable ones &amp; it&#x27;s safer as I don&#x27;t risk cuts. As a diabetic, that is something I need to be careful of &amp; that was the reason I went to this razor. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This personal razor works really good.  It gives a smooth close shave.Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is a&lt;br /&gt;good inexpensive shaver---you have to be careful about cleaning and not use the little cleaning brush on the foil, however-------------</li>
            <li> Great for both wet and dry shaving. Haven&#x27;t used all the attachments but they will be hand if the need to use them occurs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  Everyone knows a happy wife is a happy life.  We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> used twice now wont charge..wife</li>
            <li> The head falls off all the time while shaving.</li>
            <li> After purchasing several other brands that didn&#x27;t shave close enough, including some men&#x27;s electric razors, I found this one.  It is gentle, but shaves closely and has lasted a while so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for legs more for bikini area underarms too&lt;br /&gt;Also love the extras especially the one for eyebrows love it</li>
            <li> It comes all ready charged. I have only used it once, since I got it yesterday, but have used all the attachments for it. The eyebrow trimmer works really good, the only downfall on it, is with the curved handle, its too bulky, so hard to manuever to trim, the comb attachement for the eyebrows I&#x27;m not too thrilled about, never have been, maybe I just don&#x27;t use it right, but to me, it doesnt let the razor do its job. The shaver part for the legs, arms, etc.. it works pretty good, not a close shave, so don&#x27;t throw out your disposable razors you will need to use it for the stubbles to get a smoother shave. The bikini trimmer, is about the best part of the shaver I love. It works really well, again... dont throw out your disposable razor....... to get the stubbles.... Other then that, for the price, its well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  Purchased this before but misplaced it. Bought a more expensive brand from a store that cost $40 and it was no were as hood as this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using a traditional Venus razor for years and years and always had the worst razor burn bumps all along my bikini line. After reading reviews for this I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did because I haven&#x27;t had any since! It did take a few weeks for it to go away and my skin was a little dry at first but totally worth it! Didn&#x27;t have much luck with the eyebrow trimmer attachment but I was primarily buying for bikini trimmer so I don&#x27;t mind. I can usually get a few uses out of it before needing a re-charge.</li>
            <li> Great shaver is easy to use, very portable, and perfect for use all over.  Never had an issue with nicking or cuts. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> works good I am happy with it, especially bikini trimmer</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old granddaughter and she was so excited with it.  She says it is so much better than the old blade and especially loves the trimmer function.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth shave. The shaver part keeps coming off in the middle of shaving. Very disappointed and I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I was told by the instructions that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to the razor, but it does not give you a clean cut or feel. It leaves stubs behind. I do not like it.</li>
            <li> There is no way to recharge</li>
            <li> Top just twists off very easy.  I put duct tape on it to stop it from coming off.</li>
            <li> Will not charge...Money lost</li>
            <li> Very good razor, just doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. Def good enough though.</li>
            <li> I use this razor to do my underarms and private region. It works like a champ even when I decide to be perfectly bare</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The head is a little small for the legs. I can feel it scratching as I go up and down. Does the trick though.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, It does EXACTLY what I need it to do! I would definitely suggest not to use it without some type of saving cream etc or you may end up with razor burn! eeeek. But overall you really can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this product, the only reason it is a four star rating is you do have to constantly charge it like literally after every shave.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with all attachments</li>
            <li> this is james carrolls wife commenting bout the razor. i have to admit ive only owned it for a very short time but i have tried it on the legs and oh i luved it. it shaved my legs in one clean stoke it took me bout 5 mins with this trimmer which with shaving it would take a good bit. i havent tried it on my &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; but i plan on giving it a try dwn there too. and i luv how it charges and doesnt need batteries if it took batteries id probably wouldnt like it bc batteries can be expensive. so all i got to say ladies is grab it up and yes it even comes with a brush to clean it and some kind of oil idk wut its for yet but ill figure it out. and btw wen i say i shaved my legs with it i rlly did i shaved them dry and it wrked like a beauty.</li>
            <li> OK Not a real close shave!</li>
            <li> Love this shiver compact and easy to clean</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed- a back-up for when I don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower. I like all of the attachments. The battery runs out after about 20 minutes of continual use, but I&#x27;ve found that to be pretty typical for electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I let the good reviews for this razor talk me into getting one, but I&#x27;m sorry I did.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.  I have gotten Panasonic ES2207 razors for years, and got another one when this one was such a disappointment.  The Panasonic works much better.  The charger for the Panasonic takes up both slots of an outlet, but I&#x27;m finding it a small price to pay for a razor that actually works.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is 12. Perfect for her. Not too big and bulky. Charges easy and we bought a makeup bag for storage. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This works great but the only thing that really was a disappointment is the attachment that you change razors with has broken just a after a few months of owning, I had to duct tape it on so I can&#x27;t switch the heads on it.  But other then that it works great and has a long charge on it too.</li>
            <li> Worked great but stopped working all of a sudden. Had it less than a year. Also, I bought this because it had a tidy solution for the attachments but not all of the attachments fit on the base.</li>
            <li> This did not work nearly as well as many of the other reviews stated. The product had to be run over and over the same area in order to cut any hair, and even then it didn&#x27;t cut all of the hair on legs. We thought it might be that the hair was too course or too fine, so I let someone else try the item, just to be sure I was giving it a fair chance. I have fine hair, she had course, and the third had in between hair.... This product didn&#x27;t cut any of our hair without going over the same area multiple times. I have returned this, as it was a waste of time and money. If you choose to purchase this, I hope that it works for you, it failed all 3 of us. I would say that you get what you pay for, but this product wasn&#x27;t even worth the small amount of money that was paid. We were attempting to replace a 10 year old electric razor that is in need of the foil and the blades to be replaced, and that razor STILL works better than this brand new one.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! I only use it as a \\&quot; lady shaver\\&quot;. . . On occasion I will use the eyebrow trimmer too. The foil attachment doesn&#x27;t work all that well. I have tried it on my legs a few times but it will never be a true razor. My favorite attachment is the trimmer, the second largest head. It keeps me clean and close and has never hurt me. I love it.</li>
            <li> Broke the first day that I bought it.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but it does the trick.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use all the attachments yet.  The main razor does not shave as close as I would like but it does ok for a quick job.</li>
            <li> this works great no more in the bath and all that pain in the but stuff this is easy</li>
            <li> It does the job but like people said, dont expect it to get completely smooth and don&#x27;t even bother using on legs because it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> perfect for price, works well, the best part is the charging stand no batteries needed, great for bikini area and underarms</li>
            <li> Shaves well but the head falls off, alot. I didnt even use the attachments. Still works well enough that im keeping it.</li>
            <li> Then... It just became a feminine pink display on my bathroom counter.  In summary, I don&#x27;t like it, and I wish I&#x27;d spent my money on something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this razor so far. It does a great job and is ready to use and clean</li>
            <li> I only use electric razors for my thighs and bikini area as these areas are too sensitive for a regular razor. I am so glad I found this razor - I love it! It is easy to use, works wet or dry, on long or short hair and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and am happy with it.  This one was purchased for a young teen who is also happy with its performance. It was a great deal. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Great electric razor!</li>
            <li> Does NOT work at all!  Tried using it once and threw the thing away!</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> works great wife loves it</li>
            <li> Close save.  Easy on tender skin</li>
            <li> After two uses, this barely works. The foil does not cover sharp cutters, so it does not provide a close shave even on the first use.</li>
    </ol>
