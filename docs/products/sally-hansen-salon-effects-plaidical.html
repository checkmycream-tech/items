            <li>These are very cute.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>so I would never do my own at home.</li>
            <li>And it helps to have warm hands.</li>
            <li>But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments and had a bunch of people ask who did my nails.</li>
            <li>I love these strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand many, many times</li>
            <li>(I think this way is much better)</li>
            <li>Cute pattern.</li>
            <li>They are cute but fairly labor intensive to put on plus two strips peeled off the first day.</li>
            <li>Great product and great that you can get them here for a lot less than what you would pay in a store.</li>
            <li>It really is easy.</li>
            <li>Really easy to apply this product.</li>
            <li>Then I use the smooth side of the file to vigorously smooth the top of my nail, creating friction and heat to make it stick well.  </li>
            <li>If you have a steady hand, and love to do your own nails, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>they were super cute</li>
            <li>$3.49 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>The instructions suggest smoothing your nail with the smooth side of the file (included) before applying.  </li>
            <li>but i still very much enjoy them.</li>
            <li>So each box easily provides 2 full sets of nails for me.  </li>
            <li>So excited to try it on.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>The strips last over ten days for me and still look wonderful, and I do alot of cleaning without gloves.</li>
            <li>In general they are very easy to use from the moment you get used to them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I can go a full 24 hours without chipping newly polished nails.  </li>
            <li>great buy but hard to align without stretching</li>
            <li>The first time I did my nails with the Salon Effects</li>
            <li>I love the salon effects and I have purchased several styles.</li>
            <li>Hope to try more colors/designs with the same dealer or a price/shipping matching deal!</li>
            <li>Sally Hanson is the only brand of these I have tried, but I am satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>These hairs then make it more likely that the manicure will come off.  </li>
            <li>They suck I like KISS ten times better.</li>
            <li>If this had been my first use, I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li>give myself a manicure first.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and last about two weeks on my nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are short, and I can easily use one strip on 2 nails.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>Did not like that it was real polish.</li>
            <li>The product got here fast and on time.</li>
            <li>my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to apply a clear topcoat to get them to last longer.</li>
            <li>and then I will use this only for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I use the darkest pink side of the file and lightly &#x27;roughen&#x27; the nail, blow off any dust, then apply.  </li>
            <li>and i got quite a few compliments,looked cute.</li>
            <li>I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and took me less than 5 mins to finish both hands.</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m careful, I can use just one pack for a full set of fingers and toes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed the directions</li>
            <li>If u didnt use them right away they dry out.</li>
            <li>If you want professional looking nail art, but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li>That said, they are probably as timing consuming to apply as a complete manicure.  </li>
            <li>They are made of real nail polish, but have something else in them because they don&#x27;t get nicks or chip as easily as regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>You should get a decent week as directed but add a layer of the clear LED cured Sally Hansen Gel from before and after to get a solid 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I do put a clear layer of no chip nail polish so that might be why mine last longer.</li>
            <li>Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  </li>
            <li>it took me about a half hour, only because I was being very cautious to read every step and not mess up!</li>
            <li>Instead, it looks like red polish painted over black spots, unless you look  real close.  </li>

            <li> They provide a little give, so if you press it on and it&#x27;s not prefect, you can still lift it back up and reapply a couple times.  </li>

            <li> You have to read the directions, and be careful.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and tear if you are not careful , plus they do not last 3 days let alone the 10 that they advertise.i have used other strips that I highly recommend for half of the cost.</li>
            <li> Also it is quite difficult to get the shape right on the nail.</li>
            <li> the nails lasted longer than i expected!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its a hassle to take off.</li>
            <li> They last at least 2 weeks for me. -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less sticky, but heat makes it adhere, so pressing it down for 5-10 seconds with another finger gets it stuck well.  </li>
            <li> However, you can&#x27;t really mess up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before, with better results, so I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t work this time, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at polishing my nails</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell that it supposed to be a plaid.  </li>
            <li> I mean every time that I shampoo my hair when I am wearing them, hairs get stuck under them.  </li>
            <li> However for the red/black plaidical combination, the colors are not a good match.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> If you want professional looking nail art, but don&#x27;t want to pay the price. Sally Hansen Salon Effects are awesome! The first time I did my nails with the Salon Effects it took me about a half hour, only because I was being very cautious to read every step and not mess up! However, you can&#x27;t really mess up! They include extras so if you don&#x27;t like the way one turned out, take it off and apply a different one! I only had to do that on one nail though. It really is easy. I&#x27;m not very good at polishing my nails so I would never do my own at home. I was so impressed with the way my nails looked when I was done. I received so many compliments and had a bunch of people ask who did my nails. I am so happy about it!!</li>
            <li> You should get a decent week as directed but add a layer of the clear LED cured Sally Hansen Gel from before and after to get a solid 2 weeks. Really easy to apply this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting these Salon Effects and getting complements on them. They are easy to apply and last about two weeks on my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried to put them on, and they wouldn&#x27;t stick to my nails. I&#x27;ve used this brand before, with better results, so I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t work this time, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does not stick and I prep my nails and all. Also it is quite difficult to get the shape right on the nail.</li>
            <li> I love the salon effects and I have purchased several styles. This one is of my favorits. In general they are very easy to use from the moment you get used to them. Also they last for long time.</li>
            <li> They are cute but fairly labor intensive to put on plus two strips peeled off the first day. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> it just came out crappy coz i was in a rush and very disapointed it was a waste. note dont hurry</li>
            <li> Bought it on amazon from Web&#x27;s Best Deal. $3.49 plus free shipping. Got package delivered within 3 days after placing the order. So excited to try it on. It&#x27;s easy to apply and took me less than 5 mins to finish both hands. I have relatively short nails and used only 5 out of 16 strips from the kit. Very happy with the shiny and cute nail color/art. Hope to try more colors/designs with the same dealer or a price/shipping matching deal!</li>
            <li> Sally Hanson is the only brand of these I have tried, but I am satisfied with them.  They are a great way to get this sort of manicure without paying a salon.  That said, they are probably as timing consuming to apply as a complete manicure.  Also, they have a tendency to peel, and your hair gets stuck under them.  By that I mean every time that I shampoo my hair when I am wearing them, hairs get stuck under them.  These hairs then make it more likely that the manicure will come off.  Once they start to peel they will not last.  Also, be sure to apply a clear topcoat to get them to last longer.</li>
            <li> They suck I like KISS ten times better.And they are cheaper.Did not like that it was real polish.If u didnt use them right away they dry out.Kiss gives u xtra n they dont dry out.</li>
            <li> The product is great.  Works fine.  Yes, you need to take your time and it will look good.  However for the red/black plaidical combination, the colors are not a good match.  It is hard to tell that it supposed to be a plaid.  Instead, it looks like red polish painted over black spots, unless you look  real close.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of five, because to make it an obvious plaid, the red should be a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> You have to read the directions, and be careful. If you have a steady hand, and love to do your own nails, this is for you. I love these strips.</li>
            <li> Great, fast and perfect. They came as described. The product got here fast and on time. Everything went well. Cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand many, many times and I&#x27;m not sure if these were old or stored improperly, but they lasted all of a day or so before they peeled off. If this had been my first use, I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and tear if you are not careful , plus they do not last 3 days let alone the 10 that they advertise.i have used other strips that I highly recommend for half of the cost. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When using these polish strips you have to take your time. You have to give yourself a manicure first then slowly lay on the strip. And it helps to have warm hands. The strips last over ten days for me and still look wonderful, and I do alot of cleaning without gloves. I do put a clear layer of no chip nail polish so that might be why mine last longer. My only complaint is that its a hassle to take off.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to apply and it really can last up to 10 days. Mine last frequently for 7, but I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  I always get compliments about my nails when I use these products. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I can go a full 24 hours without chipping newly polished nails.  I only got these because they were 50% off at Target (regularly $8.49).  But have now ordered several from Amazon, still cheaper than the store.  They are made of real nail polish, but have something else in them because they don&#x27;t get nicks or chip as easily as regular nail polish.  They last at least 2 weeks for me. - Possibly longer but I like to change them.  People say they&#x27;re a pain to take off, but they&#x27;re made of nail polish, not a sticker.  Using nail polish remover it is similar to taking off maybe 4 coats.  One box comes with 2 sealed packs of 8 strips each.  My nails are short, and I can easily use one strip on 2 nails.  So each box easily provides 2 full sets of nails for me.  I can also do my toes using only 3 strips, by applying them then trimming off the edges.  So if I&#x27;m careful, I can use just one pack for a full set of fingers and toes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed the directions but they don&#x27;t adhere as good.  Here&#x27;s how I do it (I think this way is much better) -&lt;br /&gt;I give myself a manicure first.  The instructions suggest smoothing your nail with the smooth side of the file (included) before applying.  For me, they don&#x27;t stick as well that way.  I use the darkest pink side of the file and lightly &#x27;roughen&#x27; the nail, blow off any dust, then apply.  They provide a little give, so if you press it on and it&#x27;s not prefect, you can still lift it back up and reapply a couple times.  After the 2nd time of lifting it up it&#x27;s less sticky, but heat makes it adhere, so pressing it down for 5-10 seconds with another finger gets it stuck well.  I use the tip of another nail to make a crease at the end of my nail, and on any sides that go onto my skin, and pull off the excess.  Then I use the smooth side of the file to vigorously smooth the top of my nail, creating friction and heat to make it stick well.  Done!</li>
            <li> the nails lasted longer than i expected! they were super cute and i got quite a few compliments,looked cute. great buy but hard to align without stretching</li>
            <li> These are very cute. They do look a little different in the picture but i still very much enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Cute pattern. They didnt last but a day though.</li>
            <li> Great product and great that you can get them here for a lot less than what you would pay in a store.</li>
            <li> I really like Sally Hansen nail strip, are easy to apply and with a layer of clear polish they last a week, BUT I used different models (all Sally Hansen) and after maybe 6 weeks  my nails were really damaged they just break in a funy way (vertically), so now I stop using nail strips till my nails grow for like a moth and then I will use this only for special occasions. But they really looks good, I got a lot of complements!</li>
