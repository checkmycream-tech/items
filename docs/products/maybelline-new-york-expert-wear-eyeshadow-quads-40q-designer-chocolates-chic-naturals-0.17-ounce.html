    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I ordered the chocolates because I thought this color palette would work best with my caramel coloring and it does.</li>
            <li>It is good!!</li>
            <li>(the darkest shade, on the bottom) is perfect for polishing up and filling in my brown/blonde eyebrows with a MAC #266 brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use this product on myself and daughter all the time, it is a great combo of colors and goes on perfectly</li>
            <li>They all correspond beautifully and make the process a breeze.</li>
            <li>It is a great all in one set to get that look.</li>
            <li>The best color for me was the rose brown crease color.</li>
            <li>It looks great on.</li>
            <li>but it is great.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and the product is really good, with exellent fixation.</li>
            <li>The color choices blend very nicely together, they have great staying power, and I love the way they are labelled to give you the best use of the colors.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it instructs where to put the colors for the best effect but you can switch them up too.</li>
            <li>good shades....very happy</li>
            <li>I am all about experimenting with what looks good but not overdone.</li>
            <li>I loved the eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>Came in a timely manner, good product, and good on brown skin too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great combination, and handy to have them all together.</li>
            <li>This quad a good mix of neutral colors</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that it explains how to apply the make up to look your best and bring out your eyes.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Pigmantions is ok the colors are beautiful</li>
            <li>Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....</li>
            <li>the colors are nice and look good with my brown eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color quad...not too bright, not too smoky, just natural enhancement for your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice.</li>
            <li>The pigments slip around a bit after application, meaning you can&#x27;t quite get precision lines/shadows, but the product is nice and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>I apply my shadow with brushes which I think makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I love the color combination and the diagram on how to apply the colors.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite eyeshadow combo and the one i use most often.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have owned this product before and love that color.</li>
            <li>More saturation of pigment would have been better, but what I can expect for $5?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the shine without all the glitter.</li>
            <li>I put #3 on most of my eye.</li>
            <li>Good colors, great lasting wear, easy and smooth application.</li>
            <li>some are more vibrant than others there good for the price</li>
            <li>I like that this palette has the perfect amount of shimmer with minimal dust and fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this and loved it so much that I got [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The natural look is great for daytime, and, of course, you can jazz it up a bit for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>Shimmer is fine for some people, but not if your eyelids are over 40.</li>
            <li>Great colors that last all day and night.</li>
            <li>It has that natural look when you put it on and it works really good with brown eyes.</li>
            <li>They are great if you use them as a wash color and then use other colors to give more definition.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>This is a fun set to play around with!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced some fallout with the  dark pink/mauve color, but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>YEAH RIGHT!</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years, and the quality is consistently very high.  </li>
            <li>Ordered two of these, both arrived damage free even though the packaging was pretty skimpy.</li>
            <li>The colors are light but pretty</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Quads, Stylish Smokes,</li>
            <li>I love this Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Quad in Designer Chocolates.</li>
            <li>This incredibly powdery makeup doesn&#x27;t last more than a half hour if that on my face.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s more of a day look or natural evening look.</li>
            <li>Just beautiful as more expensive brands</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the applicators are cheaply made and fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they recently changed the layout of the compact in a way that minimizes two of the colors- which happen to be the ones I use most often.</li>
            <li>also enjoy that the color marked \\&quot;Liner\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Of course it is not as nice as something more expensive, but I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li>Had to contact the seller and they were speedy, and very repectful and answered all my questions.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived fast and undamaged.</li>
            <li>It does not have the creamy texture that I really like</li>
            <li>and for the price, it does more than expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>love the way the different colors are marked to show the way they should be used to create a polychromatic look.</li>
            <li>I still like this one much better for other reasons.</li>
            <li>and I have a gorgeous set of dark blue eyes.</li>
            <li>B0000VLX2S ChapStick Classic Lip Balm SPF 4, Cherry, 0.15-Ounce</li>
            <li>I normally wear MAC and Clinique Shadows</li>
            <li>So far, thumbs</li>
            <li>I love this particular color set (at least for me personally).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and elegant.  </li>
            <li>BTW, I love to use the darkest color on my eyebrows to fill in the sparse look that makes you look so tired -- it really seems to brighten your entire expression.</li>
            <li>I always have got complements when I wear these colors and it has become hard to fine.  </li>
            <li>It gives just enough contrast and pop that it highlights natural features &amp; contors.</li>
            <li>I love the color, I take away one star because it arrived broken, I had to fix it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had to put layers on for before i could finally see a difference, then it wouldn&#x27;t even last long.</li>
            <li> this eye shadow really makes my green eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Another trick that i want to mention is that I use urban decay eye primer before i apply the colors and it helps the color to stay on for long time.</li>
            <li> so i especially appreciate the little diagram instruction on the back of the tray.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth my time to send it back.</li>
            <li> I like the pink that is in this color set.</li>
            <li> only complain is when u use setting spray the eyeshadow run and rub of easy even with a base and primer</li>
            <li> These colors also work extremely well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I wish they were available separately, but the price point means that I can order the kit without feeling too bad about not using two of the colors.</li>
            <li> I wear this one every day, and it has cut down on my beauty routine in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I would recommend this to a friend hands down, any day.</li>
            <li> Black Drama 285 1</li>
            <li> but I found that the colors were a little chalky.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I was upset that the applicators were missing.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, and it has been working quite well for me over the past few months now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a totally (lazy) beauty minimalist, so I use this with:&lt;br /&gt;  -</li>
            <li> Wish it had a small mirror, though.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Received it and it was all broken up</li>
            <li> i was not impressed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the color combination and the diagram on how to apply the colors. Just beautiful as more expensive brands</li>
            <li> i use this product on myself and daughter all the time, it is a great combo of colors and goes on perfectly</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite eyeshadow combo and the one i use most often.  It matches a lot of my clothing and my skin tone.  It&#x27;s subtle and elegant.  I personally prefer colors that don&#x27;t appear to be too &amp;#34;look-at-me.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve just began to learn using makeup so i especially appreciate the little diagram instruction on the back of the tray.  Another trick that i want to mention is that I use urban decay eye primer before i apply the colors and it helps the color to stay on for long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and the product is really good, with exellent fixation. But it&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> Deppotted these from the orginal packaging and cleaned the bottoms as they are already magnetic and added them to my DIY freedom palette.  I&#x27;ve experienced some fallout with the  dark pink/mauve color, but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Received it and it was all broken up</li>
            <li> I brought this colour quad to experiment with colours for my blue eyes. It is a great all in one set to get that look. I think it&#x27;s more of a day look or natural evening look. I apply my shadow with brushes which I think makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I got this and loved it so much that I got [[ASIN:B002LFQ2TA Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Quads, Stylish Smokes, 04q Charcoal Smokes, 0.17 Ounce]]. I still like this one much better for other reasons. I wear this one every day, and it has cut down on my beauty routine in the morning. It gives just enough contrast and pop that it highlights natural features &amp; contors. I&#x27;m a totally (lazy) beauty minimalist, so I use this with:&lt;br /&gt;  - [[ASIN:B00E3OT2IA Maybelline Volum&#x27; Express The Falsies Spoon Brush Washable Mascara, Black Drama 285 1 ea]]&lt;br /&gt;  - [[ASIN:B001OAB7Z2 Murad Oil Control Mattifier SPF 15 1.7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;  - [[ASIN:B0000VLX2S ChapStick Classic Lip Balm SPF 4, Cherry, 0.15-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)]]&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would recommend this to a friend hands down, any day.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  I always have got complements when I wear these colors and it has become hard to fine.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color quad...not too bright, not too smoky, just natural enhancement for your eyes.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this. I use this everyday. It has that natural look when you put it on and it works really good with brown eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the chocolates because I thought this color palette would work best with my caramel coloring and it does. Love the fact that it instructs where to put the colors for the best effect but you can switch them up too. I am all about experimenting with what looks good but not overdone. This one does the trick for women on the go who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to put on makeup. Wish it had a small mirror, though.</li>
            <li> Pigmantions is ok the colors are beautiful some are more vibrant than others there good for the price only complain is when u use setting spray the eyeshadow run and rub of easy even with a base and primer</li>
            <li> The colors are nice. The chart was helpful in showing how to apply the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> good shades....very happy</li>
            <li> Wished I&#x27;d noticed that this is glittery shadow. Personally don&#x27;t like it. Shimmer is fine for some people, but not if your eyelids are over 40. I go for matte.</li>
            <li> i was not impressed. I had to put layers on for before i could finally see a difference, then it wouldn&#x27;t even last long.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite eye shadows.  I have used it for many years, and the quality is consistently very high.  Good colors, great lasting wear, easy and smooth application.</li>
            <li> I loved the eye shadows.  I was upset that the applicators were missing.  I had to buy some.  It was not worth my time to send it back.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....I recomend it..It is good!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for one color- the burgandy. I have owned this product before and love that color. All of them complement brown and blue eyes!! Had to contact the seller and they were speedy, and very repectful and answered all my questions. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the eye shadow the colors are nice and look good with my brown eyes.  Of course it is not as nice as something more expensive, but I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it! Came in a timely manner, good product, and good on brown skin too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime user of the Designer Chocolates colors. It&#x27;s a great combination, and handy to have them all together. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they recently changed the layout of the compact in a way that minimizes two of the colors- which happen to be the ones I use most often. I wish they were available separately, but the price point means that I can order the kit without feeling too bad about not using two of the colors.</li>
            <li> This incredibly powdery makeup doesn&#x27;t last more than a half hour if that on my face. This is without primer but I&#x27;d like there to be some lasting effect.</li>
            <li> The pigments slip around a bit after application, meaning you can&#x27;t quite get precision lines/shadows, but the product is nice and the colors are nice. More saturation of pigment would have been better, but what I can expect for $5?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a couple of years and still like it.  I like the pink that is in this color set.</li>
            <li> This quad a good mix of neutral colors but I found that the colors were a little chalky. They are great if you use them as a wash color and then use other colors to give more definition. The best color for me was the rose brown crease color.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. I normally wear MAC and Clinique Shadows but I saw it used in a YouTube tutorial and wanted to give it a chance. So far, thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the different colors are marked to show the way they should be used to create a polychromatic look. They all correspond beautifully and make the process a breeze. I like that this palette has the perfect amount of shimmer with minimal dust and fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy that the color marked \\&quot;Liner\\&quot; (the darkest shade, on the bottom) is perfect for polishing up and filling in my brown/blonde eyebrows with a MAC #266 brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast and undamaged. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a stand by in my make up drawer and is neutral for me because of my complexion. I love it. It stays on through the workday. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It looks great on. I also enjoy that it explains how to apply the make up to look your best and bring out your eyes. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the applicators are cheaply made and fall apart easily. I had to deduct for that. Overall, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the shine without all the glitter. Great colors that last all day and night. I would &amp; havd recommend!</li>
            <li> It does not have the creamy texture that I really like but it is great. The color stays for hours.</li>
            <li> I love the color, I take away one star because it arrived broken, I had to fix it</li>
            <li> This is always my go-to when it comes to eye shadow. I discovered it when I was 16 (in 2003) and I still continue to buy it today. I don&#x27;t use the colors how they say to use them though. I put #3 on most of my eye. Then I put #4 in my crease (heavier on the outer corner than inner corner). Then I use #1 on my lid just above the lashes as well as on my brow bone to highlight. Then I blend it all. Lasts all day and people are always asking me how I do my make up so well. Add some mascara and eye liner and I have a gorgeous set of dark blue eyes. These colors also work extremely well with my skin tone. I also love that it&#x27;s not expensive. I looked into Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 2 set and they want alomst $50. YEAH RIGHT!</li>
            <li> this eye shadow really makes my green eyes pop! and for the price, it does more than expected. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this particular color set (at least for me personally).  Stays on alright, I just have oily skin so I always need to reapply eye shadow anyway.</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these, both arrived damage free even though the packaging was pretty skimpy.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are light but pretty</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, and it has been working quite well for me over the past few months now.</li>
            <li> I love this Maybelline New York Expert Wear Eyeshadow Quad in Designer Chocolates. The color choices blend very nicely together, they have great staying power, and I love the way they are labelled to give you the best use of the colors. The natural look is great for daytime, and, of course, you can jazz it up a bit for a special occasion. BTW, I love to use the darkest color on my eyebrows to fill in the sparse look that makes you look so tired -- it really seems to brighten your entire expression. This is a fun set to play around with!</li>
