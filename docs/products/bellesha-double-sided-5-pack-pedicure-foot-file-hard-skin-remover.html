            <li>Perfect for the purpose.</li>
            <li>These work great!</li>
            <li>On paper that sounds perfect.  </li>
            <li>for the money is a very good deal...  </li>
            <li>These work great for the price.</li>
            <li>GREAT BUY.  </li>
            <li>The friend liked how they worked, but to quote her notes on her experience, &amp;#34;It worked great, but he handle is flimsy and bends while in use.</li>
            <li>No complaints about product and good price</li>
            <li>For the price I paid for 5 files I am  very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>; My wife and her mother however had no complaints at all and both liked the performance of the file.</li>
            <li>One nice thing about these foot files is that they are double-sided.</li>
            <li>these are really nice foot files...  </li>
            <li>files are very easy to hold with the ergonomically designed handle.</li>
            <li>They work even better if you use them in conjunction with the famous vinegar, Listerine warm water, foot soak.  </li>
            <li>needed to be a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I bought also the  Flowery Swedish Clover Foot File and it was a thousand time much better then those bellesha file.</li>
            <li>so if you want something more permanent you should head for a microplane foot file.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They come in minimalist packaging, a more eco-friendly option.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more..</li>
            <li>Adjust your expectations accordingly and you will be satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample for the purpose of doing a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>They are currently offered by Amazon at a very fair price.  </li>
            <li>Together, they do an excellent job of smoothing calluses and rough areas on the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re flexible and make it easy to get at the heel from all angles.</li>
            <li>These were just fine, although they&#x27;re cheaply made, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>feet felt smooth after using them.</li>
            <li>My wife, my mother and I have all tried these and all agree they are excellent at removing the dead skin at the bottom of our feet.  </li>
            <li>I know they look cheap, not to worry.</li>
            <li>KEEPS THE HEELS SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Luckily it rinses away easily.</li>
            <li>(For those of you who&#x27;ve seen Extreme Couponing on TLC) \\&quot;Winning!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great little product to keep your feet in tip-top shape.  </li>
            <li>These are for light use and I really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; and have size 15 feet and the file I&#x27;ve been using is holding up nicely after a couple of weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to work on your own pedicure at home or simply need these to keep your feet in shape, these are files you may wish to consider.</li>
            <li>Just as good as any other brand I have bought at a higher price.</li>
            <li>The file has a rougher side that is great for those tougher patches and fine paper on the other for regular</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>My wife has always had dry, cracked heels, so when I was offered a sample of the foot files to review, I gladly accepted.</li>
            <li>I probably will not buy again but this is certainly a functional tool to have in the shower.</li>
            <li>Each side of the file has a different texture, offering course and fine filing of your tootsies.  </li>
            <li>Very handy....or footy depending on your sense of humor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are packaged in a reusable zipper bag that is very</li>
            <li>These files have some flex to them, allowing them to gently conform to the foot.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, and seems like it will break in your hand as soon as you will start putting too much pressure  on it.</li>
            <li>I really don’t care for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my sample, two samples had peeling paper, giving the impression that these not hold up long under even light use.  </li>
            <li>As someone that didn&#x27;t normally pay attention to the softness of the bottom of my feet, I am a guy after all, I have to say I really do see a difference after using the file for a couple of minutes every time</li>
            <li>The filing material itself is more or less sandpaper that has been adhered to the plastic handle.  </li>
            <li>The handle is made of thin, highly flexible plastic, creating a edge that isn&#x27;t pleasant to hold.  </li>
            <li>One side has a finer grit than the other and the paddle itself handles a lot of force easily.  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got rough feet?  </li>
            <li>files are thin and really lightweight, the paper is secured to the file and they clean up easy with water.  </li>
            <li>side has a medium grit and the other side a fine grit.  </li>
            <li>It smooths my feet less than my feet smooth it.  </li>
            <li>It’s actually difficult to spot the difference, but easy to feel it when I run my fingers lightly across the file.</li>
            <li>At one point it bent so far that I thought it would snap in two.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how sturdy they were as I put them through their paces.  </li>
            <li>These are relatively inexpensive, work well, and are an Amazon Add-on (a real plus in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>Worth it even if each individual file only lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Work with the coarser grit to remove and exfoliate, smooth down the area with the other side, and buff with a buffer if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sandpaper is glued down very well</li>
            <li>Similar to an emery board, the grit is coarse on one side and much smoother on the other.</li>
            <li>Similar and slightly better quality items are roughly a a couple bucks, totaling less than half the cost of what BelleSha is asking.  </li>
            <li>There is a rough side to really take off that tough skin in just a few swipes, and then a fine grit side to smooth the skin and stop the cycle of callus production (if you just rough up the skin without smoothing it back down, it&#x27;s just going to develop an even larger callus in that location).</li>

            <li> My previous file is similar but offers a different grade on each side.</li>
            <li> The one thing this has over my other foot file (which has been unparalleled in my book for the last 12 years) is that these are skinny.</li>
            <li> These foot files work well to get rid of dry, itchy, unattractive skin patches.  </li>
            <li> It is white plastic with black loose sand pasted to it, that just disintigrates and flows down the drain in the shower.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to cracked heels, calluses,and rough feet&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely prefer these flexible files to the stiff wood or bamboo ones and they can be rinsed to keep them sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need to file them down?  </li>
            <li> The grit came off as soon as it came in contact with water and turned my tub black.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use these, the grit is rubbed off, turning my feet and tub black.  </li>
            <li> The handles are quite sturdy and won’t snap in half when you use them.</li>
            <li> Putting pressure on the handle which getting down to business, the handle flexes, which results in uneven filing.  </li>
            <li> Little on the flimsy side, but does the job.</li>
            <li> not worth it for me !</li>
            <li> The grit is thin, but each one should give you several uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother suffers from regular cracking and rough skin on her feet.  </li>
            <li> Quite simply the worst money ever spent.</li>
            <li> This is literally a fake product.</li>
            <li> These are the worst!</li>

            <li> These foot files work well to get rid of dry, itchy, unattractive skin patches.

I was provided a free sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> These foot files from BelleSha are made of flexible but sturdy white matte plastic. The entire length is just over 9 in. with the sanding areas measuring 5 in. x 2 in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandpaper is glued down very well so it doesn’t peel off and they can be rinsed to keep them sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side has a medium grit and the other side a fine grit.  Together, they do an excellent job of smoothing calluses and rough areas on the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely prefer these flexible files to the stiff wood or bamboo ones and they can be rinsed to keep them sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are packaged in a reusable zipper bag that is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BelleSha provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got rough feet?  Need to file them down?  The BelleSha Foot File pack is one way to remedy that.  Each side of the file has a different texture, offering course and fine filing of your tootsies.  On paper that sounds perfect.  In reality, the BelleSha offering is substandard and over priced (currently 36 dollars for the pack).  The handle is made of thin, highly flexible plastic, creating a edge that isn&#x27;t pleasant to hold.  Putting pressure on the handle which getting down to business, the handle flexes, which results in uneven filing.  The filing material itself is more or less sandpaper that has been adhered to the plastic handle.  On my sample, two samples had peeling paper, giving the impression that these not hold up long under even light use.  Looking around Amazon and local stores, the pricing for this item is way out of proportion for what you get.  Similar and slightly better quality items are roughly a a couple bucks, totaling less than half the cost of what BelleSha is asking.  No bargains here!</li>
            <li> My wife has always had dry, cracked heels, so when I was offered a sample of the foot files to review, I gladly accepted. I had a friend, my wife and my mother in-law test these out. The friend liked how they worked, but to quote her notes on her experience, &amp;#34;It worked great, but he handle is flimsy and bends while in use. At one point it bent so far that I thought it would snap in two.&amp;#34; My wife and her mother however had no complaints at all and both liked the performance of the file.</li>
            <li> My mother suffers from regular cracking and rough skin on her feet.  She uses foot files regularly and sometimes she misplaces one.  What I like about this [[ASIN:B00ENFS6IG BelleSha 5 pack Foot File Set]] is that it&#x27;s a multi-set for an afforable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are thin and really lightweight, the paper is secured to the file and they clean up easy with water.  These files have some flex to them, allowing them to gently conform to the foot. The file has a rougher side that is great for those tougher patches and fine paper on the other for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I like these... but they seem a bit flimsy.  We shall see if they end up snapping with repeated use.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, and seems like it will break in your hand as soon as you will start putting too much pressure  on it. I bought also the  Flowery Swedish Clover Foot File and it was a thousand time much better then those bellesha file. This item here seems like a one time use only item. not worth it for me ! will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife, my mother and I have all tried these and all agree they are excellent at removing the dead skin at the bottom of our feet.  I was surprised at how sturdy they were as I put them through their paces.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; and have size 15 feet and the file I&#x27;ve been using is holding up nicely after a couple of weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are basically plastic paddles with each side having a textured &amp;#34;sand paper&amp;#34; type material attached to it.  One side has a finer grit than the other and the paddle itself handles a lot of force easily.  As someone that didn&#x27;t normally pay attention to the softness of the bottom of my feet, I am a guy after all, I have to say I really do see a difference after using the file for a couple of minutes every time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great little product to keep your feet in tip-top shape.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample for the purpose of doing a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery. No complaints about product and good price</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Served their purpose.</li>
            <li> The one thing this has over my other foot file (which has been unparalleled in my book for the last 12 years) is that these are skinny. That means they are bendable and get in between and around my toes. There is a rough side to really take off that tough skin in just a few swipes, and then a fine grit side to smooth the skin and stop the cycle of callus production (if you just rough up the skin without smoothing it back down, it&#x27;s just going to develop an even larger callus in that location). I know they look cheap, not to worry. They work just as well as the OPI one and so I&#x27;m keeping my money! (For those of you who&#x27;ve seen Extreme Couponing on TLC) \\&quot;Winning!! Winning!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These were just fine, although they&#x27;re cheaply made, and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Worth it even if each individual file only lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> One nice thing about these foot files is that they are double-sided. Similar to an emery board, the grit is coarse on one side and much smoother on the other. It’s actually difficult to spot the difference, but easy to feel it when I run my fingers lightly across the file. The grit is thin, but each one should give you several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are very easy to hold with the ergonomically designed handle. Mind you, these files aren’t a thing of beauty by any means, but they do work well. Work with the coarser grit to remove and exfoliate, smooth down the area with the other side, and buff with a buffer if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Double-sided Foot file&lt;br /&gt;► Say goodbye to cracked heels, calluses,and rough feet&lt;br /&gt;► Handle: plastic&lt;br /&gt;► Length: 9.25” (23.5 cm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are disposable foot files so if you want something more permanent you should head for a microplane foot file. These are for light use and I really like them. The handles are quite sturdy and won’t snap in half when you use them. Flimsy I really don’t care for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in minimalist packaging, a more eco-friendly option. There’s a hole punched in the foot file itself for hanging. If you want to work on your own pedicure at home or simply need these to keep your feet in shape, these are files you may wish to consider. These are relatively inexpensive, work well, and are an Amazon Add-on (a real plus in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> these are really nice foot files...  for the money is a very good deal...  gave one each to the wife and kids..  will be ordering more..</li>
            <li> Only three stars because I was offered a choice of two colors and got the color I did not choose. I didn&#x27;t think of it when I was ordering, but these also don&#x27;t appear to have two grades of abrasion. Each side is the same. My previous file is similar but offers a different grade on each side. This product is not advertised as having two different grades--it might be something you consider in your buying decision. I probably will not buy again but this is certainly a functional tool to have in the shower. Adjust your expectations accordingly and you will be satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY.  KEEPS THE HEELS SMOOTH.</li>
