            <li>For the price this is a absolute steal.</li>
            <li>One of these brushes from the It website would be this much.</li>

            <li>You will also receive a standard foundation brush, it is not the big IT buffing brush you see on youtube all the time, but it is the most luxurious flat foundation paddle brush Ive ever seen!  </li>
            <li>This set is supposed to be a travel set, but these brushes are really full sized, not the stumpy little things you normally receive in travel kits.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it arrived late for Christmas, but she says it&#x27;s the best set of make-up brushes she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a CLEAR value based on the prices of individual brushes on various beauty sites.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than average size, it allows you to do precision work on the brows and lashes otherwise impossible.</li>
            <li> The powder brush is not the crazy humongous powder/buffing brush</li>

            <li> I love this set!  In particular, the eyeshadow blending brush is BOMB.  Does exactly what I need it to do.  Also, the smallest brush in the set is great for doing your eyebrows with a pomade.  Would definitely recommend and was cheaper than at Ulta!</li>
            <li> perfect price, delivery, quality! thanks</li>
            <li> Great quality, super soft and lux brushes. Only wished there was a larger powder brush included. The powder brush in this set seems small to me, but I guess it&#x27;s based on what I&#x27;m used to. Still, I&#x27;m happy with the quality,  look &amp; feel of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Great. I love this product line wanted brushes and got them at a good price. I recommend this highly. Love, love, love.</li>

            <li> Lovely and incredibly soft brushes. The handles are nicely weighted due to the fact they are made of metal, plus they have a fantastic rhinestone jewel on the ends of each brush as a really cute embellishment. You get the same IT cosmetic quality brush you would expect...SUPER soft, beyond belief! Performance and durability are stellar as always and you get a great carry case that doubles as a stand if you flip it over.

            <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift to my wife. Unfortunately it arrived late for Christmas, but she says it&#x27;s the best set of make-up brushes she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> I loved the wrapping it came in! The brushes are so soft and easy to use. I definitely recommend this to anyone starting a make-up brush collection.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for christmas.  She loves them and says they&#x27;re the only brushes she uses now.  She was excited to tell me that this brand is coming to ULTA finally.</li>
            <li> This brush set is really nice, soft, and easy for travel. The leather case is very lightweight and classy. Nice!</li>

            <li> I Love these It cosmetic brushes i got for Christmas! They are soft,durable with no shedding and really provide great application of eyeshadows,concealer and foundation. I have been using Mac brushes forever and last year got Lancome brushes for Christmas and i use Jane Iredale.  Now these. I have no complaints. They work better than MAC. Mac brushes shed and bristles end up all over my face.</li>
