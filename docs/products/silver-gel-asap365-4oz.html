            <li>but it isn&#x27;t working as good as it used to</li>

            <li>It safe me many times -- I use it on my face for acne or ingrown hairs that get infected.</li>
            <li>Silver shields helps the healing process by more than 50%</li>
            <li>Works better than triple antibiotic cream</li>
            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using both of these products for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the Silver Biotics.</li>
            <li>I even use it on the Grand children.</li>
            <li>Now, I stop using this product, and my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li>Not 100% sure what the strep is</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>That nurse and many hospitals use Medline SilvaSorb Gel</li>
            <li>so when I needed to get more</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend American biotech labs silver gel to everyone now for all things, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>NOT too pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I think the Sovereign Silver gel works much better.</li>
            <li>this seems to have magical anti-bacterial properties, and also speeds along the healing process...not sure how.  </li>
            <li>buy  more</li>
            <li>I love that it soaks in without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>so I could order more at once.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I use it on EVERYTHING, love the gel also.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>Great service and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>and it started looking better.</li>
            <li>The oil based silver gel stays on better though.</li>
            <li>Someone also wrote to put it in the fridge for a bit and then apply it-- so much more soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li>I do not need to buy zit cream any more.</li>
            <li>I use this product for many things including using it on my face nightly,cuts &amp; rashes.</li>
            <li>I find that it dries it out and creates more itching.</li>
            <li>, it has very cooling feeling (feels great) and seem to helping on the healing.  </li>
            <li>It works better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for all skin healing but especially for acne.  </li>
            <li>Let me also mention that this gel works better on toe nail fungus than the double-strength prescription anti-fungal cream I got from my podiatrists.</li>
            <li>But my opinion is that it is not any better than using peroxide and Vaseline.</li>
            <li>love love love it , takes the burn away in mins , and i would know i will burn during the winter time too</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>With the silver gel, I can just dab a bit on the affected area and it&#x27;s WAY better by morning.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for this product! :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>If you will buy it,  you will love ones too.</li>
            <li>is the better value at $16, as the 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li>But I will withhold criticism until I have used it more.  </li>
            <li>And I hope that the Silvadene&#x27;s better results aren&#x27;t just because of the added antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>We keep this in our medicine cabinet and it has so many uses.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is better now than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>I make sure I have a bottle on hand all the time.</li>
            <li>but it did not have the same excellent results this gel did.  </li>
            <li>This lady called me letting me know that she was running out of the gel and was in a panic, so I ordered more for her.  </li>
            <li>Now he keeps asking for more.  </li>
            <li>This product I have been using for 3 months now ,on a regular basis , and I find the product undeniably the best product on the market ,even replacing any prescription gel.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Until I find something that works even better, this is the product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>If anyone has a question or concern, I will gladly answer it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this gel.</li>
            <li>Use the liquid a lot but the gel is more appropriate at times.</li>
            <li>This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>She still licks but its totally safe for her to do so.</li>
            <li>Worked magic on my burns from a woodstove pie</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Look up silver sol, and it has many benefits, we concur with what we have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li>However, it did not remedy a toe fungus, which was mostly why I&#x27;d bought it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this Silver gel.</li>
            <li>better than any ointment you can find.</li>
            <li>ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Gel is a wonderful product.</li>

            <li>We plan on purchasing more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>continue to use the gel for many things.</li>
            <li>I ave ordered more tubeswhen we run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel truly was fantastic!</li>
            <li>This worked better than the prescriptions I got from Doctors.</li>

            <li>outstanding product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there werent many choices for colloidal silver skin products on anmazon, so i chose this one.</li>
            <li>I received it, and within 4 applications and 24 hours my side is about 50% better looking.</li>
            <li>Am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more again too.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This also seems to work better than anything for acne and burns  </li>
            <li>It is made in a way that it does leak out of solution and is safe.</li>
            <li>I can tell you I am a believer in silver for many skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered more</li>
            <li>the time I started using it the ulcer was getting smaller now it is gone GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li>i did like the nano 153 silver soap much better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person that uses over the counter stuff and most of them have never worked anyway.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps me healthy.  </li>
            <li>okay for bites and bruises</li>
            <li>love using Silver as home remedies...</li>
            <li>I have mostly used it on scabs from popped acne, and I have not seen any change in the length of time that it takes for them to heal.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Works on fungus to sore muscles.  </li>
            <li>I use silver gel mainly for preventing skin infections after getting cuts and it works great.</li>
            <li>the product is great and it meets my expectation, and I would highly recommend it to everyone to use .</li>
            <li>and I knew they would stop working eventually as well as the doctors becoming more reluctant to prescribe them for this reason.</li>
            <li>I am so excited!</li>
            <li>This was worth trying!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, works and it&#x27;s safe on any area we want to protect or kill bacteria.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, helps with wound healing and dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off buying a cheap brand at Walmart and gotten much better results.</li>
            <li>Amazing price and Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Ideal to be used daily with both children and adults&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after reading all the great reviews on this product, I was surprised to see its power for myself.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and it can be used for many skin issues.  </li>
            <li>In two weeks, the rashes subsided and I&#x27;m waay more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot maintain my perfect, glowing health (given the usual life stressors plus a traffic rear-ender brain injury, permanent trap-spasms and migraines, chronic virus etc.)</li>
            <li>I had developed a rash and it was to the point where the pain was so great</li>
            <li>It kills germs and heals wounds more quickly than most antibiotics I have used.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>have also used this product on other skin problems - insect bites, chemical reactions - all to great results!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other silver gels and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this many different times &amp; the pricing  offered on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Silver Gel, which arrived very quickly, and started dabbing it on the sore</li>
            <li>I also use this company&#x27;s liquid silver and was pleased to find the gel for skin at such a great price here,.</li>
            <li>The gel is soothing and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It will soak in very quickly...</li>
            <li>This item has about a two year shelf life, so be sure to check the exp date code stamped on the bottom of the tube seam to be sure you have nearly fresh product.</li>
            <li>An absolutely amazing product that does exactly what it says &amp;#34;rapid healing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Beyond the burns, it heals external yeast infections beautifully without irritation</li>
            <li>The old saying born with a silver spoon in your mouth came from the more affluent where they gave their children a silver spoon to suck on.</li>
            <li>and it heals so much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my pets cuts and abrasions, scars/healing time is so quick!  </li>
            <li>It is miraculous how quickly it is healing his skin!</li>
            <li>The site healed quickly and I&#x27;m sure this product helped enable the healing process.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to heal a huge scratch on my arm and looked on Amazon for \\&quot;healing creams\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the HUGE perspiration issues like everyone else on here...</li>
            <li>said this stuff kills all bacteria better than antibiotics and also has been used with success for viruses on felines.  </li>
            <li>therefore it does take a while for problems on your skin to heal such as in my case with acne scars, yet it gives great results.  </li>
            <li>This cream is so effective that it heals wounds fast and prevents scars.</li>
            <li>I used hydrogen peroxide, ASAP, and some Aquaphor to get rid of the scab, but there was still a light scar underneath the damage, so,</li>
            <li>Great as a facial aide.........</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with Bio Oil (available on Amazon for $15ish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a great product and so is the oral liquid by same name.</li>
            <li>Great for topical antibcaterioside.</li>
            <li>Hi, I think this is a great product...have not tried on open wound or burn but have been using on face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add that person&#x27;s testimony bellow because it could be important for someone suffering from this.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>A great and necessary product.</li>
            <li>There are not enough words to describe how GREAT this product is.</li>
            <li>So far not too good.</li>
            <li>I have been lubricating my catheters with silver gel and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>We love this product and cannot say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>been using silver gel (along with manuka cream) and this is far superior than the &amp;#34;typical triple antibiotic ointment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I put some of the gel on right before bed and by the morning it was magically halfway healed.  </li>
            <li>With it&#x27;s powerful 24 ppm SilverSol® gel formula, your skin will immediately benefit from its many unique properties.</li>

            <li>cant say that enough, LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>I also use it on acne and it works super quick!</li>
            <li>Ok first off I&#x27;ve never wrote a review for an online product.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m soooo excited I found this product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what else</li>
            <li>I was amazed that the area is now smooth and not painful at all.</li>
            <li>I have chronic lyme disease and for some reason, my skin has suffered significantly - head to all 10 toes.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I am thankful to have an ointment that is clean feeling, and non greasy to apply under my bandages.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry skin, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li>My three year old son has severe eczema and many, many allergies as well.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - helps minor skin irritations to heal up quickly, does not smell at all and disappears into your skin.</li>
            <li>The incision wouldn&#x27;t heal, got infected, and I had to have a special wound care nurse come to the house to monitor my leg and change bandages (checking for infection each time).</li>
            <li>were they right!</li>
            <li>I sprayed this in my eyes following a surgery and the doctor remarked what a good job I did in taking care of it</li>
            <li>I am also using the liquid form of this stuff on the same cats with good results.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use for two weeks straight to make sure I kill the virus.</li>
            <li>Anecdotal evidence is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It worked just as good, felt the same on the skin, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your skin is exposed to more damage than you may realize, and sadly, much of it is unavoidable.</li>

            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>

            <li>LIKELY GOOD FOR CUTS, STINGS &amp; BITES.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I really like Silver Biotic products I have used the liquid before and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>My burn healed up fast with the gel :)  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product to try for external skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to sleep very well</li>
            <li>and at that time I was also on antibiotics, so she really wasn&#x27;t sure what the cause was</li>
            <li>Such a good product.  </li>
            <li>I can say, however, that it&#x27;s certainly not bad.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, feels light and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It has gotten rid of Fungus, healed up sores quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the silver sol gel is used for so many different things.</li>
            <li>It healed them quickly.</li>

            <li>Helps to heal skin irritations and break outs quickly.</li>
            <li>Works quickly</li>
            <li>it quickly.</li>
            <li>The liquid silver solutions from this same company are also excellent for internal infections.</li>
            <li>Helped heal some sores quickly.</li>
            <li>Using the silver gel then has calmed the pain and has continued to not only keep me comfortable, but has helped the burn to heal nicely.</li>
            <li>:  When you can&#x27;t squeeze any more out, cut off the top and bottom of the tube and you&#x27;ll find a lot left.  </li>
            <li>I bought ASAP after trying so many things, within a few days most of the marks disappeared from my face :)</li>
            <li>I will always have this available in our first aid cupboard.</li>
            <li>It can be used for so very many different things from insect bites to mesa to building up your imunne system.</li>
            <li>its the best for healing scrapes, cuts, scratchs and really good for aches and bruises - have even used it on my face for chapped cheeks (I spend too much time outdoors in the cold)...</li>
            <li>The simple fact that this product works is why it is becoming a top choice in skin care worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The simple fact that this product works is why it is becoming a top choice in skin care worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, its also good for cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li>From my standpoint, I can say all the positive reviews are 100% accurate.  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to continuing this!!</li>
            <li>(Note:  you still have to clean the wound first.)</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and smooth</li>
            <li>and it healed nicely in the next three days.</li>
            <li>so I continued for two more days until it completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>We thought that is was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I gave some to my 2 year old when he had bronchaitus and it helped him get better in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this for anyone who has problem acne on their face or just wants something better to use for cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li>The next morning the burn was healing nicely,</li>
            <li>I am a Naturopath and personally used this product and found it highly effective.</li>
            <li>Useful for any skin infection or irritation that could turn into an infection.  </li>
            <li>However tends to sooth cuts and be useful for that.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften</li>
            <li>I take care of a big yard and am getting bit by some kind of bug or another and ASAP works wonders time and time again.</li>
            <li>If you read about Silver Sol..you will see how it works in three different ways and is effective on MRSA.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>The answer to the question about why I liked the product is :  I am a male 74 years old and have to manually catherize myself 3 times or more a day.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It has been the best secret in medicine.  </li>
            <li>So they weren&#x27;t fresh scars or wounds</li>
            <li>Worth my money</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the product came quickly, it&#x27;s a clear gel, spread on the skin easily and not sticky, it&#x27;s cool and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Their other Silver spray is really good for sore throats and keeps ur immune system up.</li>
            <li>it clears everything right up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always make the pimple disappear right away</li>
            <li>(she is right.</li>
            <li>Wish I had used the silver gel right away.</li>
            <li>Right away we put the silver gel on it, and after some hours, the pain subsided.  </li>
            <li>Another nice touch is the pop top cap I have lost caps in the past.</li>
            <li>and I also use it as an underarm deodorant which keeps me stink free even on 4hr long bike rides, better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face for blemishes and not only does it heal them quickly, it softens my skin and makes it look healthy</li>
            <li>Love this gel and use it especially in my cat scratches and heals quickly without infections.</li>
            <li>I started using colloidal silver liquid for some other health reasons about five months ago and really believe in the product and have had amazing results!</li>
            <li>This being said, I have used Sovereign Silver colloidal silver in the past with great results.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as it is advertised and for the price it is definitely worth buying through this seller.</li>
            <li>And of course thanks to the company for making such an outstanding product!</li>
            <li>But, it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a clear light-weight gel that goes on the skin smoothly, easily, and you do not need to \\&quot;rub\\&quot; it in.</li>
            <li>Never before have I found such a great price for the same product at 4 times the price..</li>
            <li>Also, helps clear up breakouts on face; good stuff, ordered several tubes of it.</li>
            <li>so far so good, I only been using it for a while</li>
            <li>It is very much like an antibiotic gel.</li>
            <li>Good product for wound healing, could be a little stronger.</li>
            <li>Good for little blemishes and acne spots.</li>
            <li>New generation of silver for skin care - worth researching to see for yourself what its designed to do!</li>
            <li>I took antibiotics and did hot packs four times a day and applied this get afterwards four times a day as well.</li>
            <li>works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fairy tale - it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s hormone related.)  </li>
            <li>When you first feel one of these coming, you know you need to react.  </li>
            <li>The first night he used</li>
            <li>The first day&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>My son ended up getting ringworm from wrestling and this cleared it up fast!</li>
            <li>I put this on a wound that I&#x27;ve been having problems with and in a very, very short amount of time it started showing healing, so I&#x27;m very much pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I only hope it has a bit more of  consistancy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>What I love about ASAP is that he has not brushed up against the furniture or used his paw to wipe the gel off because the gel is not irritable!</li>
            <li>I first started using silver gel when I had two surgeries on my ankle.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help hydrate and rejuvenate the skin, but more importantly, it helps to promote natural healing.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help hydrate and rejuvenate the skin, but more importantly, it helps to promote natural healing.</li>
            <li>It has sped up the healing of a cut and scratches, red blotches, and a scar that I&#x27;ve had for more than 20 year.</li>
            <li>(start taking at first sign) which it works well for.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>evidently, this price was a used product, even though offered as 4 oz.</li>
            <li>We won&#x27;t be without this in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I will never be without this stuff, and I now tell everyone I know about it because I think it&#x27;s a shame that doctors will prescribe potentially harmful medication when this could be used instead in most cases.</li>
            <li>I purchased American Biotech Labs Silver Gel for my grand daughter who is a chef at a retirement home.</li>
            <li>This product is something that should be kept in every first aid kit.</li>
            <li>First application brought her relief.</li>
            <li>This should be in every first aid kit and in every home.  </li>
            <li>After the first day I noticed the ringworm was no longer itchy or had puss coming out of it.</li>
            <li>and I had taken a teaspoon every hour for 8 hours and also put the gel on my forehead and temples ( I refrigerated it first to make it colder ).  </li>
            <li>I have used the liquid for multiple things and just LOVE the product.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the gel after the first outbreak.</li>
            <li>However, this product may work better for different types of skin.</li>
            <li>It is a permanent part of our first aid kit.</li>
            <li>When I saw this I had to order it to have on hand for our family first aid kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I regularly get bitten by mosquitoes as many as 40 times while doing yard work.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using the gel</li>
            <li>and I think I like the gel better than the liquid only because the gel doesn&#x27;t run when using it on you skin.  </li>
            <li>It said something about leaving skin soft and smooth on the official site.  </li>
            <li>I generally heal slowly, but this stuff was incredible!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this as a staple in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Most recently I treated an incision on my neck from having part of my thyroid removed.</li>
            <li>Can also be used for face and hands to kill any germs (especially after touching door handles).  </li>
            <li>A staple in my first aid/ health kits</li>
            <li>At the first sign of redness I use the soap and gel.  </li>
            <li>skin lesions, pimples, cuts, itches, mosquito bites, scratches, hot spots, teeth, ears, nostrils, bruised, nails, scalp</li>
            <li>It also protects warm, wet areas from infections and preempts irritation as well.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, my boyfriend had 8 weeks of radiation to his throat  and this stuff cleared up the burns in 2 1/2 days 6 weeks in.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it did not heal some residual effects (not scars) from cystic acne that I had many years ago.  </li>
            <li>and they said thank you so much times!</li>
            <li>but you can tell how much the care!</li>
            <li>Suggesting your own research, but we&#x27;ve found this brand, this product, to be exceptional and in our family, takes the place of all the other ointments previously used.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right on, it really works.</li>
            <li>The gel is very cooling, and it soaks right in leaving the skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This book explains all the many ways to fight bacteria and prevent infections and increase the healing process in the body and even treating certain medical disorders.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own due to the size.</li>
            <li>It is a nice soothing gel, but I did not notice it helping to heal cuts or acne spots anymore than other products.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Mineral Mountain silver solution internally and the gel for external skin issues with good results.</li>
            <li>I had a wound that tested positive for MRSA.</li>
            <li>The prices here are pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and worked really well on infected cat bites.</li>
            <li>It is my exclusive first aide ointment - it really expedites healing.</li>
            <li>No burning, just a cool soft get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my really dry skin, as well as dry lips, and I&#x27;ve been moderately happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also taken many trips to the ER for fear of infected facial lesions before, during, and after trying too many other solutions that bombed.  </li>
            <li>Heals cuts and skin abrasions and minor burns much faster and better.</li>
            <li>I nodded politely and said I would try it, because I really was thinking it sounded pretty out there with the whole \\&quot;silver\\&quot; thing.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive in the summer .</li>
            <li>I have tried putting this ointment at that juncture for 3 days thus far, and it is helping tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Having acne-prone, dry skin with rosacea, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, gone to more dermatologists than I can count.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll come back in a month for a more concrete review.</li>
            <li>Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds).</li>
            <li>It works beautifully on shingles nerve pain, takes the pain down to just a minor ache within an hour.</li>
            <li>So this was not a cure for me, but it certainly did something.</li>
            <li>It certainly can&#x27;t hurt, IMO.</li>
            <li>It has been 13 days, and the large burned area is about 80% gone, and there was never a blister.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it relieves the itching on the large whelps that my Wife gets.</li>
            <li>but dried up the sores!)We love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Using it on your complexion actually seems to reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was fine the next morning.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to cover it or do anything to preserve the remaining gel, it&#x27;ll hang out fine in the open tube until used.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Silver Biotics ASAP365 very highly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your first aid cabinet -</li>
            <li>while i was in mexico they loved it as well , a little pricey but its worth the money i will buy more as needed and with amazon fast free shipping couldn&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been over a month since I stopped, and the scar is already so much lighter than before.</li>
            <li>Haha.   </li>
            <li>Burns and blisters became pain free and the next morning I would have forgotten the burns except for the remaining blisters.  </li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>He had a prescription from the doctor that did not work very well and refills were costly.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for selling this Silver gel.</li>
            <li>I have been using this silver cream on my face for about 6 months - I still get pimples but they are so much milder than they used to be.</li>
            <li>I noticed the redness reduced a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is really healing or not.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on any skin condition</li>
            <li>but she was in so much pain and given pain meds every 4hrs; I don&#x27;t understand why a doctor would let someone suffer without trying to help.</li>
            <li>it did not work as fast as everyone else has said...</li>
            <li>Being fat with rolls it stops any chafting  really</li>
            <li>My whole family LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was really needing something for it</li>
            <li>I rub it on gently</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped with her breath and her gums</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>The gel makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It prevents infections and it really speeds up healing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a recommended product to have on hand for wound care.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well.</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying, but not so much a problem.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this and had it sent straight to her.</li>
            <li>Bee stings ASAP puts the fire out fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo much</li>
            <li>Fast forward 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless and seems very non-irritable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but It really didn&#x27;t seem to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li>This really helped my gnarly psoriasis to stop itching and swelling.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>But in all honesty this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I just receive this in the mail today (Fast Shipping)</li>
            <li>I am very blessed to have discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>and it healed that patch very rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I use this instead of antibiotic ointment - works really well on cuts and insect bites.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to heal your skin</li>
            <li>I was also counseled by an infectious disease specialist which didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>After reading about colloidal silver I decided to give this a try without much faith it would work</li>
            <li>If you ever have skin issues whether it being a rash, abrasion or a some type of skin irritation, Silver Biotics goes to work on killing bacteria instantly making it one of the finest products available on the market today.</li>
            <li>they packaged it VERY WELL</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference using this on a wound.</li>
            <li>the father of modern medicine treated his  patients with ulcers using silver.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for external use.  </li>
            <li>This saved me so from going through so much torture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used on my pets wounds and it heals them up fast.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>It also clears up pink eye, good news since school is just starting again</li>
            <li>Went back to Neosporin which REALLY WORKS !!!</li>
            <li>but it does clear my skin right up.</li>
            <li>In three days it is now about a third of its original size and growing hair on it again.  </li>
            <li>use it on rash, scars, boils and other things and it helps better than not using anything.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other product I have used</li>
            <li>I used this on some hot spots on my dog and it really helped to clear the spots up.</li>
            <li>I knew it would work for him because I had tried it and experienced the  same thing with a small breakout.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It will take a few months, at least, to be able to do a fair review.  </li>
            <li>First, I used an acid peel, which caused a lot of raised bumps/flaky skin (this is natural and is part of the exfoliating process).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and am buying 2 more for the future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to purchase it here, because where I would get it was too expensive.  </li>
            <li>During my most recent flair up, none of the antibiotics and topical creams my doctor prescribed were working for me, and I had given up until I came across this item.</li>
            <li>Also used on some older scars and grandsons disper rash</li>
            <li>It heals everything quickly, scratches, burns, itches, open wounds, anything.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend American Biotech Labs silver gel for anything on the skin from sunburn, to cuts, second degree burns, rashes, and more.</li>
            <li>Positive results within one week, 99% clear after two weeks.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended in this era when antibiotics are no longer going to be efficacious.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and I had a high fever this week</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who ever needs a gel with healing qualities.  </li>
            <li>I applied it only before bed at night and was blown away by the fact that the raised up, bulky scars were flat and smooth by Feb 22nd 2015!</li>
            <li>This Natural Antibiotic works WONDERS !!</li>
            <li>I have used this product on so many of life&#x27;s little things.</li>
            <li>This silver gel is clear much like aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>but wow I can&#x27;t believe how fast it cleared it up also put it on scars</li>
            <li>B0016SJLD2 ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Care 4 Ounces]I rarely review an item</li>
            <li>We have removed planters warts, normal warts, thrush, athletes foot (tinea) speed up healing and bone growth during dental implant, cured a diabetic ulcer, sinus infection</li>
            <li>Is this normal?  </li>
            <li>and I have found many uses for it in my everyday life.  </li>
            <li>I have the slow leak kind....</li>
            <li>I used this gel on my ankle, and also on a small scratch on the opposite ankle as a test (something that would have healed much more quickly).</li>
            <li>I applied it right away once he gave it to me and by the next day</li>
            <li>I was able to get them under control with this product &amp; ofcourse other general care.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had two incidents since buying the silver gel, but both times, no cold sore developed!  </li>
            <li>There are other silver gel products available on Amazon which don&#x27;t contain Triethanolamine.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast - no cust service needed.... but cannot attest to the product doing what it&#x27;s advertised to do - as I have not used it long enough to give accurate feedback</li>
            <li>Normally, antibiotics would clear up something like this within a week, but he was allergic to everything prescribed!</li>
            <li>Silver Biotics gel is a little more viscous and it is clear.</li>
            <li>&gt; as I stated in the other review, it is important to enlighten yourself about any product to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Every morning, I&#x27;d wash/rinse the area to remove the gel, and apply a new layer of gel.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It healed my wounds and my skin feels like new.</li>
            <li>Now my arms look like  new, and I do not have the sentsitiveness to sun, Doctor said I would.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it kills cold sores works against Mercer much better than a triple anti biotic</li>
            <li>Well, about 10 days later, my lips are healing, now the skin is just tinged pink, and getting better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told so many people about this stuff, have been meaning to write a review for a long long time.</li>
            <li>I used this on an infected bug bite and it took the infection down quickly and healed it!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and will break out from the slightest thing.</li>
            <li>I   highly recommend this product to every health conscious person.     </li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>I normally do not write reviews this quick after purchasing</li>
            <li>It cleared it up right away, just as effectively as the expensive cream from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I have not been disappointed, this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>My first pedicure in over 3 years left me with a burning itchy case of athlete&#x27;s foot; the gel arrived on Tuesday, and by Wednesday lunchtime I felt relief from the burning!</li>
            <li>The hot spots were very red and almost bleeding.</li>
            <li>First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not just stopped itching, but completely gone!</li>
            <li>I also use it on neck tags and many have gone away as well as some small moles.</li>
            <li>The first minute I applied it to my left arm the itch started to subside</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this and within the first application or two of using it, I could notice a very big improvement in my rash.  </li>
            <li>In about 4 days after using about twice a day, the wart is almost completely healed!  </li>
            <li>my back is clear !!!!</li>
            <li>After ONE application of this stuff, I had a major improvement to the bumps, redness, dryness, itching and elasticity of my skin!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks American Biotech Labs for high quality.</li>
            <li>It helps calm itching &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time on a mosquito bite last night, and by morning it had completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I gave him this gel to try and now the size of the bump has gone down to a third of what it was and continues to get better</li>
            <li>I have found that when I put it on my acne spots they go away quickly, now I put it on my whole face after I get out of the shower and moisturize when it has dried</li>
            <li>I like the product, and although I have not experienced any stellar results from using it (meaning, not any better or more effective at treating minor skin conditions than other products), I have not experienced anything adverse.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a big fan of silver and my wife loves this item due to</li>
            <li>I originally tried using colloidal silver, but it wouldn&#x27;t provide as long lasting relief as this gel.</li>
            <li>short, it did not cure my toenail fungus, but it certainly did something.</li>
            <li>Only reason not rating a 5 is because, from their site, I thought it would moisturize a little more.  </li>
            <li>You know the kind that start like a big sore, hard knot under the skin.(I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>He came over last week (still is active and drives) to tell us that he has the most frantic itches in the night and used this stuff to calm it down.</li>
            <li>This helped to clear up a rash in 1 day</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of remedies trying to clear the infection but nothing worked, i then had an idea to try this product because what the hell my ear was already infected, so i dabbed this gel on with a q-tip before i went to sleep that night and</li>
            <li>This has also helped clear up my chronic Psoriasis outbreaks, which I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li>ASAP365 is helping clear up this problem.  </li>
            <li>Any types of cuts it help clear it up faster.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and non-residue so no one will notice.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m supposed to use it a longer time to have those clear up.  </li>
            <li>but i bought it in the hopes it would help clear pimples.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a big difference in my skin, so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as TEA contacting the blood stream, I was oozing and leaking all over the place, so</li>
            <li>It replenishes a variety of nutrients and is completely natural.</li>
            <li>This is a natural antibiotic and anti viral mineral.</li>
            <li>This product is the first thing I reach for for minor injuries, cuts and bruises.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has to catheterize on a regular basis knows of the real threat of infection.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product to put a small amount on a q-tip and rub on the inside of my nose before bed for a week straight to combat the beginning of a sinus infection and so far I have not needed to go to the doctor for a full blown infection.</li>
            <li>He also used it for mosquito bite and not only it stop itches and heal fast too.</li>
            <li>I have tried it on so far.....</li>
            <li>I get canker sores rather frequently, and when I do, I put ASAP on the sore before I go to bed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far cheaper than any perscription...</li>
            <li>(old</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year on my face for adult acne problems on my forehead.  </li>

            <li>Keep out of direct sunlight.verSol Technology® solution.</li>
            <li>Keep out of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several times on scraped needs and cuts and they beal so much faster than with neosporin.</li>
            <li>Thanks American Biotech Labs</li>
            <li>A frequent user of this product.</li>
            <li>Put some on a cotton ball and gently rub in their ears (not too deep) and watch them stop scratching.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and weather beaten.</li>
            <li>We are on the tail end of the infection now, and I would say the gel is responsible for healing him twice as fast, which is a big big deal!</li>
            <li>Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 3 days and wounds would likely heal fast.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and sometimes the pimple hurts.</li>
            <li>but so far this has not worked.</li>
            <li>I have applied this Silver Gel twice so far</li>
            <li>After taking the prouduct internally it completely cleared up all nasal congestion.</li>
            <li>i started taking probiotics and caprylic acid and this has really helped my skin go back to looking like i didn&#x27;t just get in a car crash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product a week, so I can&#x27;t say too much of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with using colloidal silver, my skin cleared up considerably in three days.</li>
            <li>When my daughter was two years old she burned her hand.</li>
            <li>It enhances natural healing.</li>
            <li>I put this on and within 24 hours there was a marked difference.  </li>
            <li>I get adult acne &amp; have been dabbing this on at night.</li>
            <li>but I noticed it stops the itching since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have known about this company when I worked for a Chiropractor who had natural vitamins and food store connected to his business.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all who left helpful reviews here, I am so grateful!</li>
            <li>My Dad is a diabetic and I treated a MRSA infection my dad had on his foot and the wound healed completely.</li>
            <li>It is a remedy for nearly EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t completely healed either</li>
            <li>and I like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li>My husband was really stressed but silver actually cured it on his head</li>
            <li>I use this daily and very safe,natural.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet: My diabetic sister was suffering from ulcers on her feet that would not clear up after vigorous antibiotic use.</li>

            <li>Silver Gel everyday to give your skin the upper hand, and join the thousands of individuals who have already come to love the rejuvenating benefits of ASAP365(tm)</li>
            <li>So far I love it and will update this review in a few days to let you all know the final outcome.</li>
            <li>baby had 1 minor diaper rash, and I applied this every diaper change, rash subsided after 2 days... and the rash was never bad enough to cause discomfort to my newborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and sinks right into your skin.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my dog a few years ago, was recommended by a holistic vet for her ear tip wound that wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li>I also did not have very much of a mark left the next day after getting the burn.</li>
            <li>I found this in gel form and decided since I mainly use c s  topically, why not try the gel form?</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve made ASAP Ultimate a central part of our first aid kit for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still take her to the vet for dental work, but this has helped tremendously with previous discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few products that I always have on hand and readily recommend to everyone for a first aid gel.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly the incision healed and became much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>At a recent family gathering, someone spoke highly of the benefits of silver.  </li>
            <li>It has cleared up my skin so quickly and so effectively that you cannot even tell my skin ever looked bad.</li>
            <li>They healed really well and much faster than previous blisters.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s all dry and close, a few more days</li>
            <li>I have used it on minor skin infections, cuts, scrapes, and burns, and it really expedites healing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this fit my psoriasis, and it&#x27;s taken a few weeks, but it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>The medical personnel knew back then the antibiotic properties of pure silver.  </li>
            <li>I use this product very frequently when i have cuts or scraps, anything that is open to germs.</li>
            <li>Well... I have some major skin inflamation ALL over that never goes away no matter what I do, even with prescription meds.</li>
            <li>I will add another comment when I have a major issue requiring this gel again.</li>
            <li>However, I got a major rash around my mouth (mustache and beard area).</li>
            <li>I would be interested to know what other people use it for.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s been about two hours and the bumps are smaller in size and the itch is completely gone!</li>
            <li>I put in on my tearducts and rub it generally into my eyelashes to stop eye itching from alergies.</li>
            <li>Great skin  protective product, bug repellent, injury first aid.  </li>
            <li>Until now though, that was the only thing that would clear it up.  </li>
            <li>Try it for several weeks and you will see it completely clear up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old and every now and again I get a big pimple.</li>
            <li>If you ask a medical professional</li>
            <li>the next morning the infection was gone, COMPLETELY GONE,</li>
            <li>I skipped a night (in which almost no healing occurred) and then put it on the cut the next night, and it&#x27;s almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li>He put it on at night and the breakout was almost completely healed the next day.  </li>
            <li>Over time, the old nail gradually lifted off the nail bed - or rather, the place where the bed attached to the nail kept retreating toward the cuticle, enabling me to trim it back shorter and shorter (to a point).</li>
            <li>combination of direct topical application of TCP and 11% (I used 17%)</li>
            <li>had the boyfriend using it religiously for guys toe fungus for nearly a month.</li>
            <li>You get a lot for your money - the tube is large (compared to other scar cremes) and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve tried things that would BUST the extreme scale, from drinking borax to layering myself with pure sulphur powder.  </li>
            <li>Last month I decided to stop using it to see what would happen, since I was becoming worried as to why the other negligible mark was just as dark.</li>
            <li>and I heal up much faster than with any other med, whether rx or otc.</li>
            <li>Healed up small cuts very fast!</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin clear with only an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>It has become a necessary ingredient for daily skin care routines, as it helps naturally make the skin feel noticeably softer.</li>

            <li>Cortisone makes it better, but it also thins the skin and is addictive, and lip skin is already so thin.</li>
            <li>my forehead, some eyebrow hairs are missing and also got very VERY close to the skin</li>
            <li>A week later, the scars were barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>She used this product and raved (or should I say was gushing) about how her sores that had never completely healed before,  had healed completely.  </li>
            <li>About three weeks ago a strange rash developed on both of my arms</li>
            <li>First I tried it on some trouble spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>With consistent use, after a few days I noticed it was helping.  </li>
            <li>My hubby misplaced my first tubes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same product (same patent number too) as another product on amazon, but for MUCH less money.</li>
            <li>the whole thing just rolled off in the shower leaving behind fresh, soft, pink skin.  </li>
            <li>Will skin over &amp; dry as clear cover</li>
            <li>I orginally bought it to try and clear my acne, after i had tried every single wash, cream, retin-a, lotion, pill</li>
            <li>She told me that they began to heal not long after applying this cream regularly.</li>
            <li>The other day I had a fireball come out of my oven due to gas build up, burned the baby hair right off  </li>
            <li>I had a bad large burn (huge blisters! )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also often used with diabetics and on burns or other very sensitive wounds.</li>
            <li>Kills bad bacteria, yeast-fungi and virus without harming the \\&quot;good guys\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This gel is amazing at drying up cold sores in a fraction of the time.  </li>
            <li>And they clear up in a couple days with minimal redness and pus.</li>

            <li> Plus their prices were good also.</li>
            <li> It is so good.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> We did not get good results with either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely good for cuts and insect bites.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s always good to have in case of an emergency.  </li>
            <li> Good to have on hand to use as needed for abrasions or cuts and skin irritations.</li>
            <li> this stuff is just as good as the reviews say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve met the gentleman who founded ABL, he&#x27;s a good person.</li>
            <li> We have also used it on sunburn and skin abrasions with good results.</li>

            <li> It received good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good price on it.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder how much good it does.</li>
            <li> This is a good product although there is something else we sometimes get.</li>
            <li> On my post op appointment the surgeon asked what I had been using on the incision site as it looked so good.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t working as good as it used to</li>
            <li> It works so good that I wind up giving it to family members.</li>
            <li> Really good for stubborn wounds that don&#x27;t want to close.</li>
            <li> This gel is really good and gives benefits you would not expect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing around for QUICK healing of cuts, scrapes, burns, etc.</li>

            <li> I do not understand the &amp;#34;how&amp;#34; but since my grandmother was placing silver dollars in warm water I have used silver for sores, burns, infected cuts and colds.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is superior, even arriving on Sunday with Amazon Prime, love that.</li>
            <li> A nice gel consistency.</li>

            <li> always wear gloves when horseback riding in the summer :)</li>
            <li> excellent product for healing wounds and illnesses, human and animals</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a skeptic when it comes to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; healing products..especially when most aren&#x27;t FDA regulated.</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Of course, my immune system is better than most, so</li>
            <li> I greatly recommend for those who are not feeling very well.</li>
            <li> I use this for so many things.  </li>
            <li> My family and I use this product in many applications, from cuts and bruises to brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> The sum of my personal impression is, Glorious, Magnificent, Triumphant, and Blessed!</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Using on wounds has been a better purpose for it though.</li>
            <li> Could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my daughter who has bouts of eczema.</li>
            <li> I also feel completely safe swallowing some from a teaspoon to treat sore throats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with Silver Biotics 4oz bottle gel.</li>
            <li> There are so many benefits to using both the Silver Biotics gel and the solution.</li>
            <li> he said he could not believe how different and wonderfully soothing it felt.  </li>
            <li> I love this silver gel.  </li>
            <li> I no longer suffer with the pain this issue was causing, and it looks noticeably better, also.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> LOVE BOUGHT AGAIN</li>
            <li> It safe me many times -- I use it on my face for acne or ingrown hairs that get infected.</li>
            <li> Silver shields helps the healing process by more than 50%</li>
            <li> Works better than triple antibiotic cream</li>
            <li> Just love it</li>
            <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using both of these products for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the Silver Biotics.</li>
            <li> I even use it on the Grand children.</li>
            <li> Now, I stop using this product, and my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> Not 100% sure what the strep is</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> That nurse and many hospitals use Medline SilvaSorb Gel</li>
            <li> so when I needed to get more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend American biotech labs silver gel to everyone now for all things, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> NOT too pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I think the Sovereign Silver gel works much better.</li>
            <li> this seems to have magical anti-bacterial properties, and also speeds along the healing process...not sure how.  </li>
            <li> buy  more</li>
            <li> I love that it soaks in without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> so I could order more at once.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I use it on EVERYTHING, love the gel also.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> Great service and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> and it started looking better.</li>
            <li> The oil based silver gel stays on better though.</li>
            <li> Someone also wrote to put it in the fridge for a bit and then apply it-- so much more soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li> I do not need to buy zit cream any more.</li>
            <li> I use this product for many things including using it on my face nightly,cuts &amp; rashes.</li>
            <li> I find that it dries it out and creates more itching.</li>
            <li> , it has very cooling feeling (feels great) and seem to helping on the healing.  </li>
            <li> It works better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for all skin healing but especially for acne.  </li>
            <li> Let me also mention that this gel works better on toe nail fungus than the double-strength prescription anti-fungal cream I got from my podiatrists.</li>
            <li> But my opinion is that it is not any better than using peroxide and Vaseline.</li>
            <li> love love love it , takes the burn away in mins , and i would know i will burn during the winter time too</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> With the silver gel, I can just dab a bit on the affected area and it&#x27;s WAY better by morning.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for this product! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> If you will buy it,  you will love ones too.</li>
            <li> is the better value at $16, as the 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> But I will withhold criticism until I have used it more.  </li>
            <li> And I hope that the Silvadene&#x27;s better results aren&#x27;t just because of the added antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> We keep this in our medicine cabinet and it has so many uses.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is better now than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> I make sure I have a bottle on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> but it did not have the same excellent results this gel did.  </li>
            <li> This lady called me letting me know that she was running out of the gel and was in a panic, so I ordered more for her.  </li>
            <li> Now he keeps asking for more.  </li>
            <li> This product I have been using for 3 months now ,on a regular basis , and I find the product undeniably the best product on the market ,even replacing any prescription gel.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Until I find something that works even better, this is the product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> If anyone has a question or concern, I will gladly answer it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this gel.</li>
            <li> Use the liquid a lot but the gel is more appropriate at times.</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> She still licks but its totally safe for her to do so.</li>
            <li> Worked magic on my burns from a woodstove pie</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Look up silver sol, and it has many benefits, we concur with what we have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be reordering.  </li>
            <li> However, it did not remedy a toe fungus, which was mostly why I&#x27;d bought it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Silver gel.</li>
            <li> better than any ointment you can find.</li>
            <li> ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Gel is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is MAGIC.  </li>
            <li> and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> We plan on purchasing more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> continue to use the gel for many things.</li>
            <li> I ave ordered more tubeswhen we run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel truly was fantastic!</li>
            <li> This worked better than the prescriptions I got from Doctors.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for our medical needs and believe it or not it has been used for deodorant and it works well.  </li>
            <li> No nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> outstanding product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there werent many choices for colloidal silver skin products on anmazon, so i chose this one.</li>
            <li> I received it, and within 4 applications and 24 hours my side is about 50% better looking.</li>
            <li> Am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> i will be ordering more again too.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This also seems to work better than anything for acne and burns  </li>
            <li> It is made in a way that it does leak out of solution and is safe.</li>
            <li> I can tell you I am a believer in silver for many skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered more</li>
            <li> the time I started using it the ulcer was getting smaller now it is gone GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> i did like the nano 153 silver soap much better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person that uses over the counter stuff and most of them have never worked anyway.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps me healthy.  </li>
            <li> okay for bites and bruises</li>
            <li> love using Silver as home remedies...</li>
            <li> I have mostly used it on scabs from popped acne, and I have not seen any change in the length of time that it takes for them to heal.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Works on fungus to sore muscles.  </li>
            <li> I use silver gel mainly for preventing skin infections after getting cuts and it works great.</li>
            <li> the product is great and it meets my expectation, and I would highly recommend it to everyone to use .</li>
            <li> and I knew they would stop working eventually as well as the doctors becoming more reluctant to prescribe them for this reason.</li>
            <li> I am so excited!</li>
            <li> This was worth trying!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, works and it&#x27;s safe on any area we want to protect or kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, helps with wound healing and dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off buying a cheap brand at Walmart and gotten much better results.</li>
            <li> Amazing price and Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> Ideal to be used daily with both children and adults&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after reading all the great reviews on this product, I was surprised to see its power for myself.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and it can be used for many skin issues.  </li>
            <li> In two weeks, the rashes subsided and I&#x27;m waay more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I honestly cannot maintain my perfect, glowing health (given the usual life stressors plus a traffic rear-ender brain injury, permanent trap-spasms and migraines, chronic virus etc.)</li>
            <li> I had developed a rash and it was to the point where the pain was so great</li>
            <li> It kills germs and heals wounds more quickly than most antibiotics I have used.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> have also used this product on other skin problems - insect bites, chemical reactions - all to great results!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other silver gels and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this many different times &amp; the pricing  offered on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Silver Gel, which arrived very quickly, and started dabbing it on the sore</li>
            <li> I also use this company&#x27;s liquid silver and was pleased to find the gel for skin at such a great price here,.</li>
            <li> The gel is soothing and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It will soak in very quickly...</li>
            <li> This item has about a two year shelf life, so be sure to check the exp date code stamped on the bottom of the tube seam to be sure you have nearly fresh product.</li>
            <li> An absolutely amazing product that does exactly what it says &amp;#34;rapid healing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Beyond the burns, it heals external yeast infections beautifully without irritation</li>
            <li> The old saying born with a silver spoon in your mouth came from the more affluent where they gave their children a silver spoon to suck on.</li>
            <li> and it heals so much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my pets cuts and abrasions, scars/healing time is so quick!  </li>
            <li> It is miraculous how quickly it is healing his skin!</li>
            <li> The site healed quickly and I&#x27;m sure this product helped enable the healing process.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to heal a huge scratch on my arm and looked on Amazon for \\&quot;healing creams\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the HUGE perspiration issues like everyone else on here...</li>
            <li> said this stuff kills all bacteria better than antibiotics and also has been used with success for viruses on felines.  </li>
            <li> therefore it does take a while for problems on your skin to heal such as in my case with acne scars, yet it gives great results.  </li>
            <li> This cream is so effective that it heals wounds fast and prevents scars.</li>
            <li> I used hydrogen peroxide, ASAP, and some Aquaphor to get rid of the scab, but there was still a light scar underneath the damage, so,</li>
            <li> Great as a facial aide.........</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with Bio Oil (available on Amazon for $15ish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a great product and so is the oral liquid by same name.</li>
            <li> Great for topical antibcaterioside.</li>
            <li> Hi, I think this is a great product...have not tried on open wound or burn but have been using on face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add that person&#x27;s testimony bellow because it could be important for someone suffering from this.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> A great and necessary product.</li>
            <li> There are not enough words to describe how GREAT this product is.</li>
            <li> So far not too good.</li>
            <li> I have been lubricating my catheters with silver gel and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> We love this product and cannot say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> been using silver gel (along with manuka cream) and this is far superior than the &amp;#34;typical triple antibiotic ointment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I put some of the gel on right before bed and by the morning it was magically halfway healed.  </li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s powerful 24 ppm SilverSol® gel formula, your skin will immediately benefit from its many unique properties.</li>

            <li> Silver Gel is formulated using our unique and patented 24 PPM SilverSol Technology® solution.</li>
            <li> cant say that enough, LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I also use it on acne and it works super quick!</li>
            <li> Ok first off I&#x27;ve never wrote a review for an online product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m soooo excited I found this product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what else</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the area is now smooth and not painful at all.</li>
            <li> I have chronic lyme disease and for some reason, my skin has suffered significantly - head to all 10 toes.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I am thankful to have an ointment that is clean feeling, and non greasy to apply under my bandages.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li> My three year old son has severe eczema and many, many allergies as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - helps minor skin irritations to heal up quickly, does not smell at all and disappears into your skin.</li>
            <li> The incision wouldn&#x27;t heal, got infected, and I had to have a special wound care nurse come to the house to monitor my leg and change bandages (checking for infection each time).</li>
            <li> were they right!</li>
            <li> I sprayed this in my eyes following a surgery and the doctor remarked what a good job I did in taking care of it</li>
            <li> I am also using the liquid form of this stuff on the same cats with good results.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use for two weeks straight to make sure I kill the virus.</li>
            <li> Anecdotal evidence is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It worked just as good, felt the same on the skin, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin is exposed to more damage than you may realize, and sadly, much of it is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> Your skin is exposed to more damage than you may realize, and sadly, much of it is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> sure you have the real thing with patent number, as fakes have started to pop up.</li>
            <li> LIKELY GOOD FOR CUTS, STINGS &amp; BITES.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I really like Silver Biotic products I have used the liquid before and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> My burn healed up fast with the gel :)  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product to try for external skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to sleep very well</li>
            <li> and at that time I was also on antibiotics, so she really wasn&#x27;t sure what the cause was</li>
            <li> Such a good product.  </li>
            <li> I can say, however, that it&#x27;s certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, feels light and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It has gotten rid of Fungus, healed up sores quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the silver sol gel is used for so many different things.</li>
            <li> It healed them quickly.</li>
            <li> Heals quickly.</li>
            <li> One time I used it on a burn and the pain went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Helps to heal skin irritations and break outs quickly.</li>
            <li> Works quickly</li>
            <li> it quickly.</li>
            <li> The liquid silver solutions from this same company are also excellent for internal infections.</li>
            <li> Helped heal some sores quickly.</li>
            <li> Using the silver gel then has calmed the pain and has continued to not only keep me comfortable, but has helped the burn to heal nicely.</li>
            <li> :  When you can&#x27;t squeeze any more out, cut off the top and bottom of the tube and you&#x27;ll find a lot left.  </li>
            <li> I bought ASAP after trying so many things, within a few days most of the marks disappeared from my face :)</li>
            <li> I will always have this available in our first aid cupboard.</li>
            <li> It can be used for so very many different things from insect bites to mesa to building up your imunne system.</li>
            <li> its the best for healing scrapes, cuts, scratchs and really good for aches and bruises - have even used it on my face for chapped cheeks (I spend too much time outdoors in the cold)...</li>
            <li> The simple fact that this product works is why it is becoming a top choice in skin care worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The simple fact that this product works is why it is becoming a top choice in skin care worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, its also good for cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li> From my standpoint, I can say all the positive reviews are 100% accurate.  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to continuing this!!</li>
            <li> (Note:  you still have to clean the wound first.)</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and smooth</li>
            <li> and it healed nicely in the next three days.</li>
            <li> so I continued for two more days until it completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> We thought that is was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I gave some to my 2 year old when he had bronchaitus and it helped him get better in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this for anyone who has problem acne on their face or just wants something better to use for cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> The next morning the burn was healing nicely,</li>
            <li> I am a Naturopath and personally used this product and found it highly effective.</li>
            <li> Useful for any skin infection or irritation that could turn into an infection.  </li>
            <li> However tends to sooth cuts and be useful for that.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften</li>
            <li> I take care of a big yard and am getting bit by some kind of bug or another and ASAP works wonders time and time again.</li>
            <li> If you read about Silver Sol..you will see how it works in three different ways and is effective on MRSA.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> The answer to the question about why I liked the product is :  I am a male 74 years old and have to manually catherize myself 3 times or more a day.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It has been the best secret in medicine.  </li>
            <li> So they weren&#x27;t fresh scars or wounds</li>
            <li> Worth my money</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the product came quickly, it&#x27;s a clear gel, spread on the skin easily and not sticky, it&#x27;s cool and soothing.  </li>
            <li> Their other Silver spray is really good for sore throats and keeps ur immune system up.</li>
            <li> it clears everything right up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always make the pimple disappear right away</li>
            <li> (she is right.</li>
            <li> Wish I had used the silver gel right away.</li>
            <li> Right away we put the silver gel on it, and after some hours, the pain subsided.  </li>
            <li> Another nice touch is the pop top cap I have lost caps in the past.</li>
            <li> and I also use it as an underarm deodorant which keeps me stink free even on 4hr long bike rides, better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face for blemishes and not only does it heal them quickly, it softens my skin and makes it look healthy</li>
            <li> Love this gel and use it especially in my cat scratches and heals quickly without infections.</li>
            <li> I started using colloidal silver liquid for some other health reasons about five months ago and really believe in the product and have had amazing results!</li>
            <li> This being said, I have used Sovereign Silver colloidal silver in the past with great results.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as it is advertised and for the price it is definitely worth buying through this seller.</li>
            <li> And of course thanks to the company for making such an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> But, it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a clear light-weight gel that goes on the skin smoothly, easily, and you do not need to \\&quot;rub\\&quot; it in.</li>
            <li> Never before have I found such a great price for the same product at 4 times the price..</li>
            <li> Also, helps clear up breakouts on face; good stuff, ordered several tubes of it.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I only been using it for a while</li>
            <li> It is very much like an antibiotic gel.</li>
            <li> Good product for wound healing, could be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Good for little blemishes and acne spots.</li>
            <li> New generation of silver for skin care - worth researching to see for yourself what its designed to do!</li>
            <li> I took antibiotics and did hot packs four times a day and applied this get afterwards four times a day as well.</li>
            <li> works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fairy tale - it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s hormone related.)  </li>
            <li> When you first feel one of these coming, you know you need to react.  </li>
            <li> The first night he used</li>
            <li> The first day&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> My son ended up getting ringworm from wrestling and this cleared it up fast!</li>
            <li> I put this on a wound that I&#x27;ve been having problems with and in a very, very short amount of time it started showing healing, so I&#x27;m very much pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I only hope it has a bit more of  consistancy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> What I love about ASAP is that he has not brushed up against the furniture or used his paw to wipe the gel off because the gel is not irritable!</li>
            <li> I first started using silver gel when I had two surgeries on my ankle.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help hydrate and rejuvenate the skin, but more importantly, it helps to promote natural healing.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help hydrate and rejuvenate the skin, but more importantly, it helps to promote natural healing.</li>
            <li> It has sped up the healing of a cut and scratches, red blotches, and a scar that I&#x27;ve had for more than 20 year.</li>
            <li> (start taking at first sign) which it works well for.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> evidently, this price was a used product, even though offered as 4 oz.</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t be without this in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this stuff, and I now tell everyone I know about it because I think it&#x27;s a shame that doctors will prescribe potentially harmful medication when this could be used instead in most cases.</li>
            <li> I purchased American Biotech Labs Silver Gel for my grand daughter who is a chef at a retirement home.</li>
            <li> This product is something that should be kept in every first aid kit.</li>
            <li> First application brought her relief.</li>
            <li> This should be in every first aid kit and in every home.  </li>
            <li> After the first day I noticed the ringworm was no longer itchy or had puss coming out of it.</li>
            <li> and I had taken a teaspoon every hour for 8 hours and also put the gel on my forehead and temples ( I refrigerated it first to make it colder ).  </li>
            <li> I have used the liquid for multiple things and just LOVE the product.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the gel after the first outbreak.</li>
            <li> However, this product may work better for different types of skin.</li>
            <li> It is a permanent part of our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> When I saw this I had to order it to have on hand for our family first aid kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I regularly get bitten by mosquitoes as many as 40 times while doing yard work.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using the gel</li>
            <li> and I think I like the gel better than the liquid only because the gel doesn&#x27;t run when using it on you skin.  </li>
            <li> It said something about leaving skin soft and smooth on the official site.  </li>
            <li> I generally heal slowly, but this stuff was incredible!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this as a staple in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Most recently I treated an incision on my neck from having part of my thyroid removed.</li>
            <li> Can also be used for face and hands to kill any germs (especially after touching door handles).  </li>
            <li> A staple in my first aid/ health kits</li>
            <li> At the first sign of redness I use the soap and gel.  </li>
            <li> skin lesions, pimples, cuts, itches, mosquito bites, scratches, hot spots, teeth, ears, nostrils, bruised, nails, scalp</li>
            <li> It also protects warm, wet areas from infections and preempts irritation as well.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, my boyfriend had 8 weeks of radiation to his throat  and this stuff cleared up the burns in 2 1/2 days 6 weeks in.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it did not heal some residual effects (not scars) from cystic acne that I had many years ago.  </li>
            <li> and they said thank you so much times!</li>
            <li> but you can tell how much the care!</li>
            <li> Suggesting your own research, but we&#x27;ve found this brand, this product, to be exceptional and in our family, takes the place of all the other ointments previously used.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right on, it really works.</li>
            <li> The gel is very cooling, and it soaks right in leaving the skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This book explains all the many ways to fight bacteria and prevent infections and increase the healing process in the body and even treating certain medical disorders.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own due to the size.</li>
            <li> It is a nice soothing gel, but I did not notice it helping to heal cuts or acne spots anymore than other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mineral Mountain silver solution internally and the gel for external skin issues with good results.</li>
            <li> I had a wound that tested positive for MRSA.</li>
            <li> The prices here are pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and worked really well on infected cat bites.</li>
            <li> It is my exclusive first aide ointment - it really expedites healing.</li>
            <li> No burning, just a cool soft get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my really dry skin, as well as dry lips, and I&#x27;ve been moderately happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also taken many trips to the ER for fear of infected facial lesions before, during, and after trying too many other solutions that bombed.  </li>
            <li> Heals cuts and skin abrasions and minor burns much faster and better.</li>
            <li> I nodded politely and said I would try it, because I really was thinking it sounded pretty out there with the whole \\&quot;silver\\&quot; thing.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive in the summer .</li>
            <li> I have tried putting this ointment at that juncture for 3 days thus far, and it is helping tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Having acne-prone, dry skin with rosacea, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, gone to more dermatologists than I can count.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll come back in a month for a more concrete review.</li>
            <li> Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds).</li>
            <li> It works beautifully on shingles nerve pain, takes the pain down to just a minor ache within an hour.</li>
            <li> So this was not a cure for me, but it certainly did something.</li>
            <li> It certainly can&#x27;t hurt, IMO.</li>
            <li> It has been 13 days, and the large burned area is about 80% gone, and there was never a blister.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it relieves the itching on the large whelps that my Wife gets.</li>
            <li> but dried up the sores!)We love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Using it on your complexion actually seems to reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was fine the next morning.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to cover it or do anything to preserve the remaining gel, it&#x27;ll hang out fine in the open tube until used.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Silver Biotics ASAP365 very highly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your first aid cabinet -</li>
            <li> while i was in mexico they loved it as well , a little pricey but its worth the money i will buy more as needed and with amazon fast free shipping couldn&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been over a month since I stopped, and the scar is already so much lighter than before.</li>
            <li> Haha.   </li>
            <li> Burns and blisters became pain free and the next morning I would have forgotten the burns except for the remaining blisters.  </li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> He had a prescription from the doctor that did not work very well and refills were costly.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for selling this Silver gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this silver cream on my face for about 6 months - I still get pimples but they are so much milder than they used to be.</li>
            <li> I noticed the redness reduced a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is really healing or not.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on any skin condition</li>
            <li> but she was in so much pain and given pain meds every 4hrs; I don&#x27;t understand why a doctor would let someone suffer without trying to help.</li>
            <li> it did not work as fast as everyone else has said...</li>
            <li> Being fat with rolls it stops any chafting  really</li>
            <li> My whole family LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I was really needing something for it</li>
            <li> I rub it on gently</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped with her breath and her gums</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The gel makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It prevents infections and it really speeds up healing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a recommended product to have on hand for wound care.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying, but not so much a problem.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this and had it sent straight to her.</li>
            <li> Bee stings ASAP puts the fire out fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo much</li>
            <li> Fast forward 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless and seems very non-irritable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but It really didn&#x27;t seem to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> This really helped my gnarly psoriasis to stop itching and swelling.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> But in all honesty this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just receive this in the mail today (Fast Shipping)</li>
            <li> I am very blessed to have discovered this product.  </li>
            <li> and it healed that patch very rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I use this instead of antibiotic ointment - works really well on cuts and insect bites.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to heal your skin</li>
            <li> I was also counseled by an infectious disease specialist which didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> After reading about colloidal silver I decided to give this a try without much faith it would work</li>
            <li> If you ever have skin issues whether it being a rash, abrasion or a some type of skin irritation, Silver Biotics goes to work on killing bacteria instantly making it one of the finest products available on the market today.</li>
            <li> they packaged it VERY WELL</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference using this on a wound.</li>
            <li> the father of modern medicine treated his  patients with ulcers using silver.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for external use.  </li>
            <li> This saved me so from going through so much torture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used on my pets wounds and it heals them up fast.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> It also clears up pink eye, good news since school is just starting again</li>
            <li> Went back to Neosporin which REALLY WORKS !!!</li>
            <li> but it does clear my skin right up.</li>
            <li> In three days it is now about a third of its original size and growing hair on it again.  </li>
            <li> use it on rash, scars, boils and other things and it helps better than not using anything.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have used</li>
            <li> I used this on some hot spots on my dog and it really helped to clear the spots up.</li>
            <li> I knew it would work for him because I had tried it and experienced the  same thing with a small breakout.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It will take a few months, at least, to be able to do a fair review.  </li>
            <li> First, I used an acid peel, which caused a lot of raised bumps/flaky skin (this is natural and is part of the exfoliating process).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and am buying 2 more for the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to purchase it here, because where I would get it was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> During my most recent flair up, none of the antibiotics and topical creams my doctor prescribed were working for me, and I had given up until I came across this item.</li>
            <li> Also used on some older scars and grandsons disper rash</li>
            <li> It heals everything quickly, scratches, burns, itches, open wounds, anything.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend American Biotech Labs silver gel for anything on the skin from sunburn, to cuts, second degree burns, rashes, and more.</li>
            <li> Positive results within one week, 99% clear after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended in this era when antibiotics are no longer going to be efficacious.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and I had a high fever this week</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who ever needs a gel with healing qualities.  </li>
            <li> I applied it only before bed at night and was blown away by the fact that the raised up, bulky scars were flat and smooth by Feb 22nd 2015!</li>
            <li> This Natural Antibiotic works WONDERS !!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on so many of life&#x27;s little things.</li>
            <li> This silver gel is clear much like aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> but wow I can&#x27;t believe how fast it cleared it up also put it on scars</li>
            <li> B0016SJLD2 ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Care 4 Ounces]I rarely review an item</li>
            <li> We have removed planters warts, normal warts, thrush, athletes foot (tinea) speed up healing and bone growth during dental implant, cured a diabetic ulcer, sinus infection</li>
            <li> Is this normal?  </li>
            <li> and I have found many uses for it in my everyday life.  </li>
            <li> I have the slow leak kind....</li>
            <li> I used this gel on my ankle, and also on a small scratch on the opposite ankle as a test (something that would have healed much more quickly).</li>
            <li> I applied it right away once he gave it to me and by the next day</li>
            <li> I was able to get them under control with this product &amp; ofcourse other general care.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had two incidents since buying the silver gel, but both times, no cold sore developed!  </li>
            <li> There are other silver gel products available on Amazon which don&#x27;t contain Triethanolamine.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast - no cust service needed.... but cannot attest to the product doing what it&#x27;s advertised to do - as I have not used it long enough to give accurate feedback</li>
            <li> Normally, antibiotics would clear up something like this within a week, but he was allergic to everything prescribed!</li>
            <li> Silver Biotics gel is a little more viscous and it is clear.</li>
            <li> &gt; as I stated in the other review, it is important to enlighten yourself about any product to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Every morning, I&#x27;d wash/rinse the area to remove the gel, and apply a new layer of gel.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It healed my wounds and my skin feels like new.</li>
            <li> Now my arms look like  new, and I do not have the sentsitiveness to sun, Doctor said I would.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it kills cold sores works against Mercer much better than a triple anti biotic</li>
            <li> Well, about 10 days later, my lips are healing, now the skin is just tinged pink, and getting better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told so many people about this stuff, have been meaning to write a review for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I used this on an infected bug bite and it took the infection down quickly and healed it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and will break out from the slightest thing.</li>
            <li> I   highly recommend this product to every health conscious person.     </li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews this quick after purchasing</li>
            <li> It cleared it up right away, just as effectively as the expensive cream from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed, this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> My first pedicure in over 3 years left me with a burning itchy case of athlete&#x27;s foot; the gel arrived on Tuesday, and by Wednesday lunchtime I felt relief from the burning!</li>
            <li> The hot spots were very red and almost bleeding.</li>
            <li> First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not just stopped itching, but completely gone!</li>
            <li> I also use it on neck tags and many have gone away as well as some small moles.</li>
            <li> The first minute I applied it to my left arm the itch started to subside</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this and within the first application or two of using it, I could notice a very big improvement in my rash.  </li>
            <li> In about 4 days after using about twice a day, the wart is almost completely healed!  </li>
            <li> my back is clear !!!!</li>
            <li> After ONE application of this stuff, I had a major improvement to the bumps, redness, dryness, itching and elasticity of my skin!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks American Biotech Labs for high quality.</li>
            <li> It helps calm itching &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time on a mosquito bite last night, and by morning it had completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I gave him this gel to try and now the size of the bump has gone down to a third of what it was and continues to get better</li>
            <li> I have found that when I put it on my acne spots they go away quickly, now I put it on my whole face after I get out of the shower and moisturize when it has dried</li>
            <li> I like the product, and although I have not experienced any stellar results from using it (meaning, not any better or more effective at treating minor skin conditions than other products), I have not experienced anything adverse.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a big fan of silver and my wife loves this item due to</li>
            <li> I originally tried using colloidal silver, but it wouldn&#x27;t provide as long lasting relief as this gel.</li>
            <li> short, it did not cure my toenail fungus, but it certainly did something.</li>
            <li> Only reason not rating a 5 is because, from their site, I thought it would moisturize a little more.  </li>
            <li> You know the kind that start like a big sore, hard knot under the skin.(I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> He came over last week (still is active and drives) to tell us that he has the most frantic itches in the night and used this stuff to calm it down.</li>
            <li> This helped to clear up a rash in 1 day</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of remedies trying to clear the infection but nothing worked, i then had an idea to try this product because what the hell my ear was already infected, so i dabbed this gel on with a q-tip before i went to sleep that night and</li>
            <li> This has also helped clear up my chronic Psoriasis outbreaks, which I have struggled with for years.</li>
            <li> ASAP365 is helping clear up this problem.  </li>
            <li> Any types of cuts it help clear it up faster.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and non-residue so no one will notice.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m supposed to use it a longer time to have those clear up.  </li>
            <li> but i bought it in the hopes it would help clear pimples.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a big difference in my skin, so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as TEA contacting the blood stream, I was oozing and leaking all over the place, so</li>
            <li> It replenishes a variety of nutrients and is completely natural.</li>
            <li> This is a natural antibiotic and anti viral mineral.</li>
            <li> This product is the first thing I reach for for minor injuries, cuts and bruises.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has to catheterize on a regular basis knows of the real threat of infection.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product to put a small amount on a q-tip and rub on the inside of my nose before bed for a week straight to combat the beginning of a sinus infection and so far I have not needed to go to the doctor for a full blown infection.</li>
            <li> He also used it for mosquito bite and not only it stop itches and heal fast too.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on so far.....</li>
            <li> I get canker sores rather frequently, and when I do, I put ASAP on the sore before I go to bed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far cheaper than any perscription...</li>

            <li> Keep out of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several times on scraped needs and cuts and they beal so much faster than with neosporin.</li>
            <li> Thanks American Biotech Labs</li>
            <li> A frequent user of this product.</li>
            <li> Put some on a cotton ball and gently rub in their ears (not too deep) and watch them stop scratching.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and weather beaten.</li>
            <li> We are on the tail end of the infection now, and I would say the gel is responsible for healing him twice as fast, which is a big big deal!</li>
            <li> Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 3 days and wounds would likely heal fast.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and sometimes the pimple hurts.</li>
            <li> but so far this has not worked.</li>
            <li> I have applied this Silver Gel twice so far</li>
            <li> After taking the prouduct internally it completely cleared up all nasal congestion.</li>
            <li> i started taking probiotics and caprylic acid and this has really helped my skin go back to looking like i didn&#x27;t just get in a car crash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a week, so I can&#x27;t say too much of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with using colloidal silver, my skin cleared up considerably in three days.</li>
            <li> When my daughter was two years old she burned her hand.</li>
            <li> It enhances natural healing.</li>
            <li> I put this on and within 24 hours there was a marked difference.  </li>
            <li> I get adult acne &amp; have been dabbing this on at night.</li>
            <li> but I noticed it stops the itching since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have known about this company when I worked for a Chiropractor who had natural vitamins and food store connected to his business.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all who left helpful reviews here, I am so grateful!</li>
            <li> My Dad is a diabetic and I treated a MRSA infection my dad had on his foot and the wound healed completely.</li>
            <li> It is a remedy for nearly EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t completely healed either</li>
            <li> and I like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> My husband was really stressed but silver actually cured it on his head</li>
            <li> I use this daily and very safe,natural.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: My diabetic sister was suffering from ulcers on her feet that would not clear up after vigorous antibiotic use.</li>

            <li> Silver Gel everyday to give your skin the upper hand, and join the thousands of individuals who have already come to love the rejuvenating benefits of ASAP365(tm)</li>
            <li> So far I love it and will update this review in a few days to let you all know the final outcome.</li>
            <li> baby had 1 minor diaper rash, and I applied this every diaper change, rash subsided after 2 days... and the rash was never bad enough to cause discomfort to my newborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and sinks right into your skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my dog a few years ago, was recommended by a holistic vet for her ear tip wound that wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> I also did not have very much of a mark left the next day after getting the burn.</li>
            <li> I found this in gel form and decided since I mainly use c s  topically, why not try the gel form?</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve made ASAP Ultimate a central part of our first aid kit for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still take her to the vet for dental work, but this has helped tremendously with previous discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few products that I always have on hand and readily recommend to everyone for a first aid gel.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly the incision healed and became much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> At a recent family gathering, someone spoke highly of the benefits of silver.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin so quickly and so effectively that you cannot even tell my skin ever looked bad.</li>
            <li> They healed really well and much faster than previous blisters.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s all dry and close, a few more days</li>
            <li> I have used it on minor skin infections, cuts, scrapes, and burns, and it really expedites healing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this fit my psoriasis, and it&#x27;s taken a few weeks, but it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> The medical personnel knew back then the antibiotic properties of pure silver.  </li>
            <li> I use this product very frequently when i have cuts or scraps, anything that is open to germs.</li>
            <li> Well... I have some major skin inflamation ALL over that never goes away no matter what I do, even with prescription meds.</li>
            <li> I will add another comment when I have a major issue requiring this gel again.</li>
            <li> However, I got a major rash around my mouth (mustache and beard area).</li>
            <li> I would be interested to know what other people use it for.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s been about two hours and the bumps are smaller in size and the itch is completely gone!</li>
            <li> I put in on my tearducts and rub it generally into my eyelashes to stop eye itching from alergies.</li>
            <li> Great skin  protective product, bug repellent, injury first aid.  </li>
            <li> Until now though, that was the only thing that would clear it up.  </li>
            <li> Try it for several weeks and you will see it completely clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and every now and again I get a big pimple.</li>
            <li> If you ask a medical professional</li>
            <li> the next morning the infection was gone, COMPLETELY GONE,</li>
            <li> I skipped a night (in which almost no healing occurred) and then put it on the cut the next night, and it&#x27;s almost completely healed.  </li>
            <li> He put it on at night and the breakout was almost completely healed the next day.  </li>
            <li> Over time, the old nail gradually lifted off the nail bed - or rather, the place where the bed attached to the nail kept retreating toward the cuticle, enabling me to trim it back shorter and shorter (to a point).</li>
            <li> combination of direct topical application of TCP and 11% (I used 17%)</li>
            <li> had the boyfriend using it religiously for guys toe fungus for nearly a month.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money - the tube is large (compared to other scar cremes) and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve tried things that would BUST the extreme scale, from drinking borax to layering myself with pure sulphur powder.  </li>
            <li> Last month I decided to stop using it to see what would happen, since I was becoming worried as to why the other negligible mark was just as dark.</li>
            <li> and I heal up much faster than with any other med, whether rx or otc.</li>
            <li> Healed up small cuts very fast!</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin clear with only an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> It has become a necessary ingredient for daily skin care routines, as it helps naturally make the skin feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> It has become a necessary ingredient for daily skin care routines, as it helps naturally make the skin feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Cortisone makes it better, but it also thins the skin and is addictive, and lip skin is already so thin.</li>
            <li> my forehead, some eyebrow hairs are missing and also got very VERY close to the skin</li>
            <li> A week later, the scars were barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> She used this product and raved (or should I say was gushing) about how her sores that had never completely healed before,  had healed completely.  </li>
            <li> About three weeks ago a strange rash developed on both of my arms</li>
            <li> First I tried it on some trouble spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> With consistent use, after a few days I noticed it was helping.  </li>
            <li> My hubby misplaced my first tubes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same product (same patent number too) as another product on amazon, but for MUCH less money.</li>
            <li> the whole thing just rolled off in the shower leaving behind fresh, soft, pink skin.  </li>
            <li> Will skin over &amp; dry as clear cover</li>
            <li> I orginally bought it to try and clear my acne, after i had tried every single wash, cream, retin-a, lotion, pill</li>
            <li> She told me that they began to heal not long after applying this cream regularly.</li>
            <li> The other day I had a fireball come out of my oven due to gas build up, burned the baby hair right off  </li>
            <li> I had a bad large burn (huge blisters! )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also often used with diabetics and on burns or other very sensitive wounds.</li>
            <li> Kills bad bacteria, yeast-fungi and virus without harming the \\&quot;good guys\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This gel is amazing at drying up cold sores in a fraction of the time.  </li>
            <li> And they clear up in a couple days with minimal redness and pus.</li>
            <li> But no new nail ever started to grow in its place, and the old one never completely came off.</li>
            <li> Allowed this to dry, then spray with colloidal silver solution (I bought the gel instead) across the entire affected areas neck, armpit and tummy, allowed to dry and then plastered with Sudocreme directly over the lesions.</li>
            <li> There may not be a cure, but there is help to make your skin less dry, less scaly, less itchy - in other words, to make your skin better!  </li>
            <li> I use it ever other diaper change or so, and the in between changes I use a Natural BabyGanics</li>
            <li> I had used it only topically for healing of minor cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> I applied it 4 times a day to any active infections which would clear up in about the same amount of time as any normal non-MRSA sore and now use it twice a day in the trouble areas to keep the infections away.</li>
            <li> Just a little of this applied immediately created a barrier, and the wound healed probably 50% faster than it normally would have.</li>
            <li> This &amp; African Black soap have almost completely cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> It appears to work well with daily applications to the dry skin patches on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> If I have a blemish or anything on my skin,  it seems to heal much quicker than usual.  </li>
            <li> Only the internal antibiotics would clear up the sores but they would always return within a few weeks</li>
            <li> Please just try asap even if only for minor things</li>
            <li> Sometimes i get large stubborn bumps on my back where I can hardly reach.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering another brand in the past more expensive this is my new brand.</li>
            <li> After a day of using it, my problem doesn&#x27;t look so red and puffy anymore and it looks actually dry</li>
            <li> but once it settles into the skin someone on the dry side will definitely stilll need their moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> In addition to healing dry skin and any rashes, it tightens the skin and reduces pores on your face and makes the skin look younger.  </li>
            <li> She had suffered 2nd degree burns over her entire thumb and was in extreme pain, even after her visit to the ER.</li>
            <li> four days after I began using it, all that&#x27;s left is a tiny scab in the very center of it...</li>
            <li> It seems a little too clear for my senses to detect silver in it.  </li>
            <li> I acquired another, more painful rash, but IT WAS NOT DUE</li>
            <li> I am skeptical of unproven remedies and certainly have concerns about argyria, but I went ahead and gave it a try at a time when oral Lamisil was still under patent &amp; extremely expensive (not to mention risky in its own right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as the other gel, but my dog still runs when I open the tube, so getting it onto his wound consistently is difficult.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to get rid of them for good and &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; them (Stupid idea.</li>
            <li> Because I don’t want to waste money, I used it on my leg, hoping it will clear up my poison ivy scar.  </li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t know how the scar would heal, I just kept thinking it was taking a long time on</li>
            <li> I also like to use it as an antiseptic  for cuts and bug bites, minor burns etc.</li>
            <li> to staff infection from minor scratches.  </li>
            <li> It works well with minor cuts, lashes, and pimples.</li>
            <li> and the scar was completely gone just a few weeks after the injury.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a 3rd degree grease burn on my hand and tries using Neosporin Plus (with the numbing agent) on it</li>
            <li> I am using this product on a minor skin problem on my feet.</li>
            <li> use it for all my minor cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> MAY IMPROVE MINOR HYPER-PIGMENTATION.&lt;br</li>
            <li> those are caused by conditions within the body or external allergens, sometimes the cause is unknown.</li>
            <li> In parallel oral supplement of a betaglucan (am empty stomach) and concentrated olive leaf extract (pm with food).</li>
            <li> do not know the long term impact of nano particles.</li>
            <li> We use it for cuts, scraps, scratches, acne spots, ingrown hairs, baby rashes, on plantar warts, blisters, minor burns....</li>
            <li> I use it for yeast issues and minor cuts/burns.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my face on a couple spots, and it completely removed a couple of them in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have been having food reactions the last few months that left a row of hives down the side of my face that blistered and then never went away, my skin has always been 100% clear until this year</li>
            <li> are turning a natural pink again and swelling is going down.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin supple and moisturized like no other product, which makes the skin less prone to injury.  </li>
            <li> Most doctors and hospitals will tell you not to use a petrolatum based product on puncture wounds, surgical incisions, or areas where there is already a serious infection or threat of a serious infection.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years an am currently using it on an open and previously infected wound.</li>
            <li> I had a small cluster of what looked like keloid scars on my wrist, they&#x27;d been there since new years eve 2015.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on burns, cuts and other topical problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scar cremes, and this is the only one that has worked.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why UPS would have left the package - they delivered it with one other item so maybe they did not notice.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two -- but one was only $9.81 and the other $13.51----disappointed at the cheaper one---it was already opened and about 1/2 the ounces---</li>
            <li> it seems and lasts me a long time to use up!</li>
            <li> I initially bought this gel for an elderly lady who had chronic sores on her face due to post melanoma treatments.  </li>
            <li> Use a cocoa butter or coconut oil or various other butters for scar help.</li>
            <li> This was needed due to a severe medical condition.  </li>
            <li> For almost 3 years I have been struggling with diagnosed nasal and facial MRSA sores which can sometimes spread to other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the rave reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work the same for me as for other people.</li>
            <li> I also had a cut on my finger that was really itching and red, and was healing very slowly.  </li>
            <li> Even the worst, a huge blister on my pinkie, healed virtually scar free (still healing).</li>
            <li> When liquid forms caused intense pain to use on serious scrapes, this gel did the job without the pain.</li>
            <li> I also use it to dry out any break out</li>
            <li> well definitely update if it improves further; meantime if it is this  beneficial with external application I am seriously considering trying the internal use type.</li>
            <li> We often give it to others and it has helped clear up to name a few MRSA, Shingles, Face Breakouts, Suture infections, burns, scrapes, cuts, and even a beagle dog mauling and with absolutely no remaining scars on him.  </li>
            <li> Then at the end of the second day, it was dead and starting to heal!</li>
            <li> (I am allergic to penicillin and my antibiotic options are limited.)  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use it on regular scabs instead of acne scabs, but as of right now, I&#x27;m not really impressed.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and red and blemishes seem to heal quicker.</li>
            <li> It was infected with an antibiotic resistant staph like fungus typically seen only in hospital settings.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to dry out my skin a bit and didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am very slow to heal and have very thin skin due to sun damage on fair skin.</li>
            <li> purposely wore a tight shirt yesterday while in 90 degree weather, outside, attending a graduation and nothing!  </li>
            <li> It was still a little red looking</li>
            <li> Only need a little.</li>
            <li> I have had two major infections in my lower legs in the past year.1/2, for which I was hospitalized twice.</li>
            <li> I was concerned the skin would dry and crack as it healed due to the location, but that didn&#x27;t happen at all.</li>
            <li> Last night, I scratched my nose, and a tiny chunk of hard stuff had come out.  </li>
            <li> This is also in an amazing base, which doesn&#x27;t cause a &#x27;sting&#x27; when applied.  </li>
            <li> The mark became darker than I anticipated, and so did the small scratch on the opposite ankle, which I thought was strange.</li>
            <li> I was particularly careful with the scar, because of the size of it.    </li>
            <li> My elderly lab has a fatty tumor that kept getting bigger.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week in various trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 4 weeks on my face and it dried out and left my face skin with some blemishes and breakouts .</li>
            <li> on the days it does not work 100%, I still get MINIMAL sweat going</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as I expected.</li>
            <li> We had a few different people mention this silver gel, so we decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> She felt the burn healed faster than she had expected.</li>
            <li> It takes the sting out of any rough, reddened skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not expensive, worth a try.</li>
            <li> In a few days, there will probably be a totally healed area there.  </li>
            <li> This was approved by the Wound Care Center @</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE.</li>
            <li> It instantly, and I MEAN instantly can take pain away from a burn or fire ant bites.</li>
            <li> A small dab daily across my lower gums, which have felt infected ever since my teeth were pulled due to failing root canals, is working a minor miracle.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not certain it fixes everything.  </li>
            <li> I had fungus all over my back and chest due to candida and this has killed it all and its all fading away.</li>
            <li> It has been a month now, and I see no positive results from using it.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic, but I also itch in the night in various places and use cortisone liquid to calm the crazy itch down.  </li>
            <li> I have been through at least 10 rounds of antibiotics , used Bacitracin and Muprocin ointments, washed with Hebiclens and various germicide cleansers, tried Bensoyl Peroxide to dry up and prevent facial sores from developing, used the strongest Manuka Honey applied to sores and covered with gauze overnight as well as Manuka oil, tea tree oil and a few other things.</li>
            <li> I used this for a wart caused by an STD, which was growing in size and becoming painful.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using any other products on it, aside from body lotion.    </li>
            <li> If anyone has an question if this stuff works, it does not sure about everything else we only got this to try since the doctors wouldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> spent over $200 on all kinds of things and they never worked!....</li>
            <li> Other ingredients: Carbomer and TEA&lt;</li>
            <li> The silver protection tape over the end was missing---the UPC code is 106231091 and was shipped separately from the other tube.</li>
            <li> Product took care of a severe itch that could not be controlled with other lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> He somehow got a bacterial infection on his foot, which rapidly spread to other areas of his body.</li>
            <li> This chemical is banned in other countries because of the adverse health risk associated with its use.</li>
            <li> I take small amounts of this product internally.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the rash I received was due to</li>
            <li> Psoriasis can sometimes bleed due to scratching as can eczema</li>
            <li> Also using the collidal silver spray in all other areas to protect against reinfection.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no effects at all (and i have seen improvement in skin frm other colloidal silver creams within 5 days).</li>
            <li> only need a small amount as it comes in a sort of gel form.</li>
            <li> Extremely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It works so well that now when I take a shower, it even tries to block the water running down my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then tried dry bandaging it for two days but it just wouldn&#x27;t heal, and every time I showered it would bleed heavily.</li>
            <li> This gel was recommended by a friend when I mentioned that I had a sore behind  my ear that would not go away with all the usual skin first aid.  </li>
            <li> I tried just about everything, even pro active.</li>
            <li> To make this a quick synopsis, this product helped myself with getting rid of Chicken Pox and it aided my wife with her</li>
            <li> its hard to say what actual amount of microbial silver is in this product.</li>
            <li> The rope burn occurred in late May of 2014, and I began using the gel when I received it about a week or so later when the wound was healing.</li>
            <li> This was at least my 3rd purchase</li>
            <li> If you use it as much as I seem to, it&#x27;s definitely an expensive habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hosed down the wounds and applied ASAP every day.</li>
            <li> Please also don&#x27;t wash any TEA containing substances down the tubes because it&#x27;s carcinogenic to aquatic life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply after washing my face, it helps keep down breakouts and heal up existing.  </li>
            <li> Anything that is bacteria, virus or fungus will be attacked by the silver, autoimmune problems like dermatitis etc are also calmed down.</li>
            <li> I also applied the gel to a relatively bad burn I received while cooking, and it significantly help with both the pain and healing.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far and have noticed a dramatic difference on both within a day.  </li>
            <li> Reduce wrinkles and while they did not go away, they were less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had previous experience with ASAP Silver Biotics gel from a friend who let me use it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I wanted something that was less &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Have a slight toothache?</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law handed us a sample of this product and as a result, we&#x27;ve used it for scarring, black eyes, cuts and bruises and it works.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the packing, I found a slightly beat up looking tube with a piece of packing tape on the cap.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else can eradicate viruses, bacteria, fungi (including black mold) and even superbugs (can you say &amp;#34;MRSA?)</li>
            <li> A lot faster than my previous bites.</li>
            <li> I used half of the product on all sorts of wounds with no almost miraculous results as some reviewers state.</li>
            <li> I still half to use it every day as a preventative</li>
            <li> I used the Silver Gel on his forehead and in less than six weeks you couldn&#x27;t even tell he had the stitches.  </li>
            <li> (there would be less need for medicine if they did)</li>
            <li> She swears its the only thing that is healing her rash &amp; when i took it back she insisted it was getting worse again and begged to pay me for this product because she had shopped everywhere for it (its hard to find just anywhere).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how much faster things heal when using this!</li>
            <li> This one is a little less money.</li>
            <li> Less harsh than benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> Trust SILVER, DO NOT trust the Medical INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX people!</li>
            <li> I received a little sampler of this ASAP gel from my mother-in-law to try.</li>
            <li> And a little goes</li>
            <li> I wish the price was a little lower</li>
            <li> Not even a little.</li>
            <li> It takes just a little to get the problem solved, and then I ventured into skin tags I have on my chest.  </li>
            <li> If a blemish or bump starts to pop up, a little dab of this</li>
            <li> and I started to feel so self conscious in public because it looks so bad.</li>
            <li> The spots are no longer red or painful looking, and are nearly completely healed.</li>
            <li> and I also use it on a few scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the placebo affect with \\&quot;snake</li>
            <li> I got nailed by my kitties a few times when trying to give meds and used this on those scratch wounds.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does nothing, seen this on a televangist show and thought, would a man of G-d lie?</li>
            <li> I noticed a bit of improvement, but with continued use I have noticed improvement in some trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> my boyfriend had a massive gash on his face from a rugby game...</li>
            <li> A few applications to her leg</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on my fave a few times a day.</li>
            <li> old scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus way cheaper than prescription or expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on a few &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; on my dog.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Helps manage psoriasis...and to heal those everyday cuts/injuries that kids get.</li>
            <li> Waste of time, money, and efforts.</li>
            <li> We have been using silver gel for a few yrs and use it for a lot of uses.</li>
            <li> And so, my skin usually breaks down, I develop cuts, blisters and burns.</li>
            <li> The person on the forum used oral supplements and another creams also, but the silver gel and the salicylic acid worked for me and I was cured in less than a month!</li>
            <li> Washes off easily, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> got torn up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> but it burned pretty badly</li>
            <li> Painful burns on my finger as a result of pulling a hot stove rack.</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked....</li>
            <li> they started of like blisters and were healing into some pretty ugly scars.</li>
            <li> Skin cancer medication had made my arms look like raw meat.</li>
            <li> within 1 week, they seemed to heal with little to no problem!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with itchy arms for the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Also helped a persistent six month sore on my scalp that failed to heal despite a daily dab of soap and water.</li>
            <li> We had used the silver water in the past.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if this is doing anything for me</li>
            <li> after just a few weeks of using it 3x/week, the growth has stopped growing, is drying up and diminishing!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I looove it to the moon and back!</li>
            <li> It came promptly and is affective for small surface injuries.  </li>
            <li> I usually get after shaving.</li>
            <li> how their products are usually received?</li>
            <li> and I rely on this product year round!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a small improvement over a day or two of use on two spider bites.  </li>
            <li> Usually mosquito bites make me suffer for days.</li>
            <li> Ok, I bought this product and I was very doubtful that it would help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked as an art teacher for the past eight years.</li>
            <li> and usually I had 3 or 4 of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past, Abreva, prescription Valtrex pills and Zovirax cream...  </li>
            <li> (it actually never really worked as good as I&#x27;d hoped), so I desperately went in search of something that would relieve me of this terrible itch.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed my face with cold water and then applied several thin layers of ASAP gel over the next couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It seems to keep the secondary infections away.</li>
            <li> can slow the healing process...</li>
            <li> she was admitted ,  the doctor said if we didn&#x27;t get the infection out which was going into her blood stream she could have died, and that was after asap forced the infection outta 48 sores.</li>
            <li> where it just slowly leaks sweat all day...</li>
            <li> I applied this to the thick scab two or three times a day for about a week and one day</li>
            <li> This seemed to work well on a horse with a wound that was slow to heal.  </li>
            <li> Dried my skin out and made my condition worse.</li>
            <li> which has slowly helped \\&quot;a little\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Cold water didn&#x27;t help the pain for long</li>
            <li> Product did not speed up healing of minor abrasions or have any effect on cold sores.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I feel the tingle, I hit it with an Oragel Single Dose Cold Sore Treatment vial...</li>
            <li> I had little pimples on my legs that itched and this product healed them after prescriptions failed.</li>
            <li> and even if my hair brushed up against it it was painful.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I had an unfortunate toxic exposure to rubber.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on various scrapes, burns, cuts, painful foot conditions.</li>
            <li> I have problems with cystic acne and hate having to use antibiotics to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> A very ugly spider bit I got in the garden, took a week to heal, but was much improved within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Its hard to say what product can take the credit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> In 5 days this healed a Brown Recluse spider bite after the ER doctor prepared our daughter for a long, painful healing with the loss of tissue.  </li>
            <li> I can use every day with out negative reactions!</li>
            <li> husband just got a large severe burn on his lower chest from a leaking vegetable steam bag he was removing from the microwave....VERY painful &amp; would have blistered badly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what could have caused it to make my scar look worse.</li>
            <li> I had some horrible blisters on my fingers (or really the skin was ripped off my hands -</li>
            <li> The silver gel helped close up the nastiest part and had majorly decreased the remaining part of the incision site.</li>
            <li> I am still addicted to this and the liquid.</li>
            <li> One thing it has done is lighten a discoloration on my skin caused by some broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis - the doctors have told me that there is no cure for this irritating condition.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just due to my sensitivities to just about everything, but still I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am using it to treat an ulcer in a very bad place it is getting smaller .Hippocrates  </li>
            <li> I bet a lot of people are putting up fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I also use this instead of Neosporin on my toddler&#x27;s random cuts.</li>
            <li> I put it on a nasty scrape on my leg that was starting to swell and turn purple.</li>
            <li> After I was done taking the steriods I broke out with the worst acne of my life, on my back on my shoulders and arms..</li>
            <li> I say - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> the hospital (where my father went) for his extremely difficult to heal wounds (because of P.A.D.) below the knees.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this product I was somewhat skeptical that it would work on me</li>
            <li> My niece got a nasty burn and nothing worked long term to sooth the pain.  </li>
            <li> I was going crazy.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from cold sores since I was a kid...  </li>
            <li> It has helped to keep a rash from driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> I apply this gel for nasal congestion relief and when out shopping to prevent flu and cold viruses.  </li>
            <li> It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was a bad one</li>
            <li> and it got badly infected where it throbbed all day</li>
            <li> I sent a tube to my nephew, who has bad acne.  </li>
            <li> He tried over the counter products but his hand was looking really bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped the eczema on my hands heal - they were bleeding so badly</li>
            <li> I put the cream on the painful lump and in a day it was gone.  </li>
            <li> I mist it on my eyes and face after a shower, beside drinking it when feeling like I&#x27;m getting a bit sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so discouraged and disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, it&#x27;s a mist have in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used this on my knee replacement incision and was fairly disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> it was crazy!</li>
            <li> This crap does not work..</li>
            <li> My son had a very bad bicycle accident and had some really bad road rash on his face.  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s just IMPOSSIBLE to influence!</li>
            <li> They looked very painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a scar gel before, but after a particularly nasty rope burn around my ankle, I decided to purchase one of the top-reviewed ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Had a nasty incision post-op that just refused to heal after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty injury on my knee and applied the gell there for faster healing</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This helped to clear up a rash in 1 day and I also use it on a few scars.  When I run out I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> if i could rate this product -0..Then I would..This crap does not work..I bet a lot of people are putting up fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Good product for wound healing, could be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I had a wound that tested positive for MRSA. I took antibiotics and did hot packs four times a day and applied this get afterwards four times a day as well. I was on antibiotics for 5 days with no improvement when I started this and it healed nicely in the next three days. Its hard to say what product can take the credit! But, it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does what it promises. Heals cuts and skin abrasions and minor burns much faster and better.</li>
            <li> I used this on some hot spots on my dog and it really helped to clear the spots up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a scar gel before, but after a particularly nasty rope burn around my ankle, I decided to purchase one of the top-reviewed ones on Amazon. I used this gel on my ankle, and also on a small scratch on the opposite ankle as a test (something that would have healed much more quickly). I don&#x27;t know why I did it at the time, but I&#x27;m glad I did.    The rope burn occurred in late May of 2014, and I began using the gel when I received it about a week or so later when the wound was healing. Every morning, I&#x27;d wash/rinse the area to remove the gel, and apply a new layer of gel. Same thing every night. For about 5 months (until October 2014).    Since I didn&#x27;t know how the scar would heal, I just kept thinking it was taking a long time on it&#x27;s own due to the size. The mark became darker than I anticipated, and so did the small scratch on the opposite ankle, which I thought was strange. Anytime I&#x27;d be out in the sun where it might be exposed, I covered both areas in the highest SPF I could find. I was particularly careful with the scar, because of the size of it.    Last month I decided to stop using it to see what would happen, since I was becoming worried as to why the other negligible mark was just as dark. It&#x27;s now been over a month since I stopped, and the scar is already so much lighter than before. I haven&#x27;t been using any other products on it, aside from body lotion.    I&#x27;m so discouraged and disappointed with this product. I don&#x27;t know what could have caused it to make my scar look worse. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any scar I&#x27;ve had either, and it was 100% the use of the gel that discolored both scars. Argh!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful natural alternative. I had some horrible blisters on my fingers (or really the skin was ripped off my hands - always wear gloves when horseback riding in the summer :) and I put this gel on the band aids each day. They healed really well and much faster than previous blisters. I was concerned the skin would dry and crack as it healed due to the location, but that didn&#x27;t happen at all. I also use this instead of Neosporin on my toddler&#x27;s random cuts. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and will break out from the slightest thing. a friend told me about silver gel and I have noticed a big difference in my skin, so much so Im on my second tube</li>
            <li> I always like to keep this on hand for cuts and skin problems. It has worked wonders on my son&#x27;s diaper rash! I also like to use it as an antiseptic  for cuts and bug bites, minor burns etc.</li>
            <li> excellent product for healing wounds and illnesses, human and animals</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a skeptic when it comes to \\&quot;natural\\&quot; healing products..especially when most aren&#x27;t FDA regulated. This being said, I have used Sovereign Silver colloidal silver in the past with great results. I had used it only topically for healing of minor cuts and scrapes. I also used it nasally for allergies/stuffy nose symptoms. I found this in gel form and decided since I mainly use c s  topically, why not try the gel form? I have not been disappointed, this stuff works great! I also have auto-immune problems and meds I take can slow the healing process...when I have a cut or scrape I use this gel 2-4 Times daily and I heal up much faster than with any other med, whether rx or otc.</li>
            <li> Used on my face and neck.  Reduce wrinkles and while they did not go away, they were less noticeable.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I had fungus all over my back and chest due to candida and this has killed it all and its all fading away. I am so happy! Praise God!</li>
            <li> Again, nice to know it is on hand even though it is not needed yet. Trust SILVER, DO NOT trust the Medical INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX people!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with itchy arms for the past 12 years.  At a recent family gathering, someone spoke highly of the benefits of silver.  I purchased this product the next day.  It has been a month now, and I see no positive results from using it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product you need in your home.  In 5 days this healed a Brown Recluse spider bite after the ER doctor prepared our daughter for a long, painful healing with the loss of tissue.  We brush our teeth with this, treat everything we use to reach for different medications (with lists of side effects) on. Baby gets diaper rash, gone in hours.  Kills bad bacteria, yeast-fungi and virus without harming the \\&quot;good guys\\&quot;.  Do your research on this, it is one of the best kept secrets of the age.  This IS NOT Colloidal Silver. This product can be used in/on any part of the body including the eyes. I sprayed this in my eyes following a surgery and the doctor remarked what a good job I did in taking care of it post surgery. Once again, go to the web site of the manufactures and research this product. They also produce a liquid and in India they are CURING Malaria IN HOSPITALS in 5 days.  Amazon also carries the liquid SilverSol.  Stock up...</li>
            <li> Yeah, I was rescuing a cat. got torn up pretty bad. Ptomaine poisoning and all that. I hosed down the wounds and applied ASAP every day. A day later, the wounds were drying up. A week later, the scars were barely noticeable. Of course, my immune system is better than most, so that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as TEA contacting the blood stream, I was oozing and leaking all over the place, so I don&#x27;t think it went into my system. I saw this Chronic Toxicity and Carcinogenicity study in an Oxford Journal concerning ingestion of TEA by mice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some people with contact allergies, so they should stay away from ASAP because of the TEA. Please also don&#x27;t wash any TEA containing substances down the tubes because it&#x27;s carcinogenic to aquatic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is an excellent anti-bacterial, anti-fungal gel that surpasses any rival Rx or OTC medicine.</li>
            <li> This Natural Antibiotic works WONDERS !! I have used it, my Husband has used it and I used it on my Dog. It has gotten rid of Fungus, healed up sores quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t live without it. NOTHING has ever worked as good as this ASAP Siver. I will always buy from here. Plus their prices were good also. Great Product !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the placebo affect with \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot; products. I feel that if you believe it enough to make it work, then who cares why it works. I received a little sampler of this ASAP gel from my mother-in-law to try. I nodded politely and said I would try it, because I really was thinking it sounded pretty out there with the whole \\&quot;silver\\&quot; thing. Haha.   Well... I have some major skin inflamation ALL over that never goes away no matter what I do, even with prescription meds. Some stuff helps, but it never goes away. After ONE application of this stuff, I had a major improvement to the bumps, redness, dryness, itching and elasticity of my skin!!! This stuff is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t know what else this stuff is supposed to do, but I know it works for skin. I am so excited!</li>
            <li> This silver Gel worked wonders on my bug bites and cuts. It healed my wounds and my skin feels like new. I used it on my face to see if it would get rid of my pimples and after about  a week of putting it on (2x daily) Once i the morning and once before bed... my face is cleared!!! I ended up buying 5 tubes of this stuff.</li>
            <li> New generation of silver for skin care - worth researching to see for yourself what its designed to do!</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it can help heal my annal fissure. So far not too good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. For others and I, it has done a great deal of healing. I greatly recommend for those who are not feeling very well. It replenishes a variety of nutrients and is completely natural.</li>
            <li> The old saying born with a silver spoon in your mouth came from the more affluent where they gave their children a silver spoon to suck on. This is a natural antibiotic and anti viral mineral. This has been known for years. My doctor gave me a prescription cream anti biotic for a staff infection I got on my foot. It did control its spread, but as a diabetic it did not cure it. I used this gel covered with gauze and tape and it was healed in three days. It was still a little red looking so I continued for two more days until it completely disappeared. Later I got a staff infection in my finger nail where I had a Hang nail, that gray looking infection, I used this stuff with gauze and medical tape applied every morning after my shower and it was gone in three days.</li>
            <li> working miracles...will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Did not work on my hand dermatitis at all . Makes my skin feel itchy , so I stopped using it after a week . Will try after the summer and update if needed . My skin is super sensitive in the summer .</li>
            <li> We use this instead of neosporin now. Happy to find it. Used colloidal silver for years in the liquid form.</li>
            <li> I use this for so many things.  It is so good.  I use it in place of Neosporin at times.</li>
            <li> My family and I use this product in many applications, from cuts and bruises to brushing teeth. We have also used it on our pets when they injure themselves or become injured.</li>
            <li> Painful burns on my finger as a result of pulling a hot stove rack. Cold water didn&#x27;t help the pain for long so I remembered my ASAP. Burns and blisters became pain free and the next morning I would have forgotten the burns except for the remaining blisters.  Also helped a persistent six month sore on my scalp that failed to heal despite a daily dab of soap and water. Once again I tried ASAP and it faded to nothing in two days.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> According to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, it contains the following:    24 ppm ASAP Solution® (purified water, silver)  Carbomer  TEA (Triethanolamine)    There are other silver gel products available on Amazon which don&#x27;t contain Triethanolamine.</li>
            <li> After using this product...I understand why the \\&quot;Silver Sol\\&quot; technology in it is patented...that is how good it is! The sum of my personal impression is, Glorious, Magnificent, Triumphant, and Blessed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any benefit after using it for two weeks</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing! Can be used for so many things!</li>
            <li> Good stuff but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  Even clears up my nose acne which I&#x27;ve had since I was 12.  That&#x27;s 44 years of acne and nothing else seemed to work.  Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my really dry skin, as well as dry lips, and I&#x27;ve been moderately happy with the results. Using on wounds has been a better purpose for it though. I would purchase again solely for wound defense.</li>
            <li> This product is everything Dr. Pederson says it is. Today, when so many product information  contains mostly hype and hyperble, it is good to find one which contains words of truth. I   highly recommend this product to every health conscious person.     Skin cancer medication had made my arms look like raw meat. Redness and scabs all over.   Silver Sol applied daily, cleared it all away in just over two weeks. Now my arms look like  new, and I do not have the sentsitiveness to sun, Doctor said I would.</li>
            <li> We had used the silver water in the past. We did not get good results with either.  This type of product does not always give the same result with different people. We thought that is was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Works great on Warts.</li>
            <li> Great product my wife loves it</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve made ASAP Ultimate a central part of our first aid kit for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s been great for speeding up the healing process for burns, cuts and so much more. We&#x27;ve used ASAP Ultimate on our dogs several times, including twice when there just were not funds to pay the vet for stitches. ASAP Ultimate and vet tape left a smaller scar than the one with stitches. My son keeps a tube in his tool box and we have another with the fishing tackle. I have recommeded it to several friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fairy tale - it&#x27;s really working! Accelerated healing process and preventing infection without any chemical - just nature! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it anywhere needed. It helps calm itching &amp; dry skin. It also minimizes &amp; eliminates breakouts. I have used this many different times &amp; the pricing  offered on Amazon is great. I will by this again from Oxkom.</li>
            <li> We now use daily and not just on sores, but all over the skin on my husbands calfs.  Keeps skin supple and moisturized like no other product, which makes the skin less prone to injury.  This is the bonus.  Initially we purchased this product for its anti-bacterial  affect, as my husband has a tendency to staff infection from minor scratches.  Could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this product for about a year now. I&#x27;m always happy with it. I use it mostly for my daughter who has bouts of eczema. It really helps.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.  Product did not speed up healing of minor abrasions or have any effect on cold sores.  Went back to Neosporin which REALLY WORKS !!!</li>
            <li> This product is the first thing I reach for for minor injuries, cuts and bruises.  I also feel completely safe swallowing some from a teaspoon to treat sore throats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and every now and again I get a big pimple. You know the kind that start like a big sore, hard knot under the skin.(I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hormone related.)  When you first feel one of these coming, you know you need to react.  I was visiting my mother recently when one of these \\&quot;boils\\&quot; started manifesting on my cheek.  I asked my mother if she had anything for it (she&#x27;s a walking pharmacy.  she orders all kinds of pharmaceuticals off of tv).  She hipped me to ASAP cream.  She ordered it off of Jim Bakker&#x27;s religious program (go figure).  I&#x27;m here to tell you, I put the cream on the painful lump and in a day it was gone.  I&#x27;m on Amazon now trying to order some for myself.  It puts Benzoyl Peroxide to shame.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on a chronic open wound on my leg.  It seems to keep the secondary infections away. I am thankful to have an ointment that is clean feeling, and non greasy to apply under my bandages.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it kills cold sores works against Mercer much better than a triple anti biotic</li>
            <li> Best stuff for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as it is advertised and for the price it is definitely worth buying through this seller. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with Silver Biotics 4oz bottle gel. I&#x27;ve had previous experience with ASAP Silver Biotics gel from a friend who let me use it. This gel is definitely something I want to always keep around the house and whenever I&#x27;m on vacation. I learned about this gel not only from my friend, but from also buying the Silver Biotics Immune System Support solution. There are so many benefits to using both the Silver Biotics gel and the solution. One thing I would recommend getting along with these products is a book called: &amp;#34;A Fighting Chance&amp;#34; - Third Edition by Dr. Gordon Pedersen. How to Win the War Against Virus and Bacteria with Silver. This book explains all the many ways to fight bacteria and prevent infections and increase the healing process in the body and even treating certain medical disorders. It&#x27;s truly an amazing book and you will be astonished by what is contained and the possibilities of Silver.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel for my husband because he had bumps on his back that itched.  He had a prescription from the doctor that did not work very well and refills were costly.  The first night he used ASAP365 he said he could not believe how different and wonderfully soothing it felt.  I have not seen him use the backscratcher and he puts it on his foot(he only has one)and on his amputation site, and he remarked how the pain went away in the foot. It is non greasy and sinks right into your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the silver sol gel is used for so many different things. I use it to brush my dogs teeth and the vet asked me every time I take them in what I use on their teeth as they have the best looking teeth of any dogs he&#x27;s seen. It speaks for itself..</li>
            <li> I bought this based on Amazon review&#x27;s that I read.  The reviews were right on, it really works. It will heal a bump or cut, or insect bite on your skin, overnight. Sometimes i get large stubborn bumps on my back where I can hardly reach. They don&#x27;t go away, one I had cut out with surgery. This cream will heal them. A very ugly spider bit I got in the garden, took a week to heal, but was much improved within an hour or two. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this silver gel.  I just had surgery in October and used this on the incisions.  It healed them quickly.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0016SJLD2 ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Care 4 Ounces]I rarely review an item but this one needs to be told to the world.  After a lot of research on the internet I decided to try it on several things including myself and my pets.  My elderly lab has a fatty tumor that kept getting bigger.  In three days it is now about a third of its original size and growing hair on it again.  My cats had an eye infection that was not healing with meds prescribed by my vet so I tried this, again immediate results.  I am now trying on my own skin issues.  I got nailed by my kitties a few times when trying to give meds and used this on those scratch wounds.  Again immediate results.  I am also using the liquid form of this stuff on the same cats with good results.  Last night I felt a sore throat coming on so had a sip myself, it immediately went away.  Studies I looked up said this stuff kills all bacteria better than antibiotics and also has been used with success for viruses on felines.  I asked God for a miracle and found this!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does nothing, seen this on a televangist show and thought, would a man of G-d lie?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week in various trouble spots.  First I tried it on some trouble spots on my face.  With consistent use, after a few days I noticed it was helping.  The first day&#x27;s use I noticed a bit of improvement, but with continued use I have noticed improvement in some trouble spots.  I have had a white spot deep under the skin on my nose for a year or so.  Nothing I have used has helped. Last night, I scratched my nose, and a tiny chunk of hard stuff had come out.  Under one of my breasts it has felt like my skin was tearing there and it hurt allot.  I have tried putting this ointment at that juncture for 3 days thus far, and it is helping tremendously.  I no longer suffer with the pain this issue was causing, and it looks noticeably better, also.  I would recommend this product.  However, I will say that from my experience not everyone&#x27;s bodies respond the same to products as another person.  I am in the process of doing some detoxing, which I feel is the source of my skin problems.  I feel this product is helping me, and I hope you find your experience with this product to be as pleasant &amp; beneficial as I have.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this gel quickens womb healing times.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  It&#x27;s the only one that has helped with my fungal infection!  Thank you so much for selling this Silver gel.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast - no cust service needed.... but cannot attest to the product doing what it&#x27;s advertised to do - as I have not used it long enough to give accurate feedback</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne as long as I can remember. I use some face washes, etc to keep my face from getting too oily but I&#x27;ve never found a product that helps with breakouts &amp; prevention until now. I have been using this silver cream on my face for about 6 months - I still get pimples but they are so much milder than they used to be. And they clear up in a couple days with minimal redness and pus. I don&#x27;t know what is in this cream that works so well but I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and am buying 2 more for the future</li>
            <li> this is excellent healing gel</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hands.....I would have been better off buying a cheap brand at Walmart and gotten much better results. Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> My son ended up getting ringworm from wrestling and this cleared it up fast! no medication needed.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering another brand in the past more expensive this is my new brand. This stuff is great for quickly healing wounds. Another nice touch is the pop top cap I have lost caps in the past.</li>
            <li> I put this on a wound that I&#x27;ve been having problems with and in a very, very short amount of time it started showing healing, so I&#x27;m very much pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I have been having food reactions the last few months that left a row of hives down the side of my face that blistered and then never went away, my skin has always been 100% clear until this year and I am 31.   I bought ASAP after trying so many things, within a few days most of the marks disappeared from my face :)</li>
            <li> I have used one tube and am just starting my second.  It seems to help.  I have several ulcers on scar tissue.  I have treated these for several years and this product seems to help.</li>
            <li> A doctor recommended this gel to me for my severe acne problem around my cheeks.  I applied it right away once he gave it to me and by the next day I noticed the redness reduced a whole lot.  This was about three years ago and I still use it on my face.  It&#x27;s a healing gel therefore it does take a while for problems on your skin to heal such as in my case with acne scars, yet it gives great results.  It&#x27;s extremely good for cuts and insect bites.  I would definitely recommend this, I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years and I love it, it&#x27;s always good to have in case of an emergency.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to purchase it here, because where I would get it was too expensive.  The prices here are pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> LOVE BOUGHT AGAIN LIKE $18.00 @  But its a great gel and I use it for everything like Alo- Great for cosmetic around the eyes and lips and neck and after shaving your legs. Also summer feet like on the bottom to prevent fungus if you&#x27;re in the pool a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product, I recommend it 100%. It safe me many times -- I use it on my face for acne or ingrown hairs that get infected. Silver shields helps the healing process by more than 50%</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry skin, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li> It works well with minor cuts, lashes, and pimples. Not sticky at all and does not stain fabric at all as well. I only hope it has a bit more of  consistancy becuase it is somewhat too watery.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase this.  Good to have on hand to use as needed for abrasions or cuts and skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: My diabetic sister was suffering from ulcers on her feet that would not clear up after vigorous antibiotic use. She told me that they began to heal not long after applying this cream regularly. I&#x27;ve read case studies on silver and think this may go well with bandages that also include silver-- definitely something to look into for those struck by ulcers like my sister. But try to avoid taking silver supplements- real potential to overdose when taken in that manner, I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has to catheterize on a regular basis knows of the real threat of infection.  I have been lubricating my catheters with silver gel and so far, so good.  It makes perfect sense that it would work.  Anyone else using this gel for this purpose?  I would like to hear about your experience.&lt;br /&gt;Perry&lt;br /&gt;pambrose@sbcglobal.net</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on burns, cuts and other topical problems.  You can&#x27;t beat silver for stopping infections and healing.  I had quite a hurtful burn on my arm and used only silver gel.  It healed without a scar.  I always keep some handy.</li>
            <li> My first pedicure in over 3 years left me with a burning itchy case of athlete&#x27;s foot; the gel arrived on Tuesday, and by Wednesday lunchtime I felt relief from the burning! It is now Thursday and all itch/burning sensation is gone, although the cracked skin and bumps are still visible. The gel is very cooling, and it soaks right in leaving the skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I well definitely update if it improves further; meantime if it is this  beneficial with external application I am seriously considering trying the internal use type.</li>
            <li> This cream is so effective that it heals wounds fast and prevents scars. Works better than triple antibiotic cream and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to put a small amount on a q-tip and rub on the inside of my nose before bed for a week straight to combat the beginning of a sinus infection and so far I have not needed to go to the doctor for a full blown infection. I will continue to use for two weeks straight to make sure I kill the virus.</li>
            <li> this stuff is just as good as the reviews say.  We use it for pimples, cuts. My daughter burned her finger, I had her apply it to the blister. It instantly took the pain away, and the blister shriveled up almost before our eyes. amazing</li>
            <li> Recommended by Doctor-Great product.  Healing powers on open wounds excellant.  Gladd I was told about thisl product.  Just love it</li>
            <li> I use this on all scraps and cuts. It is the best product for healing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a thing</li>
            <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using both of these products for about 5 years now. I mostly use the Silver Biotics. I mist it on my eyes and face after a shower, beside drinking it when feeling like I&#x27;m getting a bit sick. ASAP is great for skin healing, blimishes and yeast infection, thats right yeast infection. I don&#x27;t get them that often, but when I do, I insert the gel with a syringe (yes, without the needle, hello). It works way faster than those medication tubes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is really healing or not.  Will keep using.</li>
            <li> Our family uses this for all sorts of ailments. It replaces triple antibiotic, antihistamine cream, eye serum, you name it! It&#x27;s anti-everything. I&#x27;ve met the gentleman who founded ABL, he&#x27;s a good person.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Silver to help heal my burned skin. (Burned from skin allergies to makeup) It really works. It is calming and soothing, and helped to take away the dryness. I wear it before I put on moisturizer every day. It seems to serve as a barrier between drying agents and my skin!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Having acne-prone, dry skin with rosacea, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, gone to more dermatologists than I can count. During my most recent flair up, none of the antibiotics and topical creams my doctor prescribed were working for me, and I had given up until I came across this item. Reading the reviews, I decided to give it a chance, and I&#x27;m so happy I did! It has cleared up my skin so quickly and so effectively that you cannot even tell my skin ever looked bad. I will always have this product handy, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like the product, and although I have not experienced any stellar results from using it (meaning, not any better or more effective at treating minor skin conditions than other products), I have not experienced anything adverse. I think the manufacturer should place more information on the label in terms of best uses and recommended amounts to apply.</li>
            <li> Referred by my sister, my son used it for his acne and it reduces his acne by 50% after 1 week of used. He also used it for mosquito bite and not only it stop itches and heal fast too.</li>
            <li> We use this product ALL the time.  It even works on acne!  I even use it on the Grand children.</li>
            <li> It will take a few months, at least, to be able to do a fair review.  I will come back and update this review  when I can.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Worked really well on any skin condition I have tried it on so far.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I have used this product on so many of life&#x27;s little things. It is great for scratches and scrapes. My mom uses it on her leg, she has leg ulcers. This is a product that no home should be without. We keep one tube for each person in our home to use and always have a extra one in the house. We love this product and cannot say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on everything. I get canker sores rather frequently, and when I do, I put ASAP on the sore before I go to bed and when I wake up the sore is gone....completely disappears!!!! I have stretch marks and I have used SEVERAL scar healing products... but nothing works on stretch marks like ASAP does. I am not claiming that ASAP has made my stretch marks go away, because that takes a miracle drug, but ASAP has caused my stretch marks to not be 3-D (my stretch marks and my skin are at an even surface now) and this gel has significantly reduced the inconsistency in my skin-to-scar tone. ASAP works wonders on making scars fade away...my boyfriend had a massive gash on his face from a rugby game...I used hydrogen peroxide, ASAP, and some Aquaphor to get rid of the scab, but there was still a light scar underneath the damage, so, I continued to put ASAP and Bio Oil on the scar and the scar was completely gone just a few weeks after the injury.&lt;br /&gt;I even used ASAP on my... my cat has a wound on his ear (from a cat fight, or maybe a thorn bush) and I got a q-tip, put vinegar on it to disinfect the wound, then I put ASAP on his wound. What I love about ASAP is that he has not brushed up against the furniture or used his paw to wipe the gel off because the gel is not irritable!</li>
            <li> I have used it for 4 weeks on my face and it dried out and left my face skin with some blemishes and breakouts . Because I don’t want to waste money, I used it on my leg, hoping it will clear up my poison ivy scar.  It made my skin itchy and when I scratch it, it bleeds. Now, I stop using this product, and my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> After doing reseach and doctors tell us there was no cure for her strep( on bottom) I found asap, within a week all her sores started draining, with all the infection draining she was admitted ,  the doctor said if we didn&#x27;t get the infection out which was going into her blood stream she could have died, and that was after asap forced the infection outta 48 sores. If anyone has an question if this stuff works, it does not sure about everything else we only got this to try since the doctors wouldn&#x27;t help.Not 100% sure what the strep is but she was in so much pain and given pain meds every 4hrs; I don&#x27;t understand why a doctor would let someone suffer without trying to help. Please just try asap even if only for minor things but my opion is I&#x27;m a believer ; has done what doctors would not do to....... help. Thank you asap</li>
            <li> Amazing healing properties.</li>
            <li> I have never tried or even read on the \\&quot;silver\\&quot; products. I was looking for something to heal a huge scratch on my arm and looked on Amazon for \\&quot;healing creams\\&quot;. This cream had great reviews, so I tried it. It has not only healed my arm in record time, but cleared up my facial blemishes! What a bonus! I am so happy to have tried this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for skin issues. Heals quickly.</li>
            <li> What else can you say, this cream seems to work well for various skin issues. Not to get too personal but if your having issue give this a try. It&#x27;s far cheaper than any perscription...</li>
            <li> a very good product, works as advertised</li>
            <li> So as a guy who works out 5 days a week, sometimes you want to wear a fitted shirt and show off your goods....well I cannot do that....I don&#x27;t have the HUGE perspiration issues like everyone else on here...I have the slow leak kind....where it just slowly leaks sweat all day...and I cannot lift my arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything under the sun....medicated ones....from a dermatologist....stuff I saw on TV....etc.....spent over $200 on all kinds of things and they never worked!....I was at the point of having that surgery to remove my sweat-glands in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 1 week ago....it did not work as fast as everyone else has said...simply because my body fights off anything I give it....so it took about 4-5 days in a row of using this at night and it does finally work! It works so well that now when I take a shower, it even tries to block the water running down my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cannot use this 2-3 times a week...I use it every-night...roll it on like I would a regular deodorant and then use a regular deodorant in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely wore a tight shirt yesterday while in 90 degree weather, outside, attending a graduation and nothing!  No sweat at all....I was pretty shocked....I sat in my chair and kept cheking....(old habits never die)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on the days it does not work 100%, I still get MINIMAL sweat going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year on my face for adult acne problems on my forehead.  It has kept my skin clear with only an occasional breakout. We have also used it on sunburn and skin abrasions with good results. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if this is doing anything for me but it feels great on my skin. I put it on in the morning after my shower. Makes the skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I keep having to reorder this product because others in my family keep &#x27;stealing&#x27; it. I&#x27;m happy to let the scientific community argue about how it works or doesn&#x27;t work. Anecdotal evidence is good enough for me. I recently used it to dress a deep razor blade cut to my finger. It was a bad one and I planned on keeping it bandaged for about a week. By the third day it was healed enough to stop bandaging it. In fact, whatever I use it for seems to heal 2-3 times faster than without and never is there an infection.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found for skin problems.</li>
            <li> I use silver gel mainly for preventing skin infections after getting cuts and it works great. One time I used it on a burn and the pain went away quickly. I also did not have very much of a mark left the next day after getting the burn. I highly recommend American Biotech Labs silver gel for anything on the skin from sunburn, to cuts, second degree burns, rashes, and more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended in this era when antibiotics are no longer going to be efficacious. Have not used yet but it&#x27;s in my medicine chest.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to protect skin from surface bacteria. Using it on your complexion actually seems to reduce fine lines. Along with moisturizer, it helps baby boomer aging skin to fight those wrinkles and keep skin looking younger.</li>
            <li> Great product and works well for my skin rash problem in combination with silver soap.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! Good for little blemishes and acne spots. Loved the product, use it on scratches and cuts too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  This is also in an amazing base, which doesn&#x27;t cause a &#x27;sting&#x27; when applied.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Great skin  protective product, bug repellent, injury first aid.  You name it!</li>
            <li> Being fat with rolls it stops any chafting  really..it is great for skin irritation or razor burn...and at a great price</li>
            <li> I first started using silver gel when I had two surgeries on my ankle. The incision wouldn&#x27;t heal, got infected, and I had to have a special wound care nurse come to the house to monitor my leg and change bandages (checking for infection each time). That nurse and many hospitals use Medline SilvaSorb Gel but I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the extra money so when I needed to get more I purchased ASAP365 from American Biotech Labs. It worked just as good, felt the same on the skin, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear light-weight gel that goes on the skin smoothly, easily, and you do not need to \\&quot;rub\\&quot; it in. It does not hurt or sting. It&#x27;s actually cooling. Put it in the fridge and it&#x27;s great on sunburn. And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of gel is perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to (or should not) use a petrolatum based product (petrolatum ointment is like Vaseline). Most doctors and hospitals will tell you not to use a petrolatum based product on puncture wounds, surgical incisions, or areas where there is already a serious infection or threat of a serious infection. It&#x27;s also often used with diabetics and on burns or other very sensitive wounds. If you ask a medical professional I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll say this product is just as good as Medline SilvaSorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is information from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.

            <li> My whole family LOVES this stuff. It&#x27;s the best thing around for QUICK healing of cuts, scrapes, burns, etc. It has a great antibiotic quality and in gel form it&#x27;s soothing too. I sometimes hear my kids recommending it to the friends, because they know it works.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  But I&#x27;m not certain it fixes everything.  I think cotton dipped in Silver Biotics liquid may be more effective for the damp and fungus places on your body.  I am presently testing Silver Biotics ASAP365 on my neck where pimples do not seem to be affected by the product.  So I&#x27;d give it a 4 out of 5 rating.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Helps with my hubby&#x27;s eczema. Put it on cuts and burns. It&#x27;s exactly the same product (same patent number too) as another product on amazon, but for MUCH less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scar cremes, and this is the only one that has worked.  You get a lot for your money - the tube is large (compared to other scar cremes) and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My mom turned me onto this stuff and I have to say it is the best product out there for skin healing. It instantly, and I MEAN instantly can take pain away from a burn or fire ant bites. I put some on a tiny molelike bump on my face 2 days in a row and after that, the thing peeled off! I cannot say enough good things about this product. Their other Silver spray is really good for sore throats and keeps ur immune system up. I gave some to my 2 year old when he had bronchaitus and it helped him get better in a couple of days. Wonderful products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my skin looking good. I put in on my bug bites and cuts and my skin heals up wonderfully. My throat was hurting me and I eat some of this and it help heal my throat.</li>
            <li> we use it for EVERYTHING - along with American Biotic&#x27;s Silver Biotics liquid - pimples on the teenagers, cuts and scrapes on the kids, bug bites, runny eyes on the dog, any skin infections or irritations. it clears everything right up.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Has a plethora of uses. Helps to heal skin irritations and break outs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing product. I orginally bought it to try and clear my acne, after i had tried every single wash, cream, retin-a, lotion, pill nothing worked until i bought this and i have had amazing results.. i started seeing results the next day. but it doesnt stop just with the acne I recently got an ear piercing and it got badly infected where it throbbed all day and even if my hair brushed up against it it was painful. I tried a bunch of remedies trying to clear the infection but nothing worked, i then had an idea to try this product because what the hell my ear was already infected, so i dabbed this gel on with a q-tip before i went to sleep that night and the next morning the infection was gone, COMPLETELY GONE, no pain, nothing. i swear it was amazing, thats when i knew this product was liquid gold, i&#x27;m currently buying another one because my friend stole it from me after breaking out in a rash on her face from eating gluten on accident because she has celiacs disease. She swears its the only thing that is healing her rash &amp; when i took it back she insisted it was getting worse again and begged to pay me for this product because she had shopped everywhere for it (its hard to find just anywhere). It is worth every penny. An absolutely amazing product that does exactly what it says &amp;#34;rapid healing&amp;#34;. I recommend you buy this product you will be amazed, ITS AMAZING! cant say that enough, LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for everything!  If my kids get a scratch I put on the silver gel and it heals so much more quickly.  I also use it on acne and it works super quick!</li>
            <li> My mom uses silver gel for everything and recommend it to me for my acne and I was really needing something for it so I gave it a shot. I have found that when I put it on my acne spots they go away quickly, now I put it on my whole face after I get out of the shower and moisturize when it has dried, I almost never break out now. I recommend American biotech labs silver gel to everyone now for all things, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> NOT too pleased with this product. I think the Sovereign Silver gel works much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Protects open wounds from infections; just cover with moist gauze and change twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;  Later I read online that silver colloid kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria and boosts their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for healing skin problems. It has sped up the healing of a cut and scratches, red blotches, and a scar that I&#x27;ve had for more than 20 year. I&#x27;m extremely happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> Great as a facial aide......... I apply after washing my face, it helps keep down breakouts and heal up existing.  Excellent aiding cuts and skin irritations.  I also use this on my pets cuts and abrasions, scars/healing time is so quick!  If they lick it off it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Even after reading all the great reviews on this product, I was surprised to see its power for myself.  I bought it because I have something that is called &amp;#34;muzzle rash&amp;#34; which results in cysts around the mouth, chin, and nose area.  First, I used an acid peel, which caused a lot of raised bumps/flaky skin (this is natural and is part of the exfoliating process).  Then I applied this gel (only when I&#x27;m at home; I wash it off before going into the sun).  This has def sped along the healing process from the acid peel, and my chin area looks almost totally free of bumps and redness!! before, even when I didn&#x27;t have cysts on my chin, it was ALWAYS red.  I also had a cut on my finger that was really itching and red, and was healing very slowly.  I put some of the gel on right before bed and by the morning it was magically halfway healed.  I skipped a night (in which almost no healing occurred) and then put it on the cut the next night, and it&#x27;s almost completely healed.  I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use Neosporin again - this seems to have magical anti-bacterial properties, and also speeds along the healing process...not sure how.  I really recommend this for anyone who has problem acne on their face or just wants something better to use for cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> very  good product.i want buy  more .i hope the price will keep the same .i use  it every day.like silver products.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it all the time.  I just gave one to a friend to had radiation treatment for breast cancer.  She likes it too, said it gave her great releif from the burn she received during treatment.</li>
            <li> This gel is working miracles on my 15 y.o. dog.  she has some growths coming up on her body and I started to put this on the one on her forehead.  after just a few weeks of using it 3x/week, the growth has stopped growing, is drying up and diminishing!  AMAZING!  I also use it 2-3x/wk on her gums.  I rub it on gently and it&#x27;s really helped with her breath and her gums are turning a natural pink again and swelling is going down.  I&#x27;ll still take her to the vet for dental work, but this has helped tremendously with previous discomfort.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this brand yet but I have been using Silver Sol Gel for 5 years. I recommend this product for a multitude of things. We have removed planters warts, normal warts, thrush, athletes foot (tinea) speed up healing and bone growth during dental implant, cured a diabetic ulcer, sinus infection etc. I use it on anything and anywhere on the body. Anything that is bacteria, virus or fungus will be attacked by the silver, autoimmune problems like dermatitis etc are also calmed down. Needless to say I looove it to the moon and back!</li>
            <li> This is the second tube of silver gel by ASAP 365 that I have purchased.  I love that it soaks in without leaving any residue.  It feels lightweight when I use it after showering and when I use it before putting on makeup.  My skin is less dry and red and blemishes seem to heal quicker.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet.. been using on my face for acne, blackheads, and for warts on my leg for weeks and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase. Had a nasty incision post-op that just refused to heal after 3 months. The silver gel helped close up the nastiest part and had majorly decreased the remaining part of the incision site. Impressed with this product. If using on a post op area consult a WOC nurse before use. My WOC nurse actually recommended this product. U can also buy at CVS but the tube is 0.5 grams and almost the same price! This is a great price vs qty deal. I&#x27;ve used several times on scraped needs and cuts and they beal so much faster than with neosporin.</li>
            <li> This gel is a must for everyone.  I wish the price was a little lower so I could order more at once.  We often give it to others and it has helped clear up to name a few MRSA, Shingles, Face Breakouts, Suture infections, burns, scrapes, cuts, and even a beagle dog mauling and with absolutely no remaining scars on him.  Keep a tube on hand. Especially in your emergency kits!</li>
            <li> Hi - my husband and I received the shipment but the packing was ripped open and there was no product.  I realize this is not the fault of the seller and will remove the feedback as soon as this is resolved.  I have no idea why UPS would have left the package - they delivered it with one other item so maybe they did not notice.  Can anything be done to resolve this?</li>
            <li> I love this product, I always have it on hand. Great for any first aid need. It also clears up pink eye, good news since school is just starting again and I know parents have this concern as well as colds symptoms (start taking at first sign) which it works well for. I use it on EVERYTHING, love the gel also.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, it&#x27;s a mist have in my opinion. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of colloidal silver but topical use it tricky since it&#x27;s basically water. The gel makes it much easier to apply. It has a million uses and has worked so well for us.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It came promptly and is affective for small surface injuries.  Glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I had a 3rd degree grease burn on my hand and tries using Neosporin Plus (with the numbing agent) on it but it burned pretty badly so I decided that that probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea. I then tried dry bandaging it for two days but it just wouldn&#x27;t heal, and every time I showered it would bleed heavily. I decided that I needed a special kind of burn cream so checked in Amazon and found this gel, which had VERY good reviews. I ordered it (Prime), received it in two days and used it IMMEDIATELY! The next morning the burn was healing nicely, the second morning it was 2/3rds gone and now, four days after I began using it, all that&#x27;s left is a tiny scab in the very center of it...NO PAIN! NO BLEEDING!&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;ll not EVER be without ASAP 365 Silver Gel AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have used it on minor skin infections, cuts, scrapes, and burns, and it really expedites healing. I put it on a nasty scrape on my leg that was starting to swell and turn purple. The pain was gone IMMEDIATELY after applying the ASAP ointment and the mark was almost entirely gone by the next morning. This has also helped clear up my chronic Psoriasis outbreaks, which I have struggled with for years. I will keep this ointment in stock! It really works!</li>
            <li> Granted I bought this item from a Farmer&#x27;s Market vendor and was way overcharged, I see now.  THe product did not work at all.  I followed the instructions carefully.  I have since found a laser technique that I think is proving successful.</li>
            <li> Great service and fast delivery.  This is a must for every medicine cabinet. Can&#x27;t say enough about the results for scrapes, insect bites, burns etc.</li>
            <li> Great product! Best after shave.</li>
            <li> stop bug i bite itch, great buy</li>
            <li> My son had a very bad bicycle accident and had some really bad road rash on his face.  I applied this to the thick scab two or three times a day for about a week and one day the whole thing just rolled off in the shower leaving behind fresh, soft, pink skin.  I have also used it for myself on a poison ivy rash.  It cleared it up right away, just as effectively as the expensive cream from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and the only thing that I notice was it left my skin with some blemishes that I didn&#x27;t have prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two -- but one was only $9.81 and the other $13.51----disappointed at the cheaper one---it was already opened and about 1/2 the ounces---evidently, this price was a used product, even though offered as 4 oz. ASAP365.  The silver protection tape over the end was missing---the UPC code is 106231091 and was shipped separately from the other tube.</li>
            <li> It works, its also good for cracked dry skin. I just wish it came in 55 gal.drums.this is a great product.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING FOR 3 YEARS!  DELIGHTED THAT I CAN GET DEPENDABLY ON AMAZON!!  THIS PRODUCT IS A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE FIELD OF SKIN CARE FOR SEVERAL YEARS!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic is very mild and soothing and has great healing properties. I would recommend this to anyone who has any type of wound .We have used it for many years and we will continue to use it for many more years it works great.</li>
            <li> My wife burnt her leg with coffee, she  thought this Silver Gel did the job well. A few applications to her leg and it started looking better. would buy this Gel again.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work well on a horse with a wound that was slow to heal.  The oil based silver gel stays on better though.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Good seller.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well in burns. Someone also wrote to put it in the fridge for a bit and then apply it-- so much more soothing and cooling. Great product! Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I am a Naturopath and personally used this product and found it highly effective.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. This gel is controlling an oral infection that my medical pros were not prepared to address. A small dab daily across my lower gums, which have felt infected ever since my teeth were pulled due to failing root canals, is working a minor miracle.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a change and I have been using it religiously.. Won&#x27;t order again I&#x27;ll just stick to the Bio Oil!! Like how it feels and wit works</li>
            <li> This gel was recommended by a friend when I mentioned that I had a sore behind  my ear that would not go away with all the usual skin first aid.  I ordered the Silver Gel, which arrived very quickly, and started dabbing it on the sore I couldn&#x27;t get to heal.  Well, in about 2 days it was all but gone and in three it was gone after months of messing around trying to get it to go away with no luck at all.  I don&#x27;t entirely understand how silver gel works, but it does.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Originaly recommended by our chiropractor. Heals well. Only need a little.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I had little pimples on my legs that itched and this product healed them after prescriptions failed.</li>
            <li> Never before have I found such a great price for the same product at 4 times the price.. Thanks American Biotech Labs</li>
            <li> A frequent user of this product. It clears up all types of skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have a condition on my scalp that there is no treatment for it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that the Silver Gel does not cure it, but controls it, which is great!</li>
            <li> Have found product very useful on rashes,dry flaky sun damage skin, cuts and scratches. Have already purchased additional  tubes for family .</li>
            <li> Multi purpose boo boo gel.  Useful for any skin infection or irritation that could turn into an infection.  I do not need to buy zit cream any more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nuclear! My GF has been getting red spots and bumps on her face. It has cleared them up so she no longer looks funny.&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it on a foot cut and its worked wonders.....</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and it can be used for many skin issues.  I will always have this available in our first aid cupboard.</li>
            <li> I use this product to treat &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; .... my doctor prescribed me a steroid cream &amp; I wanted something that was less &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;.... so I tried the silver Biotics ointment.... and it&#x27;s taken about 2 weeks.... but I can see my skin clearing up &amp; there&#x27;s a noticeable difference. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had some wounds that weren&#x27;t healing properly (later diagnosed with diabetes and found out that was why). Just a little of this applied immediately created a barrier, and the wound healed probably 50% faster than it normally would have. My son also came to me complaining of itchy mosquito bites on his back that he couldn&#x27;t reach. I applied this and instantly the itching stopped. We won&#x27;t be without this in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> the product is great and it meets my expectation, and I would highly recommend it to everyone to use .</li>
            <li> I use this product for many things including using it on my face nightly,cuts &amp; rashes. I would recommend the gel also.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product several times on my Eczema. I find that it dries it out and creates more itching. Would not recommend it for anyone with eczema. However tends to sooth cuts and be useful for that.</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on my fave a few times a day. My complexion is already improving after 2 days. My skin feels so much softer and smooth</li>
            <li> This works great on acne. I tried just about everything, even pro active. this product is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li> Low silver content seems to limit effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on a minor skin problem on my feet., it has very cooling feeling (feels great) and seem to helping on the healing.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am still addicted to this and the liquid. Have a slight toothache? Rub a pea sized glob on your tooth. Dog&#x27;s ears itch? Put some on a cotton ball and gently rub in their ears (not too deep) and watch them stop scratching. Insect bite? Rub some in and it stops itching. Sore on your gums from dental injections? Again , rub some on the area twice a day. My husband loves it too and he&#x27;s just IMPOSSIBLE to influence!</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for me.  I ordered this fit my psoriasis, and it&#x27;s taken a few weeks, but it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law handed us a sample of this product and as a result, we&#x27;ve used it for scarring, black eyes, cuts and bruises and it works. It prevents infections and it really speeds up healing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It is one of the few products that I always have on hand and readily recommend to everyone for a first aid gel.  Also workss great on acne spots.</li>
            <li> any thing and everything scratches to gashes, burns to bug bites its about the coolest s*** iv ever had the pleasure of finding....</li>
            <li> its hard to say what actual amount of microbial silver is in this product. nothing beats prescription silvadene cream (burn treatment).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and worked really well on infected cat bites. Fast shipping and a recommended product to have on hand for wound care.</li>
            <li> I have problems with cystic acne and hate having to use antibiotics to clear it up.  ASAP365 is helping clear up this problem.  It works better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product worked great, I have diabeties and have the ocassional cut that takes forever to heal but the Silver Biotics worked like a dream and improved the healing time noticeably</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.  Worked on my pimples and rashes overnight and helps with my son&#x27;s eczema too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for all skin healing but especially for acne.  I sent a tube to my nephew, who has bad acne.  He put it on at night and the breakout was almost completely healed the next day.  I knew it would work for him because I had tried it and experienced the  same thing with a small breakout.  Pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> I swear by the healing properties of this gel. It is my exclusive first aide ointment - it really expedites healing. Additionally, it really helps my skin. I am 65 years old and weather beaten. I put this gel on my face every night and it has removed brown spots and evened out my complexion. Let me also mention that this gel works better on toe nail fungus than the double-strength prescription anti-fungal cream I got from my podiatrists. This gel is one of my best all-time discoveries. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Helps with my acne I usually get after shaving. Works really well</li>
            <li> I had heard that this product would assist with quicker healing of cuts and scrapes.  But my opinion is that it is not any better than using peroxide and Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out and made my condition worse. It&#x27;s probably just due to my sensitivities to just about everything, but still I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very effective when applied immediately after an injury.</li>
            <li> Product took care of a severe itch that could not be controlled with other lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! use it for all my minor cuts and scrapes. Works quickly it seems and lasts me a long time to use up!</li>
            <li> RECEIVED ORDER FECT SHAPE.. THANK YOU..</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product! My three year old son has severe eczema and many, many allergies as well. He somehow got a bacterial infection on his foot, which rapidly spread to other areas of his body. Normally, antibiotics would clear up something like this within a week, but he was allergic to everything prescribed! We had a few different people mention this silver gel, so we decided to give it a try. It is miraculous how quickly it is healing his skin! We are on the tail end of the infection now, and I would say the gel is responsible for healing him twice as fast, which is a big big deal! I will never be without this stuff, and I now tell everyone I know about it because I think it&#x27;s a shame that doctors will prescribe potentially harmful medication when this could be used instead in most cases. No harmful side effects, totally reasonable price, and super effective. It&#x27;s a gift from God!</li>
            <li> love love love it , takes the burn away in mins , and i would know i will burn during the winter time too, i take this stuff with me whenever we go on vacation and i let some friends use it while i was in mexico they loved it as well , a little pricey but its worth the money i will buy more as needed and with amazon fast free shipping couldn&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> Love This it Works !!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Very happy ;)</li>
            <li> Have never used this product before. To include a tip sheet with product would be nice.</li>
            <li> I have poison ivy and a burn on my stomach.  I used it once so far and have noticed a dramatic difference on both within a day.  I will be handing this over to my mom who has discoloration on her legs from a chemo rash...&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> We use this instead of antibiotic cream. Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent gel. It is very much like an antibiotic gel. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds). Full disclosure I used it in conjunction with Bio Oil (available on Amazon for $15ish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some wicked grease burns on my chest 2.5 months ago, used this suggested combo and within three weeks they were healed without scaring. Burned my hand last night and used the combo immediately and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well. Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too. Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften old scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus way cheaper than prescription or expensive stuff. The Silver Gel and Bio Oil cost that $30 for both medium sized bottles off Amazon.</li>
            <li> A medical doctor suggested this for use in treating onychomycosis. I am skeptical of unproven remedies and certainly have concerns about argyria, but I went ahead and gave it a try at a time when oral Lamisil was still under patent &amp; extremely expensive (not to mention risky in its own right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it did not cure my toenail fungus, but it certainly did something. I dabbed a pea-size amt on daily and wrapped with a band-aid. Over time, the old nail gradually lifted off the nail bed - or rather, the place where the bed attached to the nail kept retreating toward the cuticle, enabling me to trim it back shorter and shorter (to a point). But no new nail ever started to grow in its place, and the old one never completely came off. For some people, it may. So this was not a cure for me, but it certainly did something. Whether it ever does enough is an open question.</li>
            <li> I ordered the gel and  received it today.  When I took it out of the packing, I found a slightly beat up looking tube with a piece of packing tape on the cap.  Like a child had put on the tape, all crooked and stuck to itself.  When I took the tape off, there was no outer seal or inner seal on the tube.  Is this normal?  Is it supposed to be unsealed?&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed because when I purchased the liquid Silver biotics, the bottle had leaked all over the packing.  ( received a refund for that.)&lt;br /&gt;Is this how their products are usually received?</li>
            <li> I like this product besides the fact that TEA (Theophylline) is included in this product. This chemical is banned in other countries because of the adverse health risk associated with its use. I will not purchase this product in the future, nor will I advise others to do the same.</li>
            <li> I have chronic rosacea flare ups, and don&#x27;t like using antibiotics every time it happens.  Until now though, that was the only thing that would clear it up.  With the silver gel, I can just dab a bit on the affected area and it&#x27;s WAY better by morning.  It is a bit drying, but not so much a problem.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this product to aid in skin recovery after a tattoo.  It worked great, preventing irritation and infection. The site healed quickly and I&#x27;m sure this product helped enable the healing process.</li>
            <li> Healed up small cuts very fast!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for eczema. Not even a little.</li>
            <li> Great product helps heal wounds!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally! My hands are healing! My work requires me to wash my hands all the time and if I&#x27;d count the times I had washed my hands in a day I&#x27;d say my fingers and toes are not enough. And so, my skin usually breaks down, I develop cuts, blisters and burns. I&#x27;ve tried using anti-bacterial ointment but it doesn&#x27;t resolve my open wounds until I&#x27;ve used this product. After a day of using it, my problem doesn&#x27;t look so red and puffy anymore and it looks actually dry and my cuts are actually closing. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 3 days and wounds would likely heal fast. Now it&#x27;s all dry and close, a few more days and it will be gone soon. Thank you for this product! :)</li>
            <li> Definitely assisted with the shingles rash.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market!  I use this instead of neosporan (sp).  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I rely on this product year round!</li>
            <li> I use this product for almost every cosmetic issue. I have adult acne and sometimes the pimple hurts. I use this after cleansing my face. It doesn&#x27;t always make the pimple disappear right away but it does make the pain from the zit go away the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on rash, scars, boils and other things and it helps better than not using anything.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. Used it for several weeks and there was no change. I am still using it to see if it just works slows but so far this has not worked. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased American Biotech Labs Silver Gel for my grand daughter who is a chef at a retirement home. She had suffered 2nd degree burns over her entire thumb and was in extreme pain, even after her visit to the ER. They gave her an antiseptic ointment to put on it at home. My experience as a nurse, I knew she needed colloidal silver in some form to put on the burn to ease the pain and keep infection out. I ordered this and had it sent straight to her. She told me this was the only thing that eased the pain, and helped a lot in the healing process. She felt the burn healed faster than she had expected. This product is something that should be kept in every first aid kit. I will definitely purchase this again and have recommended it to my family and friends. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on a few &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; on my dog. The hot spots were very red and almost bleeding. They looked very painful and I could tell he was bothered by them. I have applied this Silver Gel twice so far and I can already see a big difference. The spots are no longer red or painful looking, and are nearly completely healed. This gel worked great for us!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it. I use it on my face (which is acne prone) and on any cuts and abrasions I or my family get. Seems to work overnight in helping to form scabs and heal open wounds. Product was delivered on or before promised date.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I am buying it again and again. Thanks American Biotech Labs for high quality. If you will buy it,  you will love ones too.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I had an unfortunate toxic exposure to rubber.  I&#x27;ve worn sneakers without socks while teaching my water fitness classes for years, not knowing how it was damaging my feet.  Afterwards, I&#x27;d always wear rubber flip flops in the shower, compounding the felony!  All of a sudden one day, both arches of my feet had rashes that looked like the ugliest bacterial growth you&#x27;d see in a lab petri dish!  Someone at the health food store said \\&quot;ASAP Silver is the only thing I use on skin rashes.\\&quot;  So, I decided to try it.  Thankfully, the product came quickly, it&#x27;s a clear gel, spread on the skin easily and not sticky, it&#x27;s cool and soothing.  It takes the sting out of any rough, reddened skin.  I applied it liberally after showering with the companion silver colloidal soap (that too is an amazing product).  In two weeks, the rashes subsided and I&#x27;m waay more comfortable.  I would recommend Silver Biotics ASAP365 very highly.  Getting the 4 oz. is the better value at $16, as the 1.5 oz. is $11.00.</li>
            <li> Bee stings ASAP puts the fire out fast. I take care of a big yard and am getting bit by some kind of bug or another and ASAP works wonders time and time again.</li>
            <li> It seems a little too clear for my senses to detect silver in it.  But I will withhold criticism until I have used it more.  I have noticed a small improvement over a day or two of use on two spider bites.  But I was looking for a product to replace my miracle cream of Silvadene which requires a doctor&#x27;s script b/c it contains antibiotic with silver cream.  I don&#x27;t see it as good as that yet.  And I hope that the Silvadene&#x27;s better results aren&#x27;t just because of the added antibiotics.  This silver gel is clear much like aloe vera gel.  The Silvadene from a pharmacy is a white cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am hopeful, though.  I will add another comment when I have a major issue requiring this gel again.</li>
            <li> My niece got a nasty burn and nothing worked long term to sooth the pain.  A pharmacist recommended this product.  First application brought her relief.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and so is the oral liquid by same name.I have used this gel for everything, even impetigo on my daughter&#x27;s face that was not being cleared up from the topical antibiotic cream.(had to be persistent..but dried up the sores!)We love this stuff! No smell, no burn..just healing. If you read about Silver Sol..you will see how it works in three different ways and is effective on MRSA.&lt;br /&gt;We use it inside the nose when we start to feel a cold/ flu coming on. It absorbs into body that way plus kills the virus inside the nose...&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have the real thing with patent number, as fakes have started to pop up.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I highly recommend it to others. A+ +</li>
            <li> Silver is an amazing healing product, my dog had growths and a lot of sun damage on his stomach. One month of application twice a day and it is almost gone. My husband also had an itching patch of skin on the bottom of his foot (not athletes foot), and applying silver gel once at night before bed for two weeks it is healed. Love this product.</li>
            <li> My mother uses it, and likes it.  She asked me to order another.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! After years of use it can cause argyria, a condition that turns skin blue from all the silver in your body</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have used</li>
            <li> This gel came in a 3-pack combo. The soap was a great value: I got eight bars of soap, a jar of Ultra Colloidal Silver Gel, which I didn&#x27;t like, and the Silver Biotics gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silver Biotics gel is a little more viscous and it is clear. The smell is not as strong as the other gel, but my dog still runs when I open the tube, so getting it onto his wound consistently is difficult. Also, he licks the gel off the wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on a couple of scratches on myself, and I believe I could tell a difference in healing time. I am very slow to heal and have very thin skin due to sun damage on fair skin. Using the gel seems to help my wounds heal faster.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a great tool in the family care system, you should read up on it if not used to it.  Then follow the instruction on the label, you will be happy with the results</li>
            <li> This should be in every first aid kit and in every home.  If it kills MRSA, you can imagine it&#x27;ll take care of any infection or scrape you&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> We keep this in our medicine cabinet and it has so many uses. I try to always keep one extra to give me warning as we go through it a lot and sometimes I run out just before a trip. It&#x27;s easy to use, works and it&#x27;s safe on any area we want to protect or kill bacteria. Have used it for years without anything but satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it...</li>
            <li> SilverSol by American Biotech Labs is, literally, a miracle in a tube/bottle. Nothing else can eradicate viruses, bacteria, fungi (including black mold) and even superbugs (can you say &amp;#34;MRSA?) like this, not only doing no harm to the body, but actually enhancing the immune system and overall health of the human body. I honestly cannot maintain my perfect, glowing health (given the usual life stressors plus a traffic rear-ender brain injury, permanent trap-spasms and migraines, chronic virus etc.) without keeping a supply of ABL&#x27;s Silver Gel and Silver Solution at all times. If you want truly cutting-edge products, research this stuff online and then use it. This seller&#x27;s service is consistently extraordinary, communication is flawless and shipping always super. What&#x27;s not to love?  :D</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. The Silver Biotics ASAP365 Gel was a God send for my Perioral Dermatitis- nothing I tried was working from antibiotics to all types of ointment and creams.  My skin has cleared and this Gel is going to be a permanent part of my daily skin care regime!</li>
            <li> HAS WORKED GREAT ON SCLERADERMA SORES</li>
            <li> My dad uses this to remove skin rashes. My family uses it for all cuts. Great for any skin issue.</li>
            <li> This &amp; African Black soap have almost completely cleared up my acne. My skin is better now than it has been in years. I am 45 &amp; have had skin issues since I was in my teens. I was on the verge of going on accutane- so glad this worked!</li>
            <li> This is a clear, coolibg gel that is great on cracked fingers, pimples that won&#x27;t heal on your face or body as well as good on diaper rash. The silver helps things heal faster.</li>
            <li> Ok first off I&#x27;ve never wrote a review for an online product. But I&#x27;m soooo excited I found this product.. Back in July I was given prednisone at the ER. After I was done taking the steriods I broke out with the worst acne of my life, on my back on my shoulders and arms.. I&#x27;ve been in an out or the dermotologist office since and been on monodox and retina A which has slowly helped \\&quot;a little\\&quot;. Then I figured Id throw a Hail Mary and order this product, 48 hours later my back is clear !!!! Thank you soooo much</li>
            <li> It is a nice soothing gel, but I did not notice it helping to heal cuts or acne spots anymore than other products.</li>
            <li> This an amazing product.  My father, 86, was watching a commercial and bought a tube.  He has suffered from itchy skin and eczema forever even having to take prednisone every day to control the itch.  He came over last week (still is active and drives) to tell us that he has the most frantic itches in the night and used this stuff to calm it down. He was thrilled.  I am a skeptic, but I also itch in the night in various places and use cortisone liquid to calm the crazy itch down.  I said &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll order some.  Three tubes later I am a believer.  It takes just a little to get the problem solved, and then I ventured into skin tags I have on my chest.  In just four day, applying twice a day, they have reduce in size by over 50%.  If you itch, get this stuff.  It works!!</li>
            <li> I tried using this for my psoriasis.  It did not make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never without silver gel in my apothecary.  Great price; great product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied wirh seller and product</li>
            <li> I am allergic to prescription antibiotics. I used this on an infected bug bite and it took the infection down quickly and healed it! A lot faster than my previous bites.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  If a blemish or bump starts to pop up, a little dab of this and it&#x27;s gone within hours.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything! Keep it in the fridge and Put it on your face before your nightcream and day moisturizer. It makes you younger by eliminating the yeast that causes wrinkles. I put in on my tearducts and rub it generally into my eyelashes to stop eye itching from alergies. It is totally safe and extremely effective. Kills germs for four hours if you do not wash it off. Kills bacteria, fungus, yeast.</li>
            <li> I take small amounts of this product internally.  I had a nasty injury on my knee and applied the gell there for faster healing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is very good.  After taking the prouduct internally it completely cleared up all nasal congestion.</li>
            <li> I had a ringworm on my leg that i had been using  ringworm antifungal cream on with no results. I even tried a stronger version of the antifungal cream...nothing! Then I read that silver cream is an antifungal and boy were they right! After the first day I noticed the ringworm was no longer itchy or had puss coming out of it. Then at the end of the second day, it was dead and starting to heal! This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> i use it for my acne which was severe. i started taking probiotics and caprylic acid and this has really helped my skin go back to looking like i didn&#x27;t just get in a car crash.</li>
            <li> seems to fade some spots will continue using</li>
            <li> Not Impressed,working with my hands for a living I get wounds all the time and some get infected. I used half of the product on all sorts of wounds with no almost miraculous results as some reviewers state.I use colloidal silver on wounds that are infected and get noticeable results. This makes me wonder the amount of colloidal silver in this product. I gave up and threw out the remainder of American Biotech labs Silver Gel.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for the whole family. It can be used for so very many different things from insect bites to mesa to building up your imunne system. I make sure I have a bottle on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this gel for an elderly lady who had chronic sores on her face due to post melanoma treatments.  She used this product and raved (or should I say was gushing) about how her sores that had never completely healed before,  had healed completely.  Her dermatologist had given her a tube of ointment as well but it did not have the same excellent results this gel did.  Fast forward 5 weeks.  This lady called me letting me know that she was running out of the gel and was in a panic, so I ordered more for her.  I ordered a tube myself just in case anything came up for me.  From my standpoint, I can say all the positive reviews are 100% accurate.  If I have a blemish or anything on my skin,  it seems to heal much quicker than usual.  About a month ago, a friend of mine gashed his brow bone area to the point where I thought he needed medical attention.  He did not seek a doctor&#x27;s care and the wound healed; however, it left a bump and scar that did not seem to be improving, and we both thought he would have a permanent scar. I gave him this gel to try and now the size of the bump has gone down to a third of what it was and continues to get better and there are no signs of scarring.  Now he keeps asking for more.  I say - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  I wish I had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Got it quickly. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my medicine cabinet.  I use it for all kinds of stuff.  Staph infections that my family gets occasionally, wound care, pimples etc.  The liquid silver solutions from this same company are also excellent for internal infections.</li>
            <li> The answer to the question about why I liked the product is :  I am a male 74 years old and have to manually catherize myself 3 times or more a day.  I put it on the catheter before i use it .  This product I have been using for 3 months now ,on a regular basis , and I find the product undeniably the best product on the market ,even replacing any prescription gel.  There has never been any signs of infection , redness or otherwise I also have the liquid form and I had a high fever this week and I had taken a teaspoon every hour for 8 hours and also put the gel on my forehead and temples ( I refrigerated it first to make it colder ).  I was fine the next morning.  Please look into purchasing Dr. Gordon Pedersen&#x27;s book &amp;#34; A Fighting Chance &amp;#34;  Third Edition , and you will be amazed at the chapter on Silver Uses A-Z.  I have used the liquid for multiple things and just LOVE the product.</li>
            <li> I have found this works great for keeping my Rosacea at bay.  I put it on after my toner. I put SPF lotion on last.</li>
            <li> This helped my neck surgery scar heal so well neurosuergon was floored. Also used on some older scars and grandsons disper rash</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have been using it for many years. Great for everything. A must have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - helps minor skin irritations to heal up quickly, does not smell at all and disappears into your skin.</li>
            <li> Using it for a week now and showing good results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product a week, so I can&#x27;t say too much of its effectiveness. I can say, however, that it&#x27;s certainly not bad. I have what the dermatologist says is a form of psoriasis that just happens to break out on my face. Isn&#x27;t that great where everyone can see? Anyway, I tried ASAP365 because my skin had been driving me nuts for about a month. In conjunction with using colloidal silver, my skin cleared up considerably in three days. However, I got a major rash around my mouth (mustache and beard area). I don&#x27;t know if it was the &#x27;silver&#x27; products or something else. Thus, I don&#x27;t know what to think yet, but the company has sent me two emails already. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m reviewing this product now. I&#x27;ll come back in a month for a more concrete review. The product itself has a nice consistency and goes on very smooth. It&#x27;s odorless and seems very non-irritable. I don&#x27;t think the rash I received was due to ASAP365. Maybe it was just coincidence...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**. I acquired another, more painful rash, but IT WAS NOT DUE TO ASAP365. I stopped using the gel after the first outbreak. Then, when the rash subsided, I began using the gel again, but not around my chin or under my nose; only on my cheeks, under my eyes, and around my nose. I have not had any outbreaks in those areas where I applied the gel for the last three weeks, once every night before going to bed. I will continue to give it four stars because although it is working, I still do have some redness. However, this product may work better for different types of skin. It certainly can&#x27;t hurt, IMO. One thing it has done is lighten a discoloration on my skin caused by some broken capillaries. Until I find something that works even better, this is the product I will continue to use. If anyone has a question or concern, I will gladly answer it through Amazon. Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> great product, timely delivery.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Glad I found this gel. It is a must have product in your cabinet. Use the liquid a lot but the gel is more appropriate at times.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I say buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this on my knee replacement incision and was fairly disappointed in the results. I used it for weeks but It really didn&#x27;t seem to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> We use various forms of silver a lot for germ killing and healing. When liquid forms caused intense pain to use on serious scrapes, this gel did the job without the pain. It is a permanent part of our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before on my son who had a severe cut on his hand but refused to go to the hospital. He tried over the counter products but his hand was looking really bad. I bought this put it on the infected area that morning that night the redness was already going away. This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> First time buyer, so I may augment rating, to reflect overall performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far;&lt;br /&gt;1. SOOOTHING&lt;br /&gt;2. LIKELY GOOD FOR CUTS, STINGS &amp; BITES.&lt;br /&gt;3. MAY IMPROVE MINOR HYPER-PIGMENTATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell...</li>
            <li> When my daughter was two years old she burned her hand. Our Pediatrician gave me some cream to put on her hand under her dressing several times a day. This was twenty years ago. I remember, at the time I thought that cream was magic because it worked so well! I had passed it along to a friend who needed it for a burn as well. All I could remember about it was that it had silver in it. When I saw this I had to order it to have on hand for our family first aid kit. I started using colloidal silver liquid for some other health reasons about five months ago and really believe in the product and have had amazing results!</li>
            <li> I also use this company&#x27;s liquid silver and was pleased to find the gel for skin at such a great price here,. It worked on my itching flare up like a charm.</li>
            <li> This really helped my gnarly psoriasis to stop itching and swelling. Also, helps clear up breakouts on face; good stuff, ordered several tubes of it.</li>
            <li> Yeah, she licks herself till scabs form (I know, gross) I&#x27;ve been putting this on her for about 3 days and I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve started seeing a difference! She still licks but its totally safe for her to do so.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have never had an acne problem until 2 years ago I am in my 30&#x27;s I have tried everything my husband turned me onto this product I have been using it every day 3x a day within a week my acne was gone I still half to use it every day as a preventative but wow I can&#x27;t believe how fast it cleared it up also put it on scars heals very fast:) Amazing price and Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I tried it for the first time on a mosquito bite last night, and by morning it had completely disappeared. Not just stopped itching, but completely gone! Usually mosquito bites make me suffer for days. I&#x27;m excited to see what else it can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I regularly get bitten by mosquitoes as many as 40 times while doing yard work. I put this gel on all the bites when I get inside, and almost immediately the redness dissipates and the itching stops. When I forget, the bites itch for days. I also applied the gel to a relatively bad burn I received while cooking, and it significantly help with both the pain and healing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is fantastic. If you have any pumps or lumps that need removing, it will do the trick. It will take time, but they will start getting smaller and smaller until they are gone. I use it on my dog as well who gets pumps on her and they work on her as well.</li>
            <li> Great for topical antibcaterioside. Wounds heal faster.</li>
            <li> Worked magic on my burns from a woodstove pie</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mineral Mountain silver solution internally and the gel for external skin issues with good results. So i thought i would try the Silver Biotics brand in the tube to compare with the others. It received good reviews on Amazon. It appears to work well with daily applications to the dry skin patches on the back of my head. I recommend it. Also, i will continue to use the Silver Mountain gel from Amazon for my left lower leg skin problem that my doctor does not understand. It really works.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years an am currently using it on an open and previously infected wound. It was infected with an antibiotic resistant staph like fungus typically seen only in hospital settings. It has cleared the infection and sped healing.  Now to the people who think this is a scar gel it&#x27;s not. This is for cuts and wounds it&#x27;s not going to heal eczema or psoriasis those are caused by conditions within the body or external allergens, sometimes the cause is unknown. This will also not treat a toenail fungus as that occurs at such a deep level the gel could not possibly reach it that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s for external applications. By external it means the uppermost layers of the skin and in the case of cuts, wounds and blemishes it has a way to the source via an open epidermis. Psoriasis can sometimes bleed due to scratching as can eczema but the gel cannot treat the sources of these issues also I say again it is not for scars. This is not even related to mederma in any way. Use a cocoa butter or coconut oil or various other butters for scar help.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around.  Thank you for a very speedy delivery and for providing a great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff helped the eczema on my hands heal - they were bleeding so badly I could not sleep or tie my shoes. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it for everything</li>
            <li> This product seemed to dry out my skin a bit and didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Helps with acne, has improved skin tone, and pores. Helped heal some sores quickly. We use this instead of poly-sporin. No burning, just a cool soft get. Would recommend for everyones medicine cabinet, and can help with acne! Look up silver sol, and it has many benefits, we concur with what we have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not expensive, worth a try. Amazon has a good price on it.</li>
            <li> I really like Silver Biotic products I have used the liquid before and fell in love.  This is the first time using the gel and I think I like the gel better than the liquid only because the gel doesn&#x27;t run when using it on you skin.  Any types of cuts it help clear it up faster.  Will buy again and also, it lasted me a couple of months and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be reordering.  Thank you for being there!</li>
            <li> This is great gel., would never be without it.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Not at all as described.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I like the Silver Biotics and use it  because I am in and out of the pool......  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> The gel is soothing and easy to apply.  However, it did not remedy a toe fungus, which was mostly why I&#x27;d bought it.  It makes me wonder how much good it does.</li>
            <li> I have some kind of allergic reaction going on to medication is what the doctor says. This product does not stop me from breaking out but it does clear my skin right up. It enhances natural healing. I would recommend this to anyone. Amazon again has one of the best prices around. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Helps manage psoriasis...and to heal those everyday cuts/injuries that kids get.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews this quick after purchasing but then I never had results like I just had.  I am diabetic and sores just don&#x27;t heal up like they should.  I put this on and within 24 hours there was a marked difference.  I haven&#x27;t had healing like this for years.  I am really looking forward to continuing this!!</li>
            <li> Hi, I think this is a great product...have not tried on open wound or burn but have been using on face and I think it helps acne from infecting (mind you, I don&#x27;t think it necessarily keeps it from coming, just keeps it under control).  Only reason not rating a 5 is because, from their site, I thought it would moisturize a little more.  It said something about leaving skin soft and smooth on the official site.  Had hoped it could have doubled as a moisturizer but once it settles into the skin someone on the dry side will definitely stilll need their moisturizer over it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is great for skin rashes and cuts. My doctor recommended this for a rash in the back of my ears and my husband hit his head playing tennis and had over a 100 stitches. I used the Silver Gel on his forehead and in less than six weeks you couldn&#x27;t even tell he had the stitches.  If you have any type of cut I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works wonders for every skin problem. It cleared severe diaper rash for one of my twins. I love Silver Gel!</li>
            <li> I am becoming a big fan of silver and my wife loves this item due to it&#x27;s convenient tube that she can use easier then a tub of silver gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I get adult acne &amp; have been dabbing this on at night. I use it on any kind of cut or scrape. It&#x27;s crazy how much faster things heal when using this! This is a great product to have in your home.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get an occasional bout of exema and itchy skin and this helps immediately. I also use it on neck tags and many have gone away as well as some small moles. I think it has anti-viral qualities. This was at least my 3rd purchase and I always have some on hand and use it a couple times a month as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I love this Silver gel. I will never go without. It is such an healing gel. better than any ointment you can find. I had surgery in an eye last weel and you wouldn,t beleive how well it has healed with this gel. I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Ok, I bought this product and I was very doubtful that it would help. I have a patch of eczema around my lips that goes through stages of weeping/crusting/peeling/better.... and repeats that cycle. Cortisone makes it better, but it also thins the skin and is addictive, and lip skin is already so thin. My research saids that colloidal silver is quackery, but whatever, I&#x27;ll try it out just in case. Well, about 10 days later, my lips are healing, now the skin is just tinged pink, and getting better. I applied the gel 3-4x a day. I&#x27;m not totally convinced that the gel is what healed it, because it goes through these cycles anyway. But for now, I&#x27;m convinced to keep using it for my eczema patches.</li>
            <li> I just bought another tube.  Can&#x27;t imagine my life without silver biotics! Pimples, irritated skin, mosquito bites, razor cuts, all skin problems I treat with this gel. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a private company for my 2nd degree burns from caramelized sugar stuck to my fingers. I generally heal slowly, but this stuff was incredible!  I put it on all my burns and within 1 week, they seemed to heal with little to no problem! Even the worst, a huge blister on my pinkie, healed virtually scar free (still healing). Beyond the burns, it heals external yeast infections beautifully without irritation (it&#x27;s like using water...no stinging at all). I&#x27;ll keep this as a staple in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked as an art teacher for the past eight years. As soon as I started working with children I got molluscum contagiosum on my hands and arms. It wasn&#x27;t severe. It would come and go and usually I had 3 or 4 of them. Then I decided to get rid of them for good and &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; them (Stupid idea. I won&#x27;t go into details) and within a couple of months I had about 30. I tried every product, looked on every forum, website, tried with baking soda, vinegar, etc. Nothing worked. Then I found in some forum someone recommending a similar silver based product that I could not find so I bought this gel instead. Thank God I found this. I was going crazy. I used this and salicylic acid just like the person in that forum recommended. I used the salicylic acid every 3 to 4 days and only had to apply it about 2 or 3 times on each molluscum and the gel every day, 2 or 3 times a day. The person on the forum used oral supplements and another creams also, but the silver gel and the salicylic acid worked for me and I was cured in less than a month! I&#x27;ll add that person&#x27;s testimony bellow because it could be important for someone suffering from this.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;...combination of direct topical application of TCP and 11% (I used 17%) liquid salicylic acid (Scholl callous and corn removal treatment) onto the central core surface of the lesions avoiding surrounding skin. (she is right. It&#x27;d irritate your skin)  Allowed this to dry, then spray with colloidal silver solution (I bought the gel instead) across the entire affected areas neck, armpit and tummy, allowed to dry and then plastered with Sudocreme directly over the lesions. This done every evening after bathing. In parallel oral supplement of a betaglucan (am empty stomach) and concentrated olive leaf extract (pm with food). Positive results within one week, 99% clear after two weeks. Also using the collidal silver spray in all other areas to protect against reinfection.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this ASAP365 Silver Gel.  It does everything it says it does and I have found many uses for it in my everyday life.  There are a lot of things I don&#x27;t buy anymore because it seems to do the trick at getting rid of bacteria.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I only been using it for a while but I noticed it stops the itching since I have sensitive skin so that&#x27;s great. I also use it to dry out any break out I get here and there.</li>
            <li> ASAP Ultimate Skin+Body Gel is a wonderful product. It kills germs and heals wounds more quickly than most antibiotics I have used. I also use it as a hand sanitizer. It keeps killing germs for four hours. I use it on my face for blemishes and not only does it heal them quickly, it softens my skin and makes it look healthy and it feels great. It soaks right in, feels light and is non-greasy. It also works great on bug bites.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from cold sores since I was a kid...  I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past, Abreva, prescription Valtrex pills and Zovirax cream...  nothing helped. This stuff is MAGIC.  As soon as I feel the tingle, I hit it with an Oragel Single Dose Cold Sore Treatment vial... then I fill a water bottle CAP with this silver gel, and I just keep dabbing it on the spot.  It will soak in very quickly... just keep putting it on... while you&#x27;re watching TV, at your desk working, etc.  It&#x27;s clear and non-residue so no one will notice.  Later that night/next morning, do another Oragel Vial, and then dab the Silver gel again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had two incidents since buying the silver gel, but both times, no cold sore developed!  Didn&#x27;t puff up, didn&#x27;t blister, nothing.  This works.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy it.</li>
            <li> I have known about this company when I worked for a Chiropractor who had natural vitamins and food store connected to his business.  We sold the Silver Biotics liquid and the doctor treated patients with it as well with great results.  SO when I saw there was a gel I had to buy it and try it.  I LOVE IT!!!!  I could write the amazing results with the liquid and now with the gel I have seen good results as well.  My burn healed up fast with the gel :)  I even bought this product as a gift and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> To make this a quick synopsis, this product helped myself with getting rid of Chicken Pox and it aided my wife with her shingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and on a smaller scale it also aided us with some cuts and burns.  Product sure is effective.  We plan on purchasing more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I had a bad large burn (huge blisters! ) on my elbow. Wish I had used the silver gel right away. I forgot about using it til the next day.  Using the silver gel then has calmed the pain and has continued to not only keep me comfortable, but has helped the burn to heal nicely. I was amazed that the area is now smooth and not painful at all. The elbow is always getting bumped, with no resulting problems. I have to be on immune suppressing meds that could have allowed infection to set in that burnm but there has been no hint of infection. The silver gel has been SO helpful!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Sept 2016:&lt;br /&gt;We continue to use the gel for many things. I ave ordered more tubeswhen we run out.&lt;br /&gt;My husband just got a large severe burn on his lower chest from a leaking vegetable steam bag he was removing from the microwave....VERY painful &amp; would have blistered badly.  Right away we put the silver gel on it, and after some hours, the pain subsided.  We put the gel onto the burn 3 times a day.  It has been 13 days, and the large burned area is about 80% gone, and there was never a blister.  In a few days, there will probably be a totally healed area there.  The gel truly was fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is a good product although there is something else we sometimes get. This one is a little less money.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing at drying up cold sores in a fraction of the time.  I never noticed an improvement using the costly Abreva cream, but this clears them up in 2-3 days.  I&#x27;ve also used it on a bunch of bug bites and scrapes on the rest of the family.  I would be interested to know what other people use it for.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have reviewed in a liquid form as well. I think this is a good product to try for external skin issues.&lt;br /&gt; as I stated in the other review, it is important to enlighten yourself about any product to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;We do not know the long term impact of nano particles.</li>
            <li> This worked better than the prescriptions I got from Doctors.</li>
            <li> I had asked a question about the product and did not receive an answer, so will give one here.  It works beautifully on shingles nerve pain, takes the pain down to just a minor ache within an hour.</li>
            <li> I always have this in my refrigerator for any accidents that happen.</li>
            <li> I have a cousin who works for this company so my review is a bit biased. But in all honesty this stuff really works. We use it all the time on any topical skin treatment.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Most recently I treated an incision on my neck from having part of my thyroid removed. I was amazed at how quickly the incision healed and became much less noticeable. On my post op appointment the surgeon asked what I had been using on the incision site as it looked so good. She had not heard of this product before, but stated to keep using it as it obviously works!</li>
            <li> It has helped to keep a rash from driving me crazy. This product promotes healing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, helps with wound healing and dry skin issues. I will be a repeat buyer on this for sure!</li>
            <li> I apply this gel for nasal congestion relief and when out shopping to prevent flu and cold viruses.  Can also be used for face and hands to kill any germs (especially after touching door handles).  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I do not understand the &amp;#34;how&amp;#34; but since my grandmother was placing silver dollars in warm water I have used silver for sores, burns, infected cuts and colds.  This salve worked great controlling diaper rash and has kept infections from coming when cuts or scrapes happen.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT: Brand, Quality, Results. This was approved by the Wound Care Center @ the hospital (where my father went) for his extremely difficult to heal wounds (because of P.A.D.) below the knees. In my experience this product works THE BEST over ANY antibiotic creme or gel. I was able to get them under control with this product &amp; ofcourse other general care. If it CAN heal, it will with this. They also have a liquid that I take internally when I feel a cold/flu coming on or chronic Lyme symptoms flare up. A staple in my first aid/ health kits I wouldn&#x27;t be without.</li>
            <li> I just receive this in the mail today (Fast Shipping) and I have to share with you my experience with this product. About three weeks ago a strange rash developed on both of my arms and it&#x27;s been agony for me ever since. I haven&#x27;t been able to sleep very well and I started to feel so self conscious in public because it looks so bad. I went to see a doctor for it and she told me that it was probably a reaction to something I did while gardening (I was chopping leaves off of my banana tree two days prior to the rash) and at that time I was also on antibiotics, so she really wasn&#x27;t sure what the cause was so she suggested that I use an antihistamine. It has been the only thing that kept it (sort of) in check but it isn&#x27;t working as good as it used to (it actually never really worked as good as I&#x27;d hoped), so I desperately went in search of something that would relieve me of this terrible itch. When I read the reviews for this product I was somewhat skeptical that it would work on me so when I received it today I only applied it to my left arm. The first minute I applied it to my left arm the itch started to subside and now it&#x27;s been about two hours and the bumps are smaller in size and the itch is completely gone! The only thing I regret is that I didn&#x27;t apply it to both my arms and that I didn&#x27;t find out about this product three weeks ago. So far I love it and will update this review in a few days to let you all know the final outcome. It has given me hope. Thanks to all who left helpful reviews here, I am so grateful! And of course thanks to the company for making such an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I have had two major infections in my lower legs in the past year.1/2, for which I was hospitalized twice. ( For 8 days and 9 days each.hospitalization.)  My home health nurse advised me about this gel and.soap.  (I am allergic to penicillin and my antibiotic options are limited.)  At the first sign of redness I use the soap and gel.  I told my Doctor about how it has helped me, and he  replied \\&quot;Do you know who uses the soap?\\&quot;.  He said,\\&quot; Your Dr.\\&quot; He told me in the Civil War when they got their water from creeks.and rivers they would throw a.silver dollar iin the bucket and let it sit overnight.  The medical personnel knew back then the antibiotic properties of pure silver.  It has been the best secret in medicine.  I am very blessed to have discovered this product.  It is A++++.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for our medical needs and believe it or not it has been used for deodorant and it works well.  This was needed due to a severe medical condition.  Shipping is superior, even arriving on Sunday with Amazon Prime, love that.</li>
            <li> We use it for cuts, scraps, scratches, acne spots, ingrown hairs, baby rashes, on plantar warts, blisters, minor burns....Anything that you need to heal, this stuff works. It doesn&#x27;t burn either. No nasty smell. A nice gel consistency.</li>
            <li> A great and necessary product. Every medicine cabinet should have it...(there would be less need for medicine if they did) I am vary happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> well I been using this as an alternative to chemical under arm deodorant. and it works great... no smell..at all. just a dab does the trick.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for acne. Less harsh than benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. An essential product in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth tube of Silver Gel in 1 year. It works so good that I wind up giving it to family members. My Dad is a diabetic and I treated a MRSA infection my dad had on his foot and the wound healed completely. My wife, granddaughter and two nieces use it on mosquito bites...I don&#x27;t know why, but it relieves the itching on the large whelps that my Wife gets. Read the US Patent on this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised...thank you</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis - the doctors have told me that there is no cure for this irritating condition.  There may not be a cure, but there is help to make your skin less dry, less scaly, less itchy - in other words, to make your skin better!  And NO, the doctors won&#x27;t tell you about this outstanding product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product on other skin problems - insect bites, chemical reactions - all to great results!  I highly recommend this product for your first aid cabinet -</li>
            <li> REASON PURCHASED:  I have chronic lyme disease and for some reason, my skin has suffered significantly - head to all 10 toes.&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS USED BEFORE THIS:  Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve tried things that would BUST the extreme scale, from drinking borax to layering myself with pure sulphur powder.  I&#x27;ve also taken many trips to the ER for fear of infected facial lesions before, during, and after trying too many other solutions that bombed.  Since using this gel AND the ABL Silver Solution, you would look at me and think I am making these stories up.&lt;br /&gt;NOW USED BY:  My entire household - me, sister, bro-inlaw, 6/yo niece, 3/yo nephew, 12/yo dog&lt;br /&gt;HOW USED:  skin lesions, pimples, cuts, itches, mosquito bites, scratches, hot spots, teeth, ears, nostrils, bruised, nails, scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE YAYS&lt;br /&gt;1.  It doesn&#x27;t sting.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It becomes invisible.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I&#x27;ve seen no adverse reaction to it on anyone who has used it and both myself and my nephew have VERY sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It works quickly.&lt;br /&gt;6.  It works on any skin related problem.&lt;br /&gt;7.  You can apply makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Amazon&#x27;s price rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NAYS&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you use it as much as I seem to, it&#x27;s definitely an expensive habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  When you can&#x27;t squeeze any more out, cut off the top and bottom of the tube and you&#x27;ll find a lot left.  You don&#x27;t need to cover it or do anything to preserve the remaining gel, it&#x27;ll hang out fine in the open tube until used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it as anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti viral for topical antiseptic.  Will skin over &amp; dry as clear cover If placed on wound or spot you want to treat in about 15- 20 min.  Washes off easily, not sticky.  Also have used it under a bandage / band-aid to protect wound.  It works to prevent infection. (Note:  you still have to clean the wound first.) In once case, even applied to sore gums and after root canal to prevent infection and mouth sores. (no taste)  Suggesting your own research, but we&#x27;ve found this brand, this product, to be exceptional and in our family, takes the place of all the other ointments previously used. This item has about a two year shelf life, so be sure to check the exp date code stamped on the bottom of the tube seam to be sure you have nearly fresh product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; it works well with every kind of skin irritation I&#x27;ve had. It has been used in hospitals for burn patients. It also protects warm, wet areas from infections and preempts irritation as well.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Really good for stubborn wounds that don&#x27;t want to close.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this miracle product. It is a remedy for nearly EVERYTHING. First and foremost, my boyfriend had 8 weeks of radiation to his throat  and this stuff cleared up the burns in 2 1/2 days 6 weeks in. Why every hospital doesn&#x27;t tell you about it I do not know. I originally bought this for my dog a few years ago, was recommended by a holistic vet for her ear tip wound that wouldn&#x27;t heal. It took 3 weeks of applying but it worked! I have used it on various scrapes, burns, cuts, painful foot conditions. The other day I had a fireball come out of my oven due to gas build up, burned the baby hair right off  my forehead, some eyebrow hairs are missing and also got very VERY close to the skin (it was red and I felt the heat coming). I immediately washed my face with cold water and then applied several thin layers of ASAP gel over the next couple of hours. No burns. No redness. No peeling. No nothing. No smell, no taste, no greasiness. Just healing and soothing. I&#x27;ve told so many people about this stuff, have been meaning to write a review for a long long time. This is a must-have in everyones kitchen and first-aid box.</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING! I had a small cluster of what looked like keloid scars on my wrist, they&#x27;d been there since new years eve 2015. they started of like blisters and were healing into some pretty ugly scars. So they weren&#x27;t fresh scars or wounds but they weren&#x27;t completely healed either (I got them from firework malfunction) I bought this product on Feb 18 2015. received it on the 20th. I applied it only before bed at night and was blown away by the fact that the raised up, bulky scars were flat and smooth by Feb 22nd 2015! I didn&#x27;t even buy it to use as a scar treatment, totally unexpected but absolutely awesome results :)</li>
            <li> there werent many choices for colloidal silver skin products on anmazon, so i chose this one. imo all it is is gel--no added ingredients. no effects at all (and i have seen improvement in skin frm other colloidal silver creams within 5 days).</li>
            <li> I can use every day with out negative reactions!</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> This gel is really good and gives benefits you would not expect.  In addition to healing dry skin and any rashes, it tightens the skin and reduces pores on your face and makes the skin look younger.  I used it on one of my cats that had an itchy dermatitis on her back above her tail and it healed that patch very rapidly.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it did not heal some residual effects (not scars) from cystic acne that I had many years ago.  Perhaps I&#x27;m supposed to use it a longer time to have those clear up.  (I need a gel to increase patience and reduce frustration.)</li>
            <li> This ointment didn&#x27;t heal my eczema condition. It was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use this product very frequently when i have cuts or scraps, anything that is open to germs. I like this product!</li>
            <li> I have a bacterial infection on my side, nothing my doctor had prescribed was working.. I believe it to be some type of candida/yeast issue. I received it, and within 4 applications and 24 hours my side is about 50% better looking. It&#x27;s no longer itchy, sore or red. Praying it takes this away.. I&#x27;ve had it for several months and over 200 in prescriptions... This was worth trying!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, I will order as soon as my wife runs out.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of antibiotic ointment - works really well on cuts and insect bites.  It really helps to heal your skin and I like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> Am pleased with my purchase i will be ordering more again too.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount as it comes in a sort of gel form.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works better than neosporin or baxitracin, it&#x27;s amazing for yeast infections!</li>
            <li> Waste of time, money, and efforts. Bought for wart treatments. Extremely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;Also had the boyfriend using it religiously for guys toe fungus for nearly a month. ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE.</li>
            <li> For almost 3 years I have been struggling with diagnosed nasal and facial MRSA sores which can sometimes spread to other parts of my body. I have been through at least 10 rounds of antibiotics , used Bacitracin and Muprocin ointments, washed with Hebiclens and various germicide cleansers, tried Bensoyl Peroxide to dry up and prevent facial sores from developing, used the strongest Manuka Honey applied to sores and covered with gauze overnight as well as Manuka oil, tea tree oil and a few other things. I was also counseled by an infectious disease specialist which didn&#x27;t help much. Only the internal antibiotics would clear up the sores but they would always return within a few weeks and I knew they would stop working eventually as well as the doctors becoming more reluctant to prescribe them for this reason. After reading about colloidal silver I decided to give this a try without much faith it would work but what did I have to lose? Well, this has been amazing. I applied it 4 times a day to any active infections which would clear up in about the same amount of time as any normal non-MRSA sore and now use it twice a day in the trouble areas to keep the infections away. This also seems to work better than anything for acne and burns  and I also use it as an underarm deodorant which keeps me stink free even on 4hr long bike rides, better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve used. It seems anything related to bacterial problems can be treated with this and it absorbs into the skin with no oiliness or residue. Hopefully others will find this works for them too.</li>
            <li> Such a good product.  glad to be able to get it at a good price</li>
            <li> ...and one more Silver Biotics product that works wonders! If you ever have skin issues whether it being a rash, abrasion or a some type of skin irritation, Silver Biotics goes to work on killing bacteria instantly making it one of the finest products available on the market today. Nothing compares!</li>
            <li> I love it! just get it if you have ANY problems with your skin! what ever the problem may be! i use it after i shower and it works best :) i do perfer getting the bigger bottle..... they packaged it VERY WELL and they said thank you so much times! it was crazy! but you can tell how much the care!</li>
            <li> just get it!  its awesome.  I am using it for skin issues, nasal passages, and followed one user reviews lead in using it to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> This is an excellent natural product that will resolve many issues without going to the doctor or dermatologist. It is made in a way that it does leak out of solution and is safe.</li>
            <li> We have been using silver gel for a few yrs and use it for a lot of uses. This is one product I always keep on hand.</li>
            <li> For those who are elderly &amp; skin that tears easily on the forearms, this is the perfect remedy. It has helped heal &amp; seal  my husband&#x27;s forearms thereby preventing infection.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Works nicely to provide silver to the body and skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference using this on a wound.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I use it on cuts and on my face to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> I now have six tubes of this product. I can tell you I am a believer in silver for many skin conditions.  My husband uses it on his eczema  and decreases inflammation on his feet. He also had it on his head and it was weeping  My husband was really stressed but silver actually cured it on his head there is no scars or anything just vanished.  I am using it to treat an ulcer in a very bad place it is getting smaller .Hippocrates  the father of modern medicine treated his  patients with ulcers using silver. My hubby misplaced my first tubes so I ordered more but I found them. Silver has antibiotic properties. you can look up information online about what silver can do. This is an AA++ product      This is an update Dec 16 2014    This silver gel healed my ulcer. the time I started using it the ulcer was getting smaller now it is gone GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any difference. i did like the nano 153 silver soap much better.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for external use.  I originally tried using colloidal silver, but it wouldn&#x27;t provide as long lasting relief as this gel.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a glow and helps to heal. I purchased it for my face and acne, but eventually started placing it over my entire body. Worth my money</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff! I&#x27;ve tried other silver gels and this one works best for me. I use it for yeast issues and minor cuts/burns. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product..will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> This saved me so from going through so much torture.  I had developed a rash and it was to the point where the pain was so great, I needed something to help.  I&#x27;m not a person that uses over the counter stuff and most of them have never worked anyway.  My doctor recommended this and within the first application or two of using it, I could notice a very big improvement in my rash.  It was a miracle to me and I don&#x27;t know what i would have done if I had not found this Silver Gel.  My rash is now all gone.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> love this product!  I use it for my facial skin moisturizer daily.</li>
            <li> .....have been using this product for a good many things...its the best for healing scrapes, cuts, scratchs and really good for aches and bruises - have even used it on my face for chapped cheeks (I spend too much time outdoors in the cold)...anyhow don&#x27;t plan to be without it ....</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by the preacher Jim Bakker.  I decided to try it and it is the best product to have in your medicine cabinet.  It heals everything quickly, scratches, burns, itches, open wounds, anything.  I even use on my face after I wash it.  There is also a liquid which I use daily and it keeps me healthy.  I&#x27;ve even used on my pets wounds and it heals them up fast.  There are not enough words to describe how GREAT this product is.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works.  Try it for several weeks and you will see it completely clear up.</li>
            <li> okay for bites and bruises but i bought it in the hopes it would help clear pimples. it didn&#x27;t. It broke me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for around 3months.  I use it ever other diaper change or so, and the in between changes I use a Natural BabyGanics cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby had 1 minor diaper rash, and I applied this every diaper change, rash subsided after 2 days... and the rash was never bad enough to cause discomfort to my newborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Silver as home remedies... and this product seems like it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the rave reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work the same for me as for other people. I have mostly used it on scabs from popped acne, and I have not seen any change in the length of time that it takes for them to heal. Maybe I need to use it on regular scabs instead of acne scabs, but as of right now, I&#x27;m not really impressed. I will update my review if I change my mind. I gave it 3 stars because I used it after using a 1.5 mm dermaroller on my arm and it helped. If you have used a dermaroller, you know that it feels like your skin is sunburned afterwards. Using this stuff on the area, however, immediately soothed it.</li>
            <li> This should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  Love this product and the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Works on fungus to sore muscles.  Really.</li>
            <li> Love this gel and use it especially in my cat scratches and heals quickly without infections. I use this daily and very safe,natural.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who ever needs a gel with healing qualities.  Silver serves well as an anti-biotic, taking out over 600 different strains of bacteria.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT!!  I used this for a wart caused by an STD, which was growing in size and becoming painful.  The next day after applying this gel, the pain had reduced.  In about 4 days after using about twice a day, the wart is almost completely healed!  I also put it on my face on a couple spots, and it completely removed a couple of them in a few days.  I have what I think is a mole, which seems to be more difficult for this to remove, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it on it and see if it doesn&#x27;t eventually remove it.</li>
            <li> been using silver gel (along with manuka cream) and this is far superior than the &amp;#34;typical triple antibiotic ointment&amp;#34;.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
