            <li>I love this fragrant lotion.</li>
            <li>I just hope there is more lotions and body spray.</li>

            <li>My body chemistry obviously doesn&#x27;t work well with this lotion because it does not smell quite as wonderful on me as it did on my co-worker.</li>
            <li>This is my Favorite.....</li>
            <li>it was more like a crem than a lotion</li>
            <li>An all time favorite for a reason....</li>
            <li>It is a bit like cotton candy and vanilla icing together making it a comforting, feminine, sexy scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I could get it more often.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and really made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and I know all of the beauty rush collections were extremely strong.</li>
            <li>and I recieved it pretty quickly :).</li>
            <li>It came quickly but was leaking a bit even with bubble wrap on the dispensing side</li>
            <li>but it was super</li>
            <li>However, it did remind me of similar scents at BBW: Warm Sugar, or Vanilla Bean Noel.</li>
            <li>I am an avid shopper of Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>Smells great why do they discontinue everything that&#x27;s good :(</li>
            <li>Great product, at least that&#x27;s what she said</li>
            <li>I got exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>really like the fact that when we recieved it it was damaged and it was replaced right away no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the other 1 is wild raspberry &amp; bright strawberry</li>

            <li>I was very please to find this gift.</li>
            <li>The product reached me extremely fast</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really smell it at all</li>
            <li>This lotion has the exact same base.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 hours the lotion was still powerful.</li>
            <li>this is my husbands favorite lotion that i have bought in the past</li>
            <li>Had no problem with seller and came early .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lingering heavy sweet scent.</li>

            <li> Long lasting .</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to heavy smelling lotions and this one is not</li>
            <li> I must say I was constantly reminded of a couple other lotions out there that is currently being sold.  </li>
            <li> It is a closed friend&#x27;s favorite fragrance and she has been very disappointed that she could not find it.</li>
            <li> I put the product on myself and tested the scent for a few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Victoria&#x27; Secret needs to bring this one back</li>
            <li> I noticed where the lotion had been on my arms there was a slick feeling where the lotion had been, even though I had used soap to wash it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find now.</li>
            <li> They use a base scent on all their lotions which makes them identifiable as BBW lotions.</li>
            <li> This has been discontinued by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> I used to get it at victoria secret for 3/$25.00</li>
            <li> So sad this item comes once a year for semi annual sale.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I find this base scent annoying because of the lingering sweet sickening smell.</li>
            <li> I hate VS discontinued and nothing else they have smells like it...</li>

            <li> I received the lotion that I had ordered for my daughter. I put the product on myself and tested the scent for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lingering heavy sweet scent.

I noticed where the lotion had been on my arms there was a slick feeling where the lotion had been, even though I had used soap to wash it off. With all this said, It never reminded me of cotton candy. However, it did remind me of similar scents at BBW: Warm Sugar, or Vanilla Bean Noel. Mix the two together.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied.  I just hope there is more lotions and body spray. Does anyone have more? Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife choose and I don&#x27;t mined it because damn it smells good. She loves victoria secret and this was a great deal.</li>

            <li> Great product, at least that&#x27;s what she said</li>
            <li> This is my Favorite.....don&#x27;t want to use nothing else!  So sad this item comes once a year for semi annual sale.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 spun sugar &amp; warm vanilla  candy warm baby but only got 1 . the other 1 is wild raspberry &amp; bright strawberry</li>
            <li> The product reached me extremely fast but it was super thick(unlike the one i have) it was more like a crem than a lotion and i still have the ones i bought from VS when they did have it and it no where near smelled the same. I couldn&#x27;t really smell it at all and I know all of the beauty rush collections were extremely strong.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and works great! Non greasy and feels great! Victoria&#x27; Secret needs to bring this one back, men everywhere think this smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i wanted. The only problem i had was on the bottles the price is only $12. I kinda feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this everywhere even in the store and they do not carry it anymore!  this is the only one I can wear</li>
            <li> An all time favorite for a reason.... The scent of Candy Baby is truly delicious. It is a bit like cotton candy and vanilla icing together making it a comforting, feminine, sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive so I could get it more often. I used to get it at victoria secret for 3/$25.00</li>
