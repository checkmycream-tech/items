            <li>would like other colors more than this</li>
            <li>Although I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have no trouble using any of these eye shadows-none of them sting or make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>when I got this in the mail, i was very upset, since this was not what I ordered, instead I got different shades of color</li>

            <li> I generally stick to base colors (browns, tans, grey, and black) and this trio is one of my favorites and a staple in my make-up bag. The shades in the one I purchased-and the one pictured (I think) are Chocolate Chip-Stay Matte (definer), Buttered Bonze (single shade-contour) and Teddy Bear (single shade-base) I rarely use the pink/brown contour color, but I use the base and definer almost every time I wear make up. My skin is pale enough to use the base all around my eyes-including beneath my eyes to cover dark circles, and in the corners near the bridge of my nose to make my eyes look bigger. The defining brush is small-but works great with the dark definer.  None of the shads are a really shimmery eye shadow, which is excellent for me (I prefer matte)-the Buttered Bronze is not a true matte with hints of shimmer in it.

Although I have sensitive eyes I have no trouble using any of these eye shadows-none of them sting or make my eyes water.

Plums and mauves have always looked nice with my complexion and these are perfect! I use clinique&#x27;s 3 step system for acne and Perfectly Real foundation and I found this blush and eyeshadow to the be the perfect complement to those. Thanks, Amazon for the amazing bargain!</li>

            <li> I have used the Clinique brand before and I have never been let down. The colors seem to stay on longer than other brands.</li>

            <li> Love this product. You have a blush, lilac eyeshadow and a gray shadow.  This one is a keeper&lt;br /&gt;and the price was reasonable. Great for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> when I got this in the mail, i was very upset, since this was not what I ordered, instead I got different shades of color, not what I was looking for at all</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in a paper towel and was not sealed in anyway. Made me worry it was used or tampered with.</li>
