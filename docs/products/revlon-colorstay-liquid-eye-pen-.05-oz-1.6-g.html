            <li>This is my favorite liquid eye pen</li>

            <li>I will be keeping my eyes peeled for a better liner in the coming days.</li>
            <li>I thought because it was a pen and because it was pretty pricey, it would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>this felt tip liquid liner thinking it would be nice and bold and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I always have used this eyeliner its amazing just the way it just glides on like normal cream liner is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product , easy to apply, stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A fine pen, I guess, for beginners</li>
            <li>Its watery and so light in color</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this pen.</li>
            <li>I was excited about purchasing</li>
            <li>the original item was replaced with a maybelline liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product..</li>
            <li>It glided on so easily for the first month, and didn&#x27;t smudge, and stayed all day.</li>
            <li>Other revlon liners like their liquid liners are GREAT.</li>
            <li>But it only lasts for two weeks at best with daily use.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The color was rarely</li>
            <li>I shelled a little more money on this than I normally would for eyeliner, after hearing good things about this liquid eye pen.  </li>
            <li>It also smelled very much like a permanent marker.  </li>
            <li>I really love the low price</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-I used this product the first day that I bought it, and already the color was applied in a color that was faded grayish, as if it was already half-out of product.</li>
            <li>it only if you&#x27;re okay with a faded color&lt;</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product (it was my first liquid liner)</li>
            <li>The only redeeming factor about the whole situation was when I called the Revlon help line they offered to send me a refund for it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain much.</li>
            <li>I still think that $16 every month for eye liner is too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what happened</li>
            <li>The item was open and not the right item inside...</li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t look right as the line doesn&#x27;t come out solid.</li>
            <li>you are only following the eyeline, and not adding at all, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, truly black, and stays on without fading</li>
            <li>But then I didn&#x27;t really use it for a month, and when I opened it, it barely worked.</li>
            <li>and I am 100% positive it is not empty or running low because it works on certain surfaces but not the eye.</li>
            <li>Although it took me a few try&#x27;s, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply for a first-timer.</li>
            <li>I was going for the cheapest possible option for my first liquid liner (I&#x27;ve been using pencil) and have learned my lesson that cheaper does not always mean better.</li>
            <li>After two weeks the ink is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>Cannot rate high enough!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to a friend because it does not last as long as it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t really even leave a mark anymore.</li>
            <li>By the time I checked the mirror in the bathroom during lunch, the edges of my winged eye-lining was crumbling and faded, completely ruining the entire look.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br</li>

            <li> the pure black sought after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely be repurchasing this product like times past.</li>
            <li> i use the revlon liquid eye liner before and like it a lot, and last a long time too.</li>
            <li> As a consequence, this blackest of black pen pretty much looks like a failed pencil eyeliner application on me.  </li>
            <li> I buy the blackest black only as I know other shades are normally barely visible or fade away.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy this type of liner again, they dry out and smudge, smear and fade on your eyes they are NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li> The pen was dry from the moment I opened it.  </li>
            <li> but when you tilt it trying to squeeze the last drops the line is getting thick because it is not done with the tip but side of the brush and the line is not solid as you are trying over and over on the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can barely see it unless you press hard and go back and forth over and over which makes precision harder.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I would have been able to get it dark enough to actually show up if I had pressed very hard, but the problem with that is that the tip comes to a very hard point, so it&#x27;s not suitable for use on say, the thinnest skin on the body.  </li>
            <li> got the same from CVS as i was not able to use it as its dry.</li>
            <li> The maybelline, of course, will leave small dark creases on your lids above if you dont check every</li>
            <li> The pen is a felt tip which is very thin and wet but also VERY fast-drying.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner pen seems \\&quot;out of ink\\&quot;, the color is so weak and didn&#x27;t come out enough to complete a line unless i press really hard on the side.</li>
            <li> To enhance its boldness, I apply maybelline&#x27;s ebony black define-a-line pastel over my revlon strokes.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I opened it I only got enough out to put on one eyelid because it dried out so past.</li>
            <li> so   Often, but you can always opt out of the pastel and the liquid pen isnt messy at all.   </li>
            <li> The following day it had completely dried out and this is an expensive liner.</li>
            <li> I have to press extremely hard in order for the ink to come out, which is pretty impossible to do on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I bought this liquid eyeliner pen at a Safeway nearby because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand.  </li>
            <li> There is no special way of making the color dark enough to see. :-(</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> Although the color on the package says &amp;#34;blackest black&amp;#34; it comes out a dull grayish color, which no amount of shaking could amend.  </li>
            <li> All I got were smudges, and not the thick line I was used to...</li>
            <li> Not good..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was worse than the $1.00 one I&#x27;d previously been using.  </li>
            <li> I looked on the Revlon website for their tips and tricks to see if I was maybe applying it wrong, but nope.</li>
            <li> (Although it is actually the worst that I&#x27;ve ever used.)</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sad that an eyeliner doesn&#x27;t work on the eye.</li>
            <li> but it came out disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bad product.  </li>
            <li> so when I found out it came in a pen I rushed out like an idiot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst makeup utensil ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always have used this eyeliner its amazing just the way it just glides on like normal cream liner is amazing. I really love the low price and I will absolutely be repurchasing this product like times past.</li>
            <li> I have been all over the liner-spectrum: crayon, pencil, liquid with wand, etc.  The best liner I have come across is this liquid pen.   Revlon&#x27;s liner stays on the best, and the tip of the pen is perfectly shaped for easy strokes.   I apply it flawlessly every time, and the best part is that it looks the way I intended it to.  I use it without eyeshadow, but it wears well and looks good either way.   To enhance its boldness, I apply maybelline&#x27;s ebony black define-a-line pastel over my revlon strokes.   The maybelline, of course, will leave small dark creases on your lids above if you dont check every so   Often, but you can always opt out of the pastel and the liquid pen isnt messy at all.   It is a million times easier than the liquid wand - I dont know why anyone would choose the wand   Over the pen...its like drawing with a marker!   I most definitely recommend this. I wouldnt if I didnt get so many compliments on my eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this pen. I have a hard time with liquid eyeliner so when I found out it came in a pen I rushed out like an idiot. I paid $9.99 for this product hoping it was something it is not. Its watery and so light in color you can&#x27;t see you have any on. I looked on the Revlon website for their tips and tricks to see if I was maybe applying it wrong, but nope. There is no special way of making the color dark enough to see. :-(</li>
            <li> Best liquid eye liner I&#x27;ve ever used - easy to control and very fine tip.</li>
            <li> Love it. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love it! This eyeliner is just amazing! Easy to use, truly black, and stays on without fading and I do have mixed skin type. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I shelled a little more money on this than I normally would for eyeliner, after hearing good things about this liquid eye pen.  Unfortunately, it was worse than the $1.00 one I&#x27;d previously been using.  Although the color on the package says &amp;#34;blackest black&amp;#34; it comes out a dull grayish color, which no amount of shaking could amend.  Perhaps I would have been able to get it dark enough to actually show up if I had pressed very hard, but the problem with that is that the tip comes to a very hard point, so it&#x27;s not suitable for use on say, the thinnest skin on the body.  The lack of pigmentation made it entirely imprecise, because I had to try to go over my line again and again.  It also smelled very much like a permanent marker.  From what I gather, I&#x27;ve not been the only one with these problems, and it&#x27;s not just that my product was dysfunctional.  It&#x27;s just a bad product.  The only redeeming factor about the whole situation was when I called the Revlon help line they offered to send me a refund for it.</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this felt tip liquid liner thinking it would be nice and bold and easy to apply.  You can barely see it unless you press hard and go back and forth over and over which makes precision harder.  It looks faded gray.  After 15 minutes it had almost totally rubbed off.  Straight to the trash, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I bought this liner and it lasted 30 minutes on my eyes then started to fade,smudge and smear. The following day it had completely dried out and this is an expensive liner. I will NEVER buy this type of liner again, they dry out and smudge, smear and fade on your eyes they are NOT waterproof. Other revlon liners like their liquid liners are GREAT.</li>
            <li> The item was open and not the right item inside... the original item was replaced with a maybelline liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> i use the revlon liquid eye liner before and like it a lot, and last a long time too. I went to the counter and see this eyeliner pen and said maybe give it a try.  The eyeliner pen seems \\&quot;out of ink\\&quot;, the color is so weak and didn&#x27;t come out enough to complete a line unless i press really hard on the side. if i apply it on the eyeline i had to repeat so many times and it still doesn&#x27;t look right as the line doesn&#x27;t come out solid. i finally gave up and threw it away after a week!  it cost  $10 in  the store, $3 more than the liquid eye liner but it came out disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product.. Unfortunately when I opened it I only got enough out to put on one eyelid because it dried out so past. On the plus side my one eyelid looked good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid eye pen and I love how convenient it is for me to buy it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Not good.. Don&#x27;t get it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the same from CVS as i was not able to use it as its dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years now. I never got this one online but in local store for about $7.99 or so. I buy the blackest black only as I know other shades are normally barely visible or fade away. It is a very good product , easy to apply, stays on all day long. Can&#x27;t really complain much. But it only lasts for two weeks at best with daily use. After two weeks the ink is nearly gone. You can still try but when you tilt it trying to squeeze the last drops the line is getting thick because it is not done with the tip but side of the brush and the line is not solid as you are trying over and over on the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;I figured out that I have to buy two at once for each eye and it is good for a month. I still think that $16 every month for eye liner is too much. It should be priced somewhere within $2-3 range  I guess.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-I used this product the first day that I bought it, and already the color was applied in a color that was faded grayish, as if it was already half-out of product. The color was rarely the pure black sought after.&lt;br /&gt;-In addition to this, the color did not stay. By the time I checked the mirror in the bathroom during lunch, the edges of my winged eye-lining was crumbling and faded, completely ruining the entire look.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;-A fine pen, I guess, for beginners&lt;br /&gt;-Use it only if you&#x27;re okay with a faded color&lt;br /&gt;-if you are only following the eyeline, and not adding at all, you should be fine. It&#x27;s not the worst makeup utensil ever. (Although it is actually the worst that I&#x27;ve ever used.)</li>
            <li> I bought this liquid eyeliner pen at a Safeway nearby because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand.  I thought because it was a pen and because it was pretty pricey, it would be a good choice.  I was wrong.  The pen was dry from the moment I opened it.  I have to press extremely hard in order for the ink to come out, which is pretty impossible to do on my eyelids.  As a consequence, this blackest of black pen pretty much looks like a failed pencil eyeliner application on me.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a friend, I have never used liquid eyeliner before out of fear of smudgy raccoon eyes from lack of experience. Although it took me a few try&#x27;s, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to apply for a first-timer. The pen is a felt tip which is very thin and wet but also VERY fast-drying. I wear contacts but the eyeliner stayed on all day, even though I work in a bakery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I did not purchase on Amazon, I will be a repeat buyer of this product. Cannot rate high enough!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product (it was my first liquid liner) I was impressed. It glided on so easily for the first month, and didn&#x27;t smudge, and stayed all day. But then I didn&#x27;t really use it for a month, and when I opened it, it barely worked. All I got were smudges, and not the thick line I was used to...I don&#x27;t really know what happened and I am 100% positive it is not empty or running low because it works on certain surfaces but not the eye. Sad that an eyeliner doesn&#x27;t work on the eye. I was going for the cheapest possible option for my first liquid liner (I&#x27;ve been using pencil) and have learned my lesson that cheaper does not always mean better. I will be keeping my eyes peeled for a better liner in the coming days. I would not recommend this to a friend because it does not last as long as it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t really even leave a mark anymore.</li>
