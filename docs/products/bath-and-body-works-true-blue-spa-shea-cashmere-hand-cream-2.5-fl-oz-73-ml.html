            <li>I love the SHEA product line of hand cream, they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good choice for women who prefer to use scented hand creams over cologne or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I will continue to re-purchase this product for myself and loved ones.</li>

            <li>I love this product and have given some to friends and family who have since started ordering it themselves!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>It smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I have already submitted a review - the gift was appreciated and smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>Of course, this is nice when I&#x27;m driving as it doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky</li>
            <li>so I was delighted I was able to buy it on line.</li>
            <li>Someone at work liked it too and went out and bought some.</li>
            <li>Starts my day out with nice smooth hands and a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>the positive side, the scent of Shea Cashmere Hand Cream is very nice.</li>
            <li>Will buy it again, you will love the fragrance if you like vanilla.</li>
            <li>I Love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>While I love its scent, I&#x27;d be better off with their Signature line hand creams.</li>
            <li>While I love its scent, I&#x27;d be better off with their Signature line hand creams.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>Love this hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>My spouse and I find ourselves arguing over who&#x27;s using more of it.</li>
            <li>You will fall in love with this smell.  </li>
            <li>I payed more and waited longer to receive</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite hand cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered another one for my daughter!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light clean scent which is not overpowering but lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Shea Cashmere Hand Cream features African Shea Butter, known for its excellent moisturizing, as well as Mongolian Cashmere Extract, which imparts a smooth silky feeling on skin.</li>
            <li>A dime to quarter size amount, depending on the day, and my hands are silky, soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily bad, though, as it makes it a bit easier to squeeze from the tube, while still having a nice rich consistency that I look for in a hand cream.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is incredibly moisturizing and lasts a long time, as does the scent.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>In the tube it has a sweet vanilla scent, but when applied to my hands, it smells more rich and nutty.</li>
            <li>I often apply hand cream while I&#x27;m at a stop light while driving and</li>
            <li>I needed something I could use several times a day--something that was moisturizing but non-greasy...as well as great smelling.</li>
            <li>Fantastic buy that leaves you recieving tons of compliments</li>
            <li>The smell is just amazing, you want to eat your own hand, and it is really leave a silky soft touch!  </li>
            <li>all the photos - assuming it was original</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t ex actually right!</li>
            <li>There is no other hand cream which can compare with it, it is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I saw this on display in a Bath &amp; Body Works store as a sample size and figured I would give it a try but never thought I would love it so much.  </li>
            <li>While it still good, it isn&#x27;t the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderfully scented, thick and creamy without being greasy, softens hands for hours on end.</li>
            <li>This is a nice hand cream that left my hands soft and a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really fun scent that is sweet and a bit musky.  </li>
            <li>When looking to purchase the original formula I was looking for the original bottle which was initially displayed on</li>
            <li>Soaks in fast, no greasy feel, just soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle of this hand cream next to the bed to apply right before bed, which leaves a light scent that I can still smell when I wake in the morning.</li>
            <li>also felt it absorbed a bit more quickly than the Signature hand creams, as it takes very little effort to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I have got this as a present for last Christmas and absolutely fall in love with it!</li>
            <li>I felt that all Shea Cashmere Hand Cream really does is make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this hand cream.</li>
            <li>For lack of a better description, I think of cold winter days cuddled up reading a good book with cookies baking in the oven when I smell this.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hand so very much each day, I am a health care professional.  </li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d try the True Blue Shea Cashmere Hand</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but I could see how it might be a bit heavy for some.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>I use the cream everyday and several times a day, which keeps my hands feeling so soft, but not greasy, and I enjoy the light fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li>This and the body lotion are my new number one gift bag items for friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (eczema) and I am allergic to a lot of lotions and soaps.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hands very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on this smell and usually wear it around Christmas time. :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot so use a small amount and if you need more then use it.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of the entire Shea Cashmere line from Bath &amp; Body Works and have reviewed other products from this line on Amazon because I enjoy the products that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to several of my friends and they are also now hooked on True Blue Spa Shea Cashmere Hand Cr√®me.  </li>
            <li>Within about 1 to 2 weeks I was completely hooked.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot of knitting and my hands feel so silky soft and the yarns just glide through my fingers.</li>
            <li>I live in the chilly north, so sometimes, my hands get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying True Blue&#x27;s Glove Me Tender (which is excellent for major moisturizing treatment, but thickly greasy)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and not too heavy, a nice change from some of the more heavily scented Signature hand creams I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It soothes my dry skin and feel like it is really helping heal my hands.</li>
            <li>An hour after application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever.</li>
            <li>2 stars only.er application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever.</li>
            <li>it instantly moisturizes softly and thourghly.</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body works didn&#x27;t always sell this year round, and the original formula for the product is different due to it not being seasonal anymore.</li>
            <li>Despite its high price tag, it&#x27;s a below average product when it comes to healing and protecting my skin.</li>

            <li> The product did take a long time to arrive to its US destination (2 weeks later than predicted), but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a little bit disappointing, as typically I&#x27;d hope for them to bit closer to the top, meaning a higher concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While my skin is not super dry, the harsh, cold winters of Colorado can suck all the moisture out of my skin if I&#x27;m not careful and diligent about using a good hand cream.</li>
            <li> Minor defect.</li>
            <li> I have seriously dry hands and skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I look for hand creams to provide some long term moisturizing as well as healing of dryness and rough skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands from either typing on a keyboard all day, taking notes in class</li>
            <li> I am in a very dry desert environment and this stuff keeps my hands hydrated.</li>
            <li> The scent does last for a few hours as well,</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe how soft it makes my hands, but, somehow, it&#x27;s not greasy in the least!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find it in stores, but I usually order 3 at a time and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of cream and they usually soak in and leave my hands dry and tight or leave a greasy shine to my hands, almost like Crisco.</li>
            <li> However, after digging out my reading glasses, I noted that these two ingredients were a ways down on the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> This thick cream also works well on any dry spots like elbows or knees, and I have even used it on my feet under thick socks when I run out of the coordinating body butter from the same line.</li>
            <li> dimethicone in it makes objects a little slippery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t miss this little luxury!</li>
            <li> I received this as a christmas gift and did not &#x27;love&#x27; the scent to start.  </li>
            <li> I am stuck with it but not satisfied.</li>

            <li> My wife says it is one of the best gifts I ever bought her.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a co-worker who talked about the scent.   I have already submitted a review - the gift was appreciated and smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best hand creams I have ever used. I got it as a gift, so an excellent gift idea too !  Will buy it again, you will love the fragrance if you like vanilla.</li>
            <li> I received this as a christmas gift and did not &#x27;love&#x27; the scent to start.  However, I&#x27;ve used it faithfully every evening for 2 months and I am SOLD!  This is THE BEST body lotion line ever - the cashmere addition to the shea is just decadent and my skin has never been softer in my life I(and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s saying something!).  The scent has grown on me too and I cannot wait until they restock it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands from either typing on a keyboard all day, taking notes in class (I&#x27;m a student), or working on cars in my spare time.  For the longest time I could never find a cream or a lotion that could moisturize my hands without making them greasy.  I saw this on display in a Bath &amp; Body Works store as a sample size and figured I would give it a try but never thought I would love it so much.  Within about 1 to 2 weeks I was completely hooked.  I use the cream everyday and several times a day, which keeps my hands feeling so soft, but not greasy, and I enjoy the light fragrance to it.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to several of my friends and they are also now hooked on True Blue Spa Shea Cashmere Hand Cr√®me.  I&#x27;m now going to start buying the body lotion, shower cream, bubble bath, and anything else they come up with.  This cr√®me works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have got this as a present for last Christmas and absolutely fall in love with it! ( I asked it for this Christmas too)  The smell is just amazing, you want to eat your own hand, and it is really leave a silky soft touch!  Brilliant!</li>
            <li> This product line is awesome!  It smells so wonderful - I get compliments all of the time when I wear the body cream!Thank goodness Bath and Body Works is bringing back the entire line this Fall!</li>
            <li> I Love this hand cream.  Starts my day out with nice smooth hands and a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Shea Cashmere Hand Cream features African Shea Butter, known for its excellent moisturizing, as well as Mongolian Cashmere Extract, which imparts a smooth silky feeling on skin. However, after digging out my reading glasses, I noted that these two ingredients were a ways down on the ingredients list.  This was a little bit disappointing, as typically I&#x27;d hope for them to bit closer to the top, meaning a higher concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the scent of Shea Cashmere Hand Cream is very nice. In the tube it has a sweet vanilla scent, but when applied to my hands, it smells more rich and nutty. It&#x27;s subtle and not too heavy, a nice change from some of the more heavily scented Signature hand creams I&#x27;d been using. The scent does last for a few hours as well, so it&#x27;s a good choice for women who prefer to use scented hand creams over cologne or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Cashmere Hand Cream isn&#x27;t as thick in consistency as the Signature line hand creams. This is not necessarily bad, though, as it makes it a bit easier to squeeze from the tube, while still having a nice rich consistency that I look for in a hand cream. I often apply hand cream while I&#x27;m at a stop light while driving and the last thing I want is a runny hand lotion that gets all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also felt it absorbed a bit more quickly than the Signature hand creams, as it takes very little effort to rub it in. Of course, this is nice when I&#x27;m driving as it doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky and I don&#x27;t worry about my hands being slippery on the steering wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the big issue is its lack of moisturizing. I look for hand creams to provide some long term moisturizing as well as healing of dryness and rough skin. While my skin is not super dry, the harsh, cold winters of Colorado can suck all the moisture out of my skin if I&#x27;m not careful and diligent about using a good hand cream. I felt that all Shea Cashmere Hand Cream really does is make my skin feel smoother. An hour after application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever. Clearly this is not a therapeutic or healing hand cream for those with dry to very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing Shea Cashmere Hand Cream again. Despite its high price tag, it&#x27;s a below average product when it comes to healing and protecting my skin. While I love its scent, I&#x27;d be better off with their Signature line hand creams. 2 stars only.er application my skin, particularly around my knuckles, felt as dry as ever.

            <li> I live in the chilly north, so sometimes, my hands get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying True Blue&#x27;s Glove Me Tender (which is excellent for major moisturizing treatment, but thickly greasy), I thought I&#x27;d try the True Blue Shea Cashmere Hand Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG, I love it! I needed something I could use several times a day--something that was moisturizing but non-greasy...as well as great smelling. This product meets every criteria!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how soft it makes my hands, but, somehow, it&#x27;s not greasy in the least! Even my husband was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the aroma! It&#x27;s a heavenly, comforting sugar-cookie type smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it actually has cashmere extracts in it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. And the Shea Cashmere Foot Cream is great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book</li>
            <li> I was given this cream from an American friend while they were on holiday in Ireland  so I was delighted I was able to buy it on line. There is no other hand cream which can compare with it, it is simply the best. I am so thankful to amazon yet again for their efficiency. Regards liz</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands feeling silky for hours, literally. The fragrance is heaven s(c)ent!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> works great. Smells good. Not greasy. dimethicone in it makes objects a little slippery. Minor defect. close to 5 stars. Someone at work liked it too and went out and bought some.</li>
            <li> This is not the item I wanted. I am stuck with it but not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream. I have seriously dry hands and skin in the winter. I keep a bottle of this stuff in my purse and car at all times. I was lucky enough to get sensitive skin as well. I have had allergies to numerous lotions and this one has never caused a problem. It smells amazing as well. I have been using it for a few years and a little goes a long way. I have tried other brands of cream and they usually soak in and leave my hands dry and tight or leave a greasy shine to my hands, almost like Crisco. This stuff does neither. A dime to quarter size amount, depending on the day, and my hands are silky, soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t ex actually right! But not your fault. I asked a woman in a restaurant what she was wearing and that is what she told me to order. Different people wear smells differently. Not your fault at all. The product is fine. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this hand lotion.  I do a lot of knitting and my hands feel so silky soft and the yarns just glide through my fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this becasue a woman i work with wears it and every time she puts it on I&#x27;m attracted to it.  I love the smell.  So thinking that i bought it, come to find out this is the best lotion you don&#x27;t feel. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy (which sucks in this midwest heat) it instantly moisturizes softly and thourghly. My spouse and I find ourselves arguing over who&#x27;s using more of it. Fantastic buy that leaves you recieving tons of compliments</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! I am in a very dry desert environment and this stuff keeps my hands hydrated. My hands are addicted to this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this hand cream. I am a fan of the entire Shea Cashmere line from Bath &amp; Body Works and have reviewed other products from this line on Amazon because I enjoy the products that much. I keep a bottle of this hand cream next to the bed to apply right before bed, which leaves a light scent that I can still smell when I wake in the morning. This thick cream also works well on any dry spots like elbows or knees, and I have even used it on my feet under thick socks when I run out of the coordinating body butter from the same line. I enjoy the light clean scent which is not overpowering but lasts for a good amount of time. I will continue to re-purchase this product for myself and loved ones. Don&#x27;t miss this little luxury!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hand cream that left my hands soft and a nice scent.  My husband enjoys using it also, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the SHEA product line of hand cream, they are wonderful. Soaks in fast, no greasy feel, just soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I wash my hand so very much each day, I am a health care professional.  This lotion has soothed red, chapped cracking hands.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This a great size to pop into your purse and use throughout the day.  You will fall in love with this smell.  This and the body lotion are my new number one gift bag items for friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used and I have ordered it several times now.  I love this product and have given some to friends and family who have since started ordering it themselves!  Wish I could find it in stores, but I usually order 3 at a time and it lasts a long time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body works didn&#x27;t always sell this year round, and the original formula for the product is different due to it not being seasonal anymore. When looking to purchase the original formula I was looking for the original bottle which was initially displayed on all the photos - assuming it was original I payed more and waited longer to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is not pictured as listed - it is the non-seasonal item. While it still good, it isn&#x27;t the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont buy from this seller again, I could pay pay $18 (for 3 bottles) in store for the product versus $34 here.</li>
            <li> For lack of a better description, I think of cold winter days cuddled up reading a good book with cookies baking in the oven when I smell this.  It&#x27;s a really fun scent that is sweet and a bit musky.  I love the smell, but I could see how it might be a bit heavy for some.  To me it smells like frosting and musk. The lotion itself is incredibly moisturizing and lasts a long time, as does the scent.  I get a lot of compliments on this smell and usually wear it around Christmas time. :)</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this wonderful hand cream for my birthday from a friend! I loved it so much I ordered another one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (eczema) and I am allergic to a lot of lotions and soaps. However, I am not allergic to this one. It soothes my dry skin and feel like it is really helping heal my hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves your hands very soft and silky. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This hand cream smells wonderful and makes your hands feel silky smooth. This is a wonderful product and it is ideal for use in the winter when your hands are very dry or cracked.  It is non-greasy and rubs in thoroughly and my wife loves it.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot so use a small amount and if you need more then use it.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite hand cream and she raves about it to all of her friends.  She recommends it to you as the best hand cream that she has ever used.</li>
            <li> The perfect size for a great product. Wonderfully scented, thick and creamy without being greasy, softens hands for hours on end.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who happened upon it by accident, but didn&#x27;t know where to get it. It&#x27;s very smooth and easily absorbs into the skin. The product did take a long time to arrive to its US destination (2 weeks later than predicted), but I would buy it again.</li>
