            <li>Originally I loved this Groomer.</li>
            <li>As a body shaver, the Mangroomer does a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still torn though, my Norelco QT4014 is so good</li>
            <li>but this is as good as I have ever found.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>It is good quality product, will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I also loved the idea that I could take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also loved the idea that I could take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good shaving time</li>
            <li>(after fully charging it)&lt;br /&gt;- good grip ( won&#x27;t slip of hand easily)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>light touch is best.</li>
            <li>If you can get a good deal on this, I would say it is a buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product over all.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a good groomer-try this</li>
            <li>fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this works well.</li>
            <li>but the end results are good.</li>
            <li>good product, takes a couple of passes to get all the hair.</li>
            <li>I own a product somewhat like this, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>This all-in-one does a good job.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li>It was a good concept but</li>
            <li>When it worked, a good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the whole body-scoring real good results on arms -chest and legs-is as good as or better Philips Bodygroom Pro</li>
            <li>this is the best full body shaver I have found.  </li>
            <li>Excellent personal groomer and best customer service</li>
            <li>Not only a excellent trimmer this company is the BEST!  </li>
            <li>... shaving was very smooth!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this groomer.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li>Great groomer, it has been the best groomer I&#x27;ve got after two unsuccessful experience with Philips, the rest of them broke early</li>
            <li>This company has the most amazing customer service in the world!</li>
            <li>Great easy to use.</li>
            <li>It fits great in your hand and its comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost tempted to just get another one of those to use vs using the Mangroomer, but for someone who wants the ability to trim all over body hair, this is probably going to be your best bet.</li>
            <li>so I bought him his own..</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your prompt response and kind words regarding our customer service.</li>
            <li>I own both</li>
            <li>Also its a nice feature that</li>
            <li>Nice stand to support the product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that takes care of the most stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>I honestly stopped using it because it pulled my hair and nicked me up.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for an effective grooming device if anyone has suggestions.</li>
            <li>It is quite a handy tool.</li>
            <li>and i definitely have to say this company has the best customer service i have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Feel cleaner and the gals liked it .</li>
            <li>Excellent works well all my whole body.  </li>
            <li>This is a good concept and I like the design of it, except it would be really nice if the thing would run longer than 10 minutes on a full battery charge!  </li>
            <li>My husband was very impressed with his new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The new unit operates flawless!</li>
            <li>It is great for those days that you just want to get a quick shave to get yo by and be on your way.</li>
            <li>it is the best body trimmer I have tried so far</li>
            <li>This company is clearly dedicated to providing men everywhere with the best grooming resources I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>By far the best body groomer I have ever boughten.  </li>
            <li>The stand is flimsy at best and just doesn&#x27;t really set anywhere easy and the charge function is with the stand.  </li>
            <li>Purchased April 2014&lt;br /&gt;Everything was great right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>But no matter how great the initial design is, if you under power it, you are never going to be happy.  </li>
            <li>But no matter how great the initial design is, if you under power it, you are never going to be happy.  </li>
            <li>Great product nice having the two in one, It makes things much easier.</li>
            <li>Clean shaving just wonderful product easy to use worth the money</li>
            <li>It looked really good and had cool features</li>
            <li>The easy length adjustments are nice..</li>
            <li>Good for a quick touch up in a pinch, but not as close as a shave.</li>
            <li>Yes it has guards but anyone that has been grooming with any product knows no matter what is advertised you still should take great care in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for shaving private parts :) holds a good charge and comes with a stand that also act as a charger.</li>
            <li>I do find more use from the shaver than from the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Battery is better but the shaver pulls and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking my grooming experience will 10x better than its ever been.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>most were 5 star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their response was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Your satisfaction is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it will not hold a charge for more than 3 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more valuable than ever to me now.</li>
            <li>Its adjustable and removable guard is a nice feature and not flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>the Mangroomer is better than</li>
            <li>the Norelco is better than the Mangroomer at:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I thought it will be better at shaving</li>
            <li>but maybe I need more practice with it for what I need it for</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write to many reviews on amazon, but Mangroomer earned this one.</li>
            <li>Would have been better if they had the option of shaving as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember not to apply pressure - it works like most electric razors, so  </li>
            <li>the overall performance is great and does the job!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with it&#x27;s performance overall and dont have any complaints.</li>
            <li>and I like the mangroomer much better.</li>
            <li>how horribly NOT close it gets.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, spend the extra $20 and get a Norelco Bodygroom-- have been very happy with that, and now I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another one to replace this crappy shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wish it worked better....</li>
            <li>everyone told me I would love it...</li>
            <li>I use this product for excess armpit hair but more so for ear hair.</li>
            <li>This product would get a 5 star if the battery life was better.</li>
            <li>Like many people, I read the 5-star reviews on this product and thought it would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>OK, so I recharged it, fully, overnight</li>
            <li>It does have a nice visible indicator light to let you know when its done charging.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The idea that if no longer have to speed shave is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I sure do.......</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t hurt or anything when using it its just an all-around great item</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have it at the price and the product is top quality.</li>
            <li>the reason for the 4 stars is I whish you could have been able to use it on your face also.  </li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I was able to cut through my thinning hair on my head and everywhere else without issue.  </li>
            <li>The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok does not get as close as I</li>
            <li>Awesome product for grooming the entire body.</li>
            <li>Shaver Design - the shaver / grooming ends at the top of the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more close to 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li>The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This device is just OK.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer Trimmer is perfect for the male looking to shave or trim body hair!  </li>
            <li>My man is a hairy guy, this makes him smooth and cuddly!</li>
            <li>However, you are now dealing with a reputable company,&amp;#34;NORELCO&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>When you try to do more than that, I start to have issues with the battery dying.</li>
            <li>does a good job - overall a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and I learned to use it better .</li>
            <li>but the battery could be better.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer w Power Burst is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>this tool, I can decide the trim level that&#x27;s appropriate without being a fool about it.  </li>
            <li>The thing looks awesome, like it would last some time..</li>
            <li>My $20 Remington does a better job than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The batter won&#x27;t hold a charge any more, and it is more of a hair-ripper now than a shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an honest and fair reviewer and I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>My son in law was very excited to get this for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>On one end, you have a pretty good body groomer.  </li>
            <li>Plus it looks cool which is always a nice perk.</li>
            <li>I loved it when I first used it.</li>
            <li>best purchase in a long time!</li>
            <li>The power burst button is also a great feature and something I now couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>The dual purpose shaver allows for a quick, effective shave.  </li>
            <li>It is nice when you find a trimmer that is super effective and super efficient.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great except for the one incident</li>
            <li>Actually liked first generation design better.</li>
            <li>It is completely adjustable and does a great job regardless of the length or density of body hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a nice power boost button which ALMOST brings the cutter head to a useful speed level, but not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good grip too so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands easily depending on how you&#x27;re contorting to cut certain areas.    </li>
            <li>It was was able to mow right through my hair and leave it the skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Although the power boost button works great, I rarely use it due to the great power this groomer delivers.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great option for men!</li>
            <li>It has the best of all the features offered in other razors.  </li>
            <li>It has been many years since I bought an electric razor, so my assumption, after seeing so many great reviews, is that they have come a long way.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and takes care of all the hair on my body.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and did the job.</li>
            <li>Trying to charge this isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does the job and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The item came very quickly.</li>
            <li>With its two heads (trimmer end and shaver end) one can easily adjust the cut length between 0</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It gets plugged up with hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>2 years now still going strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly suggest purchasing this product for yourself or as a gift for a loved one.</li>
            <li>The trimmer blade zipped right thru the hair - i then got a nice smooth shave with the body groomer blade (the shaver has 2 dual blades).  </li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t use it with water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I had a Phillips Norelco groomer &amp; even that pile included a handle, so I threw the Norelco trimmer in the trash &amp; kept the handle, I just tape this trimmer to that handle &amp; it works fine.  </li>
            <li>First use, the gentle touch was great.</li>
            <li>The clipper function is fine, but for a closer shave this isn&#x27;t up to par.  </li>
            <li>I was more interested in being able to use it in the shower, and the battery life.</li>
            <li>It also works fine for body hair removal</li>
            <li>The man groomer worked fine, but when I needed to charge it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to return it to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And my wife likes my super smooth chest!</li>
            <li>The ManGroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Target has a nice selection of trimmers in the same class, which if they stop working you have a much greater return window!</li>
            <li>I emailed ManGroomer from their website regarding my shaver and luckily the company has a customer service team that goes above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy, and in fact they did just that for me.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Or the hairless man trying to fit in....</li>
            <li>Such a great close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please feel free to contact us at any time with anything additional.</li>
            <li>This Mangroomer looks terrific and has a lot of great features.</li>
            <li>Comes in great packaging and you can tell its a product made to last.</li>
            <li>Great for facial or chest hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Now it won&#x27;t even light up while on the charger....</li>
            <li>The shaver part goes smooth as well as the  trimmer, but the smallest guard setting doesn&#x27;t cut 1/16 of an inch(1.6 mm).</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, the only thing I don&#x27;t like are the button placement.</li>
            <li>A tad cheap in materials/workmanship but</li>
            <li>Everything works great however it does not get close enough to my skin.</li>
            <li>also own the nose and ear trimmer and that also works very well...</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t get it to cut effectively unless it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting which means that I am racing the clock to get my whole head and face done before it</li>
            <li>Acts like a cheap 2 &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery powered shaver that you can get for under $10.00 at the drug store.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly and close without irritation, and it feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>i regret getting rid of my good old trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>groomer is FAR superior on the Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelcos groomer is far superior to the Mangroomers.</li>
            <li>Overall, designed and functions very well; an excellent product!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of important, but the battery really blows on this thing.</li>
            <li>Good product one big thing they don&#x27;t mention is that it is NOT meant for facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t work well for beard grooming or fine touch ups, does its job well on the rest of the body though, great for manscaping, well priced, easy to use, would recommended.</li>
            <li>Worked fine the first week and now the charge lasts for 3 seconds at most.  </li>
            <li>Even more important, for those men who choose to groom themselves in those private areas, the body groomer is designed to allow for an ultra close shave without the fear of nicks or pulls; very important!</li>
            <li>It fits the hand well, charges easily, and does the job quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor.</li>
            <li>collect a lot of hair easily and get clogged quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor.</li>
            <li>Love it, easy to use and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My Mangroomer is 1 year old, i had an old norelco and bought this one because it l looked like good quality and nice design.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be so excited about an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>But as long as you do not use great force</li>
            <li>Glad I got it on a deal, as I don&#x27;t get consistent results with it.</li>
            <li>It works well but for some reason when it take the head out to clean when I go to use it again</li>
            <li>The turbo button is a nice option for those with thicker or more hair, or you are simply in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Clean design and functional design.  </li>
            <li>Other great feature is the ability to use this product in or out of the shower, the first product I have ever encountered with the ability to do so; this allows for easy grooming and easy cleanup afterwards.</li>
            <li>contact Mangroomer  and give them a chance to make it right!</li>
            <li>I LOVE my new MANGROOMER!!  </li>
            <li>Great for not &amp;#34;knicking&amp;#34; yourself like the Norelco would do... especially in the more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I guess it cuts good enough</li>
            <li>Clean up is so quick.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend much in it.</li>
            <li>Cant say any more than that thanks Mangroomer for helping me to keep my bear hair under control.</li>
            <li>pulls badly; not any kind of razor , maybe ok for body but did nothing for long neck hair after a weekend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found / purchased a lot of really cool items for $25 or under.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a quick way to really clean it out, so its annoying.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the guard lengths are true to size</li>
            <li>Good design and functionality overall</li>
            <li>However, that did not appear to be true.</li>
            <li>It pulls hair, the head gets stuck full of hair etc...</li>
            <li>This is not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li>The burst feature is pretty convenient, but again it drains the battery very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for shaving your beard, chest, or any other areas you would use it.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The one end works perfect for trimming long hair EVERYWHERE and the shaver end quickly cuts short hair creating smooth results.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li>did prefer the Mangroomer to the Philips Norelco BG2034/42 3100 Bodygroomer, and I felt that the Mangroomer did a better overall job and handled thicker hair better on the trimmer side.</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t the strongest, (hence 4 stars), but it is adequate for the job.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t keep it on the charger ALL the time it dies quickly.</li>
            <li>Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>I was able to reach most areas of my back.</li>
            <li>5 Stars for the Mangroomer company for quickly sending out a replacement.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it works so much better in high power mode.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending a considerable amount of time looking for a suitable replacement I got the Mangroomer unit.</li>
            <li>but this is alot better then a normal  razor</li>
            <li>overall, i am very satisfied with my product though</li>
            <li>This thing would be much better if it had a longer battery life and the power boost setting were the normal setting.</li>
            <li>, we would greatly appreciate if you could remove or update your Amazon review since the current 2 star review greatly hurts our new products appearance to other customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really works well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Won&#x27;t shave under water as good as dry shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying him another but will read all reviews closely first!  </li>
            <li>Just a heads up, the manual suggest using the trimmer first to get the hair nice and short before using the groomer end to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Battery wears out too fast!!</li>
            <li>Much better then the old way of just doing nothing to trim around ones privates and super hair spots .</li>
            <li>The power burst is very effective and it cuts grooming time in half.</li>
            <li>I say &amp;#34;did&#x27; because I pretty quickly claimed a refund online from Amazon, re-packaged it and then handed it over to the UPS guys for return (which, by the way, was amazingly easy -- thanks Amazon).</li>
            <li>The shaving end of the groomer also provides a really close and smooth cut with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than my old trimmers I was using.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s almost as effective as my razor plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving cream water and cuts (only had one cut on my chest, the size of a pinprick).</li>
            <li>Its worth the money spend.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to guys who want a solid, nicely designed shaver.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has a nice solid feel in your hands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a full body shave so can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does take care of my boys pretty well too when using the shaver head.</li>
            <li>Great shaver that get&#x27;s really close even in the most delicate of places.  </li>
            <li>my 3 yr old Norelco Bodygrommer is 1000% better than this.</li>
            <li>But I feel that the reliability of Norelco is worth the difference.</li>
            <li>Considering its relatively low price I think this groomer offers a great value for the money you spend to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking mostly to keep things under control, not turn myself into an 8 year old.  </li>
            <li>I have not yet attempted to use on my more sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is built well and will work good for people that don&#x27;t mind not getting close to the skin.</li>
            <li>They requested my original receipt and pic of the non-working product, completely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Tends to grab the hairs if it&#x27;s not moved at the right angle.</li>
            <li>It never sat right on the charging stand.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with it, they are going to make it right, regardless of a 60 or 90 day warranty.  </li>
            <li>If you have a problem with it, they are going to make it right, regardless of a 60 or 90 day warranty.  </li>
            <li>Talk about doing the right thing.</li>
            <li>Worked fine at first and was real happy with it, but now it does not cut as close as it did no doubt related to the excessive shaking.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s great on wet and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>At first it.seemed pretty cool product</li>
            <li>They responded in about 1 minute via email explaining they do not sell that particular piece but would send me one regardless free of charge.</li>
            <li>still works great as usual</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd or 4th different groomer I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li>, the battery is kind of a pain because it takes so long to charge.</li>
            <li>so you need to clean it pretty much after each shaving stroke</li>
            <li>Each end of the trimmer has its own power button and you can only turned on one end at a time, which is a smart idea to me.</li>
            <li>The rubber coating kind of catches and holds the trimmed hair if you do it right, making the mess easier to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one they sent will not hold a charge either &amp; problems with the free trimmer they sent out.</li>
            <li>i contacted customer service and literally within 15 minutes i had a response letting them know they would send me a new one for free</li>
            <li>The foil has a larger footprint and is able to cover more area in less time, and does much better doing so.</li>
            <li>- it is super fast and I am done.  </li>
            <li>Previously I followed good practice to use the product until the battery died and unit stopped performing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clipper is okay, not very high speed - even on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t needed to use the power boost very much.</li>
            <li>I noticed it definitely works better dry, when I added water it sort of glides over hair and, honestly, it almost stops working.</li>
            <li>In fact, the very first charge is pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li>I bought one of the original Mangroomers several years ago that was just ok, kinda cheap and fell apart in short order.</li>
            <li>Just sent email off with photo of my MG, Amazon invoice, and a detailed description of the problem with the head excessively vibrating catching hair and tearing it out.</li>
            <li>I shave my chest, stomach and groin and this shaver goes through my body hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>USED MANY DIFFERENT ONES</li>
            <li>Love the different selections and options on this one device.</li>
            <li>I love the different options for trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li>Okay I have just given several reviews for items I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>We look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have to help us serve you better in the future.</li>
            <li>and I get another chance to have Mangroomer, which was my first choice after a lot of research.cutting.  </li>
            <li>and I get another chance to have Mangroomer, which was my first choice after a lot of research.</li>
            <li>Its easier to control the Norelco because the rubber grips are on the sides, where you would most likely be holding the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better ease of use for back and body.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40 for a better product.</li>
            <li>Cut myself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>A shaver designed to shave yoyr intimate areas should not be designed to cut you!</li>
            <li>And there is a bit of noticeable growth if I come back with the razor every two days at the most.</li>
            <li>it works perfectly nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li>The battery will run for 30-45 minutes, more then enough time to do work.</li>
            <li>The last groomer I had was much better than this.  </li>
            <li>At this point it does more to rip the hair from my body than it does to actually trim it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom for a similar device which seems to have much better build quality.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You better watch out for this ultimate groomer and trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Upon receiving the Norelco unit I discovered that it is in many ways the same unit except for the exterior body as the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>After 2 months it wouldn&#x27;t even power on consistently.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe cause it was the first time i used</li>
            <li>I first sent them an email, then they sent me a phone contact.  </li>
            <li>I called, they answered on the first ring and immediately worked with me to remedy the situation.  </li>
            <li>I charged it up the first time around...</li>
            <li>This product I found pretty underwhelming.</li>
            <li>several* hours before being able to use it.</li>
            <li>should have read the reviews first</li>
            <li>I am not going to bother using it at all anymore as it only frustrates me more each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anyone has found another method, such as re-charging after every use to get better results, please comment.</li>
            <li>The first one I got never worked.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the groomer is useful for getting your back easily by yourself.</li>
            <li>It did this very occasionaly right after purchase but all the time now just 3 months after purchase.</li>
            <li>:) The device is reasonably small which makes it fit to one&#x27;s hand nicely and it is easy to shave / trim small areas with it.</li>
            <li>At least the Norelco line had a better motor and has better value.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a few times but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>After about a month of use, it has pretty much died.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as the number of positions is greater than the stated it can be considered as a feature.</li>
            <li>The old adage stays true, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I suggest you don&#x27;t get too excited like and start trimming right away put it on the charger and begin trimming the next day.</li>
            <li>Honest opinion is that Its a good design and good thought behind, It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t follow through how a quality product should.</li>
            <li>The razor just doesnt have enough power without it for even just easy whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>typically only write reviews when the product is superb or not good.</li>
            <li>It constantly pulled at the hairs it was trimming and was easily clogged.  </li>
            <li>you use once a week, you have to charge before almost every use, not worth the hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good design as far as the positioning of the shaver end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product itself is large for groomer.</li>
            <li>it also comes with a large charger.</li>
            <li>Does not work all that way in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s a good product for body builders who are using it generally for cleaning up soft body hair, or trimming tan bikini brief lines, and things like that.</li>
            <li>Feel much cleaner the only downside is finding a place to shave where you can easily pick up the hair .</li>
            <li>When in the charging stand, you can easily tell whether it&#x27;s charging (the light turns red) or whether it&#x27;s fully charge (the light is green).  </li>
            <li>The trimmer itself comes with a brush and a nice little charging stand.</li>
            <li>I had the Unit for 6 months and was very happy with it, had a small problem, contacted the company and they were extremely helpful and accommodating more than I expected</li>
            <li>After much research, my wife bought me this body groomer.</li>
            <li>(I really like Philips Norelco QT4014/42).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A VERY HAIRY  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>And the battery dies extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>All in all I really like it as an alternative to shving with a razor (wouldn&#x27;t trust it around my nuts though)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>no longer have a hairy arse thanks to this</li>
            <li>Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought on a whim to remove some hair that I don&#x27;t really want in areas where the hair causes a chafe  </li>
            <li>This thing will be going in the trash very soon--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to anyone looking for a high performance body groomer!</li>
            <li>And I really don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; to return it after using it.</li>
            <li>OK but not what I expected</li>
            <li>I purchased mine from Target, and man, this thing is a real piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging and design of the trimmer itself is very eye-catching.</li>
            <li>I like using the trimmer a lot because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown hairs as much compared to shaving.</li>
            <li>so if I really like or really dislike a product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer works like a charm, and the adjustible guard is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>when you purchase the groomer, get some extra heads, they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with this company.</li>
            <li>Powered up and was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Flash</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much else...</li>
            <li>I expected it to shave better</li>
            <li>It really works, and well</li>
            <li>I like also the blades: they cut gently.</li>
            <li>; button didn&#x27;t help a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>- After using it again this morning, I have decided I really just don&#x27;t like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>not keep a charge very well at</li>
            <li>Very usefull.</li>
            <li>Very convient and works everywhere man wants to shave literally.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the trimmer much.    </li>
            <li>and I want to throw it away, but I paid too much for that.</li>
            <li>rattles vibrates so much</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe it was released as a real product..</li>
            <li>Fast Shipper</li>
            <li>This groomer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>I do enjoy that this product rarely &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; your skin ... especially in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>When it is working and has a full battery, it does the job fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to actually finish the job.  </li>
            <li>(fortunately I tested in a small area on my chest so it could easily be covered).</li>
            <li>Worked fine the first time I used it, although it did seem to run out of charge quicker than expected  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s nicer and has more options than any other one he&#x27;s had.  </li>
            <li>One other difference is that the Norelco unit is $10.00 more than the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>As a result, we are shipping you a new MANGROOMER® ULTIMATE PRO Body Groomer immediately and completely free of all charges today, plus a FREE MANGROOMER® Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer to show our sincerity.</li>
            <li>The head should be clean  regularly ( hair clogged underneath the trimmer)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dual head provides options to shave clean or trim at seven different lengths.</li>
            <li>it does everything that i need it to, and it is very low maintenance to clean.</li>
            <li>it is very efficient and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;ll go back to the $10 special.</li>
            <li>First off, I purchased this to replace my old Norelco Maverick trimmer.</li>
            <li>Always good to go with a brand that specializes in one area as opposed to a more expensive name brand that manufactures a million different items in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Even though I only used the product about once a week, this was becoming a major annoyance.</li>
            <li>Quick and painlessly after a few short, sweet, emails between myself and their team a new shaver was on the way to me for free.</li>
            <li>I have had other trimmers similar &amp; this one is by far a superior product, expect the head to wear out, so</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the great reviews and used it to trim my body hair and instead of going through my hair smoothly and painlessly, it was painful and felt like it was pulling my hair out.  </li>
            <li>I am not super hairy, but I have never gotten more than 10 minutes of use at one time out of this thing.  </li>
            <li>The two choices of depth of shave was particularly helpful</li>
            <li>As a \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; enthusiast since the days of my first unwanted body hairs and having tried several similar razors and shavers in the past I must say this one is definitely amongst the best.</li>
            <li>In conclusion this product was decent and the customer service does not exist with this company.</li>
            <li>1 star for the the battery not last lasting more than 3 months (would&#x27;t hold a charge).  </li>
            <li>I shave my head to bald and I regularly let my beard grow out and then remove, so I was looking for a shaver that I could just do a rough pass and then follow up with an electric razor to get nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>main problem with this groomer is the battery.</li>
            <li>Also the Mangroomer customer service team is very professional and is very responsive with any questions and or issues regarding their products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I owned the original Norelco Bodygroom a long time ago until I dropped it and bent the foil.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>a high quality unit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I emailed the company about the problem and they sent me an entirely new Man-groomer, shipped free to Israel with no requirement to ship my old one back!</li>
            <li>Better for accuracy and not knicking yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is a little heavier and is of high quality.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against but it worked for me really well, well enough to give it a positive review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mangroomers trimmer is a little better than the Norelcos.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>I suppose if you have a longer beard the trimmer would be useful, but I just leave a stubble beard, which I use a different stubble shaver for.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews and only do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a normal guy</li>
            <li>Additionally, when the charge drops, there&#x27;s pretty much zero warning, and so you could be in the middle of using it, and it dies on you.</li>
            <li>NIMH batteries just don&#x27;t last, so I pretty much consider this thing disposable.</li>
            <li>Since I rarely used that end, this is not a big issue.</li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that they don&#x27;t include a handle so you can easily groom the back.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be need to have the two different tools right at my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>The hair on my chest is rather coarse and the mangroomer cut right through it without any problems.</li>
            <li>It is now down to 10 minutes on a full charge!</li>
            <li>The guard is of a little higher quality overall in design more streamline.</li>
            <li>I may not be the best at oiling the groomer, but I keep it clean and dry when not in use and am mildly disappointed in this performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to give this new one a try</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shopping a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li>I provided my purchase information and pictures of the product, and they are sending me a new unit.  </li>
            <li>Sent out a new unit as well as the nose and ear trimmers.</li>
            <li>that in mind, I forged ahead with the new trimmer.</li>
            <li>he wanted a new razor</li>
            <li>I end up having to buy a new groomer every year or two because the rechargeable batteries stop holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Once I showed them proof of purchase they sent out a new one &amp; a Ear &amp; Nose trimmer for my troubles.</li>
            <li>Even on the turbo boost it still has 1/4 of the speed as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>it was new</li>
            <li>Returning for a new one.</li>
            <li>See if the new one holds.</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>I would like a new charger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve returned the one I have for a new one, will test it and post another review.</li>
            <li>but it could be very useful other men.    </li>
            <li>Battery runs down quickly and the cutter gets plugged too fast.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to move up and down, until it pops off since it doesn&#x27;t have a full loop of plastic for support.&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your time with this POS!</li>
            <li>when I did go to use it, the metal charging contacts on the side of the trimmer were extremely hot and one of them actually burned my hand.  </li>
            <li>First time out of the box (and fully charged) it did not work properly at all.</li>
            <li>My replacement shaver is now doing the same thing as the first one, will not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Shaver to anyone who wants a great product plus a company that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li>I contacted their support team and with days they sent me a new unit while i get to keep the old one.</li>
            <li>the plus side, the cleanup really is nice, when all I have to do is use the included small brush to get big hairs out of it, and then run it under the tap to get rid of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave the Man Groomer a five star rating because it left an immediate positive impression on me.</li>
            <li>Battery power is kind of weak.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for the pubic region, but it works amazingly after charging it overnight after getting it, haven&#x27;t had long enough to judge how long the battery lasts or how long a quick charge would take.</li>
            <li>would certainly recommend the above referenced products.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I have a similar device that serves me well but wanted something a little more purpose built.</li>
            <li>the clean up my throat area below my beard, and there&#x27;s still a slight stubble feeling when I ruby my fingers over the area.</li>
            <li>I have been busy and missed the deadline to return it by  about 9 days.</li>
            <li>By far the #1 groomer for your body.</li>
            <li>This thing seems to run circles around my old philips.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my arms and once on mah pubes and chest.</li>
            <li>My old beater Norelco Bodygroom does have a hypoallergenic foil and never once has it snagged my hairs or nicked or scraped my skin like</li>
            <li>It is completely lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is what made my stomach look like a 13-yr old with acne.</li>
            <li>This has to have 15 year old battery technology in</li>
            <li>Still, this thing acted like a 10 year old product after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The light turned green.  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first because the unit used NiCad batteries, so charge times are insanely long.</li>
            <li>I ordered the body groomer and the professional travel shaver as well, figuring Id go all out.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, only thing not happy with is the charge life, seems very short.</li>
            <li>Works very well for personal areas of men.</li>
            <li>I regret buying this product and overall am really dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>This was suggested to me by a young gal that couldn&#x27;t believe men of my generation didn&#x27;t trim body hair .</li>
            <li>By January it completely would not work.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t charge it completely</li>
            <li>I bought from them again to see if they had fixed their issues</li>
            <li>Very disappointed...after only 4 months!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it takes a good 4 hours to recharge at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The base is nice and makes it look sophisticated on your counter.  </li>
            <li>At regular speed the power is not strong enough to get a good trim, you always have to turn on the red button for power burst.</li>
            <li>When it came in the mail I may have a gotten a little to excited to see how this works out</li>
            <li>Not only this but due to the inconvenience they took the novelty of sending me a nose and ear hair trimmer completely free of charge as well.</li>
            <li>Or at least the light on the shaver unit started flickering instead of on steady when cradled in charger, then stopped lighting up completely.  </li>
            <li>2 times it lasted less than 5 minutes on full charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looks like it must be a generic instruction sheet because it warns you not to get the trimmer wet, even though one of its selling points is that you can clean it under a running tap, or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a useful grooming tool, though the lightweight  nature of the plastic makes me wonder how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>It shipped immediately, I am a big fan of companies that actually support their customers I am now definitely sold and a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>It only goes in one way with the light bar out and power button down .Update</li>
            <li>,&lt;br /&gt;They responded right away replacing the unit and even sending me one of their other items</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and my only complaint is that if you shave too quickly with it, it doesn&#x27;t work right until you turn it off/on.  </li>
            <li>I actually got this as a gift and didn&#x27;t even open the box for a few months ( use a safety razor mostly).</li>
            <li>Obviously they&#x27;re hitting a button and sending preworded responses based upon certain key words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this thing could be used on the face and head, you could pretty much buzz your entire being in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I contacted Mangroomer and in about 10 minutes after I spoke to them, they shipped me a brand new shaver with an extra accessory for my issues at no expense to me.  </li>
            <li>the sent me out a NEW unit 2nd day air!</li>
            <li>I am not a man, but a really hairy Italian female.</li>
            <li>The light went from red to green.  </li>
            <li>In fairness, this is a very well made solid and versatile trimmer that worked well initially.</li>
            <li>When used for a few minutes the charge dissipates to quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as consistent or sharp as a stand alone beard trimmer</li>
            <li>We hope this will make up for this inconvenience and do not worry about sending back the original unit, due that we do not want you to incur any further costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>After I reached that &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; in life I grew an excessive amount of body hair and it became more and more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Not terribly sharp either.</li>
            <li>It is also cool because you can use it in the shower so no clean up is necessary.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the shaver was defective, but the body groomer was amazing.</li>
            <li>groomer has functions designed for both shaving thinner hair close to the skin and trimming thicker hair (not to bare</li>
            <li>The others have been cheap and last only a few months</li>
            <li>It is prone to nicks if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>That thing lasted for 20+ years until it seems a short has developed</li>
            <li>For beard and hair trimming I find myself having to immediately hit the turbo switch, which takes it to a level equal to what my old Maverick trimmer had.</li>
            <li>It barely holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>My original unit came with a weak battery and the light on the unit was supposed to turn green when fully charged which it did not.</li>
            <li>You might cut your balls off with the Mangroomer if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t even have to ship the old one back).</li>
            <li>Trimmer cutting length is good</li>
            <li>Manscaping is now an essential task for the modern man, and no one wants to use the same razor that you do &amp;#34;trimming down below&amp;#34; on their face.</li>
            <li>It seemed to have a similar to feature set to the newest and most expensive Bodygroom but at a much cheaper price which was enough for me to give a go.</li>
            <li>i really like the product and use it every other week to keep my body hair groomed.</li>
            <li>Sent back didn&#x27;t charge very well and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am thinking I might need a 3rd for my poor husband who gets NOTHING :)</li>
            <li>charge: After the first initial charge, the unit seemed a bit underpowered, but I used it anyway, thinking that I needed to run it down and recharge it for it to be at 100%.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one, but after I gave this the full charge the first time before using it, I took it off of the charger and didn&#x27;t use it until a few hours later...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, but it cuts the hairs so close to the skin that if you do it right, from a few feet no one can  tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box this was a giant waste of money.</li>
            <li>Its width of the trimmer area is a little smaller on the Mangroomer but performs just a little better, especially with the help of the turbo button.</li>
            <li>I used the shortest setting and it cut close enough to where  you can barely see the hairs.</li>
            <li>Not long after owning it the battery life began to plunge.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and it sucks for keeping it trimmed.</li>
            <li>and it did the exact same thing, except that it only took 5-6 minutes to run down the charge.</li>
            <li>and I still have to take it down to two for it to trim anything on my beard, and at that point, that level takes off too much.</li>
            <li>Pretty much anything on the trimmer end needs to be on turbo setting and still likely to be bogged down.  </li>
            <li>Other than the initial charge once that indicator light turns green.</li>
            <li>I really like the sleek black and silver look -</li>
            <li>Not super fast</li>
            <li>This item is very convenient to have, but the charge on it is pretty poor.</li>
            <li>Works fine for the most part but it sometimes pulls on the hair making it a little painful.</li>

            <li> For the price I paid on an Amazon deal for $29.99, this is a really great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great concept.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s great for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  </li>
            <li> The charge stand is attractive and keeps it out of the way.</li>

            <li> The reviews on this were great</li>
            <li> The Shaver itself was great, but within 72 hrs of plugging in the charger stopped charging.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> If you want the two or three day beard look, it is great for that.</li>
            <li> This is great for diabetics doing shots to keep hair trimmed .</li>
            <li> a great product and a great customer service team</li>
            <li> So for grooming this works great.</li>

            <li> Great tool for keeping the hedges neat and trimmed.</li>

            <li> More electronic trash!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this body groomer for xmas and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> The power-burst is great for trimming beards, and the choices of grooming heads give some good choices for body-hair.</li>
            <li> This great device cleans me up real nice and it is easy to use!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, the warranty is a wonderful thing the customer service is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> Originally I loved this Groomer.</li>
            <li> As a body shaver, the Mangroomer does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still torn though, my Norelco QT4014 is so good</li>
            <li> but this is as good as I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is good quality product, will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I also loved the idea that I could take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also loved the idea that I could take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good shaving time</li>
            <li> (after fully charging it)&lt;br /&gt;- good grip ( won&#x27;t slip of hand easily)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> light touch is best.</li>
            <li> If you can get a good deal on this, I would say it is a buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product over all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a good groomer-try this</li>
            <li> fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this works well.</li>
            <li> but the end results are good.</li>
            <li> good product, takes a couple of passes to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> I own a product somewhat like this, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> This all-in-one does a good job.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li> It was a good concept but</li>
            <li> When it worked, a good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the whole body-scoring real good results on arms -chest and legs-is as good as or better Philips Bodygroom Pro</li>
            <li> this is the best full body shaver I have found.  </li>
            <li> Excellent personal groomer and best customer service</li>
            <li> Not only a excellent trimmer this company is the BEST!  </li>
            <li> ... shaving was very smooth!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this groomer.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li> Great groomer, it has been the best groomer I&#x27;ve got after two unsuccessful experience with Philips, the rest of them broke early</li>
            <li> This company has the most amazing customer service in the world!</li>
            <li> Great easy to use.</li>
            <li> It fits great in your hand and its comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost tempted to just get another one of those to use vs using the Mangroomer, but for someone who wants the ability to trim all over body hair, this is probably going to be your best bet.</li>
            <li> so I bought him his own..</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your prompt response and kind words regarding our customer service.</li>
            <li> I own both</li>
            <li> Also its a nice feature that</li>
            <li> Nice stand to support the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that takes care of the most stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> I honestly stopped using it because it pulled my hair and nicked me up.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for an effective grooming device if anyone has suggestions.</li>
            <li> It is quite a handy tool.</li>
            <li> and i definitely have to say this company has the best customer service i have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Feel cleaner and the gals liked it .</li>
            <li> Excellent works well all my whole body.  </li>
            <li> This is a good concept and I like the design of it, except it would be really nice if the thing would run longer than 10 minutes on a full battery charge!  </li>
            <li> My husband was very impressed with his new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The new unit operates flawless!</li>
            <li> It is great for those days that you just want to get a quick shave to get yo by and be on your way.</li>
            <li> it is the best body trimmer I have tried so far</li>
            <li> This company is clearly dedicated to providing men everywhere with the best grooming resources I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> By far the best body groomer I have ever boughten.  </li>
            <li> The stand is flimsy at best and just doesn&#x27;t really set anywhere easy and the charge function is with the stand.  </li>
            <li> Purchased April 2014&lt;br /&gt;Everything was great right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> But no matter how great the initial design is, if you under power it, you are never going to be happy.  </li>
            <li> But no matter how great the initial design is, if you under power it, you are never going to be happy.  </li>
            <li> Great product nice having the two in one, It makes things much easier.</li>
            <li> Clean shaving just wonderful product easy to use worth the money</li>
            <li> It looked really good and had cool features</li>
            <li> The easy length adjustments are nice..</li>
            <li> Good for a quick touch up in a pinch, but not as close as a shave.</li>
            <li> Yes it has guards but anyone that has been grooming with any product knows no matter what is advertised you still should take great care in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for shaving private parts :) holds a good charge and comes with a stand that also act as a charger.</li>
            <li> I do find more use from the shaver than from the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Battery is better but the shaver pulls and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking my grooming experience will 10x better than its ever been.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> most were 5 star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their response was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Your satisfaction is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it will not hold a charge for more than 3 days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more valuable than ever to me now.</li>
            <li> Its adjustable and removable guard is a nice feature and not flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> the Mangroomer is better than</li>
            <li> the Norelco is better than the Mangroomer at:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I thought it will be better at shaving</li>
            <li> but maybe I need more practice with it for what I need it for</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write to many reviews on amazon, but Mangroomer earned this one.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if they had the option of shaving as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember not to apply pressure - it works like most electric razors, so  </li>
            <li> the overall performance is great and does the job!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with it&#x27;s performance overall and dont have any complaints.</li>
            <li> and I like the mangroomer much better.</li>
            <li> how horribly NOT close it gets.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, spend the extra $20 and get a Norelco Bodygroom-- have been very happy with that, and now I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another one to replace this crappy shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wish it worked better....</li>
            <li> everyone told me I would love it...</li>
            <li> I use this product for excess armpit hair but more so for ear hair.</li>
            <li> This product would get a 5 star if the battery life was better.</li>
            <li> Like many people, I read the 5-star reviews on this product and thought it would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> OK, so I recharged it, fully, overnight</li>
            <li> It does have a nice visible indicator light to let you know when its done charging.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The idea that if no longer have to speed shave is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I sure do.......</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t hurt or anything when using it its just an all-around great item</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to have it at the price and the product is top quality.</li>
            <li> the reason for the 4 stars is I whish you could have been able to use it on your face also.  </li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I was able to cut through my thinning hair on my head and everywhere else without issue.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok does not get as close as I</li>
            <li> Awesome product for grooming the entire body.</li>
            <li> Shaver Design - the shaver / grooming ends at the top of the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more close to 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li> The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This device is just OK.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer Trimmer is perfect for the male looking to shave or trim body hair!  </li>
            <li> My man is a hairy guy, this makes him smooth and cuddly!</li>
            <li> However, you are now dealing with a reputable company,&amp;#34;NORELCO&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When you try to do more than that, I start to have issues with the battery dying.</li>
            <li> does a good job - overall a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I learned to use it better .</li>
            <li> but the battery could be better.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer w Power Burst is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> this tool, I can decide the trim level that&#x27;s appropriate without being a fool about it.  </li>
            <li> The thing looks awesome, like it would last some time..</li>
            <li> My $20 Remington does a better job than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batter won&#x27;t hold a charge any more, and it is more of a hair-ripper now than a shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an honest and fair reviewer and I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> My son in law was very excited to get this for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> On one end, you have a pretty good body groomer.  </li>
            <li> Plus it looks cool which is always a nice perk.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first used it.</li>
            <li> best purchase in a long time!</li>
            <li> The power burst button is also a great feature and something I now couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> The dual purpose shaver allows for a quick, effective shave.  </li>
            <li> It is nice when you find a trimmer that is super effective and super efficient.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great except for the one incident</li>
            <li> Actually liked first generation design better.</li>
            <li> It is completely adjustable and does a great job regardless of the length or density of body hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a nice power boost button which ALMOST brings the cutter head to a useful speed level, but not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good grip too so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands easily depending on how you&#x27;re contorting to cut certain areas.    </li>
            <li> It was was able to mow right through my hair and leave it the skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although the power boost button works great, I rarely use it due to the great power this groomer delivers.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great option for men!</li>
            <li> It has the best of all the features offered in other razors.  </li>
            <li> It has been many years since I bought an electric razor, so my assumption, after seeing so many great reviews, is that they have come a long way.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and takes care of all the hair on my body.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and did the job.</li>
            <li> Trying to charge this isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does the job and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The item came very quickly.</li>
            <li> With its two heads (trimmer end and shaver end) one can easily adjust the cut length between 0</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gets plugged up with hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> 2 years now still going strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly suggest purchasing this product for yourself or as a gift for a loved one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade zipped right thru the hair - i then got a nice smooth shave with the body groomer blade (the shaver has 2 dual blades).  </li>
            <li> , just don&#x27;t use it with water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips Norelco groomer &amp; even that pile included a handle, so I threw the Norelco trimmer in the trash &amp; kept the handle, I just tape this trimmer to that handle &amp; it works fine.  </li>
            <li> First use, the gentle touch was great.</li>
            <li> The clipper function is fine, but for a closer shave this isn&#x27;t up to par.  </li>
            <li> I was more interested in being able to use it in the shower, and the battery life.</li>
            <li> It also works fine for body hair removal</li>
            <li> The man groomer worked fine, but when I needed to charge it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to return it to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And my wife likes my super smooth chest!</li>
            <li> The ManGroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Target has a nice selection of trimmers in the same class, which if they stop working you have a much greater return window!</li>
            <li> I emailed ManGroomer from their website regarding my shaver and luckily the company has a customer service team that goes above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy, and in fact they did just that for me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Or the hairless man trying to fit in....</li>
            <li> Such a great close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please feel free to contact us at any time with anything additional.</li>
            <li> This Mangroomer looks terrific and has a lot of great features.</li>
            <li> Comes in great packaging and you can tell its a product made to last.</li>
            <li> Great for facial or chest hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Now it won&#x27;t even light up while on the charger....</li>
            <li> The shaver part goes smooth as well as the  trimmer, but the smallest guard setting doesn&#x27;t cut 1/16 of an inch(1.6 mm).</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, the only thing I don&#x27;t like are the button placement.</li>
            <li> A tad cheap in materials/workmanship but</li>
            <li> Everything works great however it does not get close enough to my skin.</li>
            <li> also own the nose and ear trimmer and that also works very well...</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t get it to cut effectively unless it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting which means that I am racing the clock to get my whole head and face done before it</li>
            <li> Acts like a cheap 2 &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery powered shaver that you can get for under $10.00 at the drug store.</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly and close without irritation, and it feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> i regret getting rid of my good old trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> groomer is FAR superior on the Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelcos groomer is far superior to the Mangroomers.</li>
            <li> Overall, designed and functions very well; an excellent product!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of important, but the battery really blows on this thing.</li>
            <li> Good product one big thing they don&#x27;t mention is that it is NOT meant for facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t work well for beard grooming or fine touch ups, does its job well on the rest of the body though, great for manscaping, well priced, easy to use, would recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first week and now the charge lasts for 3 seconds at most.  </li>
            <li> Even more important, for those men who choose to groom themselves in those private areas, the body groomer is designed to allow for an ultra close shave without the fear of nicks or pulls; very important!</li>
            <li> It fits the hand well, charges easily, and does the job quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor.</li>
            <li> collect a lot of hair easily and get clogged quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My Mangroomer is 1 year old, i had an old norelco and bought this one because it l looked like good quality and nice design.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be so excited about an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> But as long as you do not use great force</li>
            <li> Glad I got it on a deal, as I don&#x27;t get consistent results with it.</li>
            <li> It works well but for some reason when it take the head out to clean when I go to use it again</li>
            <li> The turbo button is a nice option for those with thicker or more hair, or you are simply in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Clean design and functional design.  </li>
            <li> Other great feature is the ability to use this product in or out of the shower, the first product I have ever encountered with the ability to do so; this allows for easy grooming and easy cleanup afterwards.</li>
            <li> contact Mangroomer  and give them a chance to make it right!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new MANGROOMER!!  </li>
            <li> Great for not &amp;#34;knicking&amp;#34; yourself like the Norelco would do... especially in the more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I guess it cuts good enough</li>
            <li> Clean up is so quick.  </li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend much in it.</li>
            <li> Cant say any more than that thanks Mangroomer for helping me to keep my bear hair under control.</li>
            <li> pulls badly; not any kind of razor , maybe ok for body but did nothing for long neck hair after a weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found / purchased a lot of really cool items for $25 or under.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a quick way to really clean it out, so its annoying.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the guard lengths are true to size</li>
            <li> Good design and functionality overall</li>
            <li> However, that did not appear to be true.</li>
            <li> It pulls hair, the head gets stuck full of hair etc...</li>
            <li> This is not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li> The burst feature is pretty convenient, but again it drains the battery very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving your beard, chest, or any other areas you would use it.</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The one end works perfect for trimming long hair EVERYWHERE and the shaver end quickly cuts short hair creating smooth results.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> did prefer the Mangroomer to the Philips Norelco BG2034/42 3100 Bodygroomer, and I felt that the Mangroomer did a better overall job and handled thicker hair better on the trimmer side.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t the strongest, (hence 4 stars), but it is adequate for the job.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t keep it on the charger ALL the time it dies quickly.</li>
            <li> Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I was able to reach most areas of my back.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for the Mangroomer company for quickly sending out a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it works so much better in high power mode.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending a considerable amount of time looking for a suitable replacement I got the Mangroomer unit.</li>
            <li> but this is alot better then a normal  razor</li>
            <li> overall, i am very satisfied with my product though</li>
            <li> This thing would be much better if it had a longer battery life and the power boost setting were the normal setting.</li>
            <li> , we would greatly appreciate if you could remove or update your Amazon review since the current 2 star review greatly hurts our new products appearance to other customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Won&#x27;t shave under water as good as dry shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying him another but will read all reviews closely first!  </li>
            <li> Just a heads up, the manual suggest using the trimmer first to get the hair nice and short before using the groomer end to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Battery wears out too fast!!</li>
            <li> Much better then the old way of just doing nothing to trim around ones privates and super hair spots .</li>
            <li> The power burst is very effective and it cuts grooming time in half.</li>
            <li> I say &amp;#34;did&#x27; because I pretty quickly claimed a refund online from Amazon, re-packaged it and then handed it over to the UPS guys for return (which, by the way, was amazingly easy -- thanks Amazon).</li>
            <li> The shaving end of the groomer also provides a really close and smooth cut with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than my old trimmers I was using.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost as effective as my razor plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving cream water and cuts (only had one cut on my chest, the size of a pinprick).</li>
            <li> Its worth the money spend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to guys who want a solid, nicely designed shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has a nice solid feel in your hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a full body shave so can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does take care of my boys pretty well too when using the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Great shaver that get&#x27;s really close even in the most delicate of places.  </li>
            <li> my 3 yr old Norelco Bodygrommer is 1000% better than this.</li>
            <li> But I feel that the reliability of Norelco is worth the difference.</li>
            <li> Considering its relatively low price I think this groomer offers a great value for the money you spend to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking mostly to keep things under control, not turn myself into an 8 year old.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet attempted to use on my more sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is built well and will work good for people that don&#x27;t mind not getting close to the skin.</li>
            <li> They requested my original receipt and pic of the non-working product, completely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Tends to grab the hairs if it&#x27;s not moved at the right angle.</li>
            <li> It never sat right on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with it, they are going to make it right, regardless of a 60 or 90 day warranty.  </li>
            <li> If you have a problem with it, they are going to make it right, regardless of a 60 or 90 day warranty.  </li>
            <li> Talk about doing the right thing.</li>
            <li> Worked fine at first and was real happy with it, but now it does not cut as close as it did no doubt related to the excessive shaking.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great on wet and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> At first it.seemed pretty cool product</li>
            <li> They responded in about 1 minute via email explaining they do not sell that particular piece but would send me one regardless free of charge.</li>
            <li> still works great as usual</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th different groomer I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li> , the battery is kind of a pain because it takes so long to charge.</li>
            <li> so you need to clean it pretty much after each shaving stroke</li>
            <li> Each end of the trimmer has its own power button and you can only turned on one end at a time, which is a smart idea to me.</li>
            <li> The rubber coating kind of catches and holds the trimmed hair if you do it right, making the mess easier to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one they sent will not hold a charge either &amp; problems with the free trimmer they sent out.</li>
            <li> i contacted customer service and literally within 15 minutes i had a response letting them know they would send me a new one for free</li>
            <li> The foil has a larger footprint and is able to cover more area in less time, and does much better doing so.</li>
            <li> - it is super fast and I am done.  </li>
            <li> Previously I followed good practice to use the product until the battery died and unit stopped performing...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clipper is okay, not very high speed - even on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t needed to use the power boost very much.</li>
            <li> I noticed it definitely works better dry, when I added water it sort of glides over hair and, honestly, it almost stops working.</li>
            <li> In fact, the very first charge is pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the original Mangroomers several years ago that was just ok, kinda cheap and fell apart in short order.</li>
            <li> Just sent email off with photo of my MG, Amazon invoice, and a detailed description of the problem with the head excessively vibrating catching hair and tearing it out.</li>
            <li> I shave my chest, stomach and groin and this shaver goes through my body hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> USED MANY DIFFERENT ONES</li>
            <li> Love the different selections and options on this one device.</li>
            <li> I love the different options for trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li> Okay I have just given several reviews for items I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have to help us serve you better in the future.</li>
            <li> and I get another chance to have Mangroomer, which was my first choice after a lot of research.cutting.  </li>
            <li> and I get another chance to have Mangroomer, which was my first choice after a lot of research.</li>
            <li> Its easier to control the Norelco because the rubber grips are on the sides, where you would most likely be holding the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better ease of use for back and body.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40 for a better product.</li>
            <li> Cut myself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> A shaver designed to shave yoyr intimate areas should not be designed to cut you!</li>
            <li> And there is a bit of noticeable growth if I come back with the razor every two days at the most.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li> The battery will run for 30-45 minutes, more then enough time to do work.</li>
            <li> The last groomer I had was much better than this.  </li>
            <li> At this point it does more to rip the hair from my body than it does to actually trim it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom for a similar device which seems to have much better build quality.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> You better watch out for this ultimate groomer and trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving the Norelco unit I discovered that it is in many ways the same unit except for the exterior body as the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> After 2 months it wouldn&#x27;t even power on consistently.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe cause it was the first time i used</li>
            <li> I first sent them an email, then they sent me a phone contact.  </li>
            <li> I called, they answered on the first ring and immediately worked with me to remedy the situation.  </li>
            <li> I charged it up the first time around...</li>
            <li> This product I found pretty underwhelming.</li>
            <li> several* hours before being able to use it.</li>
            <li> should have read the reviews first</li>
            <li> I am not going to bother using it at all anymore as it only frustrates me more each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anyone has found another method, such as re-charging after every use to get better results, please comment.</li>
            <li> The first one I got never worked.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the groomer is useful for getting your back easily by yourself.</li>
            <li> It did this very occasionaly right after purchase but all the time now just 3 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> :) The device is reasonably small which makes it fit to one&#x27;s hand nicely and it is easy to shave / trim small areas with it.</li>
            <li> At least the Norelco line had a better motor and has better value.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> After about a month of use, it has pretty much died.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as the number of positions is greater than the stated it can be considered as a feature.</li>
            <li> The old adage stays true, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I suggest you don&#x27;t get too excited like and start trimming right away put it on the charger and begin trimming the next day.</li>
            <li> Honest opinion is that Its a good design and good thought behind, It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t follow through how a quality product should.</li>
            <li> The razor just doesnt have enough power without it for even just easy whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> typically only write reviews when the product is superb or not good.</li>
            <li> It constantly pulled at the hairs it was trimming and was easily clogged.  </li>
            <li> you use once a week, you have to charge before almost every use, not worth the hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good design as far as the positioning of the shaver end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product itself is large for groomer.</li>
            <li> it also comes with a large charger.</li>
            <li> Does not work all that way in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s a good product for body builders who are using it generally for cleaning up soft body hair, or trimming tan bikini brief lines, and things like that.</li>
            <li> Feel much cleaner the only downside is finding a place to shave where you can easily pick up the hair .</li>
            <li> When in the charging stand, you can easily tell whether it&#x27;s charging (the light turns red) or whether it&#x27;s fully charge (the light is green).  </li>
            <li> The trimmer itself comes with a brush and a nice little charging stand.</li>
            <li> I had the Unit for 6 months and was very happy with it, had a small problem, contacted the company and they were extremely helpful and accommodating more than I expected</li>
            <li> After much research, my wife bought me this body groomer.</li>
            <li> (I really like Philips Norelco QT4014/42).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A VERY HAIRY  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> And the battery dies extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> All in all I really like it as an alternative to shving with a razor (wouldn&#x27;t trust it around my nuts though)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> no longer have a hairy arse thanks to this</li>
            <li> Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought on a whim to remove some hair that I don&#x27;t really want in areas where the hair causes a chafe  </li>
            <li> This thing will be going in the trash very soon--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone looking for a high performance body groomer!</li>
            <li> And I really don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; to return it after using it.</li>
            <li> OK but not what I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from Target, and man, this thing is a real piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging and design of the trimmer itself is very eye-catching.</li>
            <li> I like using the trimmer a lot because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown hairs as much compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> so if I really like or really dislike a product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer works like a charm, and the adjustible guard is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> when you purchase the groomer, get some extra heads, they are cheap.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with this company.</li>
            <li> Powered up and was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Flash</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much else...</li>
            <li> I expected it to shave better</li>
            <li> It really works, and well</li>
            <li> I like also the blades: they cut gently.</li>
            <li> ; button didn&#x27;t help a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> - After using it again this morning, I have decided I really just don&#x27;t like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> not keep a charge very well at</li>
            <li> Very usefull.</li>
            <li> Very convient and works everywhere man wants to shave literally.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the trimmer much.    </li>
            <li> and I want to throw it away, but I paid too much for that.</li>
            <li> rattles vibrates so much</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe it was released as a real product..</li>
            <li> Fast Shipper</li>
            <li> This groomer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> I do enjoy that this product rarely &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; your skin ... especially in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> When it is working and has a full battery, it does the job fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to actually finish the job.  </li>
            <li> (fortunately I tested in a small area on my chest so it could easily be covered).</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first time I used it, although it did seem to run out of charge quicker than expected  </li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s nicer and has more options than any other one he&#x27;s had.  </li>
            <li> One other difference is that the Norelco unit is $10.00 more than the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> As a result, we are shipping you a new MANGROOMER® ULTIMATE PRO Body Groomer immediately and completely free of all charges today, plus a FREE MANGROOMER® Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer to show our sincerity.</li>
            <li> The head should be clean  regularly ( hair clogged underneath the trimmer)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dual head provides options to shave clean or trim at seven different lengths.</li>
            <li> it does everything that i need it to, and it is very low maintenance to clean.</li>
            <li> it is very efficient and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;ll go back to the $10 special.</li>
            <li> First off, I purchased this to replace my old Norelco Maverick trimmer.</li>
            <li> Always good to go with a brand that specializes in one area as opposed to a more expensive name brand that manufactures a million different items in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Even though I only used the product about once a week, this was becoming a major annoyance.</li>
            <li> Quick and painlessly after a few short, sweet, emails between myself and their team a new shaver was on the way to me for free.</li>
            <li> I have had other trimmers similar &amp; this one is by far a superior product, expect the head to wear out, so</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the great reviews and used it to trim my body hair and instead of going through my hair smoothly and painlessly, it was painful and felt like it was pulling my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I am not super hairy, but I have never gotten more than 10 minutes of use at one time out of this thing.  </li>
            <li> The two choices of depth of shave was particularly helpful</li>
            <li> As a \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; enthusiast since the days of my first unwanted body hairs and having tried several similar razors and shavers in the past I must say this one is definitely amongst the best.</li>
            <li> In conclusion this product was decent and the customer service does not exist with this company.</li>
            <li> 1 star for the the battery not last lasting more than 3 months (would&#x27;t hold a charge).  </li>
            <li> I shave my head to bald and I regularly let my beard grow out and then remove, so I was looking for a shaver that I could just do a rough pass and then follow up with an electric razor to get nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> main problem with this groomer is the battery.</li>
            <li> Also the Mangroomer customer service team is very professional and is very responsive with any questions and or issues regarding their products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I owned the original Norelco Bodygroom a long time ago until I dropped it and bent the foil.</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> a high quality unit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I emailed the company about the problem and they sent me an entirely new Man-groomer, shipped free to Israel with no requirement to ship my old one back!</li>
            <li> Better for accuracy and not knicking yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is a little heavier and is of high quality.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against but it worked for me really well, well enough to give it a positive review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mangroomers trimmer is a little better than the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I suppose if you have a longer beard the trimmer would be useful, but I just leave a stubble beard, which I use a different stubble shaver for.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews and only do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a normal guy</li>
            <li> Additionally, when the charge drops, there&#x27;s pretty much zero warning, and so you could be in the middle of using it, and it dies on you.</li>
            <li> NIMH batteries just don&#x27;t last, so I pretty much consider this thing disposable.</li>
            <li> Since I rarely used that end, this is not a big issue.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that they don&#x27;t include a handle so you can easily groom the back.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be need to have the two different tools right at my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> The hair on my chest is rather coarse and the mangroomer cut right through it without any problems.</li>
            <li> It is now down to 10 minutes on a full charge!</li>
            <li> The guard is of a little higher quality overall in design more streamline.</li>
            <li> I may not be the best at oiling the groomer, but I keep it clean and dry when not in use and am mildly disappointed in this performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to give this new one a try</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shopping a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li> I provided my purchase information and pictures of the product, and they are sending me a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Sent out a new unit as well as the nose and ear trimmers.</li>
            <li> that in mind, I forged ahead with the new trimmer.</li>
            <li> he wanted a new razor</li>
            <li> I end up having to buy a new groomer every year or two because the rechargeable batteries stop holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Once I showed them proof of purchase they sent out a new one &amp; a Ear &amp; Nose trimmer for my troubles.</li>
            <li> Even on the turbo boost it still has 1/4 of the speed as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> it was new</li>
            <li> Returning for a new one.</li>
            <li> See if the new one holds.</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> I would like a new charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve returned the one I have for a new one, will test it and post another review.</li>
            <li> but it could be very useful other men.    </li>
            <li> Battery runs down quickly and the cutter gets plugged too fast.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to move up and down, until it pops off since it doesn&#x27;t have a full loop of plastic for support.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your time with this POS!</li>
            <li> when I did go to use it, the metal charging contacts on the side of the trimmer were extremely hot and one of them actually burned my hand.  </li>
            <li> First time out of the box (and fully charged) it did not work properly at all.</li>
            <li> My replacement shaver is now doing the same thing as the first one, will not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Shaver to anyone who wants a great product plus a company that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> I contacted their support team and with days they sent me a new unit while i get to keep the old one.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the cleanup really is nice, when all I have to do is use the included small brush to get big hairs out of it, and then run it under the tap to get rid of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave the Man Groomer a five star rating because it left an immediate positive impression on me.</li>
            <li> Battery power is kind of weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for the pubic region, but it works amazingly after charging it overnight after getting it, haven&#x27;t had long enough to judge how long the battery lasts or how long a quick charge would take.</li>
            <li> would certainly recommend the above referenced products.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I have a similar device that serves me well but wanted something a little more purpose built.</li>
            <li> the clean up my throat area below my beard, and there&#x27;s still a slight stubble feeling when I ruby my fingers over the area.</li>
            <li> I have been busy and missed the deadline to return it by  about 9 days.</li>
            <li> By far the #1 groomer for your body.</li>
            <li> This thing seems to run circles around my old philips.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my arms and once on mah pubes and chest.</li>
            <li> My old beater Norelco Bodygroom does have a hypoallergenic foil and never once has it snagged my hairs or nicked or scraped my skin like</li>
            <li> It is completely lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is what made my stomach look like a 13-yr old with acne.</li>
            <li> This has to have 15 year old battery technology in</li>
            <li> Still, this thing acted like a 10 year old product after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The light turned green.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first because the unit used NiCad batteries, so charge times are insanely long.</li>
            <li> I ordered the body groomer and the professional travel shaver as well, figuring Id go all out.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, only thing not happy with is the charge life, seems very short.</li>
            <li> Works very well for personal areas of men.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this product and overall am really dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by a young gal that couldn&#x27;t believe men of my generation didn&#x27;t trim body hair .</li>
            <li> By January it completely would not work.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t charge it completely</li>
            <li> I bought from them again to see if they had fixed their issues</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...after only 4 months!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it takes a good 4 hours to recharge at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base is nice and makes it look sophisticated on your counter.  </li>
            <li> At regular speed the power is not strong enough to get a good trim, you always have to turn on the red button for power burst.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail I may have a gotten a little to excited to see how this works out</li>
            <li> Not only this but due to the inconvenience they took the novelty of sending me a nose and ear hair trimmer completely free of charge as well.</li>
            <li> Or at least the light on the shaver unit started flickering instead of on steady when cradled in charger, then stopped lighting up completely.  </li>
            <li> 2 times it lasted less than 5 minutes on full charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks like it must be a generic instruction sheet because it warns you not to get the trimmer wet, even though one of its selling points is that you can clean it under a running tap, or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a useful grooming tool, though the lightweight  nature of the plastic makes me wonder how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> It shipped immediately, I am a big fan of companies that actually support their customers I am now definitely sold and a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It only goes in one way with the light bar out and power button down .Update</li>
            <li> ,&lt;br /&gt;They responded right away replacing the unit and even sending me one of their other items</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and my only complaint is that if you shave too quickly with it, it doesn&#x27;t work right until you turn it off/on.  </li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift and didn&#x27;t even open the box for a few months ( use a safety razor mostly).</li>
            <li> Obviously they&#x27;re hitting a button and sending preworded responses based upon certain key words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this thing could be used on the face and head, you could pretty much buzz your entire being in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I contacted Mangroomer and in about 10 minutes after I spoke to them, they shipped me a brand new shaver with an extra accessory for my issues at no expense to me.  </li>
            <li> the sent me out a NEW unit 2nd day air!</li>
            <li> I am not a man, but a really hairy Italian female.</li>
            <li> The light went from red to green.  </li>
            <li> In fairness, this is a very well made solid and versatile trimmer that worked well initially.</li>
            <li> When used for a few minutes the charge dissipates to quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as consistent or sharp as a stand alone beard trimmer</li>
            <li> We hope this will make up for this inconvenience and do not worry about sending back the original unit, due that we do not want you to incur any further costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> After I reached that &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; in life I grew an excessive amount of body hair and it became more and more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not terribly sharp either.</li>
            <li> It is also cool because you can use it in the shower so no clean up is necessary.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shaver was defective, but the body groomer was amazing.</li>
            <li> groomer has functions designed for both shaving thinner hair close to the skin and trimming thicker hair (not to bare</li>
            <li> The others have been cheap and last only a few months</li>
            <li> It is prone to nicks if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> That thing lasted for 20+ years until it seems a short has developed</li>
            <li> For beard and hair trimming I find myself having to immediately hit the turbo switch, which takes it to a level equal to what my old Maverick trimmer had.</li>
            <li> It barely holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> My original unit came with a weak battery and the light on the unit was supposed to turn green when fully charged which it did not.</li>
            <li> You might cut your balls off with the Mangroomer if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t even have to ship the old one back).</li>
            <li> Trimmer cutting length is good</li>
            <li> Manscaping is now an essential task for the modern man, and no one wants to use the same razor that you do &amp;#34;trimming down below&amp;#34; on their face.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have a similar to feature set to the newest and most expensive Bodygroom but at a much cheaper price which was enough for me to give a go.</li>
            <li> i really like the product and use it every other week to keep my body hair groomed.</li>
            <li> Sent back didn&#x27;t charge very well and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am thinking I might need a 3rd for my poor husband who gets NOTHING :)</li>
            <li> charge: After the first initial charge, the unit seemed a bit underpowered, but I used it anyway, thinking that I needed to run it down and recharge it for it to be at 100%.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one, but after I gave this the full charge the first time before using it, I took it off of the charger and didn&#x27;t use it until a few hours later...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, but it cuts the hairs so close to the skin that if you do it right, from a few feet no one can  tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this was a giant waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its width of the trimmer area is a little smaller on the Mangroomer but performs just a little better, especially with the help of the turbo button.</li>
            <li> I used the shortest setting and it cut close enough to where  you can barely see the hairs.</li>
            <li> Not long after owning it the battery life began to plunge.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and it sucks for keeping it trimmed.</li>
            <li> and it did the exact same thing, except that it only took 5-6 minutes to run down the charge.</li>
            <li> and I still have to take it down to two for it to trim anything on my beard, and at that point, that level takes off too much.</li>
            <li> Pretty much anything on the trimmer end needs to be on turbo setting and still likely to be bogged down.  </li>
            <li> Other than the initial charge once that indicator light turns green.</li>
            <li> I really like the sleek black and silver look -</li>
            <li> Not super fast</li>
            <li> This item is very convenient to have, but the charge on it is pretty poor.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the most part but it sometimes pulls on the hair making it a little painful.</li>
            <li> angle of the head is tilted too far back (all other body shavers have a different angle which works) and your hair gets stuck in there</li>
            <li> Gets closer to the skin than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> IT looks nice but is completely useless!</li>
            <li> The replacement unit was worse than the original.</li>
            <li> So when I purchase something, I usually expect to at least be able to open it from the packaging, and power it on to see if it works.</li>
            <li> There are two small metal knobs on the side that much touch 2 metal plates on the charger.</li>
            <li> One has an adjustable length depending how long or short you want hair to be.</li>
            <li> but It takes forever to charge and when it is charged it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Gotta be REAL careful near the boys....</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless to me, I am back using my old body shavers and regretting buying this!</li>
            <li> So, my beater Norelco Bodygroom will soldier on for a few days until a new replacement arrives from Amazon via Prime.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer worked great for a few months, before developing a bad vibration in the head assembly.</li>
            <li> Only Minus point is that it has not a european powercable plugin.</li>
            <li> The shaver is designed poorly and does not cut the hairs quickly.</li>
            <li> First thing is, the body groomer side is very small.</li>
            <li> Maybe the only issue is that the trimmer comb is somewhat loose.</li>
            <li> It took a few passes at different angles to get all the hair because my hair likes to lay down very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> The end that has the foil on it just sucks really.</li>
            <li> and it is above average as a overall body shaver.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on the charger for too long, it kills the battery life.</li>
            <li> Long battery life is helpful.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as close as a rezor</li>
            <li> I used the bottom level spacer for my armpits, because I don&#x27;t like long armpit hairs</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Acts like the beard trimmer runs in a bind , fast then slow, fast then slow.</li>
            <li> I do not have really thick body hair, but even for me I have to use the power boost setting the whole time</li>
            <li> This product is crap, does not charge properly, breaks easily, and I highly recommend never purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> It is a good groomer... for those hard to reach areas, it is quite difficult to use due to the length of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The old one was broken and I need to find a new to for replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The groomer and also bend slightly to follow the contour of your skin which is helpful for many difficult to shave areas.</li>
            <li> - I had to update this because it seems after using this for about two and a half years it looks like the motor (or possibly the battery?) is starting to give out on me.  </li>
            <li> The product is unuseable in regular cutting mode, putting it into turbo is somewhat better but extreme pulling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work unless your skin is dry, and I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hair you need to have it actually cut, but clearly it&#x27;s not the hair of a deep Italian guy!</li>
            <li> After enjoying it for a few months I found it developed an unpleasant vibration after removing and replacing the shaver head for cleaning, but still worked well.</li>
            <li> We both use it almost daily and just charge one while we use the other.</li>
            <li> trim short bead hair let alone other &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long at all.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace a Norelco BodyGroomer (the second Norelco that bit the dust after only a year with minimal use...don&#x27;t recommend that brand!!!).</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s my main complaint.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really have enough power behind it&lt;</li>
            <li> Anyway, solid product, slow shipping (took 2 weeks), but it was packaged well &amp; the order was complete.</li>
            <li> Very weak even at a full charge.</li>
            <li> Sadly those issues escalated to where my shaver was acting very strangely (low power, then sudden bursts of normal power).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t open and test it right away.  </li>
            <li> The unit can be put inside the charging stand other ways (if put it the wrong way the LED charging light wont lit up)&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I find problems later down the road, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only down side.  </li>
            <li> just take it all down to the low bridge setting .</li>
            <li> unit only has the dull hum of a NiCd battery that is barely charged.  </li>
            <li> WET OR DRY.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and bought a Braun for less money that didn&#x27;t tear out the hair like this thing.</li>
            <li> Then I grew a slick goatee and needed a trimmer so popped it open and starting using it.</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet although I wouldn&#x27;t go dunking it in any water.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer, but the battery life on mine is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> product works but, for me, a little big for my purpose</li>
            <li> Silly arrangement because you can put it in the stand multiple ways, but certainly doable.  </li>
            <li> i went back to using my norelco male groomer, it seemed like the cutter was dull .</li>
            <li> An important point to remember for men: shaving the body hair often produces shaving bumps and they can be medically dangerous as well as unsightly.</li>
            <li> If you leave it off the charger, it&#x27;s dead by the next use.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It trims his rough textured hair without any problems.</li>
            <li> Had it only a few months and the head assembly now shakes a LOT.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected but I kept it anyway .</li>
            <li> Picked up one of these to keep in my second home and thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks with this instead of the Norelco Bodygroom</li>
            <li> but I would still be careful using it on the beans themselves.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t picture Sasquatch in the shower with this thing, it continually jammed with hair and pulled on hair repeatedly.</li>
            <li> used their Customer Service form and received a response a few days later telling me that I could use it for &amp;#34;all</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it now for a few months, and now only the clippper end works.</li>
            <li> Not what expected.</li>
            <li> Felt a few snags at times but nothing pushing the middle button couldn&#x27;t cure .</li>
            <li> However, after a few days of trying to position it properly and wait for it to charge, the razor was still not holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> Now about 4 months later after a few dozen uses the one side of the head does not work any longer .  </li>
            <li> Also it really cleans up messy thick hair (talking about pubic hair)</li>
            <li> I charged it fully, then ran the battery down (which doesn&#x27;t take long).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold enough of a charge to shave much less shave and trim a mustache!  </li>
            <li> Oh and im not a generally hairy guy so for u other slight hair guys dont get this.</li>
            <li> and they have a tendency to nick loose skin, but everyone I&#x27;ve ever had has those same small teeth.</li>
            <li> They apologized for the failure to answer previous emails and offered to send out a new unit at no charge.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is the stand and charge function.  </li>
            <li> Becoming continually frustrated with the Norelco Body Groom I decided to try the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> As written in other reviews, customer service has not responded re: warranty service or replacement.</li>
            <li> On the other end, the trimmer is serviceable.</li>
            <li> Like any other groomer</li>
            <li> I can see this working well for any other purpose, but it was unneeded for me, so I am returning.</li>
            <li> Other Mangroomer products products hold charge..</li>
            <li> On the other you have a trimmer and foil to get close.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut your gonads like the other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> I have found other products, that advertise for nose and ear, to be too noisy and not that great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then you have the groomer (shaving) head on the other end.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile i have other trimmers for my face that I have charged once months ago and its still running.</li>
            <li> So I saw the 50/50 split on reviews but wanted to give it a shot due to my bodygroom pro dying after 4 months and not holding charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil razor end is acceptable, though not stellar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what product these other people are using, but it isn&#x27;t this one.</li>
            <li> One worked, the other one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I guess it looks like the picture?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t return or replace due to a time out on return policy.  </li>
            <li> However you need to buy a small plug adapter which converts between the two different plug shapes.</li>
            <li> but I had to keep my other trimmer for my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other part is it works and it shaved parts of my body with hair that had never been touched in over  50 years .</li>
            <li> However when I do use it it trims where no tool you would use to shave other places should go and cleans me up .</li>
            <li> its weaker than other shavers</li>
            <li> and it becomes extremely</li>
            <li> the other bad thing is how easy it is to get the trimmer backed up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not used everyday so has only been charged a few times.</li>
            <li> 3) Large, difficult to maneuver?</li>
            <li> I shaved with the one end a little rough but doable .</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It really pulls hair, since even on the power burst its very weak</li>
            <li> hair has become less course due to laser hair removal treatments</li>
            <li> After about 8 months of use, I can it&#x27;s starting to dull a bit.</li>
            <li> You have to press a little harder for thin hair, as far as I&#x27;ve noticed anyway.</li>
            <li> I would expect this product to last at least 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Trust me its not worth it or the price..</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it does NOT come with a travel bag of any sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it held a charge longer.</li>
            <li> The battery after fully charged doesn&#x27;t last past a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> but this is not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> I  tried replacing my old Norelco Bodygroom with this one, but no joy.  </li>
            <li> Would be a 5 star, but you need to be real careful with the foil end of the shaver as it has &amp;#34;combs on each side that are prone to scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> The power burst is helpful except that it will run the battery down even faster.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave down like a swimmer</li>
            <li> With adjustable clipper guard it just lays hairs down</li>
            <li> Very frustrating because I really like the groomer....will try to find a replacement charger.</li>
            <li> The shaving head yanks and pulls hair, even previously trimmed ones.  </li>
            <li> It also has a turbo button which kicks up the power to both ends (an odd option for a shaver).</li>
            <li> And of course my charger as already stopped working in less than 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times, each time the charge  is getting less and less.</li>
            <li> I was using a wet/dry Philips previously</li>
            <li> It broke in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months, it holds a charge for less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> After a month of use it worked a lot less efficiently.</li>
            <li> I used less then 4 times, it&#x27;s shot.</li>
            <li> so I thought maybe now I can use it, not a chance it even gets caught on less course and finer-thinner hair..</li>
            <li> The trimmer at the other end seems gimmicky and of little value.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty inconvenient problem for me.</li>
            <li> No good, not enough power to it.</li>
            <li> It can do whatever I need to do below the neck, it can just trim the hair or give me a skin tight shave.</li>
            <li> or you will be the next guy writing a negative review!</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I do believe that if the shave foil gets damaged or off track a little</li>
            <li> Seems a little underpowered</li>
            <li> and I wish the razor side was a little cleaner per pass.</li>
            <li> not drastically so (e.g., adjustable plastic piece feels a little thin/cheap and I always feel the need to use the &amp;#34;power boost&amp;#34; button).</li>
            <li> Works well a little noisy and takes a little time to get a close shave</li>
            <li> I had a brand new one (didn&#x27;t even have to ship back the bad one).  </li>
            <li> Had to go over each area a few times for it to cut all of the hair which took a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Every time I go to use it the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead again.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Dead On Arrival.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product would stay charged for a few minutes and then need to be charged again.</li>
            <li> I wrote in a few days ago about some issues that I was having with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> After using it for few months here is my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this &#x27;sale&#x27; item a few months ago.</li>
            <li> but I have to say don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> and they sent me out two, plus a package of soothing wipes, for my trouble.  </li>
            <li> The only thing it does worse than trim is shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Even if don&#x27;t use it after charging it, when you take it out to use after a while the battery will be completely dead.</li>
            <li> After a few times trimming up, it&#x27;s started to get a bit grabby on the tougher hairs.</li>
            <li> Instead, this product came with a completely dead battery that will take 24 hours (according to the manual) for it to charge.</li>
            <li> There are 3 really key points I&#x27;d like to make about this product and why it is a poor groomer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Bought at the end of October by January it was completely dead.</li>
            <li> Trouble shooting did not work then</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They definitely stand behind theirproducts</li>
            <li> Boy, I am dissapointed to say that they were not accurate.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has the same issues the other unit had.</li>
            <li> The second shaver head is also very pointless, it gets annoying that when using the main head I keep turning that one on by accident due to them being so close together..</li>
            <li> One of the prongs gor the front screen broke off on my fourth use, rendering half the unit useless.</li>
            <li> A few days after shaving I do not feel itchy under the T-shirt (compared to an ordinary, manual shave when I usually feel this itching after a few days).</li>
            <li> not very effective as a face shave.</li>
            <li> The blades were dull making it a little painful at first.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for my social life...</li>
            <li> I had a replacement sent to me by the company, and the replacement was no better.</li>
            <li> no more</li>
            <li> Complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> but I not sure if it&#x27;s just mine</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable physically yes, because it would cause me two sweat profusely during the summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The 2 speed function is pointless, even on the power burst</li>
            <li> I can barely get one use of it before it starts to slow down which is rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> I find the battery life less than adequate,It&#x27;s not good for a mustache or head</li>
            <li> I would try another shaver of similar caliber in the future-but this one is just very poorly designed, its flaws are not something you can get around either.</li>
            <li> so you get a very uneven cut.</li>
            <li> It apparently is not replaceable, so the trimmer becomes useless.</li>
            <li> I will say this-go slow because the shaver head has these small teeth along the edge</li>
            <li> know this stuff is made in China and is pretty much crap from the get go, but come on, at least a year of use would be nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would set it up then it would loose connection and fail to charge.</li>
            <li> junk..noisy, dull.</li>
            <li> The battery life sucks on this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product should at least get to 1 year before it becomes unusable.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this thing negative stars I would.  </li>
            <li> I know to go slow with the trimmer, but even so, the head on this still yanks.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is absolute crap.  </li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY DOWN</li>
            <li> and I am a grower if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> , this is a stinker product due to battery issues.</li>
            <li> Battery life sucks and so weak it pinches hairs and stalls out, stuck to your face.</li>
            <li> the only two bad things are that (like everyone else has said)</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems to be weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my time and money on this!</li>
            <li> He likes it a coordless and he can trim his face but only if it had afull charge... Totally disappointed</li>
            <li> The mangroomers battery life sucks!</li>
            <li> Shape seems a little awkward, at least to me, might be holding wrong though.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.  </li>
            <li> Infact its worse.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I have ever used, it pulls so much and dies within 10 mins.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk-- doesn&#x27;t shave well, pulls hairs out, charges poorly and it a poor design.  </li>
            <li> Its depressing, and honestly a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Hi The man groomer charger I received was broken.</li>
            <li> That leads to part 2 of my poor rating...the customer service.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed shaving mechanism.</li>
            <li> Again I don&#x27;t like cutting to close because in the past my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted well</li>
            <li> and they are so much less painful and easier now .</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed due to the fact that I could never get this one charge.  </li>
            <li> used it on my no no areas and it does keep from cutting you.. but also is hard to even cut the hairs.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> one bad is you have to go slow</li>
            <li> The product is useless to him.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weird guy who likes to remove body hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, battery wouldn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I made the wrong decision, so you can benefit from my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because, it was expensive and I like the design.  </li>
            <li> because, it was expensive and I like the design.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of the hair, but the nicks that are generated may be worse than the chafes!</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately i can not return this because I didnt not use it until 3 weeks after i got it.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Still like it and the battery is hanging in there still taking a charge though the charging stand is difficult to position it in .</li>
            <li> uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced that level of customer service!  </li>
            <li> The safety guard prevents unfortunate incidents.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a number of things wrong with it that make it completely useless to me</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery failed after 6 months use.</li>
            <li> waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER SHAVER, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> It is painful to use and works poorly.</li>
            <li> I had read the negative reviews for this product concerning the difficulty with the positioning of the razor on its charging base, so I knew there might be some effort required to get it situated correctly.  </li>
            <li> That stupid Phillips Norelco sucks !</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bad reviews that you read, truly are correct.</li>
            <li> Then, it&#x27;s pulling the hair out, rather than cutting.  </li>
            <li> cutting head:</li>
            <li> The trimmer is still working and cutting</li>
            <li> /&gt;The adjustable cutting guide is touchy.</li>
            <li> even when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;It stops both when cutting or trimming or just in my hand.</li>
            <li> It pulled and scratched my skin, and was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how bad it pulls and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> This thing is so bad I&#x27;m considering throwing it away rather than returning it.</li>
            <li> I would just shave except I&#x27;m one of those guys that gets bad irritation from shaving the chest or below the belt line.</li>
            <li> My advise is that if you get a bad unit don&#x27;t give up on it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT a hairy person at all and this thing was so bad at shaving.</li>
            <li> Its a cheaper alternative to the Norelco and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a cheaper alternative to the Norelco and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was eager to receive this but have been somewhat disappointed with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I like the shaver</li>
            <li> The trimmer end of the unit is worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate to trash it;</li>
            <li> I hate to trash it;</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Very painful and nerve wracking to use.  </li>
            <li> I am now very frustrated as my unit just  died.</li>
            <li> Could have just been the one I got, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I like the design, but the battery life is terrible.</li>
            <li> but I can never use the thing when I need it because the battery is terrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the worst product I have ever purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer comes sealed in that awful packaging that you need scissors or a box cutter to get through but it also lets you know that no one used it and returned it (hygiene).</li>
            <li> Horrible battery technology.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that it is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I can say this thing is the worst groomer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> stars for both the manufacturer of this terrible product and amazon for pushing it on unsuspecting customers.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer is a horrible product.  </li>
            <li> Probably the worst battery I&#x27;ve come across in all my years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoy using this shaver.  It is easy to use and takes care of all the hair on my body. This company has the most amazing customer service in the world! No kidding. I bought this product while on a trip to the US last May and returned home with it to Israel. After enjoying it for a few months I found it developed an unpleasant vibration after removing and replacing the shaver head for cleaning, but still worked well. I emailed the company about the problem and they sent me an entirely new Man-groomer, shipped free to Israel with no requirement to ship my old one back! Amazing!</li>
            <li> After much research, my wife bought me this body groomer. The battery lasts about 10 minutes, no exaggeration. If you leave it off the charger, it&#x27;s dead by the next use. If you leave it on the charger for too long, it kills the battery life. I didn&#x27;t expect a groomer that I had to constantly worry about and babysit like a child. It doesn&#x27;t matter how well it is built, or how well it is designed, or how well it trims IF IT WONT HOLD A CHARGE!</li>
            <li> Great for shaving private parts :) holds a good charge and comes with a stand that also act as a charger.</li>
            <li> Stopped charging after two days.  Had to go over each area a few times for it to cut all of the hair which took a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for a while and it is above average as a overall body shaver. It won&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it is acceptable. It&#x27;s benefit is  it&#x27;s use in the shower. I do find more use from the shaver than from the trimmer. I suppose if you have a longer beard the trimmer would be useful, but I just leave a stubble beard, which I use a different stubble shaver for. I would recommend this as an overall body shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> Hubby present Hope it works well</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Mangroomer product I have purchased. I have all bases covered with this grooming product along with the back shaver. The quality for this item is terrific! I would definitely purchase from this company again!</li>
            <li> Having the name Mangroomer on a product is an automatic 5 star for me. Great item, does what is should. Removes unwanted fur...</li>
            <li> Does not hold charge.</li>
            <li> I like the design, but the battery life is terrible.</li>
            <li> Tends to grab the hairs if it&#x27;s not moved at the right angle. It works get once you get used to how to work it. The battery life seems to be weak. The battery life sucks on this product</li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t open and test it right away.  I missed my return window.  Every time I go to use it the battery is dead.  I guess it cuts good enough but I can never use the thing when I need it because the battery is terrible.  I can charge it overnight and take it off the charger in the morning then go to use it that evening and it&#x27;s dead again.  This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Norelco version but the battery would always die, so I switched to this one.  Battery is better but the shaver pulls and cuts.  Very painful and nerve wracking to use.  I&#x27;d rather stick with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> After 2 uses, it wouldn&#x27;t charge.  The connection wire broke internally, I took it apart and sodered the wire to the clip.  Still won&#x27;t charge.  Looking at getting a replacement stand costs $20 and I am iffy as to if it would charge even then.</li>
            <li> Originally I loved this Groomer. The battery only lasted 1.5 years. I purchased this item in April of 2014. It never sat right on the charging stand. I would set it up then it would loose connection and fail to charge. This was an issue from the beginning. Now it wont even charge. I would expect this product to last at least 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, the warranty is a wonderful thing the customer service is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> The shaving head yanks and pulls hair, even previously trimmed ones.  I am not a novice with manscaping.  I know to go slow with the trimmer, but even so, the head on this still yanks.  I  tried replacing my old Norelco Bodygroom with this one, but no joy.  I&#x27;m switching back to the Norelco Bodygroom.</li>
            <li> 12/30/2014 - Added a Star to my review, as Mangroomer got in touch with me and is offering to ship a replacement. Just sent email off with photo of my MG, Amazon invoice, and a detailed description of the problem with the head excessively vibrating catching hair and tearing it out. Will post back on what transpires next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer worked great for a few months, before developing a bad vibration in the head assembly. As written in other reviews, customer service has not responded re: warranty service or replacement. Purchased a Norelco for my son instead of another Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> It works well but for some reason when it take the head out to clean when I go to use it again it start pulling ball hairs as opposed to shaving. Hurts a bit lol</li>
            <li> This is a great body groomer!  I shave my chest, stomach and groin and this shaver goes through my body hair like a hot knife through butter.  No pulling or yanking my hairs - the trimmer head follows the curves of your body and I do not have to keep going over and over the same areas - it is super fast and I am done.  I shave in the shower before i turn on the water and then just wash the trimmer off under the shower head.  Clean up is so quick.  I really like the sleek black and silver look - i recommend to anyone looking for a great body trimmer!</li>
            <li> Awesome tool for the hairy man. Or the hairless man trying to fit in....</li>
            <li> Manscaping is now an essential task for the modern man, and no one wants to use the same razor that you do &amp;#34;trimming down below&amp;#34; on their face. That&#x27;s why something like the Mangroomer is a solid option. This two ended groomer has functions designed for both shaving thinner hair close to the skin and trimming thicker hair (not to bare skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer is cordless and waterproof. It also has a turbo button which kicks up the power to both ends (an odd option for a shaver). As a body shaver, the Mangroomer does a good job. It can shave thin hair very close to the skin and the combination of trimmer and micro screen work very well together. On the other end, the trimmer is serviceable. It&#x27;s not as consistent or sharp as a stand alone beard trimmer (I really like Philips Norelco QT4014/42).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did prefer the Mangroomer to the Philips Norelco BG2034/42 3100 Bodygroomer, and I felt that the Mangroomer did a better overall job and handled thicker hair better on the trimmer side. I&#x27;m still torn though, my Norelco QT4014 is so good I&#x27;m almost tempted to just get another one of those to use vs using the Mangroomer, but for someone who wants the ability to trim all over body hair, this is probably going to be your best bet.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly all over the body!</li>
            <li> Gets closer to the skin than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used thus far. And it&#x27;s waterproof to boot!</li>
            <li> great product I recommend it</li>
            <li> Still grabs you with teeth on foiled groomer side!</li>
            <li> SIMPLE TO USE. WET OR DRY. USED MANY DIFFERENT ONES AND ALWAYS CUT MY SKIN. ESPECIALLY DOWN UNDER.&lt;br /&gt;I AM A VERY HAIRY  GUY.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT A 2ND ONE FOR TRAVEL..</li>
            <li> Product arrived on schedule and I am very happy with the mangroomer performance.</li>
            <li> Battery power is kind of weak. Battery runs down quickly and the cutter gets plugged too fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking my grooming experience will 10x better than its ever been. Infact its worse. I cut myself 3 times! (While using correctly) i paid $50 for junk..... And the battery dies extremely fast.  Oh and im not a generally hairy guy so for u other slight hair guys dont get this. Trust me its not worth it or the price..</li>
            <li> My husband was very impressed with his new trimmer.  He says it&#x27;s nicer and has more options than any other one he&#x27;s had.  It trims his rough textured hair without any problems.</li>
            <li> The groomer side doesn&#x27;t work, it pulls your hairs. Only one side works after 4 months.</li>
            <li> A very good body groomer. Haven&#x27;t found the perfect one yet but this is as good as I have ever found. Love the different selections and options on this one device. Definitely a good buy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the original Mangroomers several years ago that was just ok, kinda cheap and fell apart in short order. I decided to give this new one a try and I love it.  Easy to use and really works well.  I love the different options for trimming and shaving.  My major complaint is the stand and charge function.  The stand is flimsy at best and just doesn&#x27;t really set anywhere easy and the charge function is with the stand.  And of course my charger as already stopped working in less than 2 months.  Very frustrating because I really like the groomer....will try to find a replacement charger.</li>
            <li> My son in law was very excited to get this for his birthday.  He used it the day it was delivered to him.  It doesn&#x27;t hold enough of a charge to shave much less shave and trim a mustache!  I have been busy and missed the deadline to return it by  about 9 days. The product is useless to him.  I&#x27;ll be buying him another but will read all reviews closely first!  Not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> It is good quality product, will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use. Plenty of power and performs as advertised. You will like the compact design and quality of construction.</li>
            <li> Such a great close shave with no irritation. By far the #1 groomer for your body. Every guy should have this. DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER SHAVER, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Keep looking. Not worth the money. The trimmer end of the unit is worthless.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have bought as I have 2 boys, My oldest son recieved it for Christmas and my youngest LOVES it so I bought him his own..I am thinking I might need a 3rd for my poor husband who gets NOTHING :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this looking for something that can trim and maintain the private areas. The blades were dull making it a little painful at first. At regular speed the power is not strong enough to get a good trim, you always have to turn on the red button for power burst. The beard trimmer is great and works without a hitch, the shavers need improvement. I would go with another product if possible.</li>
            <li> The shaver does not trim as close as some others. The trimmer at the other end seems gimmicky and of little value.</li>
            <li> Great product as with all ManGroomer products.  Very versatile.</li>
            <li> Like any other groomer but this is the cheaper one compared to the norelco line. The difference I noticed is that if you have course hair then you will be running on turbo the entire time. At least the Norelco line had a better motor and has better value. Plus the comb attachment broke after one drop.</li>
            <li> Okay I have just given several reviews for items I purchased on Amazon. most were 5 star. NOT THIS ONE. DO NOT waste your time with this POS! IT looks nice but is completely useless! I sent it back and bought a Braun for less money that didn&#x27;t tear out the hair like this thing. STAY AWAY FROM THIS or you will be the next guy writing a negative review!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weird guy who likes to remove body hair. This thing seems to run circles around my old philips. the problem i&#x27;ve had with the philips is that the shaving foil always seemed to pop out after about a month exposing the spinners and causing problems. I&#x27;ve had this thing for about a year now and have had no such issue.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, battery wouldn&#x27;t last. My Mangroomer is 1 year old, i had an old norelco and bought this one because it l looked like good quality and nice design. i regret getting rid of my good old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Shopping a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li> The old one was broken and I need to find a new to for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It still works great as usual and I&#x27;m really happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> You may read my prior notes.  However, I noticed others had great luck contacting the manufacturer and getting a satisfactory resolution.  Even though I was beyond the warranty period,  I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their response was overwhelming.  I provided my purchase information and pictures of the product, and they are sending me a new unit.  Here is the response I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your prompt response and kind words regarding our customer service. As a result, we are shipping you a new MANGROOMER® ULTIMATE PRO Body Groomer immediately and completely free of all charges today, plus a FREE MANGROOMER® Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer to show our sincerity. We hope this will make up for this inconvenience and do not worry about sending back the original unit, due that we do not want you to incur any further costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we would greatly appreciate if you could remove or update your Amazon review since the current 2 star review greatly hurts our new products appearance to other customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to contact us at any time with anything additional. We look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have to help us serve you better in the future. Your satisfaction is our top priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Their immediate response and attitude implies that they do believe in their product, and I simply got a defect.  For their response and offer to replace it immediately, I have to give them benefit of the doubt.  I am going to raise my score to a 5.  If I find problems later down the road, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12:46 PM 4/4/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this purchase Dec 4th, 2013.  I have regretted it since January 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a lot of effort into making this selection.  I wanted a quality product that I could rely on.  I made the wrong decision, so you can benefit from my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it will not hold a charge for more than 3 days.  Then, it&#x27;s pulling the hair out, rather than cutting.  If it&#x27;s not fully charged, keep  it away from your tenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design seems so practical.  But no matter how great the initial design is, if you under power it, you are never going to be happy.  The battery is totally unreliable.  I no longer trust it 24 hours  after charging.  I hate to trash it; because, it was expensive and I like the design.  I also loved the idea that I could take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, try and get the extra warranty.  That way you can replace it after 3 or 4 months, when the battery is toasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12:52 PM 4/4/2014&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this product.  If you have a problem with it, they are going to make it right, regardless of a 60 or 90 day warranty.  Contact the company by email and explain your situation.  They did a great service to me and I get another chance to have Mangroomer, which was my first choice after a lot of research.cutting.

            <li> The beard trimmer part doesn&#x27;t do anything. i have another beard trimmer and the clipping number I use on that one didn&#x27;t cut anything on this groomer. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if it weren&#x27;t for being deal of the day.</li>
            <li> buy at amazon or target...this is the best full body shaver I have found.  The others have been cheap and last only a few months</li>
            <li> This trimmer is absolute crap.  I bought it based on the great reviews and used it to trim my body hair and instead of going through my hair smoothly and painlessly, it was painful and felt like it was pulling my hair out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use and fast shipping. I like the power burst speed control button on it. I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> This thing massacres hair. I&#x27;ve only used it for the pubic region, but it works amazingly after charging it overnight after getting it, haven&#x27;t had long enough to judge how long the battery lasts or how long a quick charge would take. Definitely better than my old trimmers I was using. Shape seems a little awkward, at least to me, might be holding wrong though.</li>
            <li> This shaver was as advertised.  Easy to use and did the job. The two choices of depth of shave was particularly helpful</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my arms and once on mah pubes and chest. I noticed it definitely works better dry, when I added water it sort of glides over hair and, honestly, it almost stops working. That being said I don&#x27;t see a problem with that, just don&#x27;t use it with water and you&#x27;ll be fine. Also it really cleans up messy thick hair (talking about pubic hair), it&#x27;s almost as effective as my razor plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving cream water and cuts (only had one cut on my chest, the size of a pinprick). You have to press a little harder for thin hair, as far as I&#x27;ve noticed anyway. All in all I really like it as an alternative to shving with a razor (wouldn&#x27;t trust it around my nuts though), it&#x27;s fast and convenient. Will update as I shave.  :D</li>
            <li> Had it only a few months and the head assembly now shakes a LOT.  Worked fine at first and was real happy with it, but now it does not cut as close as it did no doubt related to the excessive shaking.  It comes with a 2 year warranty so I&#x27;ll see how well they back up their product.</li>
            <li> Trying to charge this isn&#x27;t easy. It also doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long at all. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend much in it.</li>
            <li> This Mangroomer looks terrific and has a lot of great features. I was looking forward to its arrival. Then it arrived! After charging it up overnight, I tried it and ... ouch! OUCH! Maybe I got one with a defective head? So, that&#x27;s my main complaint. Reading through the description again, I see the ad doesn&#x27;t say anything about a hypoallergenic foil head. My old beater Norelco Bodygroom does have a hypoallergenic foil and never once has it snagged my hairs or nicked or scraped my skin like this Mangroomer did. I say &amp;#34;did&#x27; because I pretty quickly claimed a refund online from Amazon, re-packaged it and then handed it over to the UPS guys for return (which, by the way, was amazingly easy -- thanks Amazon). So, my beater Norelco Bodygroom will soldier on for a few days until a new replacement arrives from Amazon via Prime. And I&#x27;ll be keeping the beater as a backup. It&#x27;s more valuable than ever to me now.</li>
            <li> Dead On Arrival.  Device must be placed with two prongs in contact with pickup points on stand.  Silly arrangement because you can put it in the stand multiple ways, but certainly doable.  Mine would not charge, no matter the degree of attention I gave it.  Emailed customer service and they wanted a picture of the unit on the stand, probably because so many people can&#x27;t get the silly system.  Returned to Amazon with no drama, no fuss.</li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money. It is painful to use and works poorly. It literally pulls the hair from you.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I have ever used, it pulls so much and dies within 10 mins. I had a replacement sent to me by the company, and the replacement was no better. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this trimmer, chances are you also were looking at the Norelco. I own both so heres my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a high quality unit. Comes in great packaging and you can tell its a product made to last. It fits great in your hand and its comfortable to use. Its got a rubber coating so it wont slip from your hand as well. The turbo button is a nice option for those with thicker or more hair, or you are simply in a hurry. Its adjustable and removable guard is a nice feature and not flimsy and cheap. Also its a nice feature that its wet/dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Mangroomer is better than the Norelco at:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer section exceeds Norelcos version. Its width of the trimmer area is a little smaller on the Mangroomer but performs just a little better, especially with the help of the turbo button. The guard is of a little higher quality overall in design more streamline. The teeth on the trimmer are smaller. Great for not &amp;#34;knicking&amp;#34; yourself like the Norelco would do... especially in the more sensitive areas. The rubber coating kind of catches and holds the trimmed hair if you do it right, making the mess easier to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Norelco is better than the Mangroomer at:&lt;br /&gt;The groomer is FAR superior on the Norelco. Great for shaving your beard, chest, or any other areas you would use it. The foil has a larger footprint and is able to cover more area in less time, and does much better doing so. The head is also 4-way movable to adjust to contours. Its easier to control the Norelco because the rubber grips are on the sides, where you would most likely be holding the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Norelcos groomer is far superior to the Mangroomers. Great for facial or chest hair.&lt;br /&gt;Mangroomers trimmer is a little better than the Norelcos. Better for accuracy and not knicking yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco is a little heavier and is of high quality. Both about the same size.&lt;br /&gt;Both have battery indication lights and similar charging stands.&lt;br /&gt;Both come with the same items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use the Norelco overall unless I need to use the trimmer, then I use the Mangroomer. Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well. Its a cheaper alternative to the Norelco and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- 7 months later, the head piece no longer functions on the mangroomer. I use it mabye a couple times a month and use a mix between both sides.elco overall unless I need to use the trimmer, then I use the Mangroomer. Overall, the Mangroomer is a great product and does its job well. Its a cheaper alternative to the Norelco and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.  UPDATE- 7 months later, the head piece no longer functions on the mangroomer. I use it mabye a couple times a month and use a mix between both sides.</li>
            <li> Clean design and functional design.  Nice stand to support the product. Haven&#x27;t needed to use the power boost very much.</li>
            <li> i am now completely naked! no more hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have a hairy arse thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Alright Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This does an adequate job, but certainly not exceptional.  It is prone to nicks if you are not careful.  I bought on a whim to remove some hair that I don&#x27;t really want in areas where the hair causes a chafe  (I am a distance runner).  It gets rid of the hair, but the nicks that are generated may be worse than the chafes!</li>
            <li> damn thing doesn&#x27;t charge.... I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for 3 months and already it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge...&lt;br /&gt;Now it won&#x27;t even light up while on the charger.... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it will be better at shaving but maybe I need more practice with it for what I need it for</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband! Just remember to not get into a hurry... it can pull the hair. Well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Supposed to shave pubic hair but still pulled and made my bleed like my current electric shaver, so I am sending it back.  I can see this working well for any other purpose, but it was unneeded for me, so I am returning.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is a good groomer... for those hard to reach areas, it is quite difficult to use due to the length of the trimmer.  But it does its job... I would recommend but just needs to be a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because of its dual functionality. I thought it would be need to have the two different tools right at my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning, I was having problems  with the battery. The product would stay charged for a few minutes and then need to be charged again. Even though I only used the product about once a week, this was becoming a major annoyance. I am now very frustrated as my unit just  died. It does not turn on or even charge. It is completely lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you DON&#x27;T buy this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this after researching grooming products at another website and then decided to check out Amazon reviews, I have used it once and am already a big, big fan. Having the option of a Groomer and Trimmer at either end is a great design if you need to tackle an overgrown pelt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it does NOT come with a travel bag of any sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is a great investment and will also make you say good bye to razor burn!</li>
            <li> I wrote in a few days ago about some issues that I was having with my shaver.  Sadly those issues escalated to where my shaver was acting very strangely (low power, then sudden bursts of normal power).  I contacted Mangroomer and in about 10 minutes after I spoke to them, they shipped me a brand new shaver with an extra accessory for my issues at no expense to me.  I don&#x27;t write to many reviews on amazon, but Mangroomer earned this one.</li>
            <li> Men groomer are awesome  never had apart of body trimmers that cut so close and not leaving any marks on your body must buy another part</li>
            <li> I bought it when it was $40 . After using it for few months here is my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;- good shaving time (after fully charging it)&lt;br /&gt;- good grip ( won&#x27;t slip of hand easily)&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer cutting length is good&lt;br /&gt;- Low noise&lt;br /&gt;Minus:&lt;br /&gt;- The head should be clean  regularly ( hair clogged underneath the trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;- The unit can be put inside the charging stand other ways (if put it the wrong way the LED charging light wont lit up)&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like the pivot moving of the trimmer head&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t shave under water as good as dry shaving</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Pro Body Groomer I received was defective.&lt;br /&gt;It would not stay on and the charger prongs would not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the product back to MAN GROOMER and never received a replacement/refund or any correspondence.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the worst product I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Ken&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta</li>
            <li> Perfect for the whole body-scoring real good results on arms -chest and legs-is as good as or better Philips Bodygroom Pro</li>
            <li> Excellent personal groomer and best customer service I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. I&#x27;d highly suggest purchasing this product for yourself or as a gift for a loved one.</li>
            <li> This is a good concept and I like the design of it, except it would be really nice if the thing would run longer than 10 minutes on a full battery charge!  I am not super hairy, but I have never gotten more than 10 minutes of use at one time out of this thing.  When it is working and has a full battery, it does the job fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to actually finish the job.  The power burst is helpful except that it will run the battery down even faster.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one, but after I gave this the full charge the first time before using it, I took it off of the charger and didn&#x27;t use it until a few hours later...when I did go to use it, the metal charging contacts on the side of the trimmer were extremely hot and one of them actually burned my hand.  This thing will be going in the trash very soon--I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my time and money on this!</li>
            <li> Its worth the money spend. Easy to use. Would have been better if they had the option of shaving as well.</li>
            <li> If this thing could be used on the face and head, you could pretty much buzz your entire being in less than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I run and this thing is great for eliminating hair on the legs, the chest, and anywhere else you don&#x27;t want it. Since the advent of the Dri-Fit running garb, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t do well with a lot of hair under my clothes and this device takes care of that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, but it cuts the hairs so close to the skin that if you do it right, from a few feet no one can  tell the difference. An important point to remember for men: shaving the body hair often produces shaving bumps and they can be medically dangerous as well as unsightly. The Mangroomer eliminates that risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember not to apply pressure - it works like most electric razors, so  light touch is best. Oh! And it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Dry&amp;#34; shaver, so don&#x27;t leap into the shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point: Charge the battery, but do not leave it on the charger - battery life will be diminished if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the double ended design. There are no attachments to swap out. It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> I studied all the reviews of different body groomers before making my choice.  Boy, I am dissapointed to say that they were not accurate.  First thing is, the body groomer side is very small. If you are trying to clip your legs it would take you 45 minutes. But the problem with that is that from my experience, 15 minutes is the max without a recharge. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times, each time the charge  is getting less and less.It is now down to 10 minutes on a full charge! Needless to say it is a piece of junk.  I had another brand for 15 years.The  only reason I brought another one is one of the combs broke. This Mangroomer is no use to me.</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold charge. Other Mangroomer products products hold charge.. Unfortunately i can not return this because I didnt not use it until 3 weeks after i got it. DONT BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected but I kept it anyway . I misunderstood what it was so it&#x27;s my fault for ordering it .</li>
            <li> I got this body groomer for xmas and it is amazing!  I charged it up overnight and and tried it the next day on my hairy chest and stomach.  The trimmer blade zipped right thru the hair - i then got a nice smooth shave with the body groomer blade (the shaver has 2 dual blades).  thank you man groomer!  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a high performance body groomer!</li>
            <li> the overall performance is great and does the job!  it is the best body trimmer I have tried so far... shaving was very smooth! I would recommend this to guys who want a solid, nicely designed shaver.</li>
            <li> Used once, put it to recharge and it just died. Would not start up again.</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift and didn&#x27;t even open the box for a few months ( use a safety razor mostly). Then I grew a slick goatee and needed a trimmer so popped it open and starting using it. I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against but it worked for me really well, well enough to give it a positive review. Close shave without tortuously ripping hairs from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work Mangroomer!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid on an Amazon deal for $29.99, this is a really great trimmer. I am very happy with it&#x27;s performance overall and dont have any complaints. I was using a wet/dry Philips previously and I like the mangroomer much better. If you can get a good deal on this, I would say it is a buy.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great concept.  I should have listened to some of the reviews.  On one end, you have a pretty good body groomer.  I give this a 4 star.  On the other you have a trimmer and foil to get close.  This is what made my stomach look like a 13-yr old with acne. Like an epilady for males.  I can&#x27;t tell you how bad it pulls and how horribly NOT close it gets.  Save your money.  Buy TWO separate devices.  And I really don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; to return it after using it.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad trimmer. A little pricey but it works ok. It doesn&#x27;t cut your gonads like the other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer does what its was designed to do shave your hair with no fuss.  Cant say any more than that thanks Mangroomer for helping me to keep my bear hair under control.</li>
            <li> I am not a man, but a really hairy Italian female. This great device cleans me up real nice and it is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Picked up one of these to keep in my second home and thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks with this instead of the Norelco Bodygroom I already have-- BIG MISTAKE.  This is a piece of junk-- doesn&#x27;t shave well, pulls hairs out, charges poorly and it a poor design.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, spend the extra $20 and get a Norelco Bodygroom-- have been very happy with that, and now I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another one to replace this crappy shaver.  Save yourself the time and headache and go with a Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a useful grooming tool, though the lightweight  nature of the plastic makes me wonder how long it will last.  Still, it&#x27;s great for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> This has to have 15 year old battery technology in it.&lt;br /&gt;If you use once a week, you have to charge before almost every use, not worth the hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good design as far as the positioning of the shaver end.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is okay, not very high speed - even on a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this &#x27;sale&#x27; item a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better ease of use for back and body.</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first week and now the charge lasts for 3 seconds at most.  Sorry but I have to say don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> OK but not what I expected</li>
            <li> This trimmer works exactly as described.  Mine was shipped without the shaver head, so I called customer service and they sent me out two, plus a package of soothing wipes, for my trouble.  Great customer service.  The motor isn&#x27;t the strongest, (hence 4 stars), but it is adequate for the job.</li>
            <li> It is nice when you find a trimmer that is super effective and super efficient.  I LOVE my new MANGROOMER!!  This is the trimmer that I would recommend to anyone wanting to &amp;#34;take care&amp;#34; of that unwanted hair!!</li>
            <li> I wish it worked better....&lt;br /&gt;I wish it held a charge longer...&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was easier to sit on the charger...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad everyone told me I would love it...I guess I&#x27;m just not &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work unless your skin is dry, and I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hair you need to have it actually cut, but clearly it&#x27;s not the hair of a deep Italian guy!</li>
            <li> I use this product for excess armpit hair but more so for ear hair. I have found other products, that advertise for nose and ear, to be too noisy and not that great.&lt;br /&gt;The product works but, for me, a little big for my purpose</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his body grooming needs. He hasn&#x27;t tried it yet in the shower.</li>
            <li> This item is very convenient to have, but the charge on it is pretty poor. I can barely get one use of it before it starts to slow down which is rather disappointing. The burst feature is pretty convenient, but again it drains the battery very quickly. This product would get a 5 star if the battery life was better.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that takes care of the most stubborn hair.  Would be a 5 star, but you need to be real careful with the foil end of the shaver as it has &amp;#34;combs on each side that are prone to scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well.  The power-burst is great for trimming beards, and the choices of grooming heads give some good choices for body-hair. Long battery life is helpful. The charge stand is attractive and keeps it out of the way. The angle of the groomer is useful for getting your back easily by yourself. Excellent groomer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and my only complaint is that if you shave too quickly with it, it doesn&#x27;t work right until you turn it off/on.  Design is wonderful.</li>
            <li> When fully charged the unit does not have enough power to cut hair.  When used for a few minutes the charge dissipates to quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product over all. You get what you paid. I say you go for it.  I wasnt born last night.</li>
            <li> This product seems like it&#x27;s intended to be a practical joke. The only thing it does worse than trim is shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money. This thing is so bad I&#x27;m considering throwing it away rather than returning it.</li>
            <li> It is great for those days that you just want to get a quick shave to get yo by and be on your way. Not nearly as close as a rezor but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> One of the prongs gor the front screen broke off on my fourth use, rendering half the unit useless.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it held a charge longer. Other than that its a great option for men!</li>
            <li> Like many people, I read the 5-star reviews on this product and thought it would be worthwhile. I purchased mine from Target, and man, this thing is a real piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge: After the first initial charge, the unit seemed a bit underpowered, but I used it anyway, thinking that I needed to run it down and recharge it for it to be at 100%. Nope. 10 minutes later, this thing was croaking along. OK, so I recharged it, fully, overnight and it did the exact same thing, except that it only took 5-6 minutes to run down the charge. After about a month of use, it has pretty much died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head: After a month of use and the battery basically dying, the trimming head locked up and is now stuck in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hairy guy. I don&#x27;t use this product but every 4-6 days. Yet, after 5 or 6 uses, it has crapped out. I didn&#x27;t abuse it. I didn&#x27;t drop it. I charged it fully, then ran the battery down (which doesn&#x27;t take long). Still, this thing acted like a 10 year old product after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this stuff is made in China and is pretty much crap from the get go, but come on, at least a year of use would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40 for a better product. The old adage stays true, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I travel and I like to stay groomed all the time.  It does the job and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target on an impulse buy. Figured I would put the review on here since there are none.    Background:  I owned the original Norelco Bodygroom a long time ago until I dropped it and bent the foil. It had worked well enough for me but it did nick and pull now and then. I would just shave except I&#x27;m one of those guys that gets bad irritation from shaving the chest or below the belt line. Now onto the trimmer itself.    The packaging and design of the trimmer itself is very eye-catching. Which is what made me look at it initially. It seemed to have a similar to feature set to the newest and most expensive Bodygroom but at a much cheaper price which was enough for me to give a go. The trimmer comes sealed in that awful packaging that you need scissors or a box cutter to get through but it also lets you know that no one used it and returned it (hygiene). The trimmer itself comes with a brush and a nice little charging stand. The trimmer has a nice solid feel in your hands. It has a good grip too so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands easily depending on how you&#x27;re contorting to cut certain areas.    The trimmer has two ends. One has an adjustable length depending how long or short you want hair to be. I used the shortest setting and it cut close enough to where  you can barely see the hairs. It took a few passes at different angles to get all the hair because my hair likes to lay down very close to the skin. I like using the trimmer a lot because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown hairs as much compared to shaving. Another perk of this is that there are no attachments to keep track of. Everything is built into the trimmer    Then you have the groomer (shaving) head on the other end. Again I don&#x27;t like cutting to close because in the past my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted well and I have had some ingrown hairs which are always a pain but I had to give it a whirl since I just got this. It was was able to mow right through my hair and leave it the skin nice and smooth.It didn&#x27;t nick or tug or tug on me which was a relief but I would still be careful using it on the beans themselves. The groomer and also bend slightly to follow the contour of your skin which is helpful for many difficult to shave areas. Just a heads up, the manual suggest using the trimmer first to get the hair nice and short before using the groomer end to smooth it out. There was no pulls or nicks and to this date there was no irritation or ingrown hairs after.    Each end of the trimmer has its own power button and you can only turned on one end at a time, which is a smart idea to me. In between those buttons is a power burst button in case you need some extra juice to go through coarser hairs. I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet but it could be very useful other men.    If I had to list a con, it would only be the charging time but thats the nature of the battery. You have to charge it for a day out of the box. It does have a nice visible indicator light to let you know when its done charging. To extend the life of this battery, this isn&#x27;t probably something you want to leave on the charger for days. Other than the initial charge once that indicator light turns green. Take it off.    Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It can do whatever I need to do below the neck, it can just trim the hair or give me a skin tight shave. Plus it looks cool which is always a nice perk. And its $20 cheaper then competition.    UPDATE 12/26/2014    Ive been meaning to comeback and update my review for a while. The trimmer is still working and cutting but I dropped it two stars for the battery life. Not long after owning it the battery life began to plunge. Even if don&#x27;t use it after charging it, when you take it out to use after a while the battery will be completely dead. so no emergency pre-date trimming. You have to plan in advance to charge it for hours before you use it. Meanwhile i have other trimmers for my face that I have charged once months ago and its still running. Its a pretty inconvenient problem for me.</li>
            <li> So I saw the 50/50 split on reviews but wanted to give it a shot due to my bodygroom pro dying after 4 months and not holding charge.  I was greatly disappointed due to the fact that I could never get this one charge.  Plugged it in and let it charge for over 6 hrs. The light turned green.  It literally lasted for 5 seconds.  Decided to let it charge again overnight.  The light went from red to green.  Couldn&#x27;t get it to last 3 seconds.  Horrible battery technology.  Got returned.</li>
            <li> Gotta be REAL careful near the boys.... Cut myself the first time I used it. So far it&#x27;s working great except for the one incident</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several months now. I was not all that impressed to begin with but it is starting to grow on me. I think the biggest thing is that your skin must get used to the razor and it will get close but not as close as a Mach 4 or Quatro. The biggest drawback on the razor is that i must use the power burst setting all the time to shave. The razor just doesnt have enough power without it for even just easy whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 02/01/15: So I have had the Mangroomer for about 9 months.  I honestly stopped using it because it pulled my hair and nicked me up. I got scared of it! A shaver designed to shave yoyr intimate areas should not be designed to cut you! I then contacted Mangroomer and explained my problem with the unit. Their customer  service is excellent! Sent out a new unit as well as the nose and ear trimmers. The new unit operates flawless! No pulling , no nicking and shaves like butter. I do believe that if the shave foil gets damaged or off track a little then that&#x27;s when the problems arise.  Mangroomer also sells replacement foils on its website. My advise is that if you get a bad unit don&#x27;t give up on it....contact Mangroomer  and give them a chance to make it right!</li>
            <li> That stupid Phillips Norelco sucks ! I would use the body trimmer part, 2 minutes later the battery is being drained. I finally gave up and upgraded. I am pleased with the results. The idea that if no longer have to speed shave is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Could have just been the one I got, but I was very disappointed. It pulled and scratched my skin, and was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> pulls badly; not any kind of razor , maybe ok for body but did nothing for long neck hair after a weekend.</li>
            <li> No good, not enough power to it. I returned it back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews and only do so if I really like or really dislike a product. Becoming continually frustrated with the Norelco Body Groom I decided to try the Mangroomer. First time out of the box (and fully charged) it did not work properly at all. I&#x27;m a normal guy so don&#x27;t picture Sasquatch in the shower with this thing, it continually jammed with hair and pulled on hair repeatedly. Save yourself the aggravation and DO NOT buy this product. I am still looking for an effective grooming device if anyone has suggestions.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th different groomer I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best. It fits the hand well, charges easily, and does the job quickly. The adjutable trimmer does the mustache and eyebrows perfectly-still may have to use scissors to edge, but the trimmer gets everything the same length. I don&#x27;t do a full body shave so can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does take care of my boys pretty well too when using the shaver head. I will say this-go slow because the shaver head has these small teeth along the edge and they have a tendency to nick loose skin, but everyone I&#x27;ve ever had has those same small teeth. If you&#x27;re in the market for a good groomer-try this and I think you&#x27;ll like it. I sure do.......</li>
            <li> I finally decided to write a review after having used this for a couple of months. First off, I purchased this to replace my old Norelco Maverick trimmer. That thing lasted for 20+ years until it seems a short has developed so you never know whether it would turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a considerable amount of time looking for a suitable replacement I got the Mangroomer unit. I was apprehensive at first because the unit used NiCad batteries, so charge times are insanely long. In fact, the very first charge is pretty much overnight. Additionally, when the charge drops, there&#x27;s pretty much zero warning, and so you could be in the middle of using it, and it dies on you. Unfortunately, it takes a good 4 hours to recharge at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the initial charge, I read the instruction sheet thoroughly. This looks like it must be a generic instruction sheet because it warns you not to get the trimmer wet, even though one of its selling points is that you can clean it under a running tap, or use it in the shower. Additionally, the instructions are very specific in that it is intended for use &amp;#34;below the neck.&amp;#34; When I read that I was dumbfounded because my intention was for trimming my beard, mustache and hair. I have no intentions of trimming body, arms and nether regions with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used their Customer Service form and received a response a few days later telling me that I could use it for &amp;#34;all my trimming needs.&amp;#34; I then emailed them back and quoted the included manual. Once again I got a response that was literally the same text as before. Obviously they&#x27;re hitting a button and sending preworded responses based upon certain key words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I forged ahead with the new trimmer. Frankly, it&#x27;s under powered. There is a basic on button, and then there&#x27;s a turbo boost setting for &amp;#34;whenever you need extra power&amp;#34; or so they tell us. For beard and hair trimming I find myself having to immediately hit the turbo switch, which takes it to a level equal to what my old Maverick trimmer had. While it trims well, that&#x27;s going to suck the life out of the battery fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable cutting guide is touchy. Kind of hard to move up and down, until it pops off since it doesn&#x27;t have a full loop of plastic for support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil razor end is acceptable, though not stellar. I find I have to use it for several minutes, back and forth, back and forth, the clean up my throat area below my beard, and there&#x27;s still a slight stubble feeling when I ruby my fingers over the area. And there is a bit of noticeable growth if I come back with the razor every two days at the most. Additionally, I have had an occasional hair grab while using it, which is a big ouch surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the cleanup really is nice, when all I have to do is use the included small brush to get big hairs out of it, and then run it under the tap to get rid of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s a good product for body builders who are using it generally for cleaning up soft body hair, or trimming tan bikini brief lines, and things like that. But, for my usage (beard cleanup, and then some head hair trimming), I wish I&#x27;d went with something else instead, and will probably look for something next year.</li>
            <li> Do not  buy this product, it pulled my hairs and it also cut my skin. i went back to using my norelco male groomer, it seemed like the cutter was dull .</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandpa he loves it he wanted a new razor but this is alot better then a normal  razor it works perfectly nothing wrong with it. It don&#x27;t hurt or anything when using it its just an all-around great item</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with no problems def would buy again whenever this one bites the dust which I hope isn&#x27;t any time soon</li>
            <li> This thing does an awesome job at trimming. It never scratches or bites. I have noticed that it works so much better in high power mode. My only wish is that it had a replaceable battery. I end up having to buy a new groomer every year or two because the rechargeable batteries stop holding a charge. NIMH batteries just don&#x27;t last, so I pretty much consider this thing disposable. Why not have a couple of replaceable AA NIMH batteries instead? If cordless phones can have them, why not this?</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a product similar to this and I&#x27;m glad to have it at the price and the product is top quality.</li>
            <li> As a \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; enthusiast since the days of my first unwanted body hairs and having tried several similar razors and shavers in the past I must say this one is definitely amongst the best. The dual head provides options to shave clean or trim at seven different lengths. I ordered the body groomer and the professional travel shaver as well, figuring Id go all out. Unfortunately the shaver was defective, but the body groomer was amazing. I emailed ManGroomer from their website regarding my shaver and luckily the company has a customer service team that goes above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy, and in fact they did just that for me. Quick and painlessly after a few short, sweet, emails between myself and their team a new shaver was on the way to me for free. Not only this but due to the inconvenience they took the novelty of sending me a nose and ear hair trimmer completely free of charge as well. Talk about doing the right thing. This company is clearly dedicated to providing men everywhere with the best grooming resources I&#x27;ve come across. Will definitely recommend all of their products to everybody.</li>
            <li> Great shaver that get&#x27;s really close even in the most delicate of places.  Can be used dry or wet although I wouldn&#x27;t go dunking it in any water.  Have only used it a few times but so far I&#x27;m pretty impressed. If it wears well then I will be a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> Clean shaving just wonderful product easy to use worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best machine for all body</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this works well. Recommend it and my gf likes it too.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does... the reason for the 4 stars is I whish you could have been able to use it on your face also.  That&#x27;s the only down side.  Otherwise, is excellent product.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged and he can&#x27;t use it on his head, he keeps his head shaved... He likes it a coordless and he can trim his face but only if it had afull charge... Totally disappointed</li>
            <li> Only Minus point is that it has not a european powercable plugin. That would be the finishing touch</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Complete disappointment. Pulls hair. Very weak even at a full charge.</li>
            <li> ***Update 10/12/2016 - I had to update this because it seems after using this for about two and a half years it looks like the motor (or possibly the battery?) is starting to give out on me.  I may not be the best at oiling the groomer, but I keep it clean and dry when not in use and am mildly disappointed in this performance.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works like a charm, and the adjustible guard is very helpful.  The base is nice and makes it look sophisticated on your counter.  I&#x27;ve not tried to use this in the shower to test the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; performance, but otherwise works well.</li>
            <li> Quality product. I use this groomer 2-3 times a week &amp; it&#x27;s holding up well. Seems a little underpowered so I constantly have to run it in boost mode.  The battery will run for 30-45 minutes, more then enough time to do work. Not super fast but the end results are good. I have had other trimmers similar &amp; this one is by far a superior product, expect the head to wear out, so when you purchase the groomer, get some extra heads, they are cheap.  The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is that they don&#x27;t include a handle so you can easily groom the back. I had a Phillips Norelco groomer &amp; even that pile included a handle, so I threw the Norelco trimmer in the trash &amp; kept the handle, I just tape this trimmer to that handle &amp; it works fine.  You could also use a spatula I guess. Anyway, solid product, slow shipping (took 2 weeks), but it was packaged well &amp; the order was complete.</li>
            <li> Love it..after a lot of searching found one that had all features you could want...</li>
            <li> Would rate ZERO if I could. Do NOT buy! This thing pulls out your hair. does NOT cut it! I don&#x27;t know what product these other people are using, but it isn&#x27;t this one. my 3 yr old Norelco Bodygrommer is 1000% better than this. I really wanted to like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks similar to a  Norelco Bodygrommer product. But that is where it stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, I did charge it for 18-24hours. The product is unuseable in regular cutting mode, putting it into turbo is somewhat better but extreme pulling. Imagine getting a spa to pour wax on you and YANK out your hair. NOW you have the shaving experience this shaver gives you for your chest and arms.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2. One worked, the other one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Contacted Mangroomer customer service. Once I showed them proof of purchase they sent out a new one &amp; a Ear &amp; Nose trimmer for my troubles. The new one they sent will not hold a charge either &amp; problems with the free trimmer they sent out. Customer service will now not respond back after 4 emails in 3 weeks. Very dissatisfied with this company. You can only email customer service &amp;#34;so if they won&#x27;t respond back, what can you do&amp;#34;. Write up a crappy review, which is what I am doing.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, only thing not happy with is the charge life, seems very short.</li>
            <li> MANGROOMER, bar none, has the best costumer service I have ever experienced!  Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li> This has been a great tool. After about 8 months of use, I can it&#x27;s starting to dull a bit. First use, the gentle touch was great. After a few times trimming up, it&#x27;s started to get a bit grabby on the tougher hairs.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this.  It barely holds a charge.  The clipper function is fine, but for a closer shave this isn&#x27;t up to par.  The last groomer I had was much better than this.  I think it is back to Norelco I go.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be so excited about an electric shaver.  This thing performs perfectly in trimming and close shaving in all areas.  It has the best of all the features offered in other razors.  One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  Highly recommend.  Always good to go with a brand that specializes in one area as opposed to a more expensive name brand that manufactures a million different items in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Purchased April 2014&lt;br /&gt;Everything was great right out of the box.  Trimmer worked as advertised, never needed the turbo boost.  I was able to cut through my thinning hair on my head and everywhere else without issue.  Powered up and was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward to December 2014&lt;br /&gt;The unit only has the dull hum of a NiCd battery that is barely charged.  Even on the turbo boost it still has 1/4 of the speed as when it was new.  At this point it does more to rip the hair from my body than it does to actually trim it.  I cannot use the &amp;#34;shaver side&amp;#34; with the side trimmers as I can feel it pull each hair from my skin.  Instead the only was it is useable is by using the adjustable trimmer side with the blade guard off and on turbo boost and then it still pulls the hairs out instead of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product should at least get to 1 year before it becomes unusable.  I will be recycling this and never purchasing their garbage again.</li>
            <li> It broke in less than a week.  After about two uses the buttons wouldn&#x27;t work.  Luckily I was able to return it to Amazon.  I recommend the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom for a similar device which seems to have much better build quality.</li>
            <li> bought Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Shaver in March 2014. I was totally impressed how well it shaved, it exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor. The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes. I emailed Mangroomer and was totally impressed with their Customer Service Department. They responded the next day acknowledging that it was a defective unit and sent out a replacement unit</li>
            <li> My original unit came with a weak battery and the light on the unit was supposed to turn green when fully charged which it did not. I contacted their support team and with days they sent me a new unit while i get to keep the old one. The replacement unit was worse than the original. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on after being fully charged. i asked for a refund but they rejected it.</li>
            <li> Works very well for personal areas of men. No pulls or burns or cuts. Great!</li>
            <li> Best Body Groomer! - great for shaving my chest and the boys. Does not pull! I have the back body groomer too!  And my wife likes my super smooth chest! ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent, versatile, body grooming product. Multiple features that allow you to trim hair from all parts of the body to various lengths. Even more important, for those men who choose to groom themselves in those private areas, the body groomer is designed to allow for an ultra close shave without the fear of nicks or pulls; very important! Other great feature is the ability to use this product in or out of the shower, the first product I have ever encountered with the ability to do so; this allows for easy grooming and easy cleanup afterwards. Overall, designed and functions very well; an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Ouch! You better watch out for this ultimate groomer and trimmer.  You might cut your balls off with the Mangroomer if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> So when I purchase something, I usually expect to at least be able to open it from the packaging, and power it on to see if it works. Instead, this product came with a completely dead battery that will take 24 hours (according to the manual) for it to charge. Other than that, I guess it looks like the picture? Can&#x27;t really say much else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got to use this thing and I have to say that it is HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY! I&#x27;m NOT a hairy person at all and this thing was so bad at shaving. I had to go over and over the same spot multiple times and even then it didn&#x27;t get the hair. It ended up dying on me before I was even finished and then I just ended up having to use a razor. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok does not get as close as I like I still have to use a razor to get a closer shave especially chest area and back</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how great this thing is. best purchase in a long time!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for grooming the entire body. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this was a giant waste of money. It looked really good and had cool features but when I tried to shave with it, it knicked my skin over and over. I thought maybe just cause it was new but it wasn&#x27;t the case. The shaver is designed poorly and does not cut the hairs quickly. I regret buying this product and overall am really dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product one big thing they don&#x27;t mention is that it is NOT meant for facial hair, it doesn&#x27;t work well for beard grooming or fine touch ups, does its job well on the rest of the body though, great for manscaping, well priced, easy to use, would recommended.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot on Amazon. I also scan the daily deals and occasionally pick up an item - I&#x27;ve found / purchased a lot of really cool items for $25 or under. This is not one of them. There are 3 really key points I&#x27;d like to make about this product and why it is a poor groomer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery Life - charge it for 2 hours and watch it die in 2 minutes. Its depressing, and honestly a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;2) Shaver Design - the shaver / grooming ends at the top of the product collect a lot of hair easily and get clogged quickly. There isn&#x27;t a quick way to really clean it out, so its annoying.&lt;br /&gt;3) Bulky Size - the product itself is large for groomer. it also comes with a large charger. Collectively this takes up a big portion of a drawer, and considering points 1 &amp; 2, every time you open that drawer you just think &amp;#34;why.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically only write reviews when the product is superb or not good. I think i&#x27;ll go back to the $10 special. This product is not good.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 4 weeks.  Couldn&#x27;t return or replace due to a time out on return policy.  Waste of money.  Target has a nice selection of trimmers in the same class, which if they stop working you have a much greater return window!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift.  I can say this thing is the worst groomer I have ever used. The thing yanks your whiskers rather than cut them.. Go get a norelco at walmart...</li>
            <li> I expected it to shave better I still use my razor to touch things up</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged.  Doesn&#x27;t shave well.  Pulls hair all the time.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I had the Unit for 6 months and was very happy with it, had a small problem, contacted the company and they were extremely helpful and accommodating more than I expected ,&lt;br /&gt;They responded right away replacing the unit and even sending me one of their other items complimentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that is great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It works great. Simple to use. you should use it dry(shaving part and trimmer) The shaver part goes smooth as well as the  trimmer, but the smallest guard setting doesn&#x27;t cut 1/16 of an inch(1.6 mm). It&#x27;s more close to 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li> Great groomer, it has been the best groomer I&#x27;ve got after two unsuccessful experience with Philips, the rest of them broke early</li>
            <li> I bought Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Shaver in Jan 2014. I was totally impressed how well it shaved, it exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s easy to use and takes the hair off quickly and as close as if I used a razor. The one problem I had was the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 30 minutes. I emailed Mangroomer and was totally impressed with their Customer Service Department. They responded the next day acknowledging that it was a defective unit and sent out a replacement unit. I would definitely recommend the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Shaver to anyone who wants a great product plus a company that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great on wet and dry skin.  I use this a lot on my sideburns and neck line.  The easy length adjustments are nice.. and If you&#x27;re wanting to keep the wedding tackle groomed, the Mangroomer is for you.</li>
            <li> The item came very quickly. A good device - the quality is excellent. I rather. Thank seller!</li>
            <li> Got as a present.  It really works, and well</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, the only thing I don&#x27;t like are the button placement.</li>
            <li> good product, takes a couple of passes to get all the hair. not very effective as a face shave.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were great so I bought it. I have a similar device that serves me well but wanted something a little more purpose built. I don&#x27;t think the guard lengths are true to size and I wish the razor side was a little cleaner per pass. This device is just OK. It cleans up and gets me prepped for the razor which is not entirely what I was looking for but helps all the same. There are better products out there for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace a Norelco BodyGroomer (the second Norelco that bit the dust after only a year with minimal use...don&#x27;t recommend that brand!!!). So far so good. Good design and functionality overall, mind you I only use the side with adjustable setting. A tad cheap in materials/workmanship but not drastically so (e.g., adjustable plastic piece feels a little thin/cheap and I always feel the need to use the &amp;#34;power boost&amp;#34; button). But, overall, would recommend</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer Trimmer is perfect for the male looking to shave or trim body hair!  The dual purpose shaver allows for a quick, effective shave.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My man is a hairy guy, this makes him smooth and cuddly! one bad is you have to go slow or it pulls hair.</li>
            <li> Does not work all that way in certain areas.  Pretty much anything on the trimmer end needs to be on turbo setting and still likely to be bogged down.  After 6 months, it holds a charge for less than 30 seconds.  Emailed their customer support - 3 weeks no response.  Called their customer line - &amp;#34;sorry this is for orders only&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad.</li>
            <li> Sent the Mangroomer back to Amazon and purchased from Amazon a Norelco BG2040 Bodygroom. Upon receiving the Norelco unit I discovered that it is in many ways the same unit except for the exterior body as the Mangroomer. However, you are now dealing with a reputable company,&amp;#34;NORELCO&amp;#34;. One other difference is that the Norelco unit is $10.00 more than the Mangroomer. But I feel that the reliability of Norelco is worth the difference.</li>
            <li> Works well in between shaving my nether regions and chest. Good for a quick touch up in a pinch, but not as close as a shave.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner. We&#x27;ve had it now for a few months, and now only the clippper end works. Since I rarely used that end, this is not a big issue. I was more interested in being able to use it in the shower, and the battery life. Battery life will allow you to shave one arm without issue. When you try to do more than that, I start to have issues with the battery dying. I do enjoy that this product rarely &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; your skin ... especially in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It is quite a handy tool. With its two heads (trimmer end and shaver end) one can easily adjust the cut length between 0 (shaver end) to about 1.5 cm (trimmer end at its maximum position). For some reason the trimmer end has 8 positions instead of 7. As long as the number of positions is greater than the stated it can be considered as a feature. :) The device is reasonably small which makes it fit to one&#x27;s hand nicely and it is easy to shave / trim small areas with it. I like also the blades: they cut gently. A few days after shaving I do not feel itchy under the T-shirt (compared to an ordinary, manual shave when I usually feel this itching after a few days). The mains adapter is electrically compatible with the power grid in Europe. However you need to buy a small plug adapter which converts between the two different plug shapes. Maybe the only issue is that the trimmer comb is somewhat loose. But as long as you do not use great force I think it is not a problem. Considering its relatively low price I think this groomer offers a great value for the money you spend to it.</li>
            <li> Battery wears out too fast!!</li>
            <li> The Shaver itself was great, but within 72 hrs of plugging in the charger stopped charging. Or at least the light on the shaver unit started flickering instead of on steady when cradled in charger, then stopped lighting up completely.  Returning for a new one. See if the new one holds.</li>
            <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
            <li> Unit continuously stops running every 5 or 10 seconds even when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;It stops both when cutting or trimming or just in my hand. It did this very occasionaly right after purchase but all the time now just 3 months after purchase. More electronic trash!!</li>
            <li> Everything works great however it does not get close enough to my skin. I like to keep my sideburns close but this will not do it. Other than that it is built well and will work good for people that don&#x27;t mind not getting close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I own a product somewhat like this, and it does a great job.  This product however, is, as the title says, underpowered and inefficient.  It constantly pulled at the hairs it was trimming and was easily clogged.  Even the &amp;#34;power burst&amp;#34; button didn&#x27;t help a whole lot.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and it sucks for keeping it trimmed. There are several level adjustments and I still have to take it down to two for it to trim anything on my beard, and at that point, that level takes off too much. If you want the two or three day beard look, it is great for that. It also works fine for body hair removal so it will be used for that but I had to keep my other trimmer for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;4/3/2014 - update - After using it again this morning, I have decided I really just don&#x27;t like this trimmer. As I stated in my answer below, if I could, I would return this. The end that has the foil on it just sucks really. I don&#x27;t think it has enough power to run it from a battery. And if you don&#x27;t keep it on the charger ALL the time it dies quickly. I didn&#x27;t and still don&#x27;t have to do that with the $20 Norelco trimmer I bought 5 years ago. Now I have two trimmers in my bathroom and had to rig up a way to charge them both. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> Returned it.  Charged it for the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Went to use it, and it died after about 3 minutes of use!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thought I could plug it in and use the adapter on the trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t! Returned.</li>
            <li> does a good job - overall a great trimmer.  I use it for my beard as well.</li>
            <li> had my groomer for a year and it started malfunctioning. i contacted customer service and literally within 15 minutes i had a response letting them know they would send me a new one for free (didn&#x27;t even have to ship the old one back). AMAZING customer service. i really like the product and use it every other week to keep my body hair groomed. it does everything that i need it to, and it is very low maintenance to clean. the only two bad things are that (like everyone else has said), the battery is kind of a pain because it takes so long to charge. the other bad thing is how easy it is to get the trimmer backed up. i have very thin hair and i have to blow on it/clean it out like every minute when i am grooming.. i can only imagine how guys with thick/coarse hair deal with this. overall, i am very satisfied with my product though and i definitely have to say this company has the best customer service i have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Not what expected. Not smooth-pulled hair and had to return.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;-does the job&lt;br /&gt;-large number of settings on beard trimmer allow a lot of control over styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-unless you are using the power button it doesn&#x27;t really have enough power behind it&lt;br /&gt;-does not keep a charge very well at all&lt;br /&gt;-I personally do not like charging cradles, which is the only way to charge this product</li>
            <li> The mangroomers battery life sucks! At first it.seemed pretty cool product but It takes forever to charge and when it is charged it won&#x27;t last long. I tried getting in contact with customer service but they won&#x27;t respond. In conclusion this product was decent and the customer service does not exist with this company. Do yourself a favor and buy the norelco bodygroomer now!</li>
            <li> Part of why I like it is I paid $30 for it . The other part is it works and it shaved parts of my body with hair that had never been touched in over  50 years . Feel cleaner and the gals liked it . I shaved with the one end a little rough but doable . Felt a few snags at times but nothing pushing the middle button couldn&#x27;t cure . If it goes on sale and you have a need pick one up . Here it is on sale again it is November . I don&#x27;t use it often , the charger is a pain and different . However when I do use it it trims where no tool you would use to shave other places should go and cleans me up . Much better then the old way of just doing nothing to trim around ones privates and super hair spots . I keep my underarms trimmed to about 1 inch instead of getting out of control . Still like it and the battery is hanging in there still taking a charge though the charging stand is difficult to position it in . It only goes in one way with the light bar out and power button down .Update 2 years now still going strong and I learned to use it better . This was suggested to me by a young gal that couldn&#x27;t believe men of my generation didn&#x27;t trim body hair . After using it I do not know why I didn&#x27;t . Feel much cleaner the only downside is finding a place to shave where you can easily pick up the hair . In the summer I go out in the yard for everything outside my swim trunks . I don&#x27;t shave down like a swimmer just take it all down to the low bridge setting . I have to do medication injections  in my stomach  and they are so much less painful and easier now . This is great for diabetics doing shots to keep hair trimmed . I would buy another one if the battery stops charging . I am going to buy the nose and ear trimmer today because their products work .</li>
            <li> I like this body groomer but I not sure if it&#x27;s just mine but the battery could be better. Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This all-in-one does a good job. I use mine just to keep beard trimmed, but if you&#x27;re one of those people who like to shave every part of your body, this one can help you in a painless manner.</li>
            <li> Very usefull. Did not nick tender areas. Recharges quickly. Cleans easily. I was able to reach most areas of my back.</li>
            <li> This device is an excellent tool to maintain your appearance.  It has a number of options for use and does the job well.</li>
            <li> It has been many years since I bought an electric razor, so my assumption, after seeing so many great reviews, is that they have come a long way. However, that did not appear to be true. I bought this based on others comments and have been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave well.  The trimmers on the opposing sides of the razor pinch the skin, or act as an Epilady, pulling the hair out.  And the trimmer side does not have a short enough trimmer for my liking.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable to use.Seems to pull hair rather than shave it. This seems to be the case with both clipper end and razor</li>
            <li> Bought at the end of October by January it was completely dead. I used it once a week maybe tops. After a month of use it worked a lot less efficiently. After 2 months it wouldn&#x27;t even power on consistently. By January it completely would not work. Honest opinion is that Its a good design and good thought behind, It unfortunately doesn&#x27;t follow through how a quality product should.</li>
            <li> Sent back didn&#x27;t charge very well and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer w Power Burst is an excellent product. I recently upgraded to this product from another model from another company. The ManGroomer Ultimate Pro Body Groomer works great and is easy to use. The power burst is very effective and it cuts grooming time in half. Also the Mangroomer customer service team is very professional and is very responsive with any questions and or issues regarding their products.&lt;br /&gt;I also own the nose and ear trimmer and that also works very well... it is very efficient and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend the above referenced products.&lt;br /&gt;With a great product and a great customer service team - Mangroomer is state of the art!</li>
            <li> doesnt get hair in the corners as well as i would like.</li>
            <li> Hi The man groomer charger I received was broken. The man groomer worked fine, but when I needed to charge it wouldn&#x27;t work. I would like a new charger.</li>
            <li> By far the best body groomer I have ever boughten.  I lost my charging cord while I was traveling so I decided to just order another one.  Now I have two (one for me and one for my partner).  We both use it almost daily and just charge one while we use the other.</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first time I used it, although it did seem to run out of charge quicker than expected  I thought maybe cause it was the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;Next 2 times it lasted less than 5 minutes on full charge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve returned the one I have for a new one, will test it and post another review.</li>
            <li> I gave the Man Groomer a five star rating because it left an immediate positive impression on me. After I reached that &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; in life I grew an excessive amount of body hair and it became more and more uncomfortable. Uncomfortable for my social life...no. Uncomfortable physically yes, because it would cause me two sweat profusely during the summer. When i saw this in the gold box I immediately got it. When it came in the mail I may have a gotten a little to excited to see how this works out and I didn&#x27;t charge it completely (fortunately I tested in a small area on my chest so it could easily be covered). The hair on my chest is rather coarse and the mangroomer cut right through it without any problems. If you need to you can also just take the trimmer guard off, but only do that once the hair has been trimmed to as short as it can go with the guard on. The shaving end of the groomer also provides a really close and smooth cut with no irritation whatsoever. I haven&#x27;t used the power burst feature yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I suggest you don&#x27;t get too excited like and start trimming right away put it on the charger and begin trimming the next day.</li>
            <li> Only worked for a month!</li>
            <li> The battery after fully charged doesn&#x27;t last past a few minutes of use. and needs to be recharged for a while.</li>
            <li> Great product nice having the two in one, It makes things much easier. The power burst button is also a great feature and something I now couldn&#x27;t live without. Yes it has guards but anyone that has been grooming with any product knows no matter what is advertised you still should take great care in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually contacted the Mangroomer company because the bottom guard was taken off my unit and lost at home somewhere. They responded in about 1 minute via email explaining they do not sell that particular piece but would send me one regardless free of charge. It shipped immediately, I am a big fan of companies that actually support their customers I am now definitely sold and a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This razor would not hold a charge.  I had read the negative reviews for this product concerning the difficulty with the positioning of the razor on its charging base, so I knew there might be some effort required to get it situated correctly.  However, after a few days of trying to position it properly and wait for it to charge, the razor was still not holding a charge.  I contacted amazon who immediately admitted the product had a history of not holding a charge.  Shame on amazon for making this item the &#x27;deal of the day&#x27; promotion when they knew it was faulty.  0/5 stars for both the manufacturer of this terrible product and amazon for pushing it on unsuspecting customers.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first used it. Now about 4 months later after a few dozen uses the one side of the head does not work any longer .  Even when it did work cleaning it was always an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service dept.  I first sent them an email, then they sent me a phone contact.  I called, they answered on the first ring and immediately worked with me to remedy the situation.  I have never experienced that level of customer service!  Trouble shooting did not work then the sent me out a NEW unit 2nd day air! And a nose trimmer for my inconvenience.  Unreal!  I would definitely reccomend this product and this company...</li>
            <li> Wish is would have purchased this groomer sooner! I am very pleased with the performance of this groomer. This is both a sturdy and ergonomic device. The one end works perfect for trimming long hair EVERYWHERE and the shaver end quickly cuts short hair creating smooth results. Although the power boost button works great, I rarely use it due to the great power this groomer delivers.</li>
            <li> Very convient and works everywhere man wants to shave literally. It is also cool because you can use it in the shower so no clean up is necessary.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the groomer feature. 4 for the shaver/trimmer. 1 star for the the battery not last lasting more than 3 months (would&#x27;t hold a charge).  5 Stars for the Mangroomer company for quickly sending out a replacement. All I had to do was email them with a copy of the Amazon invoice and a pic of the product and with in days I had a brand new one (didn&#x27;t even have to ship back the bad one).  So for grooming this works great. Easy to use. As a shaver it seems to work well. Don&#x27;t use the trimmer much.    **UPDATE 11/19/14** My replacement shaver is now doing the same thing as the first one, will not hold a charge.  Very disappointing as I like the shaver but this is not worth the hassle so I am downgrading my rating to one star.</li>
            <li> no nicks or cuts  the best customer service experience i&#x27;ve ever encountered.  had an issue with battery life and the manufacturer replaced immediately.  best groomer i have found after 4-5 others over the years.</li>
            <li> I find the battery life less than adequate,It&#x27;s not good for a mustache or head trim,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best for body hair</li>
            <li> This is a sensibly designed tool that does what it should, without impersonating a device designed for a woman.  I&#x27;m looking mostly to keep things under control, not turn myself into an 8 year old.  Some devices have only one mode: Instant 8 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this tool, I can decide the trim level that&#x27;s appropriate without being a fool about it.  The safety guard prevents unfortunate incidents.  When in the charging stand, you can easily tell whether it&#x27;s charging (the light turns red) or whether it&#x27;s fully charge (the light is green).  It&#x27;s designed for men, so it&#x27;s not giving you a lot of muss and fuss and sonnets.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge! please save your money! I used less then 4 times, it&#x27;s shot.</li>
            <li> Mine did not work well after two months of use only using it every two weeks .Maybe I just got the lemon ??  Acts like the beard trimmer runs in a bind , fast then slow, fast then slow.Afriad it&#x27;s going to freeze up while I&#x27;m trimming my short beard ,and yank some hair .  If I would have bought it at a local store , I would have taken it back !!</li>
            <li> This is the second item that I have bought in 8 years from Mangroomer company and the second time their products have been defective after I followed the instructions on how to charge it.  I suggest never buying this brand ever.  Mangroomer is a horrible product.  I bought from them again to see if they had fixed their issues but I was fooled twice now.  This product is crap, does not charge properly, breaks easily, and I highly recommend never purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I am an honest and fair reviewer and I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, the bad reviews that you read, truly are correct. I charged it up the first time around... used it on my no no areas and it does keep from cutting you.. but also is hard to even cut the hairs. Yes, I know how close it&#x27;s supposed to get in every level. I used the bottom level spacer for my armpits, because I don&#x27;t like long armpit hairs and I am a grower if you know what I mean. It took forever to shave my armpits. It just doesn&#x27;t cut well... no if and or about it. Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t last. Probably the worst battery I&#x27;ve come across in all my years. The thing looks awesome, like it would last some time.. but it&#x27;s a piece of crap. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, even though it was on sale when I did. Buy a different brand, or deal with this sub par performance. I just don&#x27;t like it and it stares me in the face every day and I want to throw it away, but I paid too much for that.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace earlier man groomer design. Actually liked first generation design better. Especially for guy areas. Got to be extra careful!Hence only 3 stars</li>
            <li> This was great when it arrived, but now won&#x27;t charge. It&#x27;s not used everyday so has only been charged a few times. There are two small metal knobs on the side that much touch 2 metal plates on the charger. I have cleaned all 4 places, but the contact does not result in a charge. Very disappointed...after only 4 months!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Works for about a week, tops.</li>
            <li> Works well a little noisy and takes a little time to get a close shave</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll for me and I sent it to the landfill</li>
            <li> plastic trimmer piece is cracked received that way,,, emailed manufacturer and have no contact from them/</li>
            <li> had it a couple of months now..junk..noisy, dull. just does not cut..rattles vibrates so much it feels like it will fall apart..can&#x27;t believe it was released as a real product..</li>
            <li> Not only a excellent trimmer this company is the BEST!  Excellent customer service and follow up!&lt;br /&gt;A quality product that works as described.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it and lasted only a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you don&#x27;t want this ... Take a minute to think about all the things you &amp;#34;wouldn&#x27;t&amp;#34; want in a &#x27;man&#x27; groomer and I can assure you this does it.  1) Pulls/Scratches/Cuts?  Check, it does 2) Won&#x27;t hold a charge? Check, it doesn&#x27;t ... 3) Large, difficult to maneuver? Check, it is</li>
            <li> This product I found pretty underwhelming. I shave my head to bald and I regularly let my beard grow out and then remove, so I was looking for a shaver that I could just do a rough pass and then follow up with an electric razor to get nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with this groomer is the battery. The only way to use it is off battery so it&#x27;s kind of important, but the battery really blows on this thing. As others have mentioned this thing wont hold a charge *at all* so you are stuck plugging it in and waiting *several* hours before being able to use it. i can&#x27;t get it to cut effectively unless it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting which means that I am racing the clock to get my whole head and face done before it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the reviews first, this is a stinker product due to battery issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent works well all my whole body.  I am not hairy but helps to maintain the parts that I want</li>
            <li> It lives up to everything that is advertised about it.  It is completely adjustable and does a great job regardless of the length or density of body hair.  We are very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Great tool for keeping the hedges neat and trimmed. I do not regret.</li>
            <li> Great product... Fast Shipper</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer, but the battery life on mine is ridiculous. There&#x27;s a noticeable drop in power after a couple minutes. I do not have really thick body hair, but even for me I have to use the power boost setting the whole time just so the blades don&#x27;t snag (using the shaver foil side). This thing would be much better if it had a longer battery life and the power boost setting were the normal setting.</li>
            <li> *Update July 2015*&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the replacement unit Mangroomer sent me a while back. Unfortunately it has the same issues the other unit had. It pulls hair, the head gets stuck full of hair etc... I would try another shaver of similar caliber in the future-but this one is just very poorly designed, its flaws are not something you can get around either. Its shape, the position of the head make it undesirable to use. The second shaver head is also very pointless, it gets annoying that when using the main head I keep turning that one on by accident due to them being so close together.. I am not going to bother using it at all anymore as it only frustrates me more each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to receive this but have been somewhat disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of things wrong with it that make it completely useless to me and I wish I would have returned it-but I thought I could use it for something..&lt;br /&gt;-The angle of the head is tilted too far back (all other body shavers have a different angle which works) and your hair gets stuck in there so you need to clean it pretty much after each shaving stroke&lt;br /&gt;-The 2 speed function is pointless, even on the power burst its weaker than other shavers and it becomes extremely noisy!&lt;br /&gt;-It really pulls hair, since even on the power burst its very weak, it pulls on my hairs almost every time so that makes it undesirable to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has become less course due to laser hair removal treatments so I thought maybe now I can use it, not a chance it even gets caught on less course and finer-thinner hair.. Pretty much useless to me, I am back using my old body shavers and regretting buying this! It was a good concept but the design and delivery was really low standard. My $20 Remington does a better job than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update April 2015. I am changing the review to 3 stars since Mangroomer has contacted me and are sending me a replacement unit. They definitely stand behind theirproducts so I am grateful for that!*</li>
            <li> Not as impressive as it looks. Battery life sucks and so weak it pinches hairs and stalls out, stuck to your face. Takes forever to charge. Not terribly sharp either. With adjustable clipper guard it just lays hairs down so you get a very uneven cut. Acts like a cheap 2 &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery powered shaver that you can get for under $10.00 at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Junkasaurus....wouldn&#x27;t trim short bead hair let alone other &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s like using a 18&amp;#34; push mower to cut a 3 acre yard...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two trimmer before this one and the &amp;#34; MANGROOMER Pro Body Groomer and Trimmer&amp;#34; is the best. It cuts smoothly and close without irritation, and it feels comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> I am still evaluating. I have not yet attempted to use on my more sensitive parts. If you want the stubble beard, this does not get close enough.</li>
            <li> When it worked, a good product. The rechargeable battery failed after 6 months use. It apparently is not replaceable, so the trimmer becomes useless. That leads to part 2 of my poor rating...the customer service. it is non-existent. There is a number to call. It is only for sales of products. I was told that customer service is handled via email. After multiple emails, inquiring about replacing the battery, I received no response...none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....after posting this review, Mangroomer immediately contacted me via email. They apologized for the failure to answer previous emails and offered to send out a new unit at no charge. They requested my original receipt and pic of the non-working product, completely reasonable. They also sent a nose trimmer at no charge...nice touch. So my earlier indictment of the customer service is now rendered a moot point. In fairness, this is a very well made solid and versatile trimmer that worked well initially. Also in fairness, I will continue to evaluate the battery life. Previously I followed good practice to use the product until the battery died and unit stopped performing...then recharged. If anyone has found another method, such as re-charging after every use to get better results, please comment.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the most part but it sometimes pulls on the hair making it a little painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  This groomer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  It gets plugged up with hair very quickly.  Poorly designed shaving mechanism.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it on a deal, as I don&#x27;t get consistent results with it.</li>
            <li> If I could give this thing negative stars I would.  The first one I got never worked.  Returned it and got a second one, which I haven&#x27;t even had a year.  The batter won&#x27;t hold a charge any more, and it is more of a hair-ripper now than a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice power boost button which ALMOST brings the cutter head to a useful speed level, but not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
