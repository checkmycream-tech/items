            <li>I had to crack up when I saw another review called this &amp;#34;mommy magic&amp;#34; as that is honestly what I was going to title my review, in fact when I grab the bottle after washing my daughters&#x27; hair I always say &amp;#34;time to add some magic&amp;#34; and they no longer fuss and cry about combing...</li>
            <li>I have been buying Bain de Terre Recovery from my hair dresser and always really liked it.  </li>
            <li>gives my hair a nice shine and at the age of 62</li>

            <li>I used this product for many years, but had difficulty finding it after I moved to Maine.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>so I did not notice they had changed more than the bottle...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works like magic to detangle and condition&#x27;  </li>
            <li>There is nothing I have found any better, been hairdresser over 45 years&lt;</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It came  in perfect shape in short time.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy again and shines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have yet to find anything that works better.</li>
            <li>I have looked every place for this product but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair and have for many years and this product has been so&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure why, need to ask.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments from people on how healthy my hair was looking that they asked what I did.  </li>
            <li>this makes it look allot better.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>My hair is ultra frizzy, especially in summer, so this product has become my BFF (best friend forever).</li>
            <li>So glad I found this</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I love it so much is that it does NOT have a strong scent (most folks would probably say it has none at all, but I can detect a very light, pleasant one) -</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t greasy or weighed down, it tames the frizz beautifully, and it makes my fried split ends looks a lot more smooth and happy.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good price for it, too.</li>
            <li>This is best used on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I dry it, and it finishes off my styling perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it delivers a great experience and is the only one I use, I have been using this product for many years, I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job keeping my hair frizz free and has a lovely natural shine without feeling you&#x27;ve put anything in your hair.</li>
            <li>This works great and leaves a hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a very long time and it is very effective the kind of hair I have.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>It also makes it easy to run my fingers through my hair...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as easily.    </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky, shiny and easy to take care.</li>
            <li>I tried both Biosilk and Chi Silk infusion and could not stand the strong scents.  </li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair easy to get tangles out and subdues the frizz, yep.</li>
            <li>recommeded by my hairdresser, works fine</li>
            <li>I have color treated fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li>lasts several months for me - worth full price at the salon, this lower price is a great deal!</li>
            <li>The name \\&quot;Recovery Complex\\&quot; is accurate for this product.  </li>
            <li>Buying the product at Amazon is a huge savings compared to buying it in a hair salon.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic after a hair color or perm.</li>
            <li>Although it has a light scent, I wish this product had no added scent.</li>
            <li>This product maintains my hair silky and smooth even during winter time.  </li>
            <li>Bain de Terre Recovery anti frizz, leaves my hair shiny and smooth always.</li>
            <li>Light almost not there scent.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Light weight product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed when I don&#x27;t use it my hair isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is, and living in New Orleans with all the humidity my hair stays looking sleek and healthy even when it rains!  </li>
            <li>After the flat iron I finish the look with 2  drops - dime size of Biosilk Therapy, another great product.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that seems to just get better the longer</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and keep it short, so this seems to be the best for keeping my gray hair shiny and curls comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, oily, colored/damaged hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I can no longer find it in my local salon and am thrilled to be able to get it from Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry hair!</li>
            <li>Also, it works very well with many differenct product lines -</li>
            <li>On a hunch, I tried Amazon, and two days later I looked good again.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I was really hoping this product would work well for me and my daughter as we have to battle</li>
            <li>Thanks once more, Bain de Terre ...</li>
            <li>Bain de Terre - recovery complex anti-frizz\\&quot; is wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see it in a bigger bottle available here on Amazon and plan to never run out.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This product just looks better and better up to the third day.</li>
            <li>Have a child with super curly hair that cries each time we brush or comb.  </li>
            <li>But I am very pleased to say it is the same</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and need a good treatment.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair beautiful and soft for several days.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years and it makes a huge difference in keeping my hair styled even in high humidity (and my hair is naturally curly, and easily frizzes!).</li>
            <li>The Bain de Terre doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is worth a try if you&#x27;re experimenting with anti frizz/humidity serums.</li>
            <li>How RARE is that?</li>
            <li>Tangles just slip right out with NO</li>
            <li>I also use a foam gel most of the time, but no other conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good for curly hair to keep friz down.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My wife told me to try the Bain de Terre product (she wasn&#x27;t using it very much).  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down like most conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my hair very soft and fun to touch - says my husband!</li>
            <li>I have used so many different hair products for shine and softness.</li>
            <li>SImilar to Pearatin by Loma but better price</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>However it is the first week after a beard trim.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to wash my ton of hair every day.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li>When I tried this product for the first time I was amazed at how it TRULY got rid of the frizzes.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair smooth and alive.</li>
            <li>The seller put a piece of tape over the top and this has a pump instead of squeeze bottle like pictured, and the tape was either not placed properly or it shifted when in route to me because when I opened the package the serum was all over the place.  </li>
            <li>frizzes in our hot and humid weather.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, however, the packing of the product for shipping was very poor and we lost over 1/3 of the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bain de Terre Recovery Complex for many, many years now.  </li>
            <li>Light, effective, not greasy and works well on medium thick, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and I use 3x a drop of the size of a dime on my damp hair; I spread it from the top to the ends.</li>
            <li>Authenticly helps repair split ends and smooths frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use this product before I straighten and blow dry my hair and It feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li>larger quantity, lower price with free shipping...</li>
            <li>My curly hair is very picky about anything in it.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>This serum really makes my hair shine and helps repairs my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many anti frizzing products over the years, but never REALLY got rid of them.  </li>
            <li>perhaps too much silicone slippery</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well it worked and even left my girls&#x27; hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but not the right product for truly hard to control hair like mine</li>
            <li>This leave in treatment (for me) does more than the other shine serums that just make your hair shiny &amp; smooth, this actually reconditions your hair.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I use, my hair is not greasy, and it ends up extremely shiny and silky, no frizz at all, even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li>I use a very small amount and my hair really looks good.  </li>
            <li>It protects when a flat iron is used and leaves it soft,shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>this product is healthy for youe hair not damaging like some other glosses.</li>
            <li>However, there is no denying how amazing my hair looks after applying a small quarter sized application of this product.  </li>
            <li>Seems to leave my hair in better condition without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight, thick, but very fine.  </li>
            <li>Since I color my hair, and I&#x27;m getting older (51 years now), and</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will not raise their price too high like Bain did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a little more of a scent.  </li>
            <li>Bain de Terre Recovery Complex is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its not incredibly thick  Where you should keep a bottle of this:   1.</li>
            <li>It is working very well so far.</li>
            <li>so we wouldn&#x27;t have any more crying battles with getting their hair done every morning, but a friend suggested I try this and gave me her bottle to try.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my ends everyday and makes my hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I use right after the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It will leave your hair feeling silky and soft too!  </li>
            <li>The product says to use 3-4 drops, but I usually use about a nickel-size amount on my hair (and I even use B&amp;B de-frizz on top of that sometimes).  </li>
            <li>Because I use it regularly, it was an extra bonus to be able to \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; to receiving the order and not have to manually order it each time I got low.</li>
            <li>MORE CRYING!  </li>
            <li>However, when I found I could get it online at less than half the price I was delighted.  </li>
            <li>I was seriously considering chopping it all off at that point, and this reconditioned my hair and made it possible for me to keep my very long, bleached hair for many more years.    </li>
            <li>I put some on my dry clean hair prior AND then AFTER flat-ironing, and my hair stays this way till I wash it.  </li>
            <li>I have used it with Sebastian, Biolage and Paul Mitchell, when I used it with cheaper shampoos like Pantene I had to use more recovery complex.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I had an old bottle I was finishing before I started using this Amazon purchase</li>
            <li>If you want manageable, soft, and non-greasy hair without frizz, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was told about this product and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>I buy this product for myself and my 93 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>There must be a difference between the serum with the green top and this one with the blue, because my hair feels differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves my hair silky smooth and can use it on wet or dry hair...</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be dry no matter how much I condition it.  </li>
            <li>applied just a little bit, but it still appeared greasy and didn&#x27;t seem to calm my frizzes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you use this product on a daily basis, no matter your hair type, but especially if you have any damage to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for dry, damaged, ethnic hair, frizzy, curly hair, etc</li>
            <li>I normally put this on after my hair is dry</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself years ago, and a little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li>This formula really can add a lot of shine if rubbed onto dry hair, and does provide some frizz control, but I found if put on wet hair it does very little, and if you use enough to get really good frizz control, it feels heavy and leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>I use the flat iron frequently</li>
            <li>No dry ends.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product based on my major satisfaction with the Bain de Terre line of hair care products.</li>
            <li>my hair is fine, dry and wavy--accentuates the curl, also like that I can use it on dry hair, with just a little water, to pep it up, too.</li>
            <li>Love this product - hard to find in stores!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a dependable yet cheap product like this, and it has lasted me for a long time.</li>
            <li>I keep trying other products, but keep returning to this one - it makes my long, fine hair shinier, less frizzy, and stronger.  </li>

            <li> how amazingly well it worked.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to oil sheen.   </li>
            <li> (it now has a pump that is nice) but they have also added a scent.</li>
            <li> I think its nice</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and it does its job.</li>
            <li> I had to crack up when I saw another review called this &amp;#34;mommy magic&amp;#34; as that is honestly what I was going to title my review, in fact when I grab the bottle after washing my daughters&#x27; hair I always say &amp;#34;time to add some magic&amp;#34; and they no longer fuss and cry about combing...</li>
            <li> I have been buying Bain de Terre Recovery from my hair dresser and always really liked it.  </li>
            <li> gives my hair a nice shine and at the age of 62</li>
            <li> I think it may have some but very light if any.</li>
            <li> This product make it very smooth.</li>
            <li> easy to use, and nice smell.  </li>
            <li> great for taming the fly aways and frizz on dry hair!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Magic</li>
            <li> Overall - excellent product - 4oz.</li>

            <li> an immediate improvement that leaves my hair smooth, not oily, and no frizz or dryness!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with it.</li>

            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> this serum has no alcohol which is better for your hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product for many years, but had difficulty finding it after I moved to Maine.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> so I did not notice they had changed more than the bottle...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works like magic to detangle and condition&#x27;  </li>
            <li> There is nothing I have found any better, been hairdresser over 45 years&lt;</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It came  in perfect shape in short time.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy again and shines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have yet to find anything that works better.</li>
            <li> I have looked every place for this product but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and have for many years and this product has been so&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure why, need to ask.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments from people on how healthy my hair was looking that they asked what I did.  </li>
            <li> this makes it look allot better.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....</li>
            <li> My hair is ultra frizzy, especially in summer, so this product has become my BFF (best friend forever).</li>
            <li> So glad I found this</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I love it so much is that it does NOT have a strong scent (most folks would probably say it has none at all, but I can detect a very light, pleasant one) -</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t greasy or weighed down, it tames the frizz beautifully, and it makes my fried split ends looks a lot more smooth and happy.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good price for it, too.</li>
            <li> This is best used on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I dry it, and it finishes off my styling perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it delivers a great experience and is the only one I use, I have been using this product for many years, I love it.</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job keeping my hair frizz free and has a lovely natural shine without feeling you&#x27;ve put anything in your hair.</li>
            <li> This works great and leaves a hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time and it is very effective the kind of hair I have.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li> It also makes it easy to run my fingers through my hair...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as easily.    </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky, shiny and easy to take care.</li>
            <li> I tried both Biosilk and Chi Silk infusion and could not stand the strong scents.  </li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair easy to get tangles out and subdues the frizz, yep.</li>
            <li> recommeded by my hairdresser, works fine</li>
            <li> I have color treated fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> lasts several months for me - worth full price at the salon, this lower price is a great deal!</li>
            <li> The name \\&quot;Recovery Complex\\&quot; is accurate for this product.  </li>
            <li> Buying the product at Amazon is a huge savings compared to buying it in a hair salon.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic after a hair color or perm.</li>
            <li> Although it has a light scent, I wish this product had no added scent.</li>
            <li> This product maintains my hair silky and smooth even during winter time.  </li>
            <li> Bain de Terre Recovery anti frizz, leaves my hair shiny and smooth always.</li>
            <li> Light almost not there scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Light weight product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when I don&#x27;t use it my hair isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is, and living in New Orleans with all the humidity my hair stays looking sleek and healthy even when it rains!  </li>
            <li> After the flat iron I finish the look with 2  drops - dime size of Biosilk Therapy, another great product.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that seems to just get better the longer</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and keep it short, so this seems to be the best for keeping my gray hair shiny and curls comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, oily, colored/damaged hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find it in my local salon and am thrilled to be able to get it from Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry hair!</li>
            <li> Also, it works very well with many differenct product lines -</li>
            <li> On a hunch, I tried Amazon, and two days later I looked good again.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I was really hoping this product would work well for me and my daughter as we have to battle</li>
            <li> Thanks once more, Bain de Terre ...</li>
            <li> Bain de Terre - recovery complex anti-frizz\\&quot; is wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see it in a bigger bottle available here on Amazon and plan to never run out.</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product just looks better and better up to the third day.</li>
            <li> Have a child with super curly hair that cries each time we brush or comb.  </li>
            <li> But I am very pleased to say it is the same</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and need a good treatment.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair beautiful and soft for several days.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and it makes a huge difference in keeping my hair styled even in high humidity (and my hair is naturally curly, and easily frizzes!).</li>
            <li> The Bain de Terre doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is worth a try if you&#x27;re experimenting with anti frizz/humidity serums.</li>
            <li> How RARE is that?</li>
            <li> Tangles just slip right out with NO</li>
            <li> I also use a foam gel most of the time, but no other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good for curly hair to keep friz down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife told me to try the Bain de Terre product (she wasn&#x27;t using it very much).  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down like most conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my hair very soft and fun to touch - says my husband!</li>
            <li> I have used so many different hair products for shine and softness.</li>
            <li> SImilar to Pearatin by Loma but better price</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> However it is the first week after a beard trim.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to wash my ton of hair every day.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li> When I tried this product for the first time I was amazed at how it TRULY got rid of the frizzes.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair smooth and alive.</li>
            <li> The seller put a piece of tape over the top and this has a pump instead of squeeze bottle like pictured, and the tape was either not placed properly or it shifted when in route to me because when I opened the package the serum was all over the place.  </li>
            <li> frizzes in our hot and humid weather.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, however, the packing of the product for shipping was very poor and we lost over 1/3 of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bain de Terre Recovery Complex for many, many years now.  </li>
            <li> Light, effective, not greasy and works well on medium thick, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I use 3x a drop of the size of a dime on my damp hair; I spread it from the top to the ends.</li>
            <li> Authenticly helps repair split ends and smooths frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product before I straighten and blow dry my hair and It feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li> larger quantity, lower price with free shipping...</li>
            <li> My curly hair is very picky about anything in it.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> This serum really makes my hair shine and helps repairs my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many anti frizzing products over the years, but never REALLY got rid of them.  </li>
            <li> perhaps too much silicone slippery</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well it worked and even left my girls&#x27; hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but not the right product for truly hard to control hair like mine</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment (for me) does more than the other shine serums that just make your hair shiny &amp; smooth, this actually reconditions your hair.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I use, my hair is not greasy, and it ends up extremely shiny and silky, no frizz at all, even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount and my hair really looks good.  </li>
            <li> It protects when a flat iron is used and leaves it soft,shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> this product is healthy for youe hair not damaging like some other glosses.</li>
            <li> However, there is no denying how amazing my hair looks after applying a small quarter sized application of this product.  </li>
            <li> Seems to leave my hair in better condition without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight, thick, but very fine.  </li>
            <li> Since I color my hair, and I&#x27;m getting older (51 years now), and</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will not raise their price too high like Bain did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a little more of a scent.  </li>
            <li> Bain de Terre Recovery Complex is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its not incredibly thick  Where you should keep a bottle of this:   1.</li>
            <li> It is working very well so far.</li>
            <li> so we wouldn&#x27;t have any more crying battles with getting their hair done every morning, but a friend suggested I try this and gave me her bottle to try.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my ends everyday and makes my hair feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I use right after the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair feeling silky and soft too!  </li>
            <li> The product says to use 3-4 drops, but I usually use about a nickel-size amount on my hair (and I even use B&amp;B de-frizz on top of that sometimes).  </li>
            <li> Because I use it regularly, it was an extra bonus to be able to \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; to receiving the order and not have to manually order it each time I got low.</li>
            <li> MORE CRYING!  </li>
            <li> However, when I found I could get it online at less than half the price I was delighted.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously considering chopping it all off at that point, and this reconditioned my hair and made it possible for me to keep my very long, bleached hair for many more years.    </li>
            <li> I put some on my dry clean hair prior AND then AFTER flat-ironing, and my hair stays this way till I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it with Sebastian, Biolage and Paul Mitchell, when I used it with cheaper shampoos like Pantene I had to use more recovery complex.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I had an old bottle I was finishing before I started using this Amazon purchase</li>
            <li> If you want manageable, soft, and non-greasy hair without frizz, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for myself and my 93 year old mother.  </li>
            <li> There must be a difference between the serum with the green top and this one with the blue, because my hair feels differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> leaves my hair silky smooth and can use it on wet or dry hair...</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry no matter how much I condition it.  </li>
            <li> applied just a little bit, but it still appeared greasy and didn&#x27;t seem to calm my frizzes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you use this product on a daily basis, no matter your hair type, but especially if you have any damage to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for dry, damaged, ethnic hair, frizzy, curly hair, etc</li>
            <li> I normally put this on after my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself years ago, and a little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> This formula really can add a lot of shine if rubbed onto dry hair, and does provide some frizz control, but I found if put on wet hair it does very little, and if you use enough to get really good frizz control, it feels heavy and leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> I use the flat iron frequently</li>
            <li> No dry ends.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product based on my major satisfaction with the Bain de Terre line of hair care products.</li>
            <li> my hair is fine, dry and wavy--accentuates the curl, also like that I can use it on dry hair, with just a little water, to pep it up, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product - hard to find in stores!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a dependable yet cheap product like this, and it has lasted me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products, but keep returning to this one - it makes my long, fine hair shinier, less frizzy, and stronger.  </li>
            <li> I leave my hair to dry naturally until it is almost dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it to the roots only where it&#x27;s dry and only use 2 to 3 drops, this stuff goes along way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s availabe in drugstores, local grocery store (Kroger, Walmart, HEB) and lasts just as long as this bottle if not longer.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little since too much will weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> I know it is thanks to Recovery Complex.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my hairdresser when my hair was 36\\&quot; long and bleached.  </li>
            <li> like to wear my hair long, I do whatever I can to make it comb without breaking and stronger.  </li>
            <li> By the way, like Camila, my hair is long, curly and dry.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I have tried several other brands, including salon brands, and I keep coming back to this.    </li>
            <li> just a small amount added after shampoo/conditioner and hair that before would take me 1/2 an hour of trying to be gentle and lots of crying now takes only a min.</li>
            <li> Searched for so long for a product like this!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product I notice that it was completely different than the other product I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, damaged hair.   </li>
            <li> I put a dime-sized amount in my palm and rub it around in my hands then streak it through their dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Dry, bleached, sun damaged hair will be improved with this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use organic or natural products without chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Since I have moved I have been looking for it in several salons in the area with no success.  </li>
            <li> Sad but true.</li>
            <li> I tried this on their hair (wet or dry) and have started to call it</li>
            <li> Apply to wet hair before you blow dry.</li>
            <li> Use it on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 bottles and both were opened on arrival and the packing was wet from the product.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this to gauge how harsh my shampoo is.    </li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m in a hurry and running out of the house with wet hair I will put it on wet.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly two years.</li>
            <li> and this is the only stuff that controls it and doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous products to tame the beast.</li>
            <li> Beware, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Because so little is needed, a bottle lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> if you use this every other day.</li>
            <li> I was not sure it was the same product since I was not purchasing it from a beauty supply house.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I purchased the larger bottle, but if you&#x27;d like to try it there is a small bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came in a really small bottle, I thought it&#x27;d be bigger for a 4.2floz</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work on other types of hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I use the flat iron after blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Other products have weighed it down so even with a shine it lacked body.  </li>
            <li> This Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Silky Shampoo is TERRIFIC</li>
            <li> You only use a drop of Bain de Terre Recovery Complex and your hair will shine.</li>
            <li> but at least has some essential oils for conditioning and protecting hair.  </li>
            <li> My family has searched for years for a product that would take care of our frizzy hair without leaving it greasy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> towel dry and apply a few drops before blow drying!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy reside like other products.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> made hair softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Just a little is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I got it in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have just enough wave in my hair to be irritating.</li>
            <li> and I needed a product that would give me some protection from the heat without leaving my hair oily, heavy and dull.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Gives my hair shine and manageability without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I need all the help I can get, my hair is thin and dry looks like cotton candy</li>
            <li> Both of my girls sleep on pillow pets (think of a flattened stuffed animal) and end up with the worst snarls and knots right in the back of their heads, no amount of conditioning was getting them out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past when a hair stylist&#x27;s efforts went awry and my hair was burned from a permanent solution.  </li>
            <li> No more wasting money on inferior products.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money, we&#x27;ll keep looking!</li>
            <li> No more frizz.</li>
            <li> This is really hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> It feels like a silicone product and is hard to wash off our hands so you can image how it coats the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is often hard to manage and can get easily dried out.  </li>
            <li> I try to stay at least an inch away.</li>
            <li> I was getting the recovery complex from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> have thick, curly hair and this serum keeps the curls curly and the frizz away, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive for a small bottle like this(about $13).</li>
            <li> I have seriously curly hair</li>
            <li> (2A on the curl scale and very thick.)</li>
            <li> The syrum spreads evenly through my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount calms frizz and gives hair a fuller appearance!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will save my bangs and they will stop their breakage soon as it&#x27;s getting a tad serious now!</li>
            <li> Has a very subtle scent but not a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only thing horrible about this was the shipment packaging.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does nothing to help.  </li>
            <li> I used some olive oil crap and it made my hair heavy and smelling nasty.</li>
            <li> tried it and was shocked</li>
            <li> Very unhappy and will not be ordering this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now, I have two girls who hate brushing out their tangles.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> recommeded by my hairdresser, works fine</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself years ago, and a little goes a LONG way!  Now, I have two girls who hate brushing out their tangles.  I tried this on their hair (wet or dry) and have started to call it \\&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Magic Stuff\\&quot;.  Work it into hair with your fingers and then brush...smooth as silk!  No complaining from the girls.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for quite some time.  It is an excellent product, however, the packing of the product for shipping was very poor and we lost over 1/3 of the product.  I had ordered 2 bottles and both were opened on arrival and the packing was wet from the product.  It was a mess.  I contact Amazon with my compliant and have not received any response.  Very unhappy and will not be ordering this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment (for me) does more than the other shine serums that just make your hair shiny &amp; smooth, this actually reconditions your hair.  The name \\&quot;Recovery Complex\\&quot; is accurate for this product.  I have been using this for 15 years.  It used to be called just \\&quot;recovery complex.\\&quot;  It was recommended to me by my hairdresser when my hair was 36\\&quot; long and bleached.  I was seriously considering chopping it all off at that point, and this reconditioned my hair and made it possible for me to keep my very long, bleached hair for many more years.    Since then I have cut my hair and dyed it over and over again looking for a color I like.  After all the damage from the dyes, this product, again, saved my hair.  Like other reviewers I have tried several other brands, including salon brands, and I keep coming back to this.    Also, it works very well with many differenct product lines - I have used it with Sebastian, Biolage and Paul Mitchell, when I used it with cheaper shampoos like Pantene I had to use more recovery complex.  I actually use this to gauge how harsh my shampoo is.    Overall - excellent product - 4oz. lasts several months for me - worth full price at the salon, this lower price is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Why you should consider to buy this:   1. Its relatively inexpensive  2. It smells wonderful  3. Its not incredibly thick  Where you should keep a bottle of this:   1. Your desk drawer at work - mid morning or mid afternoon pick up  2. Your gym bag   This is best used on dry hair.  Nice alternative to oil sheen.   Highly recommended for dry, damaged, ethnic hair, frizzy, curly hair, etc...      This product soaks into the hair folicule, and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue (and I use over a quarter size in my hair)!    I have dry, frizzy, damaged hair.   Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. It makes your hair feel great. It is fantastic after a hair color or perm. It&#x27;s a little hard to find. I was trilled when I found out you could buy it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> have used for several years--my hair is fine, dry and wavy--accentuates the curl, also like that I can use it on dry hair, with just a little water, to pep it up, too. I also use a foam gel most of the time, but no other conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry no matter how much I condition it.  My wife told me to try the Bain de Terre product (she wasn&#x27;t using it very much).  WOW an immediate improvement that leaves my hair smooth, not oily, and no frizz or dryness!  Now I catch my wife swiping my bottle to apply on her hair after getting out of the pool to help detangle and comb her hair without any struggle or breaking.  This stuff is the bomb.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different hair products for shine and softness. This is the best of all the products.  I have very long hair and need a good treatment. Just use a little since too much will weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> Always helps my hair!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This formula really can add a lot of shine if rubbed onto dry hair, and does provide some frizz control, but I found if put on wet hair it does very little, and if you use enough to get really good frizz control, it feels heavy and leaves a residue. Nice scent, but not the right product for truly hard to control hair like mine (2A on the curl scale and very thick.)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for that static you get in your hair in the winter.  Beware, a little bit goes a long way. Don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
            <li> I usually use organic or natural products without chemicals.  However, there is no denying how amazing my hair looks after applying a small quarter sized application of this product.  Although it has a light scent, I wish this product had no added scent.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Makes your hair feel so good and removes all the tangles after washing. Overall, I am very happy with it. Very quick shipment. I got it in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. I can no longer find it in my local salon and am thrilled to be able to get it from Amazon</li>
            <li> Makes my hair manageable without being oily or gloppy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Has a very subtle scent but not a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;. This is really hard to find in stores so I&#x27;m delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product maintains my hair silky and smooth even during winter time.  I love this product and I&#x27;m going to order again.</li>
            <li> made hair softer and less frizzy. easy to use, and nice smell.  very happy with it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great company, did not receive product and they immediately shipped another.  Eventually received 1st order as welll and was told to keep it for inconvenience.  Really above and beyond.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now..don&#x27;t see any difference except it gives a shine to the hair..doesn&#x27;t seem to control any frizz at all. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Bain de Terre Recovery Complex is amazing. I&#x27;ve used it in the past when a hair stylist&#x27;s efforts went awry and my hair was burned from a permanent solution.  This product saved and restored my hair.  My hair dresser has told me in the past I have the strongest hair she&#x27;s ever worked on, thanks to this product! I stopped using it when I couldn&#x27;t get it locally and recently discovered my bangs were breaking from using my straightening rod. So I started looking as the local guy told me it had been discontinued. I cannot tell you how thrilled I was to find it on Amazon.com!  I&#x27;m hoping it will save my bangs and they will stop their breakage soon as it&#x27;s getting a tad serious now! I highly recommend you use this product on a daily basis, no matter your hair type, but especially if you have any damage to your hair.  It will leave your hair feeling silky and soft too!  Hubby loves that!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for about 10 years and it continues to be the best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly hair and this serum keeps the curls curly and the frizz away, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this product...this serum has no alcohol which is better for your hair. I was using a name brand product but have now switched to Bain de Terre.  I even had my daughter change to this product. Researching the web to locate the best deal was with Amazon...larger quantity, lower price with free shipping...Amazon outdid them all. So if your are using serum, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I used this product for many years, but had difficulty finding it after I moved to Maine. On a hunch, I tried Amazon, and two days later I looked good again.</li>
            <li> Great price.  SImilar to Pearatin by Loma but better price if you use this every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now.  My curly hair is very picky about anything in it.  This keeps my hair very soft and fun to touch - says my husband!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used. No matter how much I use, my hair is not greasy, and it ends up extremely shiny and silky, no frizz at all, even in the most humid weather. Skip the drugstore brands, and try this! I&#x27;ve gone from using several products on my hair to only this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Love it! I have color treated fine hair but lots of it. I normally put this on after my hair is dry but if I&#x27;m in a hurry and running out of the house with wet hair I will put it on wet. It gives my hair great shine without a greasy look. I don&#x27;t apply to the roots of my hair. I try to stay at least an inch away. It also makes it easy to run my fingers through my hair...it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle as easily.    I regularly get compliments on the condition of my hair. I know it is thanks to Recovery Complex. I can see the difference when I run out....UPDATE..... I had an old bottle I was finishing before I started using this Amazon purchase so I did not notice they had changed more than the bottle...(it now has a pump that is nice) but they have also added a scent. I think its nice but it wasn&#x27;t there before. All and all it seems as if it still works the same on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, curly, course hair. I have bought numerous products to tame the beast. Bain de Terre Recovery anti frizz, leaves my hair shiny and smooth always. It protects when a flat iron is used and leaves it soft,shiny, and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy reside like other products. I love it. No more wasting money on inferior products. A must try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bain de Terre Recovery Complex for many, many years now.  I keep trying other products, but keep returning to this one - it makes my long, fine hair shinier, less frizzy, and stronger.  One of the reasons I love it so much is that it does NOT have a strong scent (most folks would probably say it has none at all, but I can detect a very light, pleasant one) - I tried both Biosilk and Chi Silk infusion and could not stand the strong scents.  The product says to use 3-4 drops, but I usually use about a nickel-size amount on my hair (and I even use B&amp;B de-frizz on top of that sometimes).  Since I color my hair, and I&#x27;m getting older (51 years now), and like to wear my hair long, I do whatever I can to make it comb without breaking and stronger.  This product helps ALOT!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it very much.  I was not sure it was the same product since I was not purchasing it from a beauty supply house.  But I am very pleased to say it is the same and I am very satisfied with the ease of ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Gives my hair shine and manageability without being stiff or sticky.  Been using it for ten years.</li>
            <li> This Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Silky Shampoo is TERRIFIC AND SO ARE THE SELLERS!!  Very prompt shipping and no problems.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and it makes a huge difference in keeping my hair styled even in high humidity (and my hair is naturally curly, and easily frizzes!).</li>
            <li> All this product did was make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  I have thin hair that is often hard to manage and can get easily dried out.  I was getting the recovery complex from my hairdresser.  Since I have moved I have been looking for it in several salons in the area with no success.  I was happy to be able to find and order it online.  Because I use it regularly, it was an extra bonus to be able to \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; to receiving the order and not have to manually order it each time I got low.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing my hair.  My hair is fine and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down like most conditioners.  I use a very small amount and my hair really looks good.  No dry ends.</li>
            <li> Authenticly helps repair split ends and smooths frizzy dry hair. this product is healthy for youe hair not damaging like some other glosses. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and highly reccomend it! towel dry and apply a few drops before blow drying! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and it does its job. I have very fine, oily, colored/damaged hair and it works really well. My hair isn&#x27;t greasy or weighed down, it tames the frizz beautifully, and it makes my fried split ends looks a lot more smooth and happy.</li>
            <li> I had to crack up when I saw another review called this &amp;#34;mommy magic&amp;#34; as that is honestly what I was going to title my review, in fact when I grab the bottle after washing my daughters&#x27; hair I always say &amp;#34;time to add some magic&amp;#34; and they no longer fuss and cry about combing... just a small amount added after shampoo/conditioner and hair that before would take me 1/2 an hour of trying to be gentle and lots of crying now takes only a min. or two and no tears. Both of my girls sleep on pillow pets (think of a flattened stuffed animal) and end up with the worst snarls and knots right in the back of their heads, no amount of conditioning was getting them out and I was at my witts end.... I remembered I had some of this product, tried it and was shocked how amazingly well it worked. I was thrilled to see it in a bigger bottle available here on Amazon and plan to never run out.</li>
            <li> Product works as intended.  I&#x27;d like a little more of a scent.  I think it may have some but very light if any.</li>
            <li> I recommend John Frieda frizz ease. It&#x27;s availabe in drugstores, local grocery store (Kroger, Walmart, HEB) and lasts just as long as this bottle if not longer.  The Bain de Terre doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is worth a try if you&#x27;re experimenting with anti frizz/humidity serums.</li>
            <li> This product works like magic to detangle and condition&#x27;  There is nothing I have found any better, been hairdresser over 45 years&lt;br /&gt;It is also wonderful to use on my Yorkie to get tangles out of their hair.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair silky smooth and can use it on wet or dry hair...great deal and would purchase again..thanks! love it</li>
            <li> This item which was suggested by a barber does seem to work. However it is the first week after a beard trim. Lets see wht happens when after a month or two.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years.  Makes my fine hair easy to get tangles out and subdues the frizz, yep.</li>
            <li> It works great. A good price and it arrived quickly. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it has become too expensive. I use Biosilk now. Hopefully they will not raise their price too high like Bain did.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Bain de Terre Recovery from my hair dresser and always really liked it.  However, when I found I could get it online at less than half the price I was delighted.  It came  in perfect shape in short time.</li>
            <li> My family has searched for years for a product that would take care of our frizzy hair without leaving it greasy and weighted down. We found this product and our search has now ended. If you want manageable, soft, and non-greasy hair without frizz, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Searched for so long for a product like this! Light almost not there scent. I use it on wet hair. Works well. Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am 67 and my hair was beginning to lose it luster. I was told about this product and wow what a difference. My hair is healthy again and shines.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that seems to just get better the longer you leave it on. For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to wash my ton of hair every day. This product just looks better and better up to the third day.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wash my hair without this product I have used it for over 20 yrs!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and love it. This serum really makes my hair shine and helps repairs my damaged hair. Buying the product at Amazon is a huge savings compared to buying it in a hair salon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair silky smooth. I use this on my ends everyday and makes my hair feel soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a dependable yet cheap product like this, and it has lasted me for a long time. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my hair very soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have yet to find anything that works better.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for myself and my 93 year old mother.  She loves the shine and anti frizz that it provides.</li>
            <li> Have a child with super curly hair that cries each time we brush or comb.  This works great and leaves a hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I have used his product for years - I have just enough wave in my hair to be irritating. I hate waxy, heavy products and this one is perfect! Light, effective, not greasy and works well on medium thick, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I have looked every place for this product but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store.  So I was so&lt;br /&gt;glad to find it on Amazon.  I color my hair and have for many years and this product has been so&lt;br /&gt;good to keep my hair in good shape.  Thank you</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight, thick, but very fine.  Other products have weighed it down so even with a shine it lacked body.  You only use a drop of Bain de Terre Recovery Complex and your hair will shine.</li>
            <li> It is working very well so far. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> There must be a difference between the serum with the green top and this one with the blue, because my hair feels differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, need to ask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many anti frizzing products over the years, but never REALLY got rid of them.  When I tried this product for the first time I was amazed at how it TRULY got rid of the frizzes.  I received so many compliments from people on how healthy my hair was looking that they asked what I did.  I told them, let them try it themselves and they too were amazed.  If you flatiron your hair you can use it before ironing or after.  I put some on my dry clean hair prior AND then AFTER flat-ironing, and my hair stays this way till I wash it.  That&#x27;s why I purchased the larger bottle, but if you&#x27;d like to try it there is a small bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is, and living in New Orleans with all the humidity my hair stays looking sleek and healthy even when it rains!  Enough said.  Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love this product, great anti-frizz and adds shine, does not leave  hair oily and you can use every day!&lt;br /&gt;period</li>
            <li> I love it! it&#x27;s not greasy gives my hair a nice shine and at the age of 62 I need all the help I can get, my hair is thin and dry looks like cotton candy this makes it look allot better. I don&#x27;t put it to the roots only where it&#x27;s dry and only use 2 to 3 drops, this stuff goes along way. I hope this will help</li>
            <li> I love this product, it delivers a great experience and is the only one I use, I have been using this product for many years, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a hair show many years ago and it worked great.  I thought it was the same product, but it doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on my hair.  Light weight product. Antifrizz + increased shine.  Have used it for years and love it.  Seems to leave my hair in better condition without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years based on stylist recommendation. I think it does a great job keeping my hair frizz free and has a lovely natural shine without feeling you&#x27;ve put anything in your hair. Apply to wet hair before you blow dry. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time and it is very effective the kind of hair I have.</li>
            <li> Love this product - hard to find in stores!!  Just a small amount calms frizz and gives hair a fuller appearance!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I used some olive oil crap and it made my hair heavy and smelling nasty. This makes my hair smooth and alive. SHINY too.</li>
            <li> I have seriously curly hair and this is the only stuff that controls it and doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and crunchy. This is a pretty good price for it, too.</li>
            <li> perhaps too much silicone slippery but at least has some essential oils for conditioning and protecting hair.  Would like something that includes strengthening. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I actually like the product itself, although I have ordered it before and this batch seems different and the packaging is not as pictured. The only thing horrible about this was the shipment packaging. The seller put a piece of tape over the top and this has a pump instead of squeeze bottle like pictured, and the tape was either not placed properly or it shifted when in route to me because when I opened the package the serum was all over the place.  I probably lost about 1/5 of the product in the packaging material.</li>
            <li> I use this product before I straighten and blow dry my hair and It feels nice and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed when I don&#x27;t use it my hair isn&#x27;t as smooth.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was NOT the item pictured.  Please check your stock and correct the photograph.  I have since returned the items in this order.</li>
            <li> It came in a really small bottle, I thought it&#x27;d be bigger for a 4.2floz but it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;I applied just a little bit, but it still appeared greasy and didn&#x27;t seem to calm my frizzes. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive for a small bottle like this(about $13).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....great for taming the fly aways and frizz on dry hair! And never makes hair greasy! I can&#x27;t do without it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a number of years and try not to run out of it.  Does a good job for me.</li>
            <li> Just the best. I&#x27;ve been using for years.  My granddaughter (9) also says it&#x27;s the best detangler there is.  And it never makes your hair greasy.  Because so little is needed, a bottle lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I was really hoping this product would work well for me and my daughter as we have to battle frizzes in our hot and humid weather.  Unfortunately, it does nothing to help.  It feels like a silicone product and is hard to wash off our hands so you can image how it coats the hair.  Another waste of money, we&#x27;ll keep looking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to help with my daughters&#x27; tangled hair and nothing else has seemed to work.  I tried this serum and it is AMAZING!  I put a dime-sized amount in my palm and rub it around in my hands then streak it through their dry hair.  Tangles just slip right out with NO MORE CRYING!  I was just about to chop their hair short so we wouldn&#x27;t have any more crying battles with getting their hair done every morning, but a friend suggested I try this and gave me her bottle to try.  I was amazed at how well it worked and even left my girls&#x27; hair shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;m so happy I never have to saturate their heads with detangling spray again!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product based on my major satisfaction with the Bain de Terre line of hair care products. I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times, but it does deliver what it claims to do ... frizz-free hair AT LAST! It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. The syrum spreads evenly through my very thick hair. My hair is ultra frizzy, especially in summer, so this product has become my BFF (best friend forever). Finally, a hair care product that does what it claims to do! How RARE is that? Thanks once more, Bain de Terre ... you&#x27;re the VERY BEST</li>
            <li> Great for damaged hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is like the hair of Camila Alves, the model  -  just to have an idea of the texture of my hair.  I use the flat iron frequently and I needed a product that would give me some protection from the heat without leaving my hair oily, heavy and dull.\\&quot; Bain de Terre - recovery complex anti-frizz\\&quot; is wonderful!!!  It leaves my hair silky, shiny and easy to take care.I am impressed with this product. Usually I use the flat iron after blow drying my hair. I have long hair, and I use 3x a drop of the size of a dime on my damp hair; I spread it from the top to the ends. I leave my hair to dry naturally until it is almost dry. Then I blow dry my hair and I use right after the flat iron. Since I started using this product I notice that it was completely different than the other product I was using before.  It makes my hair beautiful and soft for several days. After the flat iron I finish the look with 2  drops - dime size of Biosilk Therapy, another great product. These combination let my hair really nice! I don&#x27;t know how it would work on other types of hair. By the way, like Camila, my hair is long, curly and dry. This product make it very smooth. I hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I love how smooth it makes my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly two years.</li>
            <li> This item is like liquid gold. I have used it on my hair for 20 years and paired with Biolage hydrasource shampoo and matrix conditioning balm, you will have beautiful hair every day!  I have always got compliments on my hair. Use it on wet and dry hair. Just a little is all it takes.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this, it&#x27;s unavailable here, so I bought both bottles you had listed...There is nothing like it, Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect. No more frizz.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti&#x3D;frizz shine product that doesn&#x27;t build up on the hair. You only need to use a very small amount. It&#x27;s great for dry hair!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for your hair.  Does not leave any &amp;#34;build-up&amp;#34;.  Your hair is so shinny.  This product has been around for years!</li>
            <li> Repairs damaged hair, has been around forever.  Dry, bleached, sun damaged hair will be improved with this product. I have slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This helps my hair maintain its shine. I use it after I dry it, and it finishes off my styling perfectly. Great product!</li>
            <li> Not the product I remembered. Sad but true. Relieved I bought the smallest bottle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and keep it short, so this seems to be the best for keeping my gray hair shiny and curls comfortable.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and protective for hair.  Can use every day.  Good for curly hair to keep friz down.</li>
