            <li> It is the very best I have used to sharpen Maybelline pencils</li>
            <li> Finally a sharpener that works!  This one really sharpens.  It doesn&#x27;t chew up the pencil.  Perfect point.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and it still is working.  Some other cheep sharpeners chewed up the pencil and didn&#x27;t make a point.</li>
            <li> It is convenient for sharpening my eyeliner but kind of difficult to clean the scarps.</li>
            <li> perfect and great price! I was hesitant to buy this one since someone else&#x27;s review had indicated that it wouldn&#x27;t fit larger pencils.

            <li> Perfection. Works beautifully without breaking pencils or getting jammed. Sharpens eye pencils very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years and years! The cover hinges broke  but I still use it. Just bought identical one from e.l.f. but its too small for large pencils. This one fits fine and sharpens very well.</li>
            <li> I had a sharpener that kept breaking my eyeliner pencil and it was so annoying! This one works perfectly and is at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the first cosmetic sharpener that I&#x27;ve used that actually works! I was SO nervous about sharpening my new &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; eyeliner pencil because all my previous sharpeners just ate up the pencil and made it break off even worse.

Very nice quality sharpener!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and it has a hidden stick to push out/clean any shavings left behind.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades.  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> So odd. had trouble sharpening my Maybelline eyebrow pencil so I figured the same brand of sharpener would work. Not hardly. I&#x27;m not just inept either. My girlfriend works at a make up counter and se mangled the pencil by using this too. Oh well, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, comes with two easy to use sharpeners; can sharpen all pencil sizes.</li>
            <li> Too small for big pencil.</li>

            <li> Awesome! Perfect size to sharpen my eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> does a very good job with eyebrow pencils. makes a nice point.</li>
            <li> i got a different one than what was on the photo. Annoying</li>
            <li> Does a great job of sharpening eyeliners and lipliners and containing the shavings.  Snap off the clear plastic lid and there is a tool for getting out small pieces of liner which can keep you from getting a good point.  I have one in my travel kit and one at home.</li>
