            <li>So I bought this to try to combat it, &amp; it did do its job of making my hair thicker for sure.</li>
            <li>but when I eperienced it, I was devasted but please look on the hairfinity and look at the results and see most people&#x27;s hair got thinner</li>
            <li>Easy  to swallow</li>
            <li>For these people, it is best to take only one capsule a day for the first month until their body becomes adjusted to it.</li>
            <li>I recommended please feel free to buy</li>
            <li>Very good product I can stared see the different on my hair,growing fast</li>
            <li>It was ok didn&#x27;t really see hair growth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>But overall, nothing too amazing about it, wouldn&#x27;t swear by it.</li>
            <li>I love shopping on Amazon and if you are thinking about trying this product I would recommend trying it, based on the fact that I did not experience any side effects, which I am both sensitive and aware of.</li>
            <li>thank u very much</li>
            <li>I am very healthy with a healthy diet, hair care, and exercise routine, yet after taking Hairfinity for 5 months, I have experienced major shedding, excessive facial and body hair, and brittle nails, yet my hair grows at the same or slower rate than before.</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>They seem to be working helping my hair get back healthy</li>
            <li>I saw a change the first week of taking Hairfinity Hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>I was a happy excited person ready to try hair vitamins and didn&#x27;t pay any mind to the comments that mentioned their hair got thin</li>
            <li>I can see some positive differences in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will need to try the product a few more months to see a significant amount of hair growth.</li>
            <li>I did not have to consume large amounts of water.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and so does my daughter and her friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to order mote.</li>
            <li>I was told that my hair would grow so now I am looking for something that really works.</li>
            <li>and my hair is now devastatingly much shorter than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any changes and it&#x27;s a rip off to pay this much money for 1 month supply, would expect some results sooner.</li>
            <li>and I realize that I paid too much for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of using Hairfinity I have more thatn three and a half inchecs of new hair....</li>
            <li>they replied that Hairfinty helps to improve the health of the new hair that is growing from the scalp.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, even with drinking a ton of water I still experienced headaches and dizziness that actually caused vomiting.</li>
            <li>and im still waiting on it to clear up</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my hair just doesn&#x27;t go fast or this product can&#x27;t work fully because I take other medications.</li>
            <li>Long hair isn&#x27;t worth all that trouble for me.</li>
            <li>Hairfinity most certainly made my hair grow faster, but I ended up having to cut three inches off when my formally thick hair became thin, brittle, and even began to break.</li>

            <li> When I told them I had not seen a difference after taking a month supply and that my hair was still very thin in the top and sides</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, I recently went natural &amp; did the big chop ,my hair has grown a lot in the last three months</li>
            <li> A small percentage of people are sensitive to Biotin, one of the ingredients, and can breakout from taking it.</li>
            <li> the what I expected ...</li>
            <li> I only used hair infinity for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say in a few weeks my hair grew 50%.</li>
            <li> He suggested taking one pill every other day to start.</li>
            <li> This product was not worth it</li>
            <li> It will cost less</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair grew some but not a significant amount.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re in need of a little boost with your hair, this will def help.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m experiencing  the same as others with this product, my hair has started to shed and thin with this product  </li>
            <li> The price on this product is crazy high.  </li>
            <li> Something is definitely not right with this Product!!</li>
            <li> The product came well conserved, but the recipient was really old that I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> they get the growth but their hair is thin and that is not true results.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that It said &amp;#34;month supply&amp;#34; - one a day.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> It did not thicken my hair or fill in the areas where it is thin.</li>
            <li> omg when I tell you when I was pressing my hair at the end of the 3 months, my hair was extremely thin, and even if you look at the results and pictures on Instagram,</li>
            <li> I also found out that I was using the wrong shampoo</li>

            <li> Thank you for your review. I wish I had researched better before I invested in 10 bottles of it. I am very healthy with a healthy diet, hair care, and exercise routine, yet after taking Hairfinity for 5 months, I have experienced major shedding, excessive facial and body hair, and brittle nails, yet my hair grows at the same or slower rate than before. I also drink plenty of water throughout the day upward of a gallon with no soda, caffeine, or alcohol consumption. It may work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair looks healthier.It is not any longer but it&#x27;s only been a month. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it. I really like it, and so does my daughter and her friends.</li>
            <li> THESE VITAMINS ARE AWESOME GREAT PRODUCT AND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT DESIGN TO DO I WILL DEFINATELY GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 5 STAR RATING SO GO  BUY IT PEOPLE YOU WILL BE VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> I am seeing hair growth and nail growth. I would recommend this product to others. My nails are becoming very strong since using this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product I can stared see the different on my hair,growing fast the what I expected ...thank u very much</li>
            <li> I have not seen any progress.  Easy  to swallow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inly been a month but my hair is fuller and thicker</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li> The product came well conserved, but the recipient was really old that I was afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m ready to order mote.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company concerning my face breaking out they told me that Hair-finity does not cause acne. A small percentage of people are sensitive to Biotin, one of the ingredients, and can breakout from taking it. For these people, it is best to take only one capsule a day for the first month until their body becomes adjusted to it. When I told them I had not seen a difference after taking a month supply and that my hair was still very thin in the top and sides they replied that Hairfinty helps to improve the health of the new hair that is growing from the scalp. If the length or ends of your hair is already damaged, you will need to correct it externally. Hair Breakage limits the hair growth. To reduce breakage, they suggest that I  would need to implement a hair care regimen.Hair-finity may or may not help with alopecia depending on the type and cause of it. For some types of alopecia, the follicle is still viable and Hairfinity can help the hair to grow back. If the follicle has been damaged, it may not help the hair to grow. We have had customers that reported hair growth after alopecia while using Hair-finity. I was told that my hair would grow so now I am looking for something that really works.</li>
            <li> I love these pills! My hair is very thick, I recently went natural &amp; did the big chop ,my hair has grown a lot in the last three months</li>
            <li> They seem to be working helping my hair get back healthy but ive only been taking them for two months.</li>
            <li> this product help a lot if you want to grow up your hair its awesome I recommended please feel free to buy</li>
            <li> Does work but drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> The price on this product is crazy high.  You can get one months supply from the actual company for $24.99.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m experiencing  the same as others with this product, my hair has started to shed and thin with this product  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was happening with my hair until I went back and re-read the reviews of this product  I&#x27;m definitely not going to reorder and I have stop taking this product  Please do not get this product.. Something is definitely not right with this Product!!</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  I can see some positive differences in my hair.</li>
            <li> I saw no change at all.</li>
            <li> So good i just ordered another bottle</li>
            <li> Does work. Hair did grow but took longer than 2 months. It did not thicken my hair or fill in the areas where it is thin. Maybe my hair just doesn&#x27;t go fast or this product can&#x27;t work fully because I take other medications.</li>
            <li> I was very delighted with the results I received from taking Hairfinity Hair Vitamins.  I have been using them for 5 months and my hair which was short comes to my shoulders, when people ask if its mine I say yes it is and I let them know what I have used to increase the growth of my hair Hairfinity!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I definitely recommend.  My hair has grown 2 inches in a month.... Love it</li>
            <li> I just find any change in my hair</li>
            <li> It was ok didn&#x27;t really see hair growth</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! I thought people were lying and it was not going to make you break out and guess what? it made me break out like never before.....do not purchase pleaseee!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m starting to see some results. My hair isn&#x27;t shading like it use to and it&#x27;s grow in areas where there were breakage.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this product so I decided to try. Unfortunately, even with drinking a ton of water I still experienced headaches and dizziness that actually caused vomiting. I consulted my doctor and he said that this is almost 3 times the amount of vitamins one should have in a day. He suggested taking one pill every other day to start. I also broke out. Long hair isn&#x27;t worth all that trouble for me.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it does work, but it caused my skin to break out and im still waiting on it to clear up and I drink plenty of water. I&#x27;ll try it again just to see if I do it longer will that side effect subside but for now im staying away from it, but again it does work.</li>
            <li> A very good product.  Works well</li>
            <li> Buy from hair infinity website. It will cost less</li>
            <li> They are are really good pills.... But cheaper on the actually hairfinity website.</li>
            <li> I only used hair infinity for a few weeks. I did notice that my hair grew some but not a significant amount. Overall, I would say in a few weeks my hair grew 50%. I will need to try the product a few more months to see a significant amount of hair growth. I would purchase again and yes it does work.</li>
            <li> I saw a change the first week of taking Hairfinity Hair vitamins. I love love love it I also found out that I was using the wrong shampoo</li>
            <li> BREAKAGE &amp; THINNING! Hairfinity most certainly made my hair grow faster, but I ended up having to cut three inches off when my formally thick hair became thin, brittle, and even began to break. This product was not worth it and my hair is now devastatingly much shorter than it used to be. Do not use!!</li>
            <li> I had been using invisible part wigs, and the hair in the front where the clips would rub against my scalp pulled my hair out. So I bought this to try to combat it, &amp; it did do its job of making my hair thicker for sure. But overall, nothing too amazing about it, wouldn&#x27;t swear by it. But if you&#x27;re in need of a little boost with your hair, this will def help. The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that It said &amp;#34;month supply&amp;#34; - one a day. Except for the fact that it was 3 pills short. I have not bought from this vendor since.</li>
            <li> Just started to using it about a week ago.  Cannot say if it is working yet.  Too soon to tell.  Heard from friends that they can see a difference after about 30 days</li>
            <li> my transaction for the product went well and I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any changes and it&#x27;s a rip off to pay this much money for 1 month supply, would expect some results sooner.</li>
            <li> I did not experience the breakout of bumps on my face that some people had written about in their reviews. I did not have to consume large amounts of water. My daughter swears by this product. My hair did stop falling out on the sides and in the front. But my daughter bought this product from another source and I realize that I paid too much for this product on Amazon. If I decide to purchase it again, I will purchase it through her source. I love shopping on Amazon and if you are thinking about trying this product I would recommend trying it, based on the fact that I did not experience any side effects, which I am both sensitive and aware of.</li>
            <li> I took hairfinity for 3 months and the length came, but omg when I tell you when I was pressing my hair at the end of the 3 months, my hair was extremely thin, and even if you look at the results and pictures on Instagram, yeah they get the growth but their hair is thin and that is not true results. So beware. I was a happy excited person ready to try hair vitamins and didn&#x27;t pay any mind to the comments that mentioned their hair got thin but when I eperienced it, I was devasted but please look on the hairfinity and look at the results and see most people&#x27;s hair got thinner</li>
            <li> Definitely does what it says! I got a pixie two months ago now I have a short bob! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
