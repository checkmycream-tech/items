            <li>Purology Pure Volume is a great shampoo, one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used this consistently and it has to be one of the best, if not the best shampoo available.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good, I have to use a lot more to get a good lather</li>
            <li>And I love their colour care condition - smells minty and light and wonderful -</li>
            <li>I do however love the leave in repair conditioner by Pureolgy!</li>
            <li>Be sure to try the conditioner too!</li>
            <li>I love this product line!  </li>

            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>It has so many good aspects</li>
            <li>It really protects my color, gives my hair body &amp; smells great too!!!</li>
            <li>: A week ago,I bought/used Pureology Hydrate conditioner &amp; it gave nice bounce &amp; silky ends.</li>
            <li>The old Pureology Volume shampoo is awesome!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best volume shampoo out there.  </li>
            <li>I dont have to use much at all, lathers up real nicely.</li>
            <li>Fragance is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li>Still working on a solution as first use was great)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I find the smell potent and displeasing.</li>
            <li>My favorite sister-in-law sent me this shampoo to try.  </li>
            <li>I was glad that I came across this one.</li>
            <li>My thining hair, I&#x27;m 61, has more body, looks thicker and is easier to style than ever before.  </li>
            <li>I also love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks, feels and moves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any better that the shampoo</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>is on top of already having used the Volume Conditioner.)</li>
            <li>The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent</li>
            <li>The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t think of a better description).  </li>
            <li>The salon I go to sells this for almost $9 more than Amazon, so you won&#x27;t find a better deal than here.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft (even without the conditioner).  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and my hair does feel clean after I use it, but I really need help with volume.  </li>
            <li>A cute little heart sticker now says, &amp;#34; two is better than one, best used with conditioner&amp;#34;... What isn&#x27;t said is that you can&#x27;t walk out of your home if you don&#x27;t use both!&lt;br /&gt;Shame on them!!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I use the Antifade \\&quot;Holdfast\\&quot; on wet hair and it works the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Pureology is hailed as one of the more high-end hair product lines available.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the product arived fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>very nicely moisturizing not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so popular, despite the higher price tag.</li>
            <li>My stylist uses this on my hair (fine, jaw length and highlighted twice a year)</li>
            <li>hair is in good condition, color treated, straight and fine but full.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for that smooth, silky finished look, it won&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li>it was great before, but now it&#x27;s a completely different shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Hair retains vibrant color, smells nice and hair feels revitalized.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>After conditioning, my hair is manageable (although I find I need to use a significant amount of the conditioner to get there).</li>
            <li>Save your money - spend some more but buy the real one!</li>
            <li>Pureology shampoo was instantly better at first.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Pureology Pure Volume for more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo after trying the Paul Mitchell brand and thinking that a moisturizing brand would be better.  </li>
            <li>and it would lather up great on a wet head of hair.  </li>
            <li>and this really does give me a lot more volume.</li>
            <li>my hair, the only way Pureology Volume Shampoo works is to use a good conditioner (Biolage Moisture Balm or the Level 3 conditioner that comes with L&#x27;Oreal color -</li>
            <li>my hair, the only way Pureology Volume Shampoo works is to use a good conditioner (Biolage Moisture Balm or the Level 3 conditioner that comes with L&#x27;Oreal color -</li>
            <li>My hair is super-clean, not stripped, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I love Pureology and much to my dismay</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend if you have fine, color-treated hair that needs some volume!</li>
            <li>I have very straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>Relying on the loyal patronage of a group of trusting consumers to use a repackaged substandard product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The reviewer that said it &#x27;smells like an old man&#x27; was right on the money, but once I used the matching conditioner (which smells nice)</li>
            <li>I have to use more conditioner than I ever thought I should use, and I have to leave the conditioner in longer than normal.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product on Amazon and at half the price.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality shampoo, makes you hair feel great and it;s well concentrated so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It keeps my color looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>But for me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is worth the $$$$</li>
            <li>It did take me  about a week or two to get it right, though.</li>
            <li>I started using this right after I had my hair colored about 3 weeks ago</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers ok, but my hair needed major conditioner both days in order to get my fingers thru it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With fine, straight hair and a lifetime of never being able to go a day without washing my hair, I have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially for people who color their hair and it&#x27;s nice even if you don&#x27;t color.</li>
            <li>and I only go through 2 bottles of shampoo and 2 conditioner a year at most (1 volume and 1 straightening each).</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair manageable and along with Neutrogena deep conditioner, in fabulous shape!</li>
            <li>A first.</li>
            <li>After three uses, I could really notice a difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li>and it does appear much thicker!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my red hair.</li>
            <li>took us some time to catch on because we trusted our product too much!</li>
            <li>All i can say is wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved pureology for years, but now they changed their shampoo formula and it&#x27;s a mess!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have shiny healthy flat hair, than bad-looking \\&quot;volume.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very disppointed with the product, as I have used it many times and this bottle was obviously unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It is such a lovely,&lt;br /&gt;kind, sweet smelling shampoo that keeps the color in my hair from fading too quickly.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t take much, so you use less product than you would with other brands.</li>
            <li>It certainly gives you volume</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s hard not to use more when one is so used to lathering it on) and don&#x27;t use a conditioner, only a bit of thickening leave-in, then my hair is full and bouncy, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Even when the container changed and they charged more for less, I thought it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>The St. Ives made my fine hair not only conditioned, but voluminous.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Pureology</li>
            <li>thanks to a referral from a friend.  </li>
            <li>and I know very well</li>
            <li>I read not to use too much but</li>
            <li>It really made a difference in the volume and manageability without adding any product feeling.</li>
            <li>I have it cut in a mod bob that is just below the chin with lots and lots of texture.  </li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>(maybe I used too much?</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at each shampooing either therefore the bottle lasts longer.</li>
            <li>And the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts along time.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is very concentrated, so you won&#x27;t need alot of product (ie.</li>
            <li>It does not make much suds so</li>
            <li>gentle it is to my hair and keeps it manageable.</li>
            <li>The Pure Volume shampoo works well enough to clean your hair without stripping it of the moisture that color-treated hair so often requires.</li>
            <li>It has held my color better than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and Pureology</li>
            <li>Most shampoos fade your hair color, but this shampoo helps keeps your color staying longer than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>is the only kind that I really like, that does not strip my hair, doesn&#x27;t make my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>hair is shoulder length, straight, very fine, limp, and dyed to cover gray.</li>
            <li>It is a nice heavy pan!  </li>
            <li>And what was left was gorgeous hair, fluffy, non frizzy hair....</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to purchase high quality shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone with color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>So glad I had a sample or another $28 down the drain!</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months and it work on my hair which tends to be oily if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, straight hair and get highlights a few times a year.  </li>
            <li>I only use a small amount (about the size of a nickle) and it really lathers up quite nicely so a 10 oz.</li>
            <li>The new formula makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li>I understand the founder of this company sold it and has a new line of products called \\&quot;Colour\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so I can try a new shampoo.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much and it works up an amazing lather.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t buy it from LUSH ESSENCE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first shampoo with Pureology Volume shampoo, I used Biolage Moisture Balm &amp; the rat&#x27;s nest feeling was gone instantly, but so was the volume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just my hair because very few products seem to help me with volume.  </li>
            <li>It slows down fading of the color and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does help your hair color last</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t condition my hair after usage, this shampoo leaves my hair completely tangled.</li>
            <li>and for a getting close to 60yrs old, people ask me if I die my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as silky and have as much volume as it did when I used the same Pureology from the salon.</li>
            <li>But since using this shampoo on an almost daily use, I really haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in volume.  </li>
            <li>is combination with the Pureology volume conditioner or hydrate conditioner and top it all off with Bain de Terre Recovery Complex.</li>
            <li>The Pureology product line is natural, with no sulfates, and is 100% vegan.</li>
            <li>I get so much volume out of my hair with moderate effort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional stylist for 39 years and Pureology was the nicest shampoo I&#x27;d ever used.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo I received was clearly extrememly old and should not have been sold.  </li>
            <li>We enjoy the extra volume for short and long hair.</li>
            <li>You may need a little bit more if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does cost a lil more than some, but a little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li>forgot the first time and my hair foamed into a big poofy mass of thick, rich lather (lesson learned).</li>
            <li>My only regret it the high cost of the&lt;br /&gt;shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>but it goes a long way and really seems to keep the color longer.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>But this last time I bought the \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Gentle cleaning that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews before buying this product and what they say about a little shampoo going a long way is true!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a pureology fan for years and when my hair started majorly thinning out</li>
            <li>so I just switched back to the volumizing shampoo/conditioner and my hair feels soft and bouncy again--</li>
            <li>I tried leaving it naturally curly and putting in leave-in conditioner and then back to flat-ironing.  </li>
            <li>(seems pointless to use Volume shampoo and then have to super condition in order to comb hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this twice, but both times, my fine hair felt like a thick rat&#x27;s nest after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I like to amp up the volume and then get a Meg Ryan messy look (a little more refined though).</li>
            <li>After only using this shampoo for two weeks ive seen a major difference.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I really only have to use a small amount of shampoo, it really is true, I get alot of lather for such a small amount and my hair feels so soft after I shampoo</li>
            <li>But, why use a volume shampoo if I then lose the volume when forced to super condition in order to comb it?</li>
            <li>But, why use a volume shampoo if I then lose the volume when forced to super condition in order to comb it?</li>
            <li>Although it costs more than the usual shampoos it only takes a little to make alot of lather.</li>
            <li>Before finding the Hydrate conditioner, I was down to my last bottle of my cherished St. Ives Hair Repair Intense Moisture.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I used Pureology a few years ago and always loved it, but I started to buy less expensive shampoo since $20+ sounded like too much money for a hair product.</li>

            <li> I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li> and it makes your hair feel and look great.  </li>
            <li> Still works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, when I shampoo my hair, it&#x27;s feels great when rinsed.</li>
            <li> The conditionar is great too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt , again, for a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I used Pureology for years with great results...</li>
            <li> It will be great to have the opportunity to purchase the shampoo in&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, too!</li>
            <li> that evens out the smell and it makes my hair smell good.</li>
            <li> Why change a good thing?  </li>
            <li> Has been a good volumizing shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology shampoo and condition for many years and have loved it!  </li>
            <li> Purology Pure Volume is a great shampoo, one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently and it has to be one of the best, if not the best shampoo available.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good, I have to use a lot more to get a good lather</li>
            <li> And I love their colour care condition - smells minty and light and wonderful -</li>
            <li> I do however love the leave in repair conditioner by Pureolgy!</li>
            <li> Be sure to try the conditioner too!</li>
            <li> I love this product line!  </li>
            <li> When I first read about this, I thought, volume AND moisture - perfect.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> AND it gives great volume for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair color will also hold quite nicely.</li>
            <li> The aroma is nice too.</li>
            <li> It has so many good aspects</li>
            <li> It really protects my color, gives my hair body &amp; smells great too!!!</li>
            <li> : A week ago,I bought/used Pureology Hydrate conditioner &amp; it gave nice bounce &amp; silky ends.</li>
            <li> The old Pureology Volume shampoo is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best volume shampoo out there.  </li>
            <li> I dont have to use much at all, lathers up real nicely.</li>
            <li> Fragance is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li> Still working on a solution as first use was great)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I find the smell potent and displeasing.</li>
            <li> My favorite sister-in-law sent me this shampoo to try.  </li>
            <li> I was glad that I came across this one.</li>
            <li> My thining hair, I&#x27;m 61, has more body, looks thicker and is easier to style than ever before.  </li>
            <li> I also love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks, feels and moves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better that the shampoo</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> is on top of already having used the Volume Conditioner.)</li>
            <li> The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent</li>
            <li> The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t think of a better description).  </li>
            <li> The salon I go to sells this for almost $9 more than Amazon, so you won&#x27;t find a better deal than here.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft (even without the conditioner).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and my hair does feel clean after I use it, but I really need help with volume.  </li>
            <li> A cute little heart sticker now says, &amp;#34; two is better than one, best used with conditioner&amp;#34;... What isn&#x27;t said is that you can&#x27;t walk out of your home if you don&#x27;t use both!&lt;br /&gt;Shame on them!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I use the Antifade \\&quot;Holdfast\\&quot; on wet hair and it works the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Pureology is hailed as one of the more high-end hair product lines available.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the product arived fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> very nicely moisturizing not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so popular, despite the higher price tag.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this on my hair (fine, jaw length and highlighted twice a year)</li>
            <li> hair is in good condition, color treated, straight and fine but full.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for that smooth, silky finished look, it won&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> it was great before, but now it&#x27;s a completely different shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Hair retains vibrant color, smells nice and hair feels revitalized.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> After conditioning, my hair is manageable (although I find I need to use a significant amount of the conditioner to get there).</li>
            <li> Save your money - spend some more but buy the real one!</li>
            <li> Pureology shampoo was instantly better at first.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Pureology Pure Volume for more than a decade.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo after trying the Paul Mitchell brand and thinking that a moisturizing brand would be better.  </li>
            <li> and it would lather up great on a wet head of hair.  </li>
            <li> and this really does give me a lot more volume.</li>
            <li> my hair, the only way Pureology Volume Shampoo works is to use a good conditioner (Biolage Moisture Balm or the Level 3 conditioner that comes with L&#x27;Oreal color -</li>
            <li> my hair, the only way Pureology Volume Shampoo works is to use a good conditioner (Biolage Moisture Balm or the Level 3 conditioner that comes with L&#x27;Oreal color -</li>
            <li> My hair is super-clean, not stripped, and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I love Pureology and much to my dismay</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend if you have fine, color-treated hair that needs some volume!</li>
            <li> I have very straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> Relying on the loyal patronage of a group of trusting consumers to use a repackaged substandard product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The reviewer that said it &#x27;smells like an old man&#x27; was right on the money, but once I used the matching conditioner (which smells nice)</li>
            <li> I have to use more conditioner than I ever thought I should use, and I have to leave the conditioner in longer than normal.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product on Amazon and at half the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality shampoo, makes you hair feel great and it;s well concentrated so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It keeps my color looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> But for me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> It did take me  about a week or two to get it right, though.</li>
            <li> I started using this right after I had my hair colored about 3 weeks ago</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers ok, but my hair needed major conditioner both days in order to get my fingers thru it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With fine, straight hair and a lifetime of never being able to go a day without washing my hair, I have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially for people who color their hair and it&#x27;s nice even if you don&#x27;t color.</li>
            <li> and I only go through 2 bottles of shampoo and 2 conditioner a year at most (1 volume and 1 straightening each).</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair manageable and along with Neutrogena deep conditioner, in fabulous shape!</li>
            <li> A first.</li>
            <li> After three uses, I could really notice a difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li> and it does appear much thicker!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my red hair.</li>
            <li> took us some time to catch on because we trusted our product too much!</li>
            <li> All i can say is wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved pureology for years, but now they changed their shampoo formula and it&#x27;s a mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have shiny healthy flat hair, than bad-looking \\&quot;volume.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very disppointed with the product, as I have used it many times and this bottle was obviously unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It is such a lovely,&lt;br /&gt;kind, sweet smelling shampoo that keeps the color in my hair from fading too quickly.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t take much, so you use less product than you would with other brands.</li>
            <li> It certainly gives you volume</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard not to use more when one is so used to lathering it on) and don&#x27;t use a conditioner, only a bit of thickening leave-in, then my hair is full and bouncy, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Even when the container changed and they charged more for less, I thought it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> The St. Ives made my fine hair not only conditioned, but voluminous.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Pureology</li>
            <li> thanks to a referral from a friend.  </li>
            <li> and I know very well</li>
            <li> I read not to use too much but</li>
            <li> It really made a difference in the volume and manageability without adding any product feeling.</li>
            <li> I have it cut in a mod bob that is just below the chin with lots and lots of texture.  </li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> (maybe I used too much?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much at each shampooing either therefore the bottle lasts longer.</li>
            <li> And the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts along time.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is very concentrated, so you won&#x27;t need alot of product (ie.</li>
            <li> It does not make much suds so</li>
            <li> gentle it is to my hair and keeps it manageable.</li>
            <li> The Pure Volume shampoo works well enough to clean your hair without stripping it of the moisture that color-treated hair so often requires.</li>
            <li> It has held my color better than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and Pureology</li>
            <li> Most shampoos fade your hair color, but this shampoo helps keeps your color staying longer than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> is the only kind that I really like, that does not strip my hair, doesn&#x27;t make my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> hair is shoulder length, straight, very fine, limp, and dyed to cover gray.</li>
            <li> It is a nice heavy pan!  </li>
            <li> And what was left was gorgeous hair, fluffy, non frizzy hair....</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to purchase high quality shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone with color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> So glad I had a sample or another $28 down the drain!</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and it work on my hair which tends to be oily if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, straight hair and get highlights a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount (about the size of a nickle) and it really lathers up quite nicely so a 10 oz.</li>
            <li> The new formula makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I understand the founder of this company sold it and has a new line of products called \\&quot;Colour\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so I can try a new shampoo.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much and it works up an amazing lather.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy it from LUSH ESSENCE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first shampoo with Pureology Volume shampoo, I used Biolage Moisture Balm &amp; the rat&#x27;s nest feeling was gone instantly, but so was the volume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just my hair because very few products seem to help me with volume.  </li>
            <li> It slows down fading of the color and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does help your hair color last</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t condition my hair after usage, this shampoo leaves my hair completely tangled.</li>
            <li> and for a getting close to 60yrs old, people ask me if I die my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as silky and have as much volume as it did when I used the same Pureology from the salon.</li>
            <li> But since using this shampoo on an almost daily use, I really haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in volume.  </li>
            <li> is combination with the Pureology volume conditioner or hydrate conditioner and top it all off with Bain de Terre Recovery Complex.</li>
            <li> The Pureology product line is natural, with no sulfates, and is 100% vegan.</li>
            <li> I get so much volume out of my hair with moderate effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional stylist for 39 years and Pureology was the nicest shampoo I&#x27;d ever used.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was clearly extrememly old and should not have been sold.  </li>
            <li> We enjoy the extra volume for short and long hair.</li>
            <li> You may need a little bit more if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does cost a lil more than some, but a little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> forgot the first time and my hair foamed into a big poofy mass of thick, rich lather (lesson learned).</li>
            <li> My only regret it the high cost of the&lt;br /&gt;shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way and really seems to keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> But this last time I bought the \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Gentle cleaning that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this product and what they say about a little shampoo going a long way is true!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a pureology fan for years and when my hair started majorly thinning out</li>
            <li> so I just switched back to the volumizing shampoo/conditioner and my hair feels soft and bouncy again--</li>
            <li> I tried leaving it naturally curly and putting in leave-in conditioner and then back to flat-ironing.  </li>
            <li> (seems pointless to use Volume shampoo and then have to super condition in order to comb hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this twice, but both times, my fine hair felt like a thick rat&#x27;s nest after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I like to amp up the volume and then get a Meg Ryan messy look (a little more refined though).</li>
            <li> After only using this shampoo for two weeks ive seen a major difference.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I really only have to use a small amount of shampoo, it really is true, I get alot of lather for such a small amount and my hair feels so soft after I shampoo</li>
            <li> But, why use a volume shampoo if I then lose the volume when forced to super condition in order to comb it?</li>
            <li> But, why use a volume shampoo if I then lose the volume when forced to super condition in order to comb it?</li>
            <li> Although it costs more than the usual shampoos it only takes a little to make alot of lather.</li>
            <li> Before finding the Hydrate conditioner, I was down to my last bottle of my cherished St. Ives Hair Repair Intense Moisture.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I used Pureology a few years ago and always loved it, but I started to buy less expensive shampoo since $20+ sounded like too much money for a hair product.</li>
            <li> Some reveiws said use very little, so I tried a few times, what I got was tons of static &amp; dry unmanagable hair!</li>
            <li> Towards the last 2 weeks prior to my appointment my hair always is flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled about all the rave reviews for Pureology Volume shampoo &amp; how how soft it is leaving other&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stays very soft and i now can wear it down cause it has the volume and body</li>
            <li> my hair used to be gorgeous and it just simply died:(  </li>
            <li> (I usually buy it from my hair stylist&#x27;s salon) and it&#x27;s not the real thing</li>
            <li> your hair will be flat and feel like it needs to be washed again.  </li>
            <li> this is going to last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> This bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> PM&#x27;s shampoo left my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Then about 2 weeks later I noticed my hair was dry and decided to add the conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li> Antifade Complex Pure Volume Hair Condition, 8.5-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> You get a noticeable increase in volume and, while the price of the shampoo is high, a small dose of shampoo (about the size of a nickel) will lather your hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, the Antifade Complex really works, I can go three weeks between the comb-in coloring.  </li>
            <li> bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a long way\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I use the Pureology Serious Colour Pure Volume Shampoo and Blowdry Amplifier together.  </li>
            <li> Similar ingredients, but not exact.</li>
            <li> little about me:  my hair has a little bend but is mostly thick yet fine in texture.  </li>
            <li> I, personally, think this shampoo is not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would be the new one that people complained about</li>
            <li> Conditioner comes in a slightly smaller bottle than the shampoo because you use less of it.</li>
            <li> I noticed no additional volume &amp; not much conditioning either.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but worth the cost due to</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is extremely flowery with chemical notes.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> I came into work the other day without having washed my hair that morning.</li>
            <li> I tried this with the conditioner after reading tons of reveiws, I gave it three tries!</li>
            <li> After spending a lot of money on the Pureology Volume Shampoo and Conditioner, I can say that I am extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A set of shampoo and conditioner will last me close to 3 months, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It was thin, not thick and sudsy as it had been before.  </li>
            <li> But by the 3rd use, no more bounce &amp; ends drier.</li>
            <li> Due to my Lupus and the chemo injections I take for it....</li>
            <li> any other shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
            <li> Plus it made my hair icky feeling and looking the very next morning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this shampoo did not seem as thick as the same I purchased at my salon.</li>
            <li> it lasts at least as long as other brands that you will buy by the liter.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to purchase high quality shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s going to be pureology.  This product is amazing and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The old Pureology Volume shampoo is awesome!! I have been a fan and used it for years. The new formula is terrible. The bottle is a different shape and a shade darker in color. The new formula makes my hair feel like straw. It also does not lather well.</li>
            <li> I have very straight fine hair. I needed something that would give me volume and some body. I hated the idea of spending so much on one bottle of shampoo(the hair place i bought it at it was about 23.00 bucks a bottle). But then i had a few friends swear by the pureology line. So i gave it a try. All i can say is wow!!!! I dont have to use much at all, lathers up real nicely. My hair stays very soft and i now can wear it down cause it has the volume and body i want it to have. After only using this shampoo for two weeks ive seen a major difference. Enough to make me never want to switch shampoos. The only thing i wasnt so crazy about it the smell. But i do use the pureology danruff conditioner(smells oh so good!)so that evens out the smell and it makes my hair smell good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does help your hair color last but beware-only use a tiny, tiny amount or else your hair will be flat and feel like it needs to be washed again.  Once I got the small amount down (it&#x27;s hard not to use more when one is so used to lathering it on) and don&#x27;t use a conditioner, only a bit of thickening leave-in, then my hair is full and bouncy, shiny and healthy.  It did take me  about a week or two to get it right, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a pureology fan for years and when my hair started majorly thinning out this last year I switched shampoos, desperate to keep my hair from falling out.  After finding out that hormones were to blame for my hair loss (no enough thyroid medication) I realized that all those hair loss shampoos had dried out the hair I had left :-(  so I just switched back to the volumizing shampoo/conditioner and my hair feels soft and bouncy again--I dont know what I&#x27;d do without this brand--oh yeah, I&#x27;d have dull, lifeless brittle hair.  Thanks to Pureology my hair has come back to life!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best volume shampoo out there.  My hair color lasts longer since I started using this line 3 years ago.  I don&#x27;t have any bad hair days since switching to this product and although pricier than other brands since you only need to use a little bit of it it lasts at least as long as other brands that you will buy by the liter.  In the summer I switch to the straightening line and it works wonders.  I wash my hair just about every day and I only go through 2 bottles of shampoo and 2 conditioner a year at most (1 volume and 1 straightening each).</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology products for almost 2 years but never tried this one until recently.  I love it.  I don&#x27;t use the conditioner, but the shampoo is great.  One of the reasons I color my hair is for the added volume it gives.  Towards the last 2 weeks prior to my appointment my hair always is flat.  I have lived with it in the past in order to avoid over processing, but with this product I feel the need to color as needed from an appearance stand point.  Try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product for a senior citizen with silver/white hair.  It performed as advertised giving my hair body and a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend.  It is a nice heavy pan!  I hope she enjoys it!!</li>
            <li> Been using Pureology for several years now.  It keeps my color looking fresh.  It slows down fading of the color and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this product and what they say about a little shampoo going a long way is true! It leaves my hair manageable and along with Neutrogena deep conditioner, in fabulous shape! I understand the founder of this company sold it and has a new line of products called \\&quot;Colour\\&quot;. I want to try that as well.</li>
            <li> If volume is all that you are concerned about, this shampoo does the trick. Your hair color will also hold quite nicely. You get a noticeable increase in volume and, while the price of the shampoo is high, a small dose of shampoo (about the size of a nickel) will lather your hair. Now, what about the drawbacks?&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t condition my hair after usage, this shampoo leaves my hair completely tangled. There is no way I can get a comb through it. After conditioning, my hair is manageable (although I find I need to use a significant amount of the conditioner to get there). And, conditioner or no conditioner, the texture of my hair is awful. I wish you could feel the difference for yourself. This shampoo removed all shine and softness from my hair. My hair is dull and unpleasant to the touch (although some loss of the smoothness of your hair will occur with any volume shampoo). Furthermore, I find the smell potent and displeasing. It is extremely flowery with chemical notes.&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I bought the shampoo and conditioner almost two months ago and I can&#x27;t wait to finish it up so I can try a new shampoo. I thought it was too expensive to throw away. I, personally, think this shampoo is not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> After trying this shampoo, I won&#x27;t be fading away from it in the future. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used...thanks to a referral from a friend.  Seems like my hair is rejuvinated all over....and for a getting close to 60yrs old, people ask me if I die my hair.  That speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> With fine, straight hair and a lifetime of never being able to go a day without washing my hair, I have finally found a product that works for me. I have to use more conditioner than I ever thought I should use, and I have to leave the conditioner in longer than normal. But for me, it&#x27;s worth it. I came into work the other day without having washed my hair that morning. A first. I&#x27;m now a devoted customer.</li>
            <li> My favorite sister-in-law sent me this shampoo to try.  After three uses, I could really notice a difference in my hair!  It does add volume and hold to my thin, wavy hair.  Nice smell, too!</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but worth the cost due to it&#x27;s excellent volumizing and shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive... but it goes a long way and really seems to keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this with the conditioner after reading tons of reveiws, I gave it three tries! Some reveiws said use very little, so I tried a few times, what I got was tons of static &amp; dry unmanagable hair! Worst hair day ever! I did buy it at a local salon &amp; thank goodness I could return it. I do however love the leave in repair conditioner by Pureolgy!</li>
            <li> I searched the internet for shampoo for fine/color treated hair. My hair fades hair color rapidly. I was glad that I came across this one. It has held my color better than other shampoos. Although it costs more than the usual shampoos it only takes a little to make alot of lather. However I was not impressed with accompaning conditoner.</li>
            <li> Deb, our friend who is an entertainer and hair stylist introduced us to this terrific product.  She told me to use a little dab the size of a pea and it would lather up great on a wet head of hair.  I wash it once, rinse, then use a pea size amount of the cream rinse and leave it in my hair while I finish my shower and shave.  My thining hair, I&#x27;m 61, has more body, looks thicker and is easier to style than ever before.  I use the Antifade \\&quot;Holdfast\\&quot; on wet hair and it works the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Oh, by the way, the Antifade Complex really works, I can go three weeks between the comb-in coloring.  When you&#x27;re unemployed, you need to do what it takes to compete in this marketplace.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this on my hair (fine, jaw length and highlighted twice a year) and it&#x27;s a very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> The reviewer that said it &#x27;smells like an old man&#x27; was right on the money, but once I used the matching conditioner (which smells nice) the stink was gone.  And what was left was gorgeous hair, fluffy, non frizzy hair....and it does appear much thicker!  Great stuff....with a bad smell.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this shampoo did not seem as thick as the same I purchased at my salon. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as silky and have as much volume as it did when I used the same Pureology from the salon.</li>
            <li> This product is great, you can feel the thickness of your hair the minute you use it. The aroma is nice too. I definitely plan on purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this! I bought this shampoo online this time (I usually buy it from my hair stylist&#x27;s salon) and it&#x27;s not the real thing - it is Purology shampoo mixed with water!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I know very well what it&#x27;s texture is. It IS NOT LIQUID as the one I just got! Purology Pure Volume is a great shampoo, one of the best on the market. Just don&#x27;t buy it from LUSH ESSENCE! Save your money - spend some more but buy the real one!</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo for my daughters&#x27; hair as I use it for mine also.  We enjoy the extra volume for short and long hair. Fragance is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li> After spending a lot of money on the Pureology Volume Shampoo and Conditioner, I can say that I am extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these products, my hair is dull, heavy and feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the Graham Webb HALO products and should have stuck with them.  I realize now that they are the best for my colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pureology is way over-rated.  Definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
            <li> Prevents fading ...a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, straight hair and get highlights a few times a year.  My hairstylist gave me some samples of this shampoo and conditioner to try.  When I tried the samples, I thought it was helping with both the color fading and volume.  But since using this shampoo on an almost daily use, I really haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in volume.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just my hair because very few products seem to help me with volume.  This shampoo smells great and my hair does feel clean after I use it, but I really need help with volume.  When I finish with this bottle, I&#x27;m unsure if I&#x27;ll re-order or not.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I really only have to use a small amount of shampoo, it really is true, I get alot of lather for such a small amount and my hair feels so soft after I shampoo, I have shoulder length hair. I started using this right after I had my hair colored about 3 weeks ago and the color has hardly faded. I also love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and this is going to last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> Based these reviews I decided to give this a try. The shampoo is very thick and squeezes out in a ribbon. I read not to use too much but forgot the first time and my hair foamed into a big poofy mass of thick, rich lather (lesson learned). I love the way my hair looks, feels and moves. The price is ridiculous but I am a believer and while I can afford to get things like manicures and pedicures I will also be buying this little luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in good condition, color treated, straight and fine but full. I use this is combination with the Pureology volume conditioner or hydrate conditioner and top it all off with Bain de Terre Recovery Complex.</li>
            <li> Pureology is hailed as one of the more high-end hair product lines available. It has so many good aspects, it&#x27;s no surprise it&#x27;s so popular, despite the higher price tag. A bottle of Pureology shampoo or conditioner will cost about $25 each in store; however, on Amazon it&#x27;s almost a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s so great about it? The Pureology product line is natural, with no sulfates, and is 100% vegan. For those of you who aren&#x27;t concerned with such matters, it&#x27;s also highly-effective product. The Pure Volume shampoo works well enough to clean your hair without stripping it of the moisture that color-treated hair so often requires. It&#x27;s made for color-treated hair, but works on all hair types. It smells great - almost like aromatherapy - and works great too! Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t take much, so you use less product than you would with other brands. (A quarter-sized amount of shampoo is plenty for shoulder-length hair.) A set of shampoo and conditioner will last me close to 3 months, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Conditioner comes in a slightly smaller bottle than the shampoo because you use less of it. Be sure to try the conditioner too!

            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would give volume to my hair.  This product was disappointing.  It&#x27;s not any better that the shampoo I&#x27;m already using for half the price.</li>
            <li> This a great product in conjunction with the Volume conditioner.  I have been using it for several months and it work on my hair which tends to be oily if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  It really made a difference in the volume and manageability without adding any product feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pureology Pure Volume for more than a decade.  I thought it was great.  Even when the container changed and they charged more for less, I thought it was worth it.  But this last time I bought the \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot;.  It was awful. It made my hair feel like a haystack.  It was thin, not thick and sudsy as it had been before.  At my local CVS pharmacy the price was $35.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> very nicely moisturizing not heavy at all.  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I like it. It certainly gives you volume but if you&#x27;re looking for that smooth, silky finished look, it won&#x27;t do that but I don&#x27;t think it claims to. I have fine, thin hair and this really does give me a lot more volume. I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use the Pureology Serious Colour Pure Volume Shampoo and Blowdry Amplifier together.  I get so much volume out of my hair with moderate effort.  I love this product line!  I like the smell it reminds me a little of Aveda.  The shampoo is great.  I get lots of suds and just need to wash it once and it feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about me:  my hair has a little bend but is mostly thick yet fine in texture.  I have it cut in a mod bob that is just below the chin with lots and lots of texture.  I like to amp up the volume and then get a Meg Ryan messy look (a little more refined though).</li>
            <li> I have used Pureology shampoo and condition for many years and have loved it!  No more.  I can tell something is different about the product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as good, I have to use a lot more to get a good lather and it makes my hair get so tangled when I shampoo it.  I know the formula has been changed.  Why change a good thing?  I will not buy it again.  (:  (:</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!  I have always bought very good hair products and think this&lt;br /&gt;ranks among the tops.  Yes, it does cost a lil more than some, but a little bit goes a very long way and it makes your hair feel and look great.  I would recommend this to anyone who colors their hair, or has dry&lt;br /&gt;curly hair.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleaning that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  It really protects my color, gives my hair body &amp; smells great too!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I was concerned that it would be the new one that people complained about but it wasn&#x27;t. Still works great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and Pureology is the only kind that I really like, that does not strip my hair, doesn&#x27;t make my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> Very drying. not impressed for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled about all the rave reviews for Pureology Volume shampoo &amp; how how soft it is leaving other&#x27;s hair. Is this without conditioner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this twice, but both times, my fine hair felt like a thick rat&#x27;s nest after rinsing. The shampoo lathers ok, but my hair needed major conditioner both days in order to get my fingers thru it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, straight, very fine, limp, and dyed to cover gray. I wash it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, when I shampoo my hair, it&#x27;s feels great when rinsed. I&#x27;ve never experienced this rat&#x27;s nest feeling before. It almost feels like it&#x27;s been stripped until I put conditioner in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shampoo with Pureology Volume shampoo, I used Biolage Moisture Balm &amp; the rat&#x27;s nest feeling was gone instantly, but so was the volume! (trade off?) The next day I again washed with the Volume Shampoo, but conditioned with a sample of Pureology Volume Conditioner. I noticed no additional volume &amp; not much conditioning either. As I dried my hair, I could tell that the silkiness was gone, so I re-wet from my ears down &amp; used the Biolage Balm &amp; rinsed.(this is on top of already having used the Volume Conditioner.) I will definitely take a pass on the Pureology Volume Conditioner. So glad I had a sample or another $28 down the drain! (seems pointless to use Volume shampoo and then have to super condition in order to comb hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More: A week ago,I bought/used Pureology Hydrate conditioner &amp; it gave nice bounce &amp; silky ends. But by the 3rd use, no more bounce &amp; ends drier. (maybe I used too much? Still working on a solution as first use was great) Before finding the Hydrate conditioner, I was down to my last bottle of my cherished St. Ives Hair Repair Intense Moisture. (now discontinued) In trying to find it online, I discovered that Pureology Hydrate conditioner is close to the St. Ives. So I bought it. Similar ingredients, but not exact. The St. Ives made my fine hair not only conditioned, but voluminous. The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume. I&#x27;ll take the trade off as St. Ives gone forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, the only way Pureology Volume Shampoo works is to use a good conditioner (Biolage Moisture Balm or the Level 3 conditioner that comes with L&#x27;Oreal color - both gave silky ends &amp; bounce) But, why use a volume shampoo if I then lose the volume when forced to super condition in order to comb it? I do love the scent so I&#x27;ll keep using &amp; moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying a sample of the Hydrate Shampoo tomorrow, but have heard that it too dries out hair over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. My Pureology Volume shampoo is rather runny &amp; I&#x27;m reading that it&#x27;s supposed to be very very thick in consistency. Maybe I got a bad bottle, so checking into it &amp; might exchange, but doubtful this will help me.ioned, but voluminous. The Hydrate gives a bit better bounce &amp; silky ends, but no volume.

            <li> I used Pureology a few years ago and always loved it, but I started to buy less expensive shampoo since $20+ sounded like too much money for a hair product. Then I realized that I spend hundreds every year on cutting and coloring my hair, so I may as well pay money to maintain my hair.</li>
            <li> Has been a good volumizing shampoo for me. But the product line has been changed and the shampoo with the same description but different packaging is completely different. So the amazon market is the only source.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years as recommended by my stylist.  However, recently the price in her salon has doubled.  Who can spend thirty dollars for a bottle of shampoo.  I was so happy to find this product on Amazon and at half the price.</li>
            <li> I switched to Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo after trying the Paul Mitchell brand and thinking that a moisturizing brand would be better.  PM&#x27;s shampoo left my hair dry and brittle.  Pureology shampoo was instantly better at first.  Then about 2 weeks later I noticed my hair was dry and decided to add the conditioner as well.  The pair promised to ensure the moisturizing part.  No dice.  My hair is dull and scraggly (I can&#x27;t think of a better description).  I tried leaving it naturally curly and putting in leave-in conditioner and then back to flat-ironing.  No difference.  It&#x27;s this product.  I think unfortunately there is no magic bullet for flatter hair besides blow drying and teasing.  Oh well.  I&#x27;d rather have shiny healthy flat hair, than bad-looking \\&quot;volume.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would like to recommend this product to any one who colors their hair . Most shampoos fade your hair color, but this shampoo helps keeps your color staying longer than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used before. You don&#x27;t have to use much at each shampooing either therefore the bottle lasts longer. And the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this Pureology shampoo when I borrowed some from a friend and I was so impressed.  It smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft (even without the conditioner).  I only use a small amount (about the size of a nickle) and it really lathers up quite nicely so a 10 oz. bottle goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product, especially for people who color their hair and it&#x27;s nice even if you don&#x27;t color.</li>
            <li> When I first read about this, I thought, volume AND moisture - perfect.  And I love their colour care condition - smells minty and light and wonderful - but this stuff smells absolutely horrible.  I almost gagged every time I tried to use it.  Plus it made my hair icky feeling and looking the very next morning.  Wish I could send it back because it is expensive to just be thrown away.</li>
            <li> Pureology has reformulated this shampoo - it was great before, but now it&#x27;s a completely different shampoo.  My hair comes out of the shower feeling like a Brillo pad and I can&#x27;t get a comb through it, it&#x27;s so stiff and tangled.  It leaves a residue in my hair and my style droops in a day, so now I have to shampoo and restyle every day instead of every 3 or 4 days.  I am done with this expensively awful shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have never been overly impressed with brand name shampoo. Due to my Lupus and the chemo injections I take for it....I have dead hair- my hair used to be gorgeous and it just simply died:(  I read a conversation online where some friends were talking about it so, I purchased the travel size \\&quot;just to try it\\&quot; I LOVE IT! In one week I have had four compliments on my hair and just attended a wedding last night where someone asked me if I had my hair done that day! I am sold! just picked up the regular size bottles this am.  This is worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts along time.  The conditionar is great too.  Anyway, the product arived fast and in good condition. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved pureology for years, but now they changed their shampoo formula and it&#x27;s a mess! It doesn&#x27;t lather and makes my hair all tangled in the shower. Very very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone with color-treated hair. AND it gives great volume for my fine hair. This shampoo is very concentrated, so you won&#x27;t need alot of product (ie. \\&quot;goes a long way\\&quot;). The salon I go to sells this for almost $9 more than Amazon, so you won&#x27;t find a better deal than here. DO allow for slightly longer shipping though.</li>
            <li> Hair retains vibrant color, smells nice and hair feels revitalized. Pureology products don&#x27;t make hair feel sticky or hard as some other hair care products have a tendency to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional stylist for 39 years and Pureology was the nicest shampoo I&#x27;d ever used.  Then, they change the formula. Don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s terrible.  Why is it that companies make a wonderful product and then change it?  I&#x27;f it was so wonderful, then it didn&#x27;t need changing and this is the case with Pureology shampoo.  This is EXPENSIVE shampoo and now it&#x27;s not good.  So sad.  I&#x27;m on the hunt , again, for a great shampoo.  Way to go L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  On the other hand, it does last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much and it works up an amazing lather.  My hair is super-clean, not stripped, and full of body.  I highly reccommend if you have fine, color-treated hair that needs some volume!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my red hair. I have highlighted red hair and this shampoo keeps my red longer then any other shampoo I have used. It is pricey yes but you only use a dime size. It does not make much suds so don&#x27;t think you are not using enough. I use a dime size for my short hair. You may need a little bit more if you have long hair. This bottle last a long time. Keeps my red longer. Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used Pureology for years with great results...then &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; which requires conditioner to balance shampoo or your hair is like a broom. Forbid you run out of conditioner...you won&#x27;t even be able to comb your hair!!! A cute little heart sticker now says, &amp;#34; two is better than one, best used with conditioner&amp;#34;... What isn&#x27;t said is that you can&#x27;t walk out of your home if you don&#x27;t use both!&lt;br /&gt;Shame on them!!! Relying on the loyal patronage of a group of trusting consumers to use a repackaged substandard product.&lt;br /&gt;Just took us some time to catch on because we trusted our product too much! Won&#x27;t make that mistake again....I hate being taken advantage of!</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently and it has to be one of the best, if not the best shampoo available.</li>
            <li> Pureology must have went off the deep end ugh!!!! This is definitely not the volume shampoo that I&#x27;ve been using  for years,  the other reviewers are dead on, it doesn&#x27;t lather and makes my hair feel awful in the shower. I swear this feels worse than store bought shampoo. Why can&#x27;t anyone leave a product alone when it&#x27;s good!!!!???? Terribly frustrated!</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was clearly extrememly old and should not have been sold.  Very disppointed with the product, as I have used it many times and this bottle was obviously unsatisfactory.  I will not buy from here again.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology and much to my dismay it is not available in my  town yet. It is such a lovely,&lt;br /&gt;kind, sweet smelling shampoo that keeps the color in my hair from fading too quickly. I love&lt;br /&gt;how gentle it is to my hair and keeps it manageable. My only regret it the high cost of the&lt;br /&gt;shipping and handling. It will be great to have the opportunity to purchase the shampoo in&lt;br /&gt;my town soon.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality shampoo, makes you hair feel great and it;s well concentrated so a little goes a long way!</li>
