            <li>The cleaning feature is great as well as the precision shaver on the side.  </li>
            <li>It feels great.  </li>
            <li>great thing about Braun system is the cleaning and charging station.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to get the opportunity to try this through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>What a great shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>travel case is great</li>
            <li>I get a great shave.</li>
            <li>The cooling does make a noticeable difference and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any rusting anywhere on the product which is great.</li>
            <li>A great choice for a gift to</li>
            <li>Great packaging</li>
            <li>The cooling effect is great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that it did not burn my skin at all</li>
            <li>Got mine from a program run by Braun, and so happy i did.  </li>
            <li>In the shower the shave was great.</li>
            <li>What a great idea.</li>
            <li>and it felt great on my face.  </li>
            <li>¬∞CoolTec function is great.  </li>
            <li>On my face, the razor works great and provides a shave comparable to the Series 7 and a cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I am certainly happy that I have made the switch to the CoolTec</li>
            <li>The CoolTec experience is like nothing that I have experienced before from a shaving system.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for even weekend trips away from home.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but it felt great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatically cleaning station is great.  </li>
            <li>this truly is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However from a shaver perspective I gotta say it was alright.</li>
            <li>on my face it worked well gave a great</li>
            <li>Braun has come out with a great product and it is working great for me.</li>
            <li>I work varying hours and using this product has been great.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric razor.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The side burn trimmer still works great.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aesthetically, the razor looks great.</li>
            <li>great product&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and cleaning system does a great job cleaning the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>It felt great.</li>
            <li>Having everything all together and organized in the station is  great.</li>
            <li>All in all, the cooling technology was a great idea</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It provides a great shave, and immediately starts cooling once it&#x27;s turned on.  </li>
            <li>So when I heard that this razor would greatly reduce this</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy that I had the opportunity to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think it make a great gift.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the result I got from this razor.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great</li>
            <li>it is a great shaver would recommend.</li>
            <li>But anyway the product is great.</li>
            <li>it gives a great shave</li>
            <li>I am so thankful to have been able to try this razor!!</li>
            <li>The razor does a very nice job and the CoolTec cooling bar</li>
            <li>did a very nice job soothing my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice to just place the shaver in the cleaner</li>
            <li>I have to say that on a day to day basis, this thing works very nicely.</li>
            <li>The included travel case/charging adapter were very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CoolTec feature is a very nice sensation.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect comes in very handy when I go on a shaving holiday.</li>
            <li>cleaning and charging station is very nice.</li>
            <li>the cooling technology is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice looking unit, the dock solves the problem of where to store the shaver</li>
            <li>The &#x27;CoolTec&#x27; feature is very nice.</li>
            <li>What most impressed me about the Braun CoolTec was how great the shaver felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good shave, takes a while, not the best on the neck, like the cool shave bar in the razor probably the best feature of the razor.</li>
            <li>all it was just an okay razor, but not the best out there.</li>
            <li>and it provides a good shave, so I am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is without a doubt, the most awesome shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also I feel like the razor is so much more sanitary with the awesome cleaning system it uses.  </li>
            <li>As with any shaver, there are good things and not so great things about the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price point, I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money for this razor even though it&#x27;s really nice to get as a gift!</li>
            <li>I have used many Braun&#x27;s including the Series 7, which I feel is still the best Braun available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how the razor cleans itself, and the travel case will come in handy this Christmas!  </li>
            <li>best part was the automatic cleaning mode did a outstanding job cleaning the blade...</li>
            <li>After having the Braun CoolTec System for over a week I&#x27;m more impressed with it&#x27;s capabilities.</li>
            <li>I feel that the shave was good, but the I still experienced razor burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor for a couple weeks now, I am thrilled with its quality and ability!  </li>
            <li>I always have issues with getting me neck just the way I want and with this razor I was able to get it the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a very nice shaver and the cooltec makes for a good feature and experience.</li>
            <li>I use the cleaning station after immediately after every shave and find it does an excellent job at removing hair from the razor and keeping it very clean and</li>
            <li>razor has a very sleek design, the cooling bar is awesome and the housing kit is perfect</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cools your face as you shave, creating a really pleasant experience when you groom.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice</li>
            <li>Very glad to have the opportunity to try this great razor.  </li>
            <li>It feels good, shaves close, and even comes with its own cleaning/charging station!</li>
            <li>It has excellent craftsmanship - extremely easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver was extremely easy, and have the cleaning cradle was awesome as well.</li>
            <li>It makes the shaving experience so much more pleasant!</li>
            <li>and I must say this is by far the best shaver I have ever used the best feature</li>
            <li>In case you are going to be gone for a good while, the unit ships with a &amp;#34;mobile charger&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My wife is quite impressed with how smooth my face is after I finish with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave on my neck.</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for the price, it gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>It also feels good in my hand, ergonomically speaking.</li>
            <li>The razor also keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li>but I just could not get a good, even shave.</li>
            <li>product arrived in what I would call superior packaging and build quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the good.</li>
            <li>Ideally Braun will figure out a way to get this CoolTec technology into their top Series 7 shaver as an optional model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I feel good knowing the razor has a self cleaning option.</li>
            <li>but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Jumping to the point, the shaver doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately that the good also comes with some negatives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver does a nice close shave, the cooling system is a great sensation .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good on skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>even my beloved Series 7‚Äîand</li>
            <li>The travel case is durable and provides good protection for the razor.  </li>
            <li>Which is a good thing since, in the end, i find this product to be overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I own this razor and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I think the price is fair on this razor.  </li>
            <li>It gives my a close shave and because of the CoolTek technology, my face feels really good.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is good, although it seems to me that it is a bit pricey to use this system rather than just cleaning it out myself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar felt good on my face, when using and prevented irritation.</li>
            <li>Also the hair trimmer works great for my sideburns and keeping my mustache and goatee trimmed nicely for my wife.</li>
            <li>To give a good perspective, I have ranked them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it probably is good for maintaining the blades,</li>
            <li>blah, blah, but it felt good on my face.  </li>
            <li>The charge stays good for days, even in using the cooling technology with every shave, every day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>idea of the cleaning system is a good idea, but takes up room that I just don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>good when you haven&#x27;t shaved for a longer amount of time</li>
            <li>No need to dilute good drinks like a bourbon with ice cubes.  </li>
            <li>The electric razor alone doesn&#x27;t do a good job around my neck, and I always get razor burn.</li>
            <li>is an all around good product.</li>
            <li>Purchase this razor for yourself or a loved one and it will preform to expectations.</li>
            <li>Pro: Good for razor burns with the cooling effect.</li>
            <li>but this worked good for me.</li>
            <li>Hence, I give the product 3 stars because its a good razor</li>
            <li>give it 3/5 stars because it&#x27;s a good razor, but not something I would be bragging about to everyone.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>is good - no tugging on my skin</li>
            <li>While it was good, the price premium did not justify the added cooling and cleaning benefits.</li>
            <li>But over all it is a good razor.</li>
            <li>shave itself was not as superior however.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Features that are good about the razor:</li>
            <li>Having never been a fan of electric razors I was weary of the idea that the razor would be any good</li>
            <li>Over all a good razor.</li>
            <li>Good job Amit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slower and not as good of a shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a cleaner built into it, which does rather good.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 45 minutes and is surprisingly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I want to give it 4 stars because it works good.</li>
            <li>That cooling bar just feels so good.</li>
            <li>in a good way.  </li>
            <li>All guys deal with some level of irritation after shaving and this adaptation to the shaver does a good job combatting that issue.  </li>
            <li>and it feels really good when the coolness kicks in.  </li>
            <li>The greatest part of all is that this product was a free test that I received from Braun.</li>
            <li>and it did provide a good deal of comfort while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also sturdy and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>CoolTec didn&#x27;t cut as good as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>All in all a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar does help sooth the skin and feels good while shaving.</li>
            <li>I suppose the pluses of this would be if you want a five o clock shadow that sort of atheistic good look to your jaw..</li>
            <li>The razor worked good in the shower and after use I just put it in the charger and it cleans itself.</li>
            <li>the Braun works good</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s an 8500 model and this does not work as good.  </li>
            <li>It does have a couple of good features.  </li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec Shaving system is a good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning feature is really nice and works great.  </li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t the best, but it does provide a smooth, non-irritating shave.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver , I am a believer in the Braun product and will always own one .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Worked smoothly and perfectly without skin</li>
            <li>The battery life is good.</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t take away from the fact that it delivered a good close</li>
            <li>Good job Braun.</li>
            <li>It hits the spot with close shave and my skin feeling good after I use it.</li>
            <li>One of the things I loved about this trimmer was the sleek look it had.</li>
            <li>Good shaving...fine days...</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product as I‚Äôve been on the hunt for the best shaving solution for years.  </li>
            <li>It better be good for that price!  </li>
            <li>clean and charge station is great!</li>
            <li>like knowing my shaver is clean before each use so the Clean&amp;Charge Station was something I was really impressed with</li>
            <li>What was really awesome about this shaver is it comes with a Clean &amp; Charge station.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a month now, I have not had to clean it as the cleaning station does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although if you are using this to keep your face neat and clean - this is perfect - just not for me!</li>
            <li>The Clean &amp; Charge system worked perfectly and I was quite amazed to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li>It is awesome that this cleans itself with the Clean &amp; Charge station.</li>
            <li>Every manufacturer of electric razors claims to have the best unit when it comes to a clean shave and preventing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I just received my cooltec shaver from Braun through a special program and was instantly impressed by the look and feel of the shaver.</li>
            <li>The product looks sleek, the packaging was nice, the directions were easy to follow, and the charging station is the perfect size - not too bulky.</li>
            <li>I received this product through a program run by Braun and I have been very pleased by how good this shaver is.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s move onto the Cool Bar feature, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>A cool feeling on your face instead of a burning sensation is awesome.</li>
            <li>I was particularly impressed by how cool the shaver felt.  </li>
            <li>The cool tec feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li>all I still give it a 4 because the shave is still one of the best and the cool shave feature works</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best of all worlds would be the cool shave feature on the 790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>As a cheaper version to the series 7, this is not a bad razor at all and is a very great entry level shaver.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this device!</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great razor that gives you an all around great shave and leaves your face smooth and feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a nice light, and the bells and whistles are really impressive.  </li>
            <li>While the razor is great and also gives a great clean and close shave, I do not feel that the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; aspect is needed.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver the cooling factor is something else it truly makes for a better shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for many years and it has been great.</li>
            <li>cooltec gel feels very refreshing and clean&lt;</li>
            <li>in all I‚Äôm very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec system.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of counteracting the shaver heating up as find with most shavers.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The comfort of the styling grip was great, and the cooling sensation of the aluminum bar is even better.</li>
            <li>I was more than happy to jump in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great sensation, and I really love using it.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>a great Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-term, the Clean&amp;Charge station, while providing some healthy conditioning of the shaver, is a long-term expense, too.</li>
            <li>And I am very glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very glad I didn&#x27;t buy one</li>
            <li>all I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend this to friends and family</li>
            <li>One more great thing , the shaver cleans it self and that saves a lot of time .</li>
            <li>The cut was close and the cooling part made it very comfortable!</li>
            <li>The face on my skin stayed cooler than the rest of my body which led to a very enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave on my face, but i struggle with getting a good close shave on my jawline and neck area.</li>
            <li>This one works so good and cleans so easy, no face burn or discomfort great item a must have.</li>
            <li>When I got the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System in the mail I was very excited to see how great it was going to work.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in my hands, holds a charge and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>That said, I think this was the best shave I&#x27;ve received from an electric right out of the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its great - LOVE LOVE this system!</li>
            <li>The charging station is very nice looking, and much better looking than my Series 7 unit.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec razor provided a real nice clean close shave.</li>
            <li>one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, and possibly most importantly, the CoolTec provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>When I first received it I was highly impressed.  </li>
            <li>, that was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as part of a program from Braun and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>what a brilliant idea to cool the skin during the shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>The cool bar felt incredible.</li>
            <li>I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>And he did and I am ok with it!</li>
            <li>The CoolTec System is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Let me start with one of the most remarkable features for me...</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The CoolTec System is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>This attempt was more successful although still had it&#x27;s share of issues.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that feature!</li>
            <li>I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to put lotion on and not have pain after!</li>
            <li>I really love my CoolTec Shaving System!</li>
            <li>The Cooling Bar is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Watching the adds for it, and reading what it can do, it sounds like a pretty awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>does its job really well too; the foil feels great after being cleaned, and on top of that it comes out smelling like lemons, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I get better at maneouvering around and also finishing my shaving sooner every time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li>Also - the cleaning basin is great and easy to operate while the unit is in it&#x27;s charging</li>
            <li>The cool tec is awesome because it keeps your skin from getting too hot/warm and more irritated.</li>
            <li>The shave is still pretty close and nice, however it is a noticeable difference compared to the best in the price</li>
            <li>First, its cooling effect is simply incredible, feels great and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li>The cool temperature feels so good on my face!  </li>
            <li>The shave that the CT5cc gave me was more than adequate, and the popup trimmer was excellent on my goatee.</li>
            <li>The best benefit for me was being able to come off after work and get a quick shave in before going out that evening.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nice for the skin and is easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>This CoolTec shaver system, provided to me via a program fun by Braun to try out, does a very good job.</li>
            <li>but i really enjoy it and it leaves my face feeling great</li>
            <li>It gives me a great COMFORTABLE close shave.  </li>
            <li>it has been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The cooling mechanism is amazing,</li>
            <li>The cooling technology is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does an amazing job shaving without skin irritation&lt;</li>
            <li>My husband said the cooling feature was amazing on his face.</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing and amazing in its simplicity.  </li>
            <li>The cooling element works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>The cooling technology feels absolutely amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I must be honest, it didn&#x27;t work amazingly.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The close shave that Braun CoolTec provides is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It felt amazing shaving my cheeks</li>
            <li>I have a light beard which this razor is great on.</li>
            <li>I did not feel that this razor did an amazing job shaving hair that was growing in every direction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun CoolTec is an amazing piece of technology and innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cooltec works amazing</li>
            <li>The razor itself is extremely comfortable to hold and does a great job of staying evenly pressed against my face when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, YES.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Also the cleaning/charging system, while effective, takes up a lot of space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>or my face get warm.</li>
            <li>cooling technology is fairly nice.  </li>
            <li>The hold of the razor is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>This razor is spectacular.  </li>
            <li>is the perfect gift holiday season if you want to really impress someone.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is you do not have to use the cooling technology if you chose not to.</li>
            <li>Cleaning works wonderful and is much easier than manually cleaning it.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar felt nice, minimized burn etc.</li>
            <li>Its a nice change in design which gives me another option while shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fully understand how it works, but the cooling effect is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I kind of like that</li>
            <li>Nice battery life and travel case.</li>
            <li>Again, nice materials.</li>
            <li>But it has a nice build to it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m being as honest as I can.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is nice but just like the series 7 cleaning system, they can get a expense and need replaced about once a month depending on usage.</li>
            <li>I can honestly admit that this was</li>
            <li>the docking/cleaning station is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a nice, close shave</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice close shave too.  </li>
            <li>but I think I might change to being a Braun kind of guy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like those automated car washes.</li>
            <li>With my participation in a Braun promotion, I have used the electric razor for several weeks now and would like to weigh in on whether it is a great shaver, or the greatest shaver!</li>
            <li>and it even includes a nice cleaning station.</li>
            <li>The accessories are nice too.</li>
            <li>but when doing your head and face it cuts it kind of close.</li>
            <li>The shaver fits nicely in my hand in the shower, but it is heavier than what I am used to holding.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun 790CC since 2008 and have always really liked that model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Kind of nice to have a push-button cleaning system</li>
            <li>I really liked the cooling effect</li>
            <li>It is also nice to have something that I can travel with and also use in the car on my way to work for those days when life just pushes you to the brink.</li>
            <li>It is also nice for around my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received the razor through a program run by Braun, that allows people to try the product in order to give their honest opinion.</li>
            <li>In addition, it was great to be able to shave in the shower, which saved even more time in the</li>
            <li>I have never been a guy who liked to use a razor period.  </li>
            <li>The cooling mechanism the starts cooling as the shaver is turned on is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I still like to go over it with a my Gillette ProGlide razor every once in awhile, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like I have to.</li>
            <li>These are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li>The shaver feels really nice in my hand --</li>
            <li>is a nice touch</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one nice thing about this shaver is the CoolTec technology.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest</li>
            <li>The technology and built into these shavers was impressive: lithium ion battery that charges fast, waterproof and washable, LED display and self cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec part of this all was nice; I didn&#x27;t notice any razor burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And in my bathroom it feel kind of aggressive having it stick out like that</li>
            <li>Design of the shaver is nice.</li>
            <li>The cool-tec feature is really nice &amp; soothing.</li>
            <li>Nice option to have for traveling.</li>
            <li>That said, what follows are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels sturdy in your hands, and it mostly does a good job.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like a warm razor when trying to shave.  </li>
            <li>It made it effortless to charge the unit and I liked the cleaning feature as well...</li>
            <li>Also I liked the fact that the shaver was waterproof, had a cleaning station, and had a cooling bar to combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have time but have a nice day wherever you reside in the United States of America-have to go now</li>
            <li>but honestly i like my skin to be warm as it opens the pores in the skin and makes it an easier shave.</li>
            <li>It honestly feels like a treat when using.</li>
            <li>and i really liked it.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect does work which is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I liked the razor but would not purchase it at this price range.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning function is handy and the charging dock is nice and compact for when I travel.</li>
            <li>I the like cleaning feature that is nice</li>
            <li>When I grew my beard out some, this didn&#x27;t trip as close as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t select the product to return with a note about it containing hazardous materials.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to have a shaving option</li>
            <li>I liked that it had a cleaning system</li>
            <li>Braun sent this to me to test out and give an honest review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This thing is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall:  I liked this razor, but I can&#x27;t justify the price of it for that &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooltec strip.  </li>
            <li>Nice and close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of design, it looks really nice-</li>
            <li>After shaving with the CoolTec feature, I honestly feel like I don&#x27;t even need aftershave</li>
            <li>kind of guy.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how nice my skin felt after my shave.  </li>
            <li>You have the ability to turn off the cooling bar while shaving if you do not like the feeling of it, but I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you that nice kick that you need to wake you up.  </li>
            <li>travel case and charger are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The rest of your face will be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel case is handy and well made.  </li>
            <li>When the cooltec is activated by the &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; button, it does feel really nice.  </li>
            <li>I also really liked the self cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li>The whole experience and the product, were awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who keeps a beard not because I like it</li>
            <li>Since there are no words, you kind of just have to go for</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs nice to know my razor can go with me.  </li>
            <li>The station fits nicely on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>And of course you will feel a bit of a cooling sensation which is nice...</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li>The cooling technology was nice but not a must have for me.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to try out the Braun cooltec razor to see what it was all about.</li>
            <li>I would have to say there are many good things about this razor.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec feature is a nice addition to this shaver.  </li>
            <li>cooling feature is a nice feature I use it each time</li>
            <li>face felt nice after the shave.  </li>
            <li>It was nice.  </li>
            <li>Basically they provide a string of pictures which is nice but no detail into all the parts and</li>
            <li>Nice having a cradle to just set the shaver in for charging instead of messing around with cords.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is also handy and works well.</li>
            <li>This one has a built-in cleaning system, but also is a much cleaner shave - works great!</li>
            <li>I honestly have not found any electric shaver that give me a shave that I consider close.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight with balance.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>- Although it feels good in the hand, it is a bit more cumbersome to maneuver.</li>
            <li>The cooltec would also be nice if it was on the perimeter of the shaving head rather than the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially good for me since I am prone to real irritation from electric shavers.</li>
            <li>The cooling does help, it feels nice when the razor glides over your face.</li>
            <li>Nice to shave in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Cooling system is a nice feature, but</li>
            <li>It is compact, sleek, and comes with a nice case&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it feels kind of nice, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>Got cleaning and charging station...very effective.</li>
            <li>The cool feature is great and thus works great  for a good quick shave.  </li>
            <li>This has been a very good experience and I am excited to be able to use the system going forward.</li>
            <li>I am a very warm blooded person and thoroughly enjoy the cooling feature of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>seriously great product and worth trying!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great for me because i don&#x27;t have time in the mornings to clean my shaver.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cool Tec Shaving system is fabulous , the best shaver I have EVER</li>
            <li>The ability to clean is also great.  </li>
            <li>was impressed with the design and the CoolTec system in this particular</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and highly recommend you giving this product a shot.  </li>
            <li>This would be great gift for the special guy, brother, dad, or grandad in your life.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Shaving System for more than a month now, and I will say, it has provided me with a much more pleasant electric shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as a razor but its good for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>What you gain is the ability to cool your face downand greatly increase comfort during the shaving process.</li>
            <li>cool technology is great and helps with the irritation that shaving always brings.  </li>
            <li>The chamber is easy to clean and the battery life is very good.  </li>
            <li>me start off by saying that this razor is very cool - literally!  </li>
            <li>After trying this wonderful shaver, I would recommend it to anyone who was in the market for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>and this is almost as impressive a new feature as the cooling system</li>
            <li>After opening the package, setting it up in my bathroom and letting it charge, I was stoked to think I had a new awesome electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The new Braun CoolTec System is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned and was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>The shaver is amazing, by far the best shaver i have had the pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>- I take a great deal of time to make sure that it perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved the razor itself and how easy it was to handle.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly, feels great on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station works great also quick and leaves the shaver spotless.</li>
            <li>The blades made my whole face feel awesome even after I was done shaving :)  </li>
            <li>Make it quick with this great shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels good in my hand, is balanced well, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be a super well groomed and happy camper.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the cooling feature as it actually felt really good on my skin and boy</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used a good one, but I was very happy that the noise level was so low.  </li>
            <li>that said, with self-cleaning, this is a great product to have when I just need a close shave, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be great for quick one handed access to the razor.  </li>
            <li>cool is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s cool though, the cooling sensation is a very nice feeling while I shaved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to put together</li>
            <li>Cleaning the razor was also very easy -  </li>
            <li>razor is also built very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>I received the product through a program run by Braun and could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand.</li>
            <li>The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Its a great razor in its own right.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual says that water is ok to use to clean it out but that the solution is recommended because it does lubricate the shaver and clean it the best.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve been using the clean &amp; charge station and my razor came out looking clean and smelling wonderful, way better than what I‚Äôve been accustomed too.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I own a Braun 9595 electric shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I just have to say this is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say this electric shaver is more than just a gimic.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice form fitting case.</li>
            <li>The trimmer though is better and provides a nice close shave</li>
            <li>I was able to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free from a program run by Braun, but honestly, the hype just isn&#x27;t as good as it</li>
            <li>This effectively keeps your skin from getting irritated during shaving and keeps your skin feeling refreshing all throughout</li>
            <li>I have been using cartridge refill type blades for some time now, not being too impressed with my old Norelco electic shaver.  </li>
            <li>A great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is nice, and is probably my favorite aspect of the device.</li>
            <li>Although I could have charged it in my room, the battery lasted all 5 days, which most of you guys know is amazing.</li>
            <li>While it took a couple of shaves to get used to, I&#x27;m impressed at how soft and refreshed my skin feels after shaving.  </li>
            <li>After three weeks of using it, I can honestly say that I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This electric razor has two blades that contour nicely to my and the cooling feature is actually refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Charging/Cleaning station is nice and stylish.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old fashioned and not used to electric shavers, but this product gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also want the case to be able to hold the cord to keep everything tidy in one place when traveling.  </li>
            <li>If there was a bit more articulation to the shaving head would come in handy.</li>
            <li>It is actually my first electric razor, but after a lot online research and speaking to friends, I figured that it would be a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>what turned out to be perfect timing, I was able to get my hands on a new CoolTec shaver via a Braun promotional program.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great ergonomic shape and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or easily breakable&lt;br</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning is exceptional and it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll always be shaving with a squeaky clean razor.</li>
            <li>it is right for you, then it is a great</li>
            <li>It cools quickly, works remarkably well and delivers the benefit it advertises.  </li>
            <li>The cooling technology at first is very surprising and then it feels great to shave with especially early in the morning to wake you up &#x3D;D.</li>
            <li>but the more I used it the more I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Despite good reviews, the shave isn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an instant burst of coolness that feels so great against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec is already an awesome product, but it&#x27;d be better as the complete Braun gadget package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had a nice close shave and my face felt nice and smooth after using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many razors, both electric and manual and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>The clean &amp; charge station works really good and clean my shaver really good.</li>
            <li>The razor provides a good clean shave for an electric razor</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome idea how cool the shaver is</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times so far and it has been a very pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>shaver itself has a good grip and is more weighty which I like because it gives me more accurate</li>
            <li>But within seconds I was amazed as I felt this cooling sensation as I experienced my first shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>First, the shaving performance itself is not that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that this is the first electric shaver that I have felt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an electric with this feature before but was pretty happy with the operation.</li>
            <li>However great the features are, it is first and foremost supposed to be a razor.  </li>
            <li>The Cool Tec feature is good.</li>
            <li>The idea of having a cool feeling razor on your skin as your shaving is a great idea and feels pretty good, but</li>
            <li>It feels real cool while shaving.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is cool and it makes my face feel good after the shave (even if it&#x27;s all in my head).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also loved to cool feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning - I have used the included Clean &amp; Renew system yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been an issue given the fact that this shaver is really best for trimming stubble.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very comfortable shave and the cooling mechanism</li>
            <li>The feel of the shaver itself is very comfortable and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec as it provided a very comfortable shave which is the number 1 priority for me when it comes to electric units.</li>
            <li>My skin showed no irritation after the shave and had a very smooth feeling, even with some pesky stubble remaining.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it was honestly a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>In the end of the day shavers are meant to do one very important thing, shave your hair.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs very comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>The actaul shaver did leave my skin very smooth and</li>
            <li>On the contrary, the shaver feels well-built and is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec strip would chill my skin as the razor made each pass making a very very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>When plugging the cord to the charger/cleaner unit, the plug did not seem to be very securely attached but it charged just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is very good and gives you a nice clean shave without too much hassle.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the cooling bar is really great and quite innovative.</li>
            <li>Nice an easy to use with the push of a button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>The side trimmer is effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked that it&#x27;s waterproof and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>The shaver recharges quickly and has a good, comfortable-to-hold shape.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Braun shaver because it was easy to use, except for refilling the alcohol cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning process runs through quickly and it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>do really enjoy this razor and am glad I have had the chance to use it!</li>
            <li>I love the color scheme, and the LED lights that are super bright and futuristic.  </li>
            <li>I thought the scent was nice and it has been very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I love it, very smooth.</li>
            <li>But gets a close shave irritation free and most of all razor bumps free!!</li>
            <li>would highly recommnend this product to any friends or family that is looking for a great shave with the added benefit that the electric razor is water proof and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I certainly would not be happy paying well over $100 for a shaver that doesn&#x27;t execute its job.</li>
            <li>Clean, cool shave, great trimmer with some neck negligence.</li>
            <li>When this razor fist arrived I was super happy and excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is also a huge plus!</li>
            <li>have used several Braun models over the years, including the series 7, which in my opinion is their best model.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the cooling function</li>
            <li>Granted, I can shave without it and experience no irritation, but it does feel better to have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All around okay shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall i am very happy with this product and would recommend it to my friends that use power shavers!</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s now my favorite one.</li>
            <li>The coolness is soothing and let&#x27;s me shave longer and more continuously than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try the cleaning station on this one yet to know if it&#x27;s better though, but I hope it is.</li>
            <li>My last Braun was a pulsonic which I was very happy with and used it until it practically fell apart.  </li>
            <li>Instead of getting irritated by the blades and having your face feel like it is on fire, Braun has come up with a better way.</li>
            <li>have been using a triple or quad blade razor for many years</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric razor, I don&#x27;t think you could do better than the CoolTec Shaving System from Braun.</li>
            <li>anyone who likes electric razors, you will love the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li>So pleased to try this product out from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>After using the razor for a week now I have to say I am pleased, it makes shaving with a electric an option again.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>so I was able to test this shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros - very close shave, cleaning of the blades between shave, the cleaner provides a great smell after you shave.  </li>
            <li>I love the case and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun in which I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li>and it takes your face a week or more to get used to an electric razor...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my skin is thanking me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those of you who enjoy shaving in the shower, it is nice to have that feature.</li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>I always used just a razor and shaving cream until I was able to try this.  </li>
            <li>It has its own cleaning station which makes me feel more comfortable about the sanitation of this shaver.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE the cooling bar.  </li>
            <li>If you like electric shavers give it a try, its better than rotary blades that&#x27;s for sure...</li>
            <li>After using the Braun Cooltec for almost a month now, i and thoroughly enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>but if for sure was noticeable.</li>
            <li>I do love the aluminum cooling bar and the sensation it provides.  </li>
            <li>I have been growing out my sexy mustache for movember</li>
            <li>I decided to play it safe and try out the electric shaver that I got from Braun yesterday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a triple head Phillips electric razor for many years</li>
            <li>Great close shave that really hits the mark.&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the cake is the cooling bar.</li>
            <li>Instead through conduction you get an easier more efficient way to remove the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>face will love you for it.</li>
            <li>then I can&#x27;t think of something better.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I was able to get the cleaning station setup</li>
            <li>I also love the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>cleaning station was interesting, and I trust that it cleaned the head of the razor well since it uses an alcohol based solution for three minutes of cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $200.00 on it</li>
            <li>It seems to work much better when the hair is shorter and better maintained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a fan of Braun and most of their products</li>
            <li>but I honestly think their might be better options out there available.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give it one more</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun&#x27;s top shaver&#x27;s from the Activator to the Series 7.</li>
            <li>which is one more thing to bring along when traveling.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m very impressed by how close the shave is for an electric razor because it&#x27;s almost as close as an actual razor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this one the benefit of the doubt that I will get more efficient in how I manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the series 7 before and it was much better.</li>
            <li>I love the innovation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given this shaving system through a program by Braun, and after using the Cooltec, I am extremely glad I was chosen.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The one thing I did love was the cleaning mechanism and couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li>Before turning it on I would say I was about 80% sure I wouldn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Knowing it is cleaning and sanitizing the razor keeps me confident that I am treating my face well.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice ergonomic fit for your hand, but it is heavier than most others.  </li>
            <li>I feel you get more for the price with this razor.  </li>
            <li>As for the cleaning system provided, I must admit that it ends up taking up more counter space than I would like to give to my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is truly an innovative product you will need to try firsthand.</li>
            <li>now shave more than twice a week&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>As the title suggest, I have tried many electric razors and have not found one to be satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Just flip of the top and run it through water.</li>
            <li>The most I went was two days, but did mostly because it was a nuisance to see.</li>
            <li>Holding the unit a a 90 degree angle seems to help it cut better and get closer to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I received the feeling thati would be able to give myself a salon quality shave at home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used many razors and electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>I have not yet tried this, but this is an excellent feature especially when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver, as it reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that my favorite part of this system would be the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>And like i said, while the cooling feature does work, for what this model sells for, I&#x27;d expect much better performance on the shaving end.</li>
            <li>As for the cleaning station, i do like it better than using just water</li>
            <li>This package deal did not come with cover for razor head but had the travel case which I love.  </li>
            <li>Also, since the head of the shaver (aka the cassette) needs more room to house the coolTec bar</li>
            <li>At this point, I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li>defiantly won&#x27;t win any speed records; I found it much slower then my safety razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s Bad?&lt;br /&gt;Braun sells an excellent cleaning stand for its foil shavers, but even on a premium product like the CoolTec, it&#x27;ll cost you extra.</li>
            <li>The close shave for me along with the cooling bar put it over the top.</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying telling others about my &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Best bday present</li>
            <li>The cooling technology sounded great, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Still, an interesting idea.  </li>
            <li>Received a Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program by Braun and am glad to have received it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the gripping points on the razor.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind this razor is at its best when you use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This product was provided to me my a program ran by Braun, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>The cool-tec keeps my skin happy for whole day,</li>
            <li>CoolTech has many benefits and features I do like...</li>
            <li>There was many aspects to this shaver.</li>
            <li>With the trimmer built in it is definately more convenient.</li>
            <li>It did a top notch job on my lip, cheeks, and chin.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>CoolTec is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Top of the line.</li>
            <li>Well, after a month it did not get any better and the shave was just not as close as the 790CC.  </li>
            <li>now if they could only add the Cooltec feature to the 790CC I think they would have the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li>so it can&#x27;t hurt me any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give this 3 stars for being just &#x27;Okay&#x27;.</li>
            <li>too many days!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(But most electric razors aren&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed the quality, comfort, and ease of the Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li>I am always in search of the best when it comes to shaving, as it is a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could get a better shave out of this.</li>
            <li>I mention this because so many electric shavers \\&quot;leak\\&quot; shavings all over your sink and counter</li>
            <li>It feels that the shave would be more efficient if the two blades were together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was never quite sure how to hold the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten used to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works perfectly - cleaning the shaver back to out-of-the-box condition.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works perfectly - cleaning the shaver back to out-of-the-box condition.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>All around I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It still provided an impressive improvement in the amount of times I had to go back over an area of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been electrics around for a while that do this, so that isn&#x27;t by itself that impressive, but it is VERY quiet compared to others that I have used (when cleaning).  </li>
            <li>The recharging/cleaning station is great and makes re-use that much easier.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Could be better.</li>
            <li>I have always used disposable razors, but am glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li>Suffice to say, it was nice to be able to try out this product for free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks, and I&#x27;m generally satisfied with it although it isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery - Honestly, the battery life on this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec shaver from Braun to try out and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.  </li>
            <li>I love the CoolTec cooling strip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The performance of the shaver could be better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning after using was a cinch -- just pop off the top and dust it off with an included brush.</li>
            <li>The more proficient I get with the shaver</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question that this shaver is more efficient and faster then</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, so this shaver was great for me, and it did the job it said it would!</li>
            <li>You can purchase replacements from many places; I found them for 2 for about $10.</li>
            <li>This comes off a bit like a tactic to get more of my money.</li>
            <li>I love how close it shaves and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>but without using it on my entire face, I just can&#x27;t give a perfect opinion.  </li>
            <li>This razor did a great job on my neck, and gave me a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than my Norelco, so I&#x27;m happy with that feature, though I don&#x27;t expect much from it.  </li>
            <li>And I love the feel of the cooling bar.  </li>
            <li>I was able to feel the cooling bar</li>
            <li>I had no skin irritation at all which definitely makes this the best electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I must say I am impressed with the cleaning features and the nice smooth shave I receive, especially post- Movember trimming.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of manual and electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the self-cleaning dock more than once a week because I&#x27;m so used to popping the head off and tapping/brushing the shavings out.</li>
            <li>Noneed for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>On the note of a beard trimmer with no guard, the precision trimmer is an OK feature but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It IS a great feature because it does enhance the performance of the razor as a whole.</li>
            <li>I really love this razor.</li>
            <li>travel 5 days out of the week and was happy to find that I didn&#x27;t have to bring the whole docking station with.</li>
            <li>but I was able to get this product through a program that Braun is running</li>
            <li>It was almost like the blades weren&#x27;t able to reach the hair, no matter what I did to stretch out</li>
            <li>It is stylish and sleek and zippers up rather than being a bulky plastic case that I am used to travelling with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cooling technology is what I really love about this shaver.</li>
            <li>Just flip of the top and run it through water.</li>
            <li>The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely love to see the cooling system in more razors but until then I think i&#x27;m sticking with my Gillette ProGlide Styler.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the aluminum cooling bar ACTUALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to make the shave any better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I tried every type of pressure (light-hard), every direction (360), varying speeds (slow-fast), still wasn&#x27;t able to get all my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of the hair that I wasn&#x27;t able to get was along my neck and my side burn areas.  </li>
            <li>scalp seems to like the electric shaver much more than a razor.  </li>
            <li>Also, the razer itself is probably one of the better setups for waterproof/cleaning that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely love the packaging and the travel case that you put the razor in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
            <li>but I am kind of cheap anyway.</li>
            <li>If my stubble gets longer than 1/16th of an inch, it feels more like</li>
            <li>more than once, I&#x27;ve had to stop shaving to run the device through its cleaning cycle before finishing my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>self-cleaning seems to work better than my 7-series self cleaner</li>
            <li>I was able to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>I got a tester unit from a program run by Braun, and man am I glad that I was able to snag</li>
            <li>favorite part of the bundle was the clean/charge dock.</li>
            <li>so i have avoided most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the capability of being able to just bring it into the shower and get two things done at once.</li>
            <li>I love about the system now:  </li>
            <li>I can use an electric shaver a lot more often without the irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is also more time consuming as you have to pay attention to some parts that are missed and you have to shave them again - I was shaving after a week</li>
            <li>: You wouldn&#x27;t think they could come up with a gadget that can make shaving any better, but they did.</li>
            <li>Either way, it seems to make for a better shave.</li>
            <li>I should start however, by saying that I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for the better part of 30 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using a Panasonic ES-LA 63, which in my opinion, may be the best shaver out there for the price / performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sticking with the Panasonic brand as its 13,000 RPM motors work a lot better for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A couple of places took more than a couple of passes to get to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit itself has a great feel, very weighty and grippy.</li>
            <li>I recommend confidently.</li>
            <li>had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is a good size, looks very sleek, and provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>I love that it cools my face</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel a burn after like I do with most razors.  </li>
            <li>This way the shaver head can remain more compact without warming up while shaving.  </li>
            <li>but it surpassed most of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have always bought disposable razors, I just believed they did better than electric razors.  </li>
            <li>do I love about the Braun CoolTec system.  </li>
            <li>understand not being able to return the \\&quot;flammable\\</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with that feature.  </li>
            <li>Meh... it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I also love the cleaning and recharging station.  </li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is absolutely ingenious.</li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>I gave up on using electric razors more than a decade ago.</li>
            <li>I have never had an enjoyable shaving experience until I got this product  via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping I would be getting something better than I had, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all I really need is a great shave and the CoolTec delivers.</li>
            <li>had no problems with my noreclo, but with this style shaver, I find that is is more troublesome to turn the shaver to hit all the angle of my face,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re getting better, but not quite there yet.</li>
            <li>The concept made sense, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel this much better.</li>
            <li>this one device does a better job than all those things combined.  </li>
            <li>am still enjoying this razor after almost two months.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy to add the CoolTec shaver to my shaving routine!</li>
            <li>and I was especially interested in trying this because the Cooltec technology was not something I had ever seen or heard of before in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it fit in my hand, and it had some weight to it.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling sensation as you&#x27;re shaving after a shower.</li>
            <li>years i have used razors and shaving gels, every once in a while getting a cut, and then having to go out and get more razors.</li>
            <li>The Series 7 is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used on my neck, but still falls short of matching a cartridge.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning process is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a try to see if they‚Äôd come up with something more durable and</li>
            <li>The shaver is good ‚Äì certainly worth the lower price that Braun charges, and I‚Äôd say a better value than their top of the line 700 series.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is also refreshing (especially first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have been able to try the Braun CoolTec Shaving System provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>These 2 items are great but what anyone really wants to know is do you get a close shave?</li>
            <li>This system is just ok.</li>
            <li>the cooling bar really helped reduce irritation that I had previously experienced with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I wasn‚Äôt too pleased by how ineffective the razor was at removing hair, but the cooling bar made up for my displeasure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a chance to try out this electric razor as part of a Braun program and was fairly pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is refreshing to have that coolness while you&#x27;re shaving, and there&#x27;s a bonus on/off switch to turn off the cooling if you&#x27;re trying to save battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can pop the top off the razor and see for yourself that the cleaning works.  </li>
            <li>I love the Braun CoolTec Mens Shaving System.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is touted to be more hygenic than just rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li>The Shaver gets most hairs on the face but the longer you let it grow the more passes you will need.</li>
            <li>It delivers a great shave that is, in my opinion, as close as you can get without a straight razor.</li>
            <li>With this shaver I haven&#x27;t experienced it once thanks to the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>also thoroughly enjoyed how it&#x27;s charged.</li>
            <li>to recap, love the Cooltec system</li>
            <li>, I will continue using it and hopefully with more use I will get faster with it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with skin irritation since using this phenomenal razor.</li>
            <li>I was also expecting more out of this as well).</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, I enjoyed the feeling of the cooling bar on my skin.</li>
            <li>so when I was able to try this one through a program run by Braun</li>
            <li>The shaver did a great job on my face of getting really close.  </li>
            <li>The precision trimmer seemed more like an afterthought.</li>
            <li>you love electric razors</li>
            <li>its worth a shot, if your somebody like me that doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close or as good a shave from one you might want to pass on it.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec shaving system from a program run through Braun and let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be MORE PLEASED with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to get some lotion to use with shaver.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the cool-tec feature.  </li>
            <li>once i get out of the 60&#x27;s and in with technology :)</li>
            <li>If I had that in my 8000 series razor, I would absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but after having tried out this razor, would pay $30-$50 more to have the CoolTec bar on it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is comfortable to hold and looks really nice.</li>
            <li>I opened up the box, set up the ingenious cleaning station, and charged it for an hour.</li>
            <li>Ok if used every day but miss a day it leaves patches on face</li>
            <li>I like my rotary unit  much better, except it can not be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>The razor cut through my beard and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, not even on my neck, which is a sure thing.  </li>
            <li>I also love the cleaning station that makes it sterile.  </li>
            <li>in all, this product is great for men who do not need a very close shave and for men who suffer from razor bumps or skin irritation when shaving.  </li>
            <li>, I just think it should be implemented on a better quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the cooling tech is all integrated with the blade, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to cost quite a bit when I need to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was sent a Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>I have grown to love this</li>
            <li>A problem that many electric shavers have is the friction can make your face feel warm and not as comfortable.</li>
            <li>This razor was able to resolve both issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love about the system now:  </li>
            <li>ok maybe 15.  </li>
            <li>It was refreshing and kept my skin from sticking to the shaver and my hair from getting pulled.  </li>
            <li>two factors that matter most to</li>
            <li>Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>The cooling bar was suprising at first, but quickly felt very good against what would otherwise be irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>clean and charge station was phenomenal!</li>
            <li>My face feels good during the shave and right after.  </li>
            <li>it was very nicely packaged and everything is very high-quality.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system itself has been very nice and very convenient.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know but being able to clean while charging is nice.  </li>
            <li>The clean and renew system is great for keeping it fresh and preventing germs and infections.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver after  hearing that it reduces shaving irritation.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this shaver and my Bruan 7526 Syncro</li>
            <li>The advertised cooling sensation that promised a more comfortable and irritation-free shave seemed to be too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the idea of using an electric shaver rather than a manual one in which I often get cut.  </li>
            <li>was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>When I received my Braun CoolTec System (provided via a program run by Braun), I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec as part of a promotional program run by Braun and was very excited.  </li>
            <li>CoolTec System via a program run by Braun and was very excited to try the cooling feature that was well hyped up.</li>
            <li>, I was very excited about this product because I often suffer from skin irritation and sometimes razor bumps from electric or non-electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very excited to get hold of the CoolTec</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually a nice (unique) feature.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec shaving system as part of a promotional program by Braun and after about 3 weeks of using it, I can honestly say it meets up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I have since thrown that old plastic razor away for good!</li>
            <li>but , so far so good!</li>
            <li>The cool feeling while shaving is wonderful, and the shave is as good as to be expected from a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>As soon as the cool bar kicks in you feel like your shaving with an ice cube, but in a good, smooth, refreshing way.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I am able to shave quicker and that cooling bar feels as good on my face as when a barber puts hot shaving cream on my neck.</li>
            <li>After use, you can either clean it with warm running water or you can stick it in the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>but it never felt like a nice cool refreshing shave.</li>
            <li>But it does keep the razor clean which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>In turn I would have to use a manual razor to clean up leaving me a nice case of razor burn.  </li>
            <li>, I not only feel good after a shave, but I get a good shave and actually use a perfectly cleaned shaving system.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that when I started using this razor that the cooling system has kept the irritation of my face to a minimum; which is awesome because I have super sensitive</li>
            <li>Just smells very clean and</li>
            <li>The shave is very clean and is closer</li>
            <li>This makes the shaver smell very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I really love is that this shaver was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say this is the frustration free packaging advertised is very nice.</li>
            <li>i got the Braun Cool Tec from a program being ran by Braun, and I have to say it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The cooling experience is great for reducing razor burn and irritation from the normal electric or non-electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The first shave was wonderful, it shaved close and smooth the first time without any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>When I first received this Braun cooltec electric razor via a program run by Braun, I was sporting a good mountain man sized beard.</li>
            <li>Takes many passes to get a patch done, many more to make it smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the shave just doesnt match up to the nice cool feeling.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cool Tec feels great to use and leaves my face feeling cool and comfortable after each use.</li>
            <li>and I have to say its pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t perform nearly as good as when I first got it.</li>
            <li>The cool touch feature is really nice.</li>
            <li>The shaving itself was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave while providing a nice cool sensation on the skin that takes the sting out of shaving.</li>
            <li>Good things first.</li>
            <li>At any rate, the cleaning station seems to do a pretty good job clearing the head of cut hair.</li>
            <li>When you use it, it gives your skin a nice, cool sensation.</li>
            <li>All in all the razor was pretty good, it didn&#x27;t get the closest of shaves, but it did help with the razor</li>
            <li>so i had a pretty good beard.</li>
            <li>Now, my skin doesn&#x27;t normally get incredibly irritated when I shave, but it also doesn&#x27;t normally feel GOOD after a shave like it does with the CoolTec.</li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job shaving my face.</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is pretty good for electric.</li>
            <li>The shaver cuts very nice and closer than my older rotating electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I would say it was about 95% as good as the best manual razor I&#x27;ve used, which was miles ahead of any other shaver I have experienced previously, and there was almost no irritation, which again, was unexpected and impressive.  </li>
            <li>The cool feeling truly feels very good on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause the normal skin irritation that I&#x27;m used to getting from these types of shavers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown up using electric shavers, so I was excited to give this shaver a chance!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product, and for any guy looking for a new shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that the CoolTec does live up to hype with regards to skin irritation, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the new 790CC...</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, before buying a Braun CoolTec system, consider whether the great new cooling bar technology will solve an issue you might have with redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>I got a close comfortable shave and the cooling strip really works and feels great.  </li>
            <li>The both together give a smooth, irritation free razor and my skin has felt amazing.</li>
            <li>It fits easily into my hands and holds the charge for a more than ample amount of time.</li>
            <li>And to my pleasant surprise, I think I&#x27;ve accomplished that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation was pleasant and would really help minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is extremely easy and allows for a refreshing experience even after repeated uses.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a convenient shaver that does the job, but not as good as a good shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product, with a good shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that you don&#x27;t need shaving gel or anything to have a comfortable, smooth and close shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall pluses would be: easy to clean and cleaning station works well, cooling effect is soothing on skin and keeps from getting irritated, nice travel case and</li>
            <li>Also, its good if you&#x27;re on the run, travelling or need a good daily shave.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec shaver has a nice quality build, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and the travel accessories are perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the man on the go who wants a irritation free shave</li>
            <li>It was very refreshing and was a smooth, cool feeling.  </li>
            <li>you are the type that shaves every morning, this is sure to make that process easier and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Storing the cleaning station is a bit more of a challenge as the cleaning agent in the system can spill if it is tilted too much, but the plug and cord detach which is good for storage</li>
            <li>In addition, the shaver was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean in the cleaning system that is provided and</li>
            <li>the parts are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the better shave you get, but I think this is true for most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>travel case that this shaver comes with is pretty nice as well, although it would be nice if it could fit the cord and plug as well.</li>
            <li>It came nicely packaged with the instructions right on top.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec Shaving System also comes with a clean &amp; charge station that is unparalleled!</li>
            <li>With that being said, Braun&#x27;s CoolTec razor gives me a close and clean shave!</li>
            <li>love the cooling feature and quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love Braun and I was so excited to be able to test this razor.  </li>
            <li>I was also impressed with the weight and feel of the shaver in my hand, it felt very comfortable and solid, like if I dropped it on the tile it would be fine, not the cheap light plastic feel I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great and cleans it very well and leaves a clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love keeping the unit clean, and the alcohol does a better job at killing the bacteria which is a plus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally the clean and charge station is one of the greatest features.</li>
            <li>However, it does clean really well in the cleaning station, so this is a great feature for me to periodically renew the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gave me a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system not only comes with a cooling option that leaves your skin flawless, it also has a cleaning kit for helping to clean the inside without any</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec electric razor has a cooling area between the blades that is very cool to the touch and gives a soothing sense as the razor glides over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the heads are very good at following all the countours of my neck, face, and head.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec is the only part of the shaver I found to be very good</li>
            <li>It is a very cool shaving on summer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This razor delivers a superior shave and the product seems to have the appreacance in the shape and size as a very high end product.</li>
            <li>Together with the charging/cleaning station and the soft case that will allow me to take this on the road with me, I think this is a great razor for a close shave without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the CoolTec feature or not</li>
            <li>That feature would be great for someone with sensitive skin or razor</li>
            <li>Love the cool tech thing how ever the shave could be better.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly smooth, even better than a manual razor.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m happy to omit any shaving aids, since they often just irritate my sensitive</li>
            <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I have some difficulty with consistency of shaving my neck, but this is usually my own skin type problem as this is a consistent problem with most shavers.</li>
            <li>I have used it wet with shave lotion, and it does awesome.</li>
            <li>It came at the perfect time, as I was about ready to replace my more than 10 year old Braun Synchro 7505.  </li>
            <li>I must have rotated it twenty times while shaving just to see 1) the most comfortable way to hold it and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a precision blade for closer and more precise shaving.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun was great which is why I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>I was also questioning whether or not it would be able to provide me with an irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>This cooling of the skin seems to have kept my skin from becoming irritated when using the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally I enjoy the acoustics when I am gettting my vocals warmed up in the shower. :-)</li>
            <li>However the expense of using blade razors is becoming quite cost prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>The good is my nephew will be getting his first Braun shaver for free....</li>
            <li>Great travel case included - I travel for business frequently and having this case</li>
            <li>and it is more of a cheap gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li>It gave my skin a nice cool and smooth feeling, but that feature alone does not change my mind about keeping my manual razor.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the shave is great as far as the cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>I love the product because it gives a smooth close shave .</li>
            <li>shave is the most important thing here, and for me it was the closest I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this shaver because of the close and smooth shave it provided me.</li>
            <li>Now what I don&#x27;t really care for out weighs all the good I just described.</li>
            <li>After cleaning, the razor was nice and fresh and smelled clinical, which I do not mind.  </li>
            <li>i found that it gives you a very close shave (almost as good as the Razor)</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT WORKS GOOD AND FAST</li>
            <li>The razor is waterproof so you do not have to worry much about giving it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not pull or cause irritation, and it is quite nice to have that cooling bar go over the freshly shaved areas.  </li>
            <li>Immediately loved the cooling sensation on my face and eventually when I was finished it did feel much better than a normal shave.</li>
            <li>Automatic cleaning in the Charge and Clean station is very effective and doesn‚Äôt require much manual cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clean &amp; charge station is also a pretty nice feature as it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and fully charged!  </li>
            <li>I like this new system so much that I recommended it to my best friend of 20+ years.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun customer for many, many years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels nice in your hand, but i feel that the on/off and cooling button should be switched (my thumb rested right on the cooling button).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Five stars is a must for the close shave, easy and quick recharge, simple instructions and wonderful cistomer service</li>
            <li>the foil blades clean easily if rinsed under warm water and if that doesn&#x27;t work the clean station cleans it in about 3 minutes which is very quick.</li>
            <li>First off the solution gives you a good 5-10 cleanings depending on how often you clean it.</li>
            <li>The charge life is great, the fact you can use it wet/dry is another huge plus as I usually shave in the shower, and the CoolTec technology is like nothing I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>every other day, this razor is perfect.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave without the razor burn and leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the cooling bar and you&#x27;ll notice a significant decrease in skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other electric razors with cleaning systems and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>And by all means reread my original review as most of it still applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it takes a significant amount of time more to shave than with a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now I can say that it is one cool cat!</li>
            <li>You are a true pioneer!</li>
            <li>Get a cool close shave!</li>
            <li>but the Cool Tec doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck!</li>
            <li>Some give you great traction, some give you great fuel mileage, hardly any will give you both.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth and kept my face cool with the CoolTec system throughout the shave.</li>
            <li>would recommend this shaver to any guy that&#x27;s looking for an easy to maintain razor that leaves you with a clean smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li>; that is compact and easy to haul along.  </li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>the cooling bar, the handle itself is easy to hold and maneuver around your face.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to use.</li>
            <li>with Jet Clean System]] and really love it.</li>
            <li>Really easy.  </li>
            <li>The better station is the charge and clean station.</li>
            <li>But if I miss a day or two then the thicker hairs do not get cut as easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use and even easier to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Since taking the beard off, I have cleaned the shaver and noted how easy the process was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The cover pops off easily for easy maintenance and care.</li>
            <li>Easy setup with charging station, shaver, and additional</li>
            <li>&gt; - It is easy to use and easy to store in your travel bag</li>
            <li>The charging dock station is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The traveling case is portable and easy to bring along on trips.  </li>
            <li>the package and the instuctions were easy to follow as well.</li>
            <li>But then...I was able to experience the ¬∞CoolTec Shaving system as I used it to clean up my neck.  </li>
            <li>like the ease of the charging/cleaning station and how it makes it easy to care for the unit.</li>
            <li>You could easily forgo the cleansing solution once it runs out if you are not worried about that(or use on occasion rather than every time?).  </li>
            <li>Easily packs in my carryon luggage.</li>
            <li>You have to decide for yourself what is more important, a baby smooth shave, or the convenience of an electric shave with the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li>On most of my face the shave is nice and close, but on  on my chin under my lip I find that I can not get a very close</li>
            <li>self-cleaning works well and is easy</li>
            <li>I love the ability to clean the shaver at the push of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you start looking over everything though it began to make sense, and was rather easy to work</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Charging is easy, just drop it in and press.  </li>
            <li>The buttons are easy, the readouts are simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can still easily maneuver around your face and</li>
            <li>it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The cleaning portion is easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bulky and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is made of a non-slick material so you can easily push the trimmer up and lock in place.  </li>
            <li>made it easy to travel with -</li>
            <li>The waterproof design makes shaving easy and carefree, wherever I decide to shave.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to know that I can pack for a business trip and not have to worry about the power button getting hit while it&#x27;s in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It easily came out of its socket.  </li>
            <li>burns easily so that it is even all the way around.</li>
            <li>The square head makes it easy to control if you have a goatee or mustache</li>
            <li>I am not a regular shaver but was more than happy to try this out as part of a Braun promotion.</li>
            <li>and I break out easily.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t something you can easily keep out.</li>
            <li>Storing the razor safely is easy with the travel case and docking station provided.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to rinse the razor in the sink since it comes with a easily detachable head.</li>
            <li>The handle fits easily in my hand and the razor contours to the shape of my face effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Because of its compact size, it is easy to carry along when travelling and comes with a sleek travel</li>
            <li>strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>anyone that is used to use a classic shaving  machine - this is surely a good product.</li>
            <li>After shaving with it for 2 weeks, I put my older Braun shaver up for good.  </li>
            <li>and they are staying strong.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the shaver works as good as the older models.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, my fact isn&#x27;t red, its COMFORTABLE (for the first time in many years) - its awesome!  </li>
            <li>Deffinatlly would recommend this to everyone its one nice shaver and works very very well</li>
            <li>it self feels good in the hand and feels like its made high quality materials.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above all - Braun&#x27;s CoolTec (provided to me by a program run by Braun) looks good and of high quality.</li>
            <li>It will leave your face smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice quick and close shave and has a neat cooling bar feature that will cool your skin while shaving.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I felt that I got a really close shave, and was very satisfied with the end</li>
            <li>However, on general day to day shaving, it gets the job done and feels great doing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked using electric for the convenience, but always knowing that a razor gets much closer and is a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It really is an enjoyable feel to have a cool shave, when activated.</li>
            <li>However for someone with Rosacea I will gladly trade off the heat and irritation that come with the Series 7&#x27;s close shave for the CoolTec&#x27;s cool bar shave.</li>
            <li>My son loves this the most as it makes all kinds of cool noises.</li>
            <li>The shave was of average quality, and the cooling system was not as impressive as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor and I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to do the full beard yet, because I am waiting for Movember to be over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually feels good on your skin, you should really check this out.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system seems to work pretty well and the carrying case is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>A good thing too, considering I had to go over my face so many more times than I would have with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use for the Braun Cool Tec Mens Shaving System.</li>
            <li>But this shaver is pretty good at getting most of them the first time.</li>
            <li>The cool feeling as I shave is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Good shave for no thick or course hair&lt;</li>
            <li>A razor is pretty intuitive, but it would have been nice to see clearer instructions on connecting the cleaning solution cartridge, using the travel charger, and manual cleaning.</li>
            <li>So the idea of the cool strip was interesting.</li>
            <li>It feels great and is a nice change from other shavers that feel like they&#x27;re going to burn your skin by the time you get done shaving.  </li>
            <li>That said, this &#x27;shaving system&#x27; is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Love the cool tec feel.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the charging station is the right size.</li>
            <li>While the older unit still worked perfectly, I immediately switched over and have ditched the old unit for this one.</li>
            <li>The directions weren&#x27;t super easy or esthetically appealing.</li>
            <li>It is nice to use a razor that is clean and smells fresh for every use.  </li>
            <li>However, the end result - a smooth, clean shave - is achievable with most Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was overly thrilled with it , my older braun might have been better</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electronic shaver that is out there that is out there in the market today.</li>
            <li>In summary, if you don&#x27;t already own an electric razor, and think you really need or would enjoy the cooling feature, this razor could work for you but if you already own a razor that works for you, i doubt this is worth switching to.</li>
            <li>, is light, feels good in my hand, and is highly maneuverable.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this and intrigued by the cool technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then the cleaning station makes it good as new</li>
            <li>or so I am less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>and I was less impressed over time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of the cool feature I will say that it worked well and kept my skin free from irritation - a problem I&#x27;ve had on many shavers before this</li>
            <li>Also, I picked up the series 7 (black version) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that purchase!</li>
            <li>this is fine</li>
            <li>The CoolTec feels WONDERFUL on my face after the shave and leaves it feeling less irritated.  </li>
            <li>The idea of the cool bar integrated on it is a innovative and fantastic idea.  </li>
            <li>I have always just rinsed my shavers under the sink after each use and this has work just fine for years.  </li>
            <li>I was very lucky to receive a free razor from Braun ¬∞CoolTec System for a trail.  </li>
            <li>really love the clean and charge station that came with the set, it is easy to keep the razor clean, and even easier to keep it charged.  </li>
            <li>in that it fits comfortably in my hands and easy to use without worry that I would nick myself.  </li>
            <li>The cool technology makes shaving so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>One thing I always took as a truth was the more hot the skin was the better a shave you could get.</li>
            <li>I would say that part works fine</li>
            <li>The braun cool tec razor provided for a free trail by braun has been a pleasant surprise with a close shave combined with cool roller blades instead of the hot one</li>
            <li>love the self cleaning station , sterile and quick</li>
            <li>this quick!</li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent at shaving and very precise and quick without missing some hairs not cut .</li>
            <li>And This new CoolTec system is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>and I was really impressed by the Clean &amp; Charge Station that actively cleans your shaver after use while also recharging it.</li>
            <li>The LED display is bright and easy to see in my dimly lit bathroom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec Solo and would highly recommend one for purchase.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a first time shaver buyer in look for a great and painless shaver.</li>
            <li>I love that the blade/foil unit pops right off the top making it super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>However, the Charging/Cleaning station is huge.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be any more surprised or happier with the amazing results I have gotten.</li>
            <li>the topic of the cleaning/charging station: Its huge.</li>
            <li>is HUGE, takes up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;-Travel</li>
            <li>I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running.</li>
            <li>I then used the CoolTec Shaver to make my face silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the razor about a dozen times now with various degrees of hair length and can say that I am mostly happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always chalked it up to buying a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great after a short charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li>Comfortable shave -</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar feels nice against your face, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much by way of keeping my face from being irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, not only did this razor surpass my every expectation, it looks and feels great as well.</li>
            <li>CoolTec System for free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>Then there is the cleaning light.</li>
            <li>Though that is where the cleaning feature will really come in handy.</li>
            <li>so for me I am not trying to get a baby&#x27;s butt smooth shave on my face to replace my razor.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and close.</li>
            <li>The cartridge does need to be replaced and there is an indicating light that tells you when it does.  </li>
            <li>The electric shaver was provided free from Braun, but it does not affect my review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never thought that I&#x27;d enjoy a cooling sensation while shaving.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec,(provided free to try from Braun)I</li>
            <li>The shave was close and my skin felt comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning feature is convenient and easy to use, it even has a reminder on the shaver to clean it.</li>
            <li>cooltec gel is awesome, but refills are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>the important part: the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>my face is comfortable afterwards with no</li>
            <li>The razor has a light that illuminates if the razor needs a cleaning</li>
            <li>received my shaver for free, courtesy of Braun.</li>
            <li>Effortless and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>After shaving with the Braun, my face was a smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li>automatic cleaning systems also provides a fresh clean feel, and easily cleans and maintains the shaver in top shape.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product, would give it a 5 star</li>
            <li>I received this shaver to try for free as part of a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>but again, i am low maintenance and am perfectly happy just rinsing &amp; tapping.</li>
            <li>I was provided the shaver via a program run by Braun, the instructions for use were clean and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Hopefully that process goes smoothly.</li>
            <li>All in all though, this is a fantastic razor</li>
            <li>Even though it is slower the convenience being able to shave without water or shave lotion almost anywhere makes the loss of speed almost worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Braun gives me a great close shave, and the cooling sensation is great and really helps the hairs stand straight so they can be shaved evenly and after only one pass.  </li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System for free to try out from a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>travel charger + case which isn&#x27;t the cheap stuff you can get with some razors</li>
            <li>If you shave every 2-3 days then you may want to consider more powerful options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that the Braun CoolTec shaver was FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the CoolTec system</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is great because it save you time from doing the standard breakdown cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not having to spend countless dollars on aftershave/lotion alone makes this razor a great return on investment.</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver going on 3 days now, and there is no irritation, and when I am done shaving I have a baby butt smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Any doubts in buying this for a close comfortable shave don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It does need the charger, so if you travel, you will need to take it with you which can be somewhat of a hassle when you are trying to travel light.</li>
            <li>No &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; period needed between in order to feel comfortable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We buy a lot from Amazon and never had a problem, and the way they handled this issue was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and like the feel that the CoolTec system provides.</li>
            <li>It even works great for me shaving my head since I wear my hair so low.</li>
            <li>I have found this razor to be excellent for everyday</li>
            <li>For men with finer facial hair this would be a great buy.</li>
            <li>I got this for free from Bzzagent, and tried it immediately.</li>
            <li>I received Braun CoolTec shaving system for free from Braun as part of a trial program, and I was ecstatic to be receiving a $200 shaver from a well-respected company.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would take too much additional space and would be nice to keep both together.</li>
            <li>With a push of a button it is easy to clean .</li>
            <li>I enjoy sing my cooltec shaver, the cooling blade allows for a soothing shave.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when my Braun Cooltec in the mail thanks to a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks ago, I received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver in the mail from Braun, free of charge, under the guise that I would speak about my experience.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortably shave and the CoolTec System works noticeably well.</li>
            <li>However, the SensoBlade still gave me a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver for free from a program run by Braun to review.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec was provided to me free to try by Braun, but I didn&#x27;t let that bias my review in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>i could change anything, it would be to adjust the location of the button for the cooling button, and perhaps adjust the size of the openings in the foil to fit a thicker whisker like mine.</li>
            <li>Effortless and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Everything else was great, I could shave and just rinse the shaver under the sink and put it back in the stand.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall a great shaver that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I received the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free as part of a promotion from Braun.</li>
            <li>Had I not gotten this shaver for free, I wouldn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>I was offered a Braun CoolTec shaver for free as part of a Braun promotion in which I was supposed to try the product and give a review of my thoughts on the shaving system.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the shave, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the cheap flimsy plastic</li>
            <li>I thinnk this is a great shaver for the man with a medium facial hair growth.</li>
            <li>However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and</li>
            <li>was free</li>
            <li>For myself it was one of the only gifts I was truly happy to get this year.</li>
            <li>would recommend this razor if you you have want a comfortable shave, and enjoy using electric razors.</li>
            <li>shave is close and his skin is smooth, even in the afternoon (which is quite a feat for his whiskers!)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the fantastic things about any Braun shaver -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ability to provide a decently smooth shave.</li>
            <li>When I want an area of my face to be hair free, it has to be hair</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec for free from a program Braun runs.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec System free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>I Received my Braun CoolTec Shaver free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>The cooling strip is nice and really does seem to help reduce the irritation.</li>
            <li>but if you have longer facial hair it doesn&#x27;t do the job to great</li>
            <li>I received the shaving system for free from a program through Braun.  </li>
            <li>At the $200 level, it made me wince a bit, but at $135, it was more than worth it.</li>
            <li>The electric razors help to keep a smooth looking face and no burn.  </li>
            <li>The base/stand does a great final job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nextis the cooling strip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric shaver kind of guy.</li>
            <li>It was a close comfortable shave in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>and you can feel patches in your face that you just can&#x27;t get smooth out with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-Horrible on the neck area.</li>
            <li>Zero discomfort issues, no razor burn whatsoever, and I get a comfortable close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive this item via a program with Braun.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth and painless.</li>
            <li>I am always searching for the next great thing when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked the design, it is very sleek looking and the shaver itself</li>
            <li>This shaver also drastically improved my opinion of electric shavers and how much technology has been improved to alleviate irritation while getting a nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not forget about the primary purpose: shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes some practice and you need to counter space to set up the Clean&amp;Charge station, but my face is just as smooth as when I used my Gillette razor</li>
            <li>you are looking for a great daily shaver,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave is baby smooth, As soon as you turn on the cooling functionality</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the only thing I wasn‚Äôt happy with was the shave, which doesn‚Äôt bode well for a razor.</li>
            <li>I received this shaver for free to write my review of the product.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor free.</li>
            <li>The device causes absolutely no rashes or burns and works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and the cooling system kept the razor burn at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received this system free from a Braun program that they were running.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec.  </li>
            <li>I think this kinda makes this point not as great as if the actual shaver it self worked.</li>
            <li>I got a very close shave and the cooling sensation feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Compared to my Norelco electric razor that I had years ago, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Compared to my Norelco electric razor that I had years ago, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>so when I got a chance to participate in a promotion where I received a cooltech razor from Braun for free</li>
            <li>CoolTech provides a comfortable, smooth shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>The cool strip that is suppose to keep your face from becoming irritated from shaving works,</li>
            <li>It actually works great.</li>
            <li>cleaning solution that was supplied smells like cheap vodka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can imagine it took quite a bit of engineering to fit a cooling system into a shaver.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning dock is great and very quiet!  </li>
            <li>This shaver looks great, and since it doesn&#x27;t have a port to plug it in, you can actually use it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to just return the razor and have the unit clean and charge it for me.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product from Braun to try and keep for free.</li>
            <li>I got the braun cooltec for free from a program</li>
            <li>However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and</li>
            <li>was free</li>
            <li>clean system is good at clean the shaving and use it very faster to clean</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I placed it in the container and it was surprisingly cleaned up many tiny hairs.  </li>
            <li>and so far it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>up was super easy - the instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the cleaning system is that it requires additional purchases for more cleaning solution ‚Äì hopefully I can find a good deal on those.  </li>
            <li>However, when I let my hair grow for 2 days or more the growth seems to be more than this razor can handle in a reasonable amount of time...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It provides an awesome cool sensation for your skin and helps cut down on irritation.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the razor to anyone needing a good quick shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the shaver very easy to use and the dock/cleaning system was pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li>The first time I uses the Clean and Charge station, the Braun did come out nice and clean but again I don&#x27;t see a need to use it every shave.</li>
            <li>The entire unit is a nice size, and does not take up too much space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec technology was a very nice feature</li>
            <li>Also, consider your budget and the great many other Braun models available at a lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it says cool, it means cool!  </li>
            <li>I love how the trimmer is right on the razor</li>
            <li>and I feel like it isn‚Äôt able to get right up to the edge of my beard, even with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, I realized that I needed to make more room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the cool tech idea would work, but it makes the shave very comfortable.</li>
            <li>That said, I have gotten the plug to stay for the most part, and that quirk has not damaged my positive experience with this razor!</li>
            <li>That‚Äôs fine with me as I got a clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was happy I was able to test the shaver and would give it as a gift to other members of my family.</li>
            <li>Its easy to turn the cool bar on and off with no problems.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this product 3 stars because I did not feel it was worth the money but wanted to give it more time to see if I would get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cool charger.</li>
            <li>clean the foils, the top of the shaver comes right off to allow you to clean the hair out of the mechanism easily.  </li>
            <li>The travel charge kit is also very nice since I travel a lot for work and like to keep my neck properly groomed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a quality electric razor that&#x27;s easy to use, extremely effective, and effortless to clean.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is a very nice shaver</li>
            <li>Since you can shave closer, faster, and more comfortably with the 790cc-4 I&#x27;m sticking with that, but would be happy to buy a new top of the line razor with shave performance similar to the 790cc which includes the cooling tech, however, there is some work to be done by Braun.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, just set the shaver in the Clean &amp; Charge station and press</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver is as good as the Panasonic and shaves as close as most electric shavers can.&lt;br /&gt;The system also has a clean and charge station with a replaceable cleaning fluid that installs super easily at the bottom of the station.</li>
            <li>For the most part it gets a pretty close shave and the CoolTech system works great, but the actual shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to get every hair on your face.</li>
            <li>While that doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like a very satisfying sensation, I&#x27;ll take a cool &amp; comfortable face over the burning and irritation I have experienced with other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I get a great shave in no time flat with the Braun ‚Å∞CoolTec.</li>
            <li>cooling feature is indeed really cool (pun intended), but if you want a perfect shave, I would suggest a straight razor or a different electric razor.</li>
            <li>This razor should be, first and foremost, a device for shaving and, though the technology built into it (and around it, if you consider the cleaning station) is nice, it does not and cannot make up for its lack of a good shave for me personally.</li>
            <li>Aside from the high price tag, I definitely think its an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to be awesome and had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>The CoolTech is nice, quality shaving system and is definitely worth a look should you be on the market for a new shaver.d to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you like that clean smooth feeling...this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>Plus, when you do take it on the road, you can clean it under running water if the cleaning station isn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy to remove from the box.</li>
            <li>The cleaning machine was super easy, just set it and forget it.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is really nice and it really does keep your skin cool.  </li>
            <li>I think its awesome that it cleans its self and is ready for the next time you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Overall product is okay and works better for somebody whom has lighter facial hair but the packaging and cleaning kit is great to have and thats one thing i love about Braun</li>
            <li>it was super easy to setup, too.</li>
            <li>From the first shave I found it faster, closer and definitely more comfortable than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once it kicked in it really felt nice and cool.</li>
            <li>And quick and easy use.</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad shave and the CoolTec has a very nice feel, but I expected more for the price.    </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Clean &amp; Charge station, it&#x27;s a very modern looking station yet would fit in well in any bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I very much have enjoyed having the cooling aluminium running across the lenght of the razor head</li>
            <li>The new Braun CoolTech delivers a perfect shave and finally comparable to manual razors.</li>
            <li>you use electric razors and need a new one, this one (Braun CoolTec) is worth the $200, you still get a good shave</li>
            <li>The cleaning station that comes with it is great and really does keep the razor blades feeling new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I am very impressed by the Braun CoolTec System and would definitely recommend this to a family member or friend looking at getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I think the razor will be a great quick shave tool, especially since it causes zero irritation.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the shaver was easy to use and gave a clean quick shave.</li>
            <li>My facial hair grows rather quickly and if I shave every day it provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is a great feature and it is super simple to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is quick and easy to clean and charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how smooth the shave was and how cool my face stayed throughout the shave.</li>
            <li>and i was excited to get it</li>
            <li>This product has some &#x27;cool&#x27; hi-tech features providing a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure my beard beat the blades into submission.</li>
            <li>First electric that I can use more than twice a week without bumps of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave me a cool comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Next, the shave itself is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I have had excellent results with Braun products and I have no reason to believe that, if properly taken care of, this CoolTech shaver will last me many years.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the skin cool and provided a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>With the Cool Tec shaver, which i received free from a promotion from Braun, all i have to do is press a button and the shaver cleans itself.  </li>
            <li>I tried this, but of course the hot water negated most of the cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to have the privilege to test the Braun CoolTec CT5cc shaver that was given to me for evaluation and review by Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I get another one I&#x27;ll explore this option more. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This system keeps your skin feeling smooth and cool and it has helped reduce skin irritation when I shave.</li>
            <li>I am typically a normal razor kind of guy.</li>
            <li>When I just need to go over my face quickly in the morning before work, then it works fine.</li>
            <li>This is my first wet/dry shaver, and I love that I can rinse it off in water.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product as it was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>My skin felt cool and smooth after each shave.  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li>my first use I immediately fell in love with the cooling bar.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m noticing a better shave the first time around which is saving me time</li>
            <li>Update to original review</li>
            <li>Original ------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found myself doing many more passes than I did with the 790cc and actually caused more irritation.  </li>
            <li>the razor looks cool and is totally comfortable to hold an maneuver while shaving.  </li>
            <li>and I must tell you that it makes me laugh when I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li>but I was excited to see how this worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am interested in trying anything on the market that is innovative</li>
            <li>Upon turning on the shaver and applying it to my face, I did not notice a significant amount of cooling on my face.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a cool, irritation free, quality electric shave?&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>I was excited when I read about the features of the CoolTec by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li>have to say after reading about it I was really excited to give it a try</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>and I am excited about it.  </li>
            <li>It has significantly reduced the appearance of razor bumps for me.  </li>
            <li>This shaver, just like all electric shavers,does not like longer whiskers so be sure to use the trimmer first if your beard is longer.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to just throw it on the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station after each use and not have to worry about it being charged or cleaned when I went to shave next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being cleaned and charged, I tried it out for the first time.</li>
            <li>Instead of hiding the shaver in cabinets or drawers in my bathroom, I excitedly set it up on my bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li>As a guy who has used electric shavers most of his life, I was very excited when I received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System via a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>They gave the razor, a very nice travel case, and small travel sized travel charger as well as an amazing charge and clean station.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Build: My old rotary shaver is very light and made mostly of rubber and plastic, so it was a bit of a surprise to hold the CoolTec, which has quite a bit of heft to it.  </li>
            <li>So the prospect of a Braun razor that would provide a clean, close shave and minimize skin irritation was something I was truly excited about.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it because this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>When I first heard about the Braun CoolTec Shaving System, I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>not as great above the lip.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a great system when compared to other electric shavers.</li>
            <li>However, if you have realistic expectations, such as comparing it to other electric shavers, none of which will shave as close as the best manual razors, then the Braun CoolTec may be a great choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This new CoolTec shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>This new technology is amazing from the closest shave ever with no irritation to talk about.  </li>
            <li>I like knowing my shaver is clean before each</li>
            <li>With the CoolTec system, you can clean and charge this shaver with the push of a button by putting the razor in the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free directly from Braun to try it out and give my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have to follow up with my razor to keep my neck completely clean.  </li>
            <li>The indicator is telling me to clean after each use.  </li>
            <li>the cooling sensation makes my skim feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>so it knew the intensity to clean at.  </li>
            <li>to clean -&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to clean it with a brush.</li>
            <li>Where I&#x27;d go over my face over and over with my Panasonic ES8103S Shaver just to get halfway clean shaven, the CoolTec was probably 1/2 the passes.</li>
            <li>system also comes with a clean and charge station that is recommended to use after every shave.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is place the shaver in the clean and charge station and push the power button, it runs through a 3-minute self clean cycle.</li>
            <li>They irritate my skin and/or a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best way to shave my neck with no red marks.&lt;br /&gt;Thee</li>
            <li>The package contained the razor, the charger and cradle, the Charge and Clean station, cleaning solution, a cleaning brush, travel case, and user‚Äôs</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also clean the CoolTec under running water.  </li>
            <li>It gives me peace of mind that after I am done that my razor will be clean and disinfected.</li>
            <li>While it is amazing, the bar will actually HEAT UP if you use it for more than about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also waterproof so you can have a shave in the shower or just take it apart when you&#x27;re done shaving and stick it under the tap to clean it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this item to anyone who is not as worried about a clean shave but do get irritated areas when shaving.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it makes my skin and no burning after shaving thanks to the cooling bar.</li>
            <li>This razor is excellent and honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong selecting this on a deal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Of the 15+ shavers I have used in my lifetime (and some manual shaving too), this razor is by far the best because instead of making the motors bigger and faster, Braun decided to focus on comfort as well.</li>
            <li>The shaver also came with a charge and clean system.</li>
            <li>Once I was done shaving I placed the shaver on the &#x27;Clean and Charge&#x27; station and the station started to clean my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>\\&quot;clean and Renew\\&quot; system refills every three months.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it gets as clean and sterilized as the 7.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is sub-par, and doesn&#x27;t properly clean the razor.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Charge Station</li>
            <li>Close clean</li>
            <li>Cost of additional clean and renew solution cartridges.</li>
            <li>I have had a number of electric shavers that claim you can clean them and</li>
            <li>However, if you like to keep a completely clean look, then I imagine the shaver would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor and the cooling effect is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>- The indicator on the shaver that tells you when it needs to be cleaned seems to be a bit too sensitive and a bit of a scam to get you to clean it more and buy more cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say you should clean it about once a week</li>
            <li>It has a charging/cleaning station to ensure a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It also has a built in trimmer to help clean up your beard, goatee etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tended to start out with the electric, and clean at the end with my blade.  </li>
            <li>to clean.  </li>
            <li>have since kept the beard but tried to keep my neck line clean.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that the electric razor would give me a close clean shave.</li>
            <li>I tried again as a dry shave and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The Clean &amp; Charge station keeps the unit clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to brushing my Braun with the provided brush, keeping it neat and clean.</li>
            <li>When I am at home, I can just drop the shaver into the Clean and Charge station and it will charge automatically.</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor clean without me having to do anything.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to take the heads off to clean the razor blades.  </li>
            <li>had my doubts I would be able to use this because I haven&#x27;t been able to frequently use any shaving system, ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a trimmer attachment is another plus because it helps to clean up the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A brush and some rubbing alcohol and about 1 minute of your time will clean this.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll find the razor, cleaning station, power cord, zippered travel case, charging cradle, one Clean and Renew cartridge, cleaning brush and manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cooling Bar works, but a clean shave would be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;1)Try to clean shave around adams apple or under chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - Although it takes me more time, I do get a very close shave with no burn and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen an electric shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li>To get a clean shave</li>
            <li>Clean at the press of a button.  </li>
            <li>But, it is a shaver that is mid-range when it comes to a close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>albeit spotty this will give it to you since you wont get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth and quick shave when I am on the go.</li>
            <li>The shaver provided clean shave for halfe my face, then it needed cleaning in order to continue.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>so I use it to clean up</li>
            <li>so keeping the shaver clean was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The system also helps to clean up the blade so it prolong the blade</li>
            <li>Its comfortable, powerful, and precise.</li>
            <li>Well I set it up and let it clean the razor</li>
            <li>Once the shave was complete I was honestly amazed with how close and smooth of a shave I had received from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>This keeps the product clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li>But Braun&#x27;s unique cool technology has me hooked.</li>
            <li>But Braun&#x27;s unique cool technology has me hooked.</li>
            <li>so I got really excited when I got the Braun cool Tec Shaving System.</li>
            <li>It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  </li>
            <li>The Braun Cool Tec electric shaver is by far the best shaver I have used ever since switching over to electric shavers (I have purchased five different electric shavers before purchasing the Braun Cool Tec shaver) and is well-worth the money.</li>
            <li>The battery does not have a very large capacity so if traveling for more than a couple of shaves worth</li>
            <li>Setup was easy and everything was provided to get you started right away.</li>
            <li>The head pops right off and is easily rinsed, as is the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li>This was a very good razor, but I have to admit that I use it mainly for in between standard razor shaves.</li>
            <li>It was a close, clean, and cool shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that I need too many passes for a good shave, a lot fewer than the Norelco in fact.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that I need too many passes for a good shave, a lot fewer than the Norelco in fact.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning solution is really cool and it leaves the razor smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>But I will use this Cooltec as my travel shaver as its much more compact, certainly good enough as a daily shaver, and ‚Äì since I fall for almost every gimmick ‚Äì has a cool bar that makes my face feel nice in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you trim it first, then use this shaver after, to clean it up a little and create the look</li>
            <li>and it is certainly the most &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; electric I have tried.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec Solo through a special program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>I still have to make repeated passes over certain portions of my face, mostly around my mouth and on my neck.</li>
            <li>It cuts closely and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It cleans the shaver well enough, but I think I can get as good of a clean if I just did it myself.  </li>
            <li>it makes sure your razor is clean and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine because you get a full shave&#x27;s worth of juice in 5 minutes, just as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li>I keep having to clean up with a cartridge razor to get an actual good shave out of the device.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about it and really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t chafe your skin no matter how hard you press it against your skin, but in order to get the closest shave possible, you will have to apply a good amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately thrilled about the CoolTec system that keeps the head of the shaver very cool for the entire shave, keeping my skin cool and un-irritated.  </li>
            <li>technology is amazing in this thing as far as the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; element.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my face especially in the hot shower.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have issues with skin irritation with electric razors but this is just more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers I have owned in the past never did a great job on my neck hairs</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus on my end, and the fact that it has a battery guage telling you how much life you have left in the shaver is great too.</li>
            <li>Who knows why it took so long to think of something so obviously amazing!</li>
            <li>Because of this, I have never really found an electric shaver that works great for me.</li>
            <li>That is definitely cool.</li>
            <li>Clean&amp;Charge Station was really cool and something I have not seen before.</li>
            <li>I say when activated because this system allows you to turn the cool bar on and off.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec system also comes with a travel case and travel lock feature to prevent it from turning on in your luggage-how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can feel that it is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the cleaning station was a really cool added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that if electric razors work well for you, this is a good razor to try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true or not.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely a cool piece of tech</li>
            <li>It does feel cool, and eliminates the need for shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>They told me I was receiving a CoolTec razor that kept my face cool during shaving.</li>
            <li>I let the cooling bar cool off before I started to shave.</li>
            <li>I kept shaving and my face stayed cool.</li>
            <li>the automatic cleaner works wonders and always keeps the blades nice and clear from hair and skin.</li>
            <li>The shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to just slide in and fit snugly in the station, it seems as though you need to manipulate it a bit to make sure that the prongs on the back of the shaver are touching the connectors on the station</li>
            <li>It really just helps to make the whole shaving experience more satisfying.</li>
            <li>If you have rosacea you will understand the need to keep your face cool.</li>
            <li>The technology geek snob in me wants the top of the line series 7 shaver.</li>
            <li>Just a cool gimmick trying to make a sell.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts that this Cool Tec could dethrone Norelco&#x27;s nifty 3D blades, but the Braun&#x27;s Cool Technology piqued my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good thing we got Prime now, since I know I&#x27;ll never find them locally.</li>
            <li>But the Cool Tec is just ...</li>
            <li>But the Cool Tec is just ...</li>
            <li>the Cool bar thing was really sweet.</li>
            <li>My wife even commented on how nice and soft my skin</li>
            <li>It was really cool and kept my face from feeling the heat of the electric blades.  </li>
            <li>cool.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation felt like a cool breeze on your face and gave a sense of freshness to it.</li>
            <li>It was a good feeling and made your skin feel rejuvenated after the you got used to the initial exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packing was cool.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered a Braun CoolTech razor to review, I went in with somewhat of a bias, but the razor sounded cool</li>
            <li>I have come to the conclusion that it is a good razor to use in combination with my regular razor.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cool Tec shaver has provided a quality shave, comparable to when I used razors.  </li>
            <li>I turned on the cool bar on and began shaving.</li>
            <li>The skin truly feels cool to the touch and provides an invigorating feel.</li>
            <li>Works extermely well and the CoolTec feature is cool...</li>
            <li>I could tell the razor would get cool but never felt 44 degrees.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to be a good product overall</li>
            <li>Keep your skin cool</li>
            <li>Keep your skin cool</li>
            <li>I havent found many electric shavers which I like too much.</li>
            <li>Which is good , since I usually only get that close of a shave with my Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>Now the cooling bar on this thing is surprisingly cool.  </li>
            <li>I figured it does such a good job with my face</li>
            <li>the Braun Cool Tec shaver system has a built in cleaner and lubricator.  </li>
            <li>This feature is designed to cool your skin and reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li>CoolTec System via a program run by Braun, and really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I like knowing that my shaver is getting a full cleaning and being sanitized without any effort on my part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if the price of the razor is a concern it will be good to note that there will be additional future fees to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s shaving system through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>By keeping your skin cool during shaving, the ¬∞CoolTec shaver minimizes redness, burning and itching sensations and leaves skin cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll like this when I give a full face shave.  </li>
            <li>but it does have some really cool features.</li>
            <li>I was in full beard mode when I got my CoolTec through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>I thought the Braun Cool Tec shaver worked well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, i was very pleased with the shaver and enjoy the cool feeling when i go to shave.  </li>
            <li>(Everything from the packaging to the design of the shaver itself is cool and ergonomic).  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good electrice razor.</li>
            <li>After a couple passes, the cool sensation did feel soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does leave a cool feeling on the face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool.</li>
            <li>The Cooltec feature is cool</li>
            <li>: It does a good job on the bigger surfaces.</li>
            <li>Returning the Cool - Tec&lt;br /&gt;2  </li>
            <li>but I have a full beard</li>
            <li>Keeping it simple is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I have also always preferred a rotary shaver because I did not get a good shave with the last foil shaver I tried.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to say that I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything before and gotten the cool, soothing sensation that this gives.</li>
            <li>But because its a Braun, and it does have some cool features (pun intended)</li>
            <li>This unit utilizes a CoolTec bar that keeps cool and soothes the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice feature particularly on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>Its almost a relaxing experience to have the cool metal brush against your cheeks.</li>
            <li>In my 25 years of shaving, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of gimmicks come and go and most of them really didn&#x27;t add anything to the shave.</li>
            <li>This is a cool idea for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used the razor four times before I came back to write a review because I wanted to give it a fair go.</li>
            <li>Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Not So Cool Stuff:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll NEVER get as close a shave as with a regular razor, it does a fairly good job for an electric.  </li>
            <li>The cool bar is a neat feature</li>
            <li>They were just good enough.</li>
            <li>It does work, it does feel cool, and is pleasant(although</li>
            <li>But for full price?</li>
            <li>Anyway cool idea on paper,</li>
            <li>I like the cool feeling of the bar on my face and had no burning after.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good shaving system and gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CoolTec is surprising quiet for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It does cool the skin while shaving&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like cool rag against your skin without the redness after a close shave.</li>
            <li>Then the moment of truth, would this thing actually shave good?</li>
            <li>Better than the really pricy 7000 which it is replacing.</li>
            <li>But the Braun cool shaver does what it says  it would do and that it would take the redness out and cool your skin .</li>
            <li>Another cool feature of this Braun shaver is the speed at which it recharges the battery.  </li>
            <li>I just dont feel like I get a good shave with an electric razor and really prefer a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; disposable blade razor.</li>
            <li>That is just cool.</li>
            <li>but after the initial shock absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m more impressed than I expected to be.  </li>
            <li>The Cooling System is a piece of metal that, you guessed it, gets cool during shaving.</li>
            <li>Quick, clean, and efficient</li>
            <li>It drains the battery faster and it doesn&#x27;t really make the shave any better.</li>
            <li>There are two holders/chargers that come with this system, both of which are very sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;REFRESHINGLY COOL</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first day after the shave and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I would be able to skip using lotion to cool my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s no a bad thing though because the added weight doesn&#x27;t make it cumbersome to hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t prefer the shaver it&#x27;s not shockingly bad.  </li>
            <li>No razor burn, feels fresh, cool, light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok the trimmer works great, that&#x27;s nice but not terribly surprising.  </li>
            <li>The two blades contour nicely to my face without much effort, the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice if you&#x27;re in a hot shower, and the handle fits easily in my hand and has enough weight to feel a little luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to it, as of right now I&#x27;m very satisfied but not quite sure if I&#x27;m ready to through away my old manual razor just</li>
            <li>I plan to enjoy the new CoolTec razer for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new, more advanced machine</li>
            <li>it is decent and the cooling technology is new and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The CoolTech is nice, quality shaving system and is definitely worth a look should you be on the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really stand the beard anymore, so I thought it would be a good time and pull out my new Cooltec</li>
            <li>Speaking of CoolTec, this is a great feature, that while you may think is gimmicky, actually feels very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>The cooling strip is an excellent idea and really did reduce the skin irritation that I typically had to endure after shaving.</li>
            <li>hey it&#x27;s free right,</li>
            <li>The shaver does feel super cool once the feature is turned on.</li>
            <li>I however was not as impressed with the closeness of the shave, i had to use a disposable razor to clean up several areas that it would not get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>cleaning option is great and it only takes a couple minutes to have a fully clean and lubricated razor ready to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a cleaning station that is super cool.</li>
            <li>expected the cooling system to be a novelty, but it&#x27;s actually very effective.  </li>
            <li>After trying both the regular setting as well as the cool setting, I have to say that both were pretty nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is really nice as well and did a great job cleaning the shaver after a shave ‚Äì much better than I would have done ‚Äì and it only takes a few minutes and its done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the sleekness of the razor, and the awesome cooling sensation that seems to actually keep the irritation away, this entire system is very well-designed and stylish.</li>
            <li>have to say there were a lot of things to like about the razor and the CoolTec feature: close shave, calm skin, cool feel, quick charge, familiar Braun charging and cleaning station, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor for anyone who likes a smooth, clean shave!</li>
            <li>When I received this razer from Braun as part of a promotion, there wasn&#x27;t really any special events occurring for me, so I just went with it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave, again, wasn&#x27;t really all that effective.  </li>
            <li>The reasonably priced &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; refill packages keep the shaver very clean and ultra sanitary....</li>
            <li>My Norelco still works great, and certainly cost enough.</li>
            <li>My Norelco still works great, and certainly cost enough.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product works great</li>
            <li>cleaning system works great as I am used to with my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other great thing is that this is a system.</li>
            <li>But with the cool tech after using for more than a week daily my face is in tip top shape no break outs no irritation.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna spend money on a shaver, why not spend a little more and get a really good one?</li>
            <li>would use this razor every day if I needed to stay fresh and clean and presentable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the active cooling technology is great and it does its job</li>
            <li>cleaning station works well and leaves the razor with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>cleaning station works well and leaves the razor with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>cleaning in charging station feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li>i was super stoked.</li>
            <li>After a quick charge I had to give this razor a try.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to people that are looking for a great electric razor that gives a very close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li>It will give me a super close shave while keeping my face chilled (from the built in cooling system.</li>
            <li>I quickly plugged it in</li>
            <li>As far as being an actual shaver goes, though, it was incredibly disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never shaved as close or quick as a razor in addition</li>
            <li>The cooling bar has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>While i did find the cooling feature innovative and refreshing, it&#x27;s not exactly necessary.</li>
            <li>Nothing a quick stroke with a disposable can&#x27;t fix, however.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is isopropyl alcohol based for sterilizing the razor &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; allowing for quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually mitigated this by using after shave or lotions, but what this razor has done is very innovative and honestly has saved me a lot of money in aftershave and skin lotions.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed no skin irritation, no drag on the skin and over all a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>, Fast charge, 4+ shaves per charge, Easy clean &amp; charge, Trimmer included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cos</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best overall shaver that I have ever had!</li>
            <li>Quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I need a quick, close shave&amp;#34; shaver.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job and left my skin very</li>
            <li>It does a great job and fits very well in my hand for being a larger guy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s solid, a comfortable weight and has nice grips.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The foils do pivot side-to-side which is adequate for the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li>The charging is super</li>
            <li>When I use the Braun CoolTec, I can get a quick shave and run off to whatever I need to do.  </li>
            <li>The shaver heads clog quickly too, and</li>
            <li>However, if you are mainly after a close shave, there are better options in the price range without the cooling</li>
            <li>As a 30 something male that absolutely hates shaving, I have found the Braun CoolTec System to be a great razor.  </li>
            <li>I had to shave quickly</li>
            <li>and this razor did not come close to quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did feel the cooling sensation coming from the razor which did feel good, but it was not cutting the facial hairs off like</li>
            <li>This razor definitely cut better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; aspect of this shaver was extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The pores would open and thus allowing more hair to protrude giving you a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, being fully waterproof is a huge plus that I honestly didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>Maybe a quick start guide with color pictures</li>
            <li>received the razor through a program run by Braun and have never been more satisfied with a personal grooming device!</li>
            <li>The equipment added to clean the shaver is easy fast to set up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not as quick as a safety razor</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the long-term cooling effect improves irritation, but the instant cooling effect feels nice and seems to provide a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The best way I can equate the cooling feature is if you put a cold can of soda on your warm face/forehead.  </li>
            <li>the cooling effect left my face feeling great and it cut very close to the skin..</li>
            <li>is the ability to drain the blade rather quickly after the cleaning since the liquid tend to drip all over.</li>
            <li>so it dries up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of using this shaving system, I could never get an adequate shave.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver has been in FREQUENT use for over 4 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver which was provided via a program run by Braun, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I would probably say that this razor best suits somebody who shaves every single day, as it seemed to struggle to do anything to even a light beard, and could not evenly trim very short hair.</li>
            <li>Not quite the absolute baby smooth fine feeling (across the grain, so to speak), but very close and very adequate for a day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have not used an electric  razor for many years and was impressed with how the CoolTec left little irritation.</li>
            <li>Shaver also leaves your skin feeling very refreshed and feeling very cool.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s just ok but might be good for someone with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great shaver and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I found that it was not as close a shave as I normally get from a razor which meant shaving more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently grown a &amp;#34;chinstrap beard&amp;#34;, and while I can maintain it with this unit, it requires far too much work to doso without taking out a chunk of a perfectly manicured line.  </li>

            <li>I ordered this for my son who has been using his father&#x27;s for years and was so excited to finally have his own.  </li>
            <li>Braun shaver owner and enjoy their products and the features that are offered, but this by far was the most exciting.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec keeps my face cool and calm.</li>
            <li>the cooling feature is cool and does calm the skin</li>
            <li>I received this shaving system through a free promotion from Braun and first thing I will say is the design wasn&#x27;t overly bulky in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is my very first electric razor and was provided to me through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>There is a bar that sits in the middle between the foil elements that draws heat away from the foil and is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Pretty close and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the flip side to the razor.</li>
            <li>I never would have changed on my own simply because I dealt with what was familiar.  </li>
            <li>I first got the Braun CoolTec Shaving System via a program with Braun for free</li>
            <li>think this shaver sits in a niche market, those who don&#x27;t need to shave often, or can&#x27;t due to sensitive skin,and don&#x27;t need a perfect shave when they do.  </li>
            <li>First off I received this shaver for free as part of a marketing program.</li>
            <li>I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and for an electric razor, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar in the middle of the razor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar in the middle of the razor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>, the bar keeps my face cool and calm while shavings so on that front</li>
            <li>I recently received the Braun CoolTec electric razor through a program run by Braun and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I am still quite pleased with the razor and think that the cooltec feature is a nice addition to an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I think the Braun CoolTec is an innovative product and will definitely be loved by a lot of individuals, especially those with sensitive skin that suffer from irritation.</li>
            <li>The sensation is surprising at first, but ultimately provides a cool, fresh-feeling shave.</li>
            <li>When using the razor the cooling effect was really strange, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li>The cooling works good and makes difference but not WOW as you expect .</li>
            <li>The aluminum cooling bar is not cold, just cool.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is rather large but easy to use.</li>
            <li>The shaver works great if you have already trimmed your beard down to a \\&quot;1\\&quot; or lower.</li>
            <li>gives me a nice clean shave same as my Series 7.</li>
            <li>The next shave starts out nice and clean just like it should.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action leaves the blades clean and provide a better shave.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase the cool tec shaver, as I was hoping it would be the \\&quot;magic bullet\\&quot; in my desire to get a clean, close shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li>I recently starting using the Braun Cool Tec electric shaver (as I recently received it through a program with Braun) and I have been pretty impressed with the overally shave and how close to the skin the razor gets.  </li>
            <li>Although you feel the cooling action of the aluminum bar, its still no replacement for a  good pre shave lotion like Lectric Shave or an actual shave gel or foam which I currently use with my ES-LA63 with great</li>
            <li>I was able to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>&quot; November is over, I was finally able to use my new Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li>Once I made the adjustment, I started to get better results from the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely my new favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with my new Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li>my new primary shaver and will be recommending it!</li>
            <li>Every generation of new Braun product keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only experienced very mild irritation once with this razor and that was probably my fault for pressing it too hard to my face the first time I used it as I didn&#x27;t know how easily and effectively it would cut the &amp;#34;little</li>
            <li>like the CoolTec cooling band, it seems to cool your face right away, feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great product and leaves your face less irritated, I would have not used it on my dome if it didn&#x27;t work so well on my face.</li>
            <li>This cooltec system has greatly reduced the amount of redness, and soreness over my previous electric.  </li>
            <li>: I really wish it would provide a closer shave, as I really do enjoy the cool tec technology on the shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaving system broke the mold and also left my face feeling cool after the shave which I really liked.</li>
            <li>razor was easy to setup, as the instructions explained the process reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>- i don&#x27;t shave daily and don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m perfectly clean shaven, but to give a fair review, this shaver didn&#x27;t give that closer of a shave.</li>
            <li>the shaver felt cool and light on my skin and it was really giving me a shave....</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is water proof and cleans easily</li>
            <li>travel charger worked pretty good, but the kit I received only had 1 power cable that had to be shared between the travel  charging sled and the cleaning/charging</li>
            <li>the Cooltec shaver  is beefy but quite ergonomic and easily to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li>This gets a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works as good as they say that it does in the ads.</li>
            <li>Setup was easy straight out of the box</li>
            <li>Battery life seems pretty good, I can go a week+ on one charge so on short trips all you need</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it at first, since we are all used to the notion of a &amp;#34;hot shave&amp;#34;, but I find it to be really soothing.</li>
            <li>That first shaver was awesome, it signified my transition to manhood, but it was ultimately a heaping pile of junk and soon replaced with a regular razor as it just did not give as close or as quick a shave.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to get as good coverage with this razor as I have been able to with other products (most recently a Philipps/Norelco Senso Touch).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a smooth, clean shave in areas that are easy to get to and have to make some adjustments in other areas.  </li>
            <li>On top of all that, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Other systems would clean, but not as good as the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li>tried it couple more times and it worked better with the hairs pretty short.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, what a generous thing for them to do!  </li>
            <li>was so excited when i first received Braun CoolTec razor System from</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job but is it worth the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor for the past 11 years and loved it!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to keep it because the cool feature felt really good, but the shave was just not close enough</li>
            <li>I was excited to see a razor that did not get really hot when you are using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first time using the shaver I was sold!  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the shaver was the price, almost $200 retail?!  </li>
            <li>cleaning station is amazing, really does make it like a new shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, great new technology -- I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw the new &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out this new shaver as I have been wanting to ditch the disposal</li>
            <li>always get very excited to try new technology, and because of a program run by Braun I was provided with a CoolTec electric shaver to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out this new</li>
            <li>recharging dock is really easy to use and the cleaning fluid guarantees a more thorough cleansing of your equipment.</li>
            <li>Charging, cleaning and most other maintenance is very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is great for what it is, but I would love to have something that can really cut some long hairs AND give me a smooth shave in one.</li>
            <li>This is an innovative product and has great potential, it just didn&#x27;t give me as clean a shave as other products have.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as a straight razor but for someone trying to avoid skin issues this is fine trade.</li>
            <li>Out of curiosity, I put it in the charger/cleaning system and let it clean before I shaved for my first time.</li>
            <li>The auto clean feature is pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is thoughtfully designed and the built-in cleaner / charger combo is a smart idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a high-tech well manufactured piece of equipment and is extremely comfortable to hold, use and shave with.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to use a nice electric razor for my shaving instead of always using shaving cream and a multiblade razor thinking that this will be quicker, more convenient and give me a nice close shave without slight razor burn or possible nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little strip of cooling surface feels great against my face, and it also seems to reduce the irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to anyone who wants a cool clean shave</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no irritation or redness, just a cool clean feeling that I really enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin was calm and not irritated</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the cooling feature is nice - really better than the gimmicky feature it sounds</li>
            <li>I got this electric shaver a few days ago through a program run by Braun and it works great.</li>
            <li>must say that I am very grateful that Braun gave me this razor to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Still, for a product that I got for free, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>This is the ideal &amp;#34;running late for work</li>
            <li>I plan on traveling with work soon and hope that I enjoy it on the road as much as I have at home.</li>
            <li>The shave is extremely smooth and very close, even without using a preshave lotion.</li>
            <li>I really like the performance of the shaver and the resulting smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well, and is accurate...</li>
            <li>It really does make a huge difference in skin irritation and razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CoolTec System is fantastic, I got to try this razor thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li>The travel case gives the razor a very snug fit, however, there is no room for the charging cradle, or the cord, as my 8000 series case does.  </li>
            <li>the indicator light went off and it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It provides a great shave for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the CoolTec is an intriguing option, it did nothing to help enhance my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.  </li>
            <li>I truly wanted to like this razor, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to any kind of razor blades again.</li>
            <li>I would not have purchased this razor on my own because of that (since there are cheaper models out there that likely work just as well).</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun shavers most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>and it is worth the price of the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the cooling strip is novel and pretty cool</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shave is still good-- just not AS good, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I would definitely buy it on my own.  </li>
            <li>I have travelled with the CoolTec and miss the fact that I don&#x27;t have a fresh razor in the morning.  </li>
            <li>For a razor, the Braun CoolTec is quite fun to play with, when you consider all of its features.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t necessary but it is nice.</li>
            <li>long time to get a true close shave - had to go over some areas 15-20 times just to try to get a smooth shave (mostly on the neckline&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>I do not feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But I prefer Norelco&#x27;s cleaning solution; it&#x27;s cheaper and seems to be more readily available locally.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cooltec is a pretty cool shaver, no pun</li>
            <li>the auto-cleaner device is pretty cool to use.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar did scare me as the possibility of a gimmick, but in reality it really is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>My first impressions of the Cool Bar was that it felt like a mini air conditioner for my face.</li>
            <li>correctly&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;not having success yet.</li>
            <li>It was securely packaged but didn‚Äôt require the jaws of life to open as many things</li>
            <li>stand that comes with the razor is pretty cool in the fact that it cleans to razor for you with alcohol at the push of a button and also charges the razor between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He had about a days worth of porcupine like growth.  </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint really has nothing to do with this awesome razor:</li>
            <li>also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.</li>
            <li>The skin at first does feel cool from the \\&quot;Cooltec</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand and will not slip even if wet.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec part of this razor is a feature that surprised me the most.</li>
            <li>I honestly will never go back to a blade!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work on some people&#x27;s faces, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That means you&#x27;ll need a second sculpting razor handy.  </li>
            <li>The shave i better thsan my old electric shavers</li>
            <li>Overall I would say this is a great razor geared for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For me, who at times has sensitive skin, it really was a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only downside was that the shave was not as close as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Personally, I won&#x27;t use the cleaning solution after every use but this is the only real downside to this wonderful razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had been about 2 weeks worth of growth.</li>
            <li>Not only is a nice feeling on your face as I think it cools the skin for an optimal</li>
            <li>Love the cooling feature, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun Cooltec as part of a promotion from Braun, and I have thus far highly enjoyed this experience.</li>
            <li>I like that it came with a two different charging stations -- one for cleaning/charging (also a nice feature) and the cradle for just charging.</li>
            <li>As far as the closeness of the shave, I still think my 5 blade manual razor does a better job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool, pun intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with a really nice case for it and smaller charging cradle.</li>
            <li>It was nice to have it simple.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Power plug when plugged into the main unit easily pulls out, even without moving the unit.  </li>
            <li>It also had a nice travel pouch to carry the shaver with me outside of the house.</li>
            <li>Also the item is very bulky, so be sure to have enough space in your bathroom counter top before you purchase it.</li>
            <li>So far though I&#x27;m enjoying the Cooltech.</li>
            <li>so that made it much better since my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First impression is that the thing is cool, cool as in really neat.</li>
            <li>This is my 3 one, and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels nice to shave.  </li>
            <li>Dual wide heads do a good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>cleaning system is a nice gimmick, but not necessary or worth the expense of having to buy replacement cartridges of solution.  </li>
            <li>so I start with my cheeks before moving to the more sensitive areas on the neck.</li>
            <li>During my first shave I noticed it didn&#x27;t cut as closely as I would have liked on the first or second pass over my skin but after working it around for awhile I got the desired result of a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Now, as for the cooling action... I thought it was a gimmick, but now I know better.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with skin irritation from razors the better part of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>But after 6 years, I thought it was worth it, and that is why I decided to go with Braun again.</li>
            <li>, so far I love the razor.</li>
            <li>That cool bar soothes my skin as I shave and keeps my face from getting hot and irritated.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>bought a nice Norelco but still fought with the irritation of a daily shave.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar is a nice touch, and does seem to improve the overall experience.  </li>
            <li>The hair trimmer on the back side of the shaver is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the CoolTec system if you looking for a nice hand help wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and cooling feature is really neat and different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth checking this out if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li>After years of rarely shaving, I decided to try The Braun CoolTec Shaving System.</li>
            <li>All in all though, as far as electric razors go, the Braun CoolTec is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of rarely shaving, I decided to try The Braun CoolTec Shaving System.</li>
            <li>All in all though, as far as electric razors go, the Braun CoolTec is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its so nice to have a charging system that cleans the razor at the same time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of an electric razor guy, but I was actually quite impressed this one.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this would have to be the aluminum cooling bar it helps my sensitive skin from getting razor burn &amp; irritation.</li>
            <li>I would rather not have the charging cradle, and would prefer to be able to plug the cord directly into my razor for charging and shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet for an electric razor too which is nice.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s around 5 bucks a month to keep the cleaning solution flowing, but for now, it&#x27;s worth every of those 500 pennies.)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, though, and overall, this product provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and for that it deserves praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may need to follow up with a pass of a traditional blade to ensure closeness, which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Either price point is WELL worth</li>
            <li>I believe the Packaging kit is worth it because it comes with extras that are actually useful .&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It DOES have a cool feeling when shaving... which was somewhat surreal.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>If it prevents my shaver from clogging up then it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>travel dock is a useful addition, allowing you to charge the shaver out of the cleaning dock.  </li>
            <li>and I found a nice spot under my sink to set the system until next time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used it dry with the cool mode on and it actually does a very good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if this is true as its one of my main issues with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning of this razor is easy, just slide off the blue sleeve remove the heads, shake over a can, and it&#x27;s clean!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the Cooltec shaver and will be continuing to use it as my new primary electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My current Braun doesn&#x27;t have a fancy cooling bar, but it does a great job with my morning shave, so I was interested to see how well the new Braun CoolTec system worked in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean the idea of being able to shave without using water and shaving cream sounds good.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s razor is very smooth and only requires a couple of passes for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive the cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System.  </li>
            <li>, one important note is that the cradle is very large and takes up a decent amount of counter space, couple that with the $5 cartridges it can get pricey quick.</li>
            <li>I love the no mess cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to say that this is an excellent product due to the drawbacks I&#x27;ve mentioned above but the unique cooling technology is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the shaver was also freshly cleaned was noticeable as well, it kept the blades very smooth and lubricated, unlike any electric shaver I had experienced previously, even when freshly cleaned with a third party lubricating agent.  </li>
            <li>So overall i would highly recommend it, and one of my favorite parts is how easy they made it to clean.</li>
            <li>I was quite interested in how the system would work when I first heard about it and was excited to start using it.  </li>
            <li>you drop it in, hit a button and walk away, next time you are ready for a shave, your razor is there waiting for you, nice and clean and all charged up.</li>
            <li>This is extremely important with guys with sensitive skin as the irritation is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I can enjoy a fast, smooth close shave in between my main shaves and it doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this out when I first received it.</li>
            <li>I tried this shaver for a week, and while the cooling part of the unit is a very interesting effect, the fact that the head does not pivot really limited my ability to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a a clean and charge station that not only recharges the razor in between uses but also cleans the blades and lubricates them to keep them in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>So seriously, this razor is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li>This unit is much quieter than the older unit I had and more compact.  </li>
            <li>I can attest that compared to many of Braun&#x27;s older shavers, this feature does work very well.</li>
            <li>In lieu of this, you can clean the shave under running water and invest in a bottle of Shaver Saver to get the same results but with more manual intervention.</li>
            <li>When I think electric razor I think quick and easy, but this was far from what happened.</li>
            <li>The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is flat out amazing.</li>
            <li>Other then that, its been a good shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver and the cleaning system were just as good as other braun models (i have also used the series 5).</li>
            <li>If Braun were to change just a couple other things about this shaver, it would have a superior product on its hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they always keep their products modernized and with this Cool Technology, they are taking a big leap in whats to come in the innovative and fresh world of shaving.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar in between the shaver blades does a good job cooling the skin to circumvent shaver burns and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li>My skin wasn‚Äôt irritated after shaving, and the cleaning system did a good job just like my other Braun system.</li>
            <li>CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is an upgrade compared to other electric shavers but for me it still is not as good as an &amp;#34;old fashion razor.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a niche product, its designed extremely well, built like a tank, and reliable like any good razor should be.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Just plug in (although the plug could have a longer cord; but I solved that by stretching the included one out for it to work), drop in the CoolTec and flip to the right</li>
            <li>This shaver just didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel right&#x27; to me</li>
            <li>the cooling bar was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>The Seven series can plug right into it&#x27;s cord.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs well made and has the right amount of ‚Äúheft.‚Äù  </li>
            <li>I also wish that the cord plugged right into the razor (allowing me to shave while it is plugged in) instead of plugging into the charging station.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box you will notice a difference with this system.</li>
            <li>This program came at the right time.</li>
            <li>Taking part in Movember, and have to keep the right trim</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the right razor for me</li>
            <li>However, the cooling tech does in fact do one thing right, and that is prevent/</li>
            <li>I also like the set-up / holder- which I put right on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>(it is a shaver, right?)</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t chafe right away</li>
            <li>and I could not feel it right away, but</li>
            <li>So although I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this for others of you it might be something that is right up your alley, I am just not a fan of electric razors and this did not sway me to start liking them.</li>
            <li>You need to practice to get it right</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>my Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The cooling function is defaulted to On so it started cooling right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>system not only does the job from a clean shave standpoint, but it also is a very unique experience.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s another positive: all the hair stays inside the head of the shaver!  </li>
            <li>This new razor allows me to freely shave my face and neck without having to worry about the red streaks of skin irritation from a warm razor surface.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, I will keep using it for quick touch ups on my face and head, but when I wantto look extra fly, there is nothing better than my plain ol&#x27; razor with shaving cream,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for several weeks now and it is still as amazing as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off it charges extremely fast and has a Led light display to make everything easier to see.</li>
            <li>But I will have to stick to a straight razor when I want a truly clean mug.</li>
            <li>It gives a clean shave, retains its charge well, and recharges fast when needed.</li>
            <li>After a month of no shaving during Movember, I was ready to clean up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I was more than willing to try the CoolTec and give my Series 7 a rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the shaver for about two full weeks, I am still satisfied with the overall use and results from the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It takes many passes to even get short hairs and it feels like the cool bar detracts from the shave quality by spacing out two of the foil elements.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much hair that going to build up under the blades, and it&#x27;s easy enough to remove the top of the trimmer and rinse it</li>
            <li>at first I&#x27;m taken aback by the different sensation, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>It really does clean well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From there the main razor did the rest, getting my face smooth with no effort.</li>
            <li>Having a separate charging dock that takes the exact same cord was nice and convenient.</li>
            <li>But every now and then I do have to go clean shaven, and I really dislike razors</li>
            <li>I just pop it in there to charge and it keeps it clean, ready to go and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun provides a close clean shave and does not make too much noise.  </li>
            <li>:clean system runs our to fast for cost&lt;br /&gt;3.Not</li>
            <li>It is also much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the latest innovation is the cool bar on the razor head.  </li>
            <li>To summarize, ok shave, but better than the average electric razor.  </li>
            <li>everything is clean, charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>The long hair trimmer works great, but it&#x27;s nothing innovative; other electric razors have this feature.  </li>
            <li>When i received this shaver from braun through a special program i wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>cleaning station is very large for a bathroom where there isn&#x27;t a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>Station very large.</li>
            <li>I had a light beard at the time of shaving, which should be easily taken care of by a razor such as this one.</li>
            <li>Finally, it&#x27;s still light and easy to hold despite the added gadgetry within, making shaving easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My previous shaver was Braun Activator which worked for me about 9 years and was the top at the time I bought it, I believe that this CT2CC is better shaver than Braun Activator .</li>
            <li>The cooling element really works and it would easy the transition from a real razor to electric.</li>
            <li>customer service - 5 stars - took care of my problem and made what I was sure was going to be a frustrating ordeal into a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning system and this version allows to you control how often it cleans so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of fluid quickly.  </li>
            <li>It ran great for two weeks on a single charge (YMMV), and it is completely sealed so you can use it in the shower,</li>
            <li>It really does stay cool.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast it became cool.</li>
            <li>Over the past couple of years, I have been looking for a great electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cool sensation when shaving, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a cleaning unit that looks really cool, but appears to be very impractical.  </li>
            <li>it kept sensitive areas from becoming irritated which I always have issues with when shaving.</li>
            <li>This system really does leave the skin feeling closely shaven and cool.  </li>
            <li>The cool tech feature really does cool the shaving area and really did seem to keep off any skin irritations.</li>
            <li>My whole thought process on buying shavers has changed forever after getting the Braun Cool Tec shaver through a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>top of the cooling comfort, the adaptable three stage cutting system with the Sensoblade provides and excellent, very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I get a close shave, the cool tec option really helps with getting the hair close and it sooths the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li>It really does cool your face a</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer that I have used that was useful, without giving me the nose-need-to-sneeze-tickle that all the others seem to do.  </li>
            <li>travel case that comes with the system is a great improvement over others in the past.  </li>
            <li>The cool bar in the shaver really helps.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the CoolTec was just going to be marketing filler, but it really did feel cool while shaving.</li>
            <li>It was worth trying, although I do not think I would have purchased if I had not had a chance to try it first.</li>
            <li>You really think about the cool sensation each time you shave.</li>
            <li>I will say I use a cartridge most of the time, because I have a heavy beard, and a cartridge has always been far superior in providing a close shave on my neck without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li>. Does not shave as closely as a straight razor, but that is true with all electric razors, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and frequently have razor burn, but with the cooling bar on the razor, i&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the design of the razor head with the cool strip, it doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave without a LOT of passes over your face.  </li>
            <li>After all it is known as a hot shave and not a cold one.</li>
            <li>Also, due to the coolig head that is ceramic it gives you a nice cool feeling while you are shaving</li>
            <li>I have owned Braun electric shavers in the past with mostly good results and was excited to try this one out as it was provided via a program by Braun.</li>
            <li>battery life is pretty good, in comparison with other wireless systems in the price range.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be easy to use right out of the box and feel like it will be a shaver that will last with me for a good long while.</li>
            <li>The design and feel of the razor is good and fits in your hands with ease which i think is very important when shaving due to the constant movements.</li>
            <li>I have had some sort of facial har for the last ten years, so I didn&#x27;t completely clean shave, but this razor is the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>I have had Braun shavers in the past and have loved the clean and renew system.  </li>
            <li>all I really need is a great shave and the CoolTec delivers.reen when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed right away was the cooling system on my face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different shavers and electric and other wise but hadn&#x27;t found one that wouldn&#x27;t cause me problems after using it, until I got my Braun CoolTec Shaving System free to try from Braun.</li>
            <li>My previous experiences haven&#x27;t been good.  </li>
            <li>I really would like the razor to be warm as to open and relax my hair</li>
            <li>The refills for the cleaning feature come three to a pack and are easy to switch out with the old cartridge.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensetive and the cool technology really works!</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, simple to use, and the zipper case, makes traveling easier as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because its cordless, so you can use it in the shower, it&#x27;s rechargeable, so you don&#x27;t need batteries and the best part is the self cleaning base.  </li>
            <li>I previously used a Panasonic electric razor that worked fairly well, but I have needed to replace the blade too often in order to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a nice long charge, I had my first shave.</li>
            <li>After only a few uses, I have to say that this might be the best electric razor I have every used.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the machine, I dint use the cool tech to see how much of the difference was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a traditional shaving cream, and straight razor kind of guy.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec system through a program offer by Braun and was presently surprised on how easily it was to set up and use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried this, but the instructions are clear and should be easily</li>
            <li>The cooling bar is great, but regular charging (every 2-3 shaves) is necessary for it to work.</li>
            <li>If I shave every day, it does the job nicely because it keeps hair growth to a minimum, but if you like to skip a few days at a time between shaves, it can take a while to get that smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a great shaver as far as electric shavers are concerned but as you would expect, it will not give you the close shave that you get from a wet shave.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to the feeling and preferred it to my straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Overall if you love electric razors this will be worth</li>
            <li>Although the cooling bar felt awesome and it is probably one of the closest shaves ive had with an electric razor, it did leave me with some irritation a few hours later.  </li>
            <li>I have had several different shavers over the years and none seemed to do great.</li>
            <li>so while you are sitting there, annoyed with the amount of time it&#x27;s taking to trim your &#x27;stache, you&#x27;re also dealing with the added frustration of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, despite from the trimmer being inadequate for my needs, the CoolTec seems to be a great razor that delivers a comfortable and close shave even to the standards of someone as picky as myself.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the cooling bar, at first it made me jump a little but got used to it pretty quick and after time, it felt really good and helped to keep irritation at bay.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to any of my friends who enjoy a good, clean shave; especially those with sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li>you want a clean-shaven look, and as long as you shave every day (every other day at the most), you&#x27;ll be okay with this razor and may even love it.</li>
            <li>I have read reviews that stats that the station is not as high of quality as the series 7 Braun clean and charge station.</li>
            <li>The cooling action start pretty quick after pressing the cooling button and leaves the skin feeling clean close shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The cooling action start pretty quick after pressing the cooling button and leaves the skin feeling clean close shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Its only redeeming quality is it&#x27;s barely functional trimmer (you can buy better ones for cheaper).  </li>
            <li>The cool sensation it provides was my favorite part, especially when waking up and getting ready to go in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The cool bar does feel good, but the shaver simply did not cut my hair, so I needed to go over my face countless times to get a half-decent shave.  </li>
            <li>After trimming the longer hair with the handy long hair trimmer, I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shaver went across my face.</li>
            <li>Men that have a goatee or a mustache will be just fine, but if you are doing anything around your jawline, you will experience much frustration in trying to use the main head of this</li>
            <li>Men that have a goatee or a mustache will be just fine, but if you are doing anything around your jawline, you will experience much frustration in trying to use the main head of this</li>
            <li>Once I had it all set up; however, it was pretty clear and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I loved my previous Braun shaver but one of my biggest complaints was how hot it would get; and how my face would burn when finished shaving.</li>
            <li>I was more than excited to try it out as I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past and had been looking for a new model that would be a good option for my sensitive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  </li>
            <li>Razor charges very fast.</li>
            <li>I was very much anti electric before trying this razor.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>CoolTec shaver is very much a specialty razor.</li>
            <li>, I think it would be a great match, but as it is, I will probably go back to using my 7-series most of the time and save this one for maybe vacations when I don&#x27;t want to bring my more expensive shaver on the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the pop-up trimmer very much yet, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the pop-up trimmer very much yet, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Some places such as my chin feel very smooth shaving, however places on the sides of my neck don‚Äôt do as well in the smoothness department.</li>
            <li>It actually helps make the shave feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li>As I stated before, the cooling feature was neat, but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me other than feel good in and of</li>
            <li>The cooling bar is a nice and unique feature, you basically activate it while shaving and the little bar in between the blades will give your skin a nice cool little blast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of use I still stand by my original review in that it is a nice close shave and the cooltec feature is an added benefit.</li>
            <li>Use in the shower - as I typically shave in the shower, it was great to have a new razor that also works in the shower -</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out the new shaver.</li>
            <li>As a new user to electric shavers, I was excited to learn that I was chosen to participate in a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 15 year user of a Norelco circular blade shavor, and I was excited to be a part of a program that allowed me to try out something new.  </li>
            <li>, I was so excited to try something to new.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer of the \\&quot;3 floating heads \\&quot; for years easy to use but always got the red blotches on my neck.</li>
            <li>Despite my negative comments it does a good clean shave for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It is what I&#x27;d call a middle of the line electric that does a decent job with a nice feature to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; your face while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very fast when I first started using a manual razor, so</li>
            <li>I have never been able find a shaver that has done a great job QUICKLY without irritation for those days that I‚Äôm running late and need to go out the door or when I‚Äôve got dry</li>
            <li>It did a good job with making your face look clean shaven, but a swipe of the hand told me it was just short enough not to really see</li>
            <li>If that is the case that&#x27;s a huge disadvantage, as I do travel fairly frequently for a week at a time</li>
            <li>The idea of it was pretty \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, however after using for a week</li>
            <li>I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 standard razor and this is way better.</li>
            <li>It actually seemed to work better on my head than it did on my face.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the cooling feature, where an aluminum cooling bar is chilled to reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>I also managed to get a pretty close shave as well.</li>
            <li>I used to use electric razors almost exclusively then switched back to manual ones (since I do most of my shaving the shower).</li>
            <li>I first got my razor</li>
            <li>I have never once felt the razor get hot</li>
            <li>It is more of a daily maintenance shaver.  </li>
            <li>It has two foils which help catch whatever you miss on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I first got this razor, I told my brother (who is an electric guy through and through)</li>
            <li>so this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>At first touch I had my reservations when the Braun CoolTec razor was provided to me through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>After all, this was the first shaver that I had with the cooling technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small charging station is also great and it was ready within an hour of opening the package.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about it I thought &amp;</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s exactly the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for a couple of days now and overall am pleased with the way it performs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that my face was hot and the feeling of an electric shaver was better than trying not to cut my face with traditional razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And can be rinsed under a stream of hot water.  </li>
            <li>but I thoroughly enjoy the cooling affect of the shaver during shaving and will definitely enjoy using this one for a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li>When I first tried this razor</li>
            <li>When I tried it the first time the cooling bar worked well</li>
            <li>For myself and my beard, it will most likely end up under the sink like the rest of them.</li>
            <li>First off, I need to mention I was provided this electric CoolTec shaver as part of a program run by Braun</li>
            <li>how many times I went back and forth over them&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really love the idea of electric shavers but have NEVER found one that actually gives me a quality shave.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty darn</li>
            <li>price component is a big differentiation for many, with almost a $100 difference between the two razors</li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me</li>
            <li>my knowledge, Braun was the first to innovate this gimmick.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I haven&#x27;t had to give it a once over with the disposable razor.</li>
            <li>After getting the Braun cooltec razor from a program by Braun, I tried it for the first time</li>
            <li>&#x27;s get started with first impression.</li>
            <li>When I opened up the box the first thing I noticed about the razor was its heft.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar feels exactly like that ...</li>
            <li>the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I wish this wasn&#x27;t going to be my first.</li>
            <li>I was able to repeat each area of my face multiple times and didn&#x27;t experience any shave bumps at all.</li>
            <li>and most recently the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first impression of the CoolTec was the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed the build quality of the CoolTec.  </li>
            <li>First off I would like to say that I am just using my girlfriends account with amazon because I don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cooling technology works pretty well also, during the first couple of minutes of a shave you don&#x27;t notice it as well</li>
            <li>but this was pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was how well the cooling element works.</li>
            <li>Finally, not only is the shaver waterproof, but it is even designed to be safe to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and you know exactly where to place your pointer finger and thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The last Braun electric shaver I used was an ultra inexpensive razor I purchased at the PX Store at Fort Lee (Army) more than 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was exactly like taking a soda can out of the refrigerator and putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li>She thinks my facial hair is better groomed with the cooltec by Braun.</li>
            <li>Each shaver has Braun Optifoil screen which is essential a set of oblong shapes on the foil to catch more hairs.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the smooth shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li>but then becomes hot after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li>The first day I tried it, I had 3 days growth, and I gave the shaver a work out.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it has been the easiest to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>Second, the cleaning system and extra charging station are perfect, especially if you are the person that shaves in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Next, Ive never been one to be on top of cleaning my shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have always shaved a &amp;#34;dry run,&amp;#34; and my skin reacts to additional products such as the lotions and gels that can be used with many electric razors.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES it!  </li>
            <li>It does pretty well on my face and chin area</li>
            <li>First of all, I have never thought about shaving with the razor being &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, and I was interested in how this was going to work.  </li>
            <li>I was also interested in seeing how the cleaning/charging system would work.  </li>
            <li>It also was great to have a long hair trimmer attached to the back, which allowed me to trim up my mustache.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on first thing when I woke up, and it worked like a beauty.</li>
            <li>My first thoughts after receiving this shaver was all of the items that was included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To test the trimmer (and to make sure it was actually getting power), I touched it to a piece of cardboard.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the cleaning station</li>
            <li>have really enjoyed using this razor, and may not go back to shaving exclusively with a DE Safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Then pop the top back on</li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me</li>
            <li>After the first time using the shaver I realized that this was the case.  </li>
            <li>my first shave I was taken aback.  </li>
            <li>and I actually used the shaver more often with</li>
            <li>Plus, I love occasionally skipping shaving with the strait</li>
            <li>I shave every day and while I like the closest shave I can get from a manual razor I am willing to sacrifice some closeness for a still-great shave while avoiding irritation and speeding up the process.</li>
            <li>The cooling technology really works!  </li>
            <li>Not only did this take more time, it increased skim irritation.  </li>
            <li>I think its more meant to get you to use cleaner regularly so you will buy replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Determined to keep an optimistic outlook I decided to use it several more times.</li>
            <li>First off, the packaging seems a bit intimidating, however after putting it together, I was shaving in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec shaver almost seemed too gimicky when I first heard of it.  </li>
            <li>my first shave after the month of MoVember.</li>
            <li>first thing you will immediately notice- as I did- is the cooling bar.</li>
            <li>It feels over-engineered to deliver benefits that more simple shavers can deliver, but, hey, if you want to of the line this is your product.</li>
            <li>I must first say I was trying this shaver as part of a program for Braun.</li>
            <li>but the shave is still very close and worth it.</li>
            <li>but i had to use my razor at the end of the shave to make sure i covered those missed parts and the region above my Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I wish was somewhat better.</li>
            <li>: The solid build, fast and close overall shave and ease of cleaning make it a great product.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this is a series 5 shaver as noted on the box.  </li>
            <li>did ok by my chin and upper lip area  </li>
            <li>After my first time using this razor I can say that it actually does make shaving feel much more</li>
            <li>It definitely made shaving feel more</li>
            <li>As with most electric shavers, you&#x27;re never going to get as close a shave as you would with a traditional blade, but this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>First things first, I&#x27;m not a fan of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Upon the first use, however, I realized my fears were not founded at all.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty and gadgety.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Overall im pleased with the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one button on the top to start the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was in a rush.  </li>
            <li>Most do not get nearly close enough to give me that smooth feeling and almost all irritate my face.</li>
            <li>I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver free directly from Braun to test out and review.  </li>
            <li>First, is the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>like I wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li>so I had a pretty dense forest of hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>/week I would suggest going over it with some clippers first.  </li>
            <li>Braun wins and the pricing from Amazon made it a real deal.</li>
            <li>felt like one needed a degree in aeronautical engineering to operate this when I first opened it up.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work to well (numerous days).  </li>
            <li>my first if I had the time).  </li>
            <li>Again, much better than the tiny slide-out trimmer on the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have heard others complain about the cost of refills, but each refill is only about $5-$6 and lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li>Again, much better than the tiny slide-out trimmer on the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have heard others complain about the cost of refills, but each refill is only about $5-$6 and lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li>the back and forth method of shaving leave many areas with hair still on the face, and the adam apple is a nightmare, either you rush and pinch</li>
            <li>first impression was that there were a lot of pieces.</li>
            <li>Most very big and bulky.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a way to only run the razor over my skin once.</li>
            <li>Would I be willing to switch and give up my disposable?</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li>Essentially it is like most electric shavers -- a convenience item.</li>
            <li>I have to remember to do it well before bed time, because my wife can hear it even through the closed bathroom door, and if the door is open the bright flashing light bothers her too, so it needs to be done before we go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to comment more than my initial impression here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look forward to using it over the coming weeks and giving a more in-depth review of actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, 45 days later:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so much better than the manual razor alone.  </li>
            <li>The first time, I used it</li>
            <li>After using my shaver I made sure to check every inch of my skin to see if there was any red blotching, there was none.</li>
            <li>(I use a cartridge razor about 70% of the time - shaving daily), and have always been pleased with that product.  </li>
            <li>I recently received the Braun CoolTec System through a program run by Braun and I love it.  </li>
            <li>First of all I received this shaver via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>First thing&#x27;s first.  </li>
            <li>first reaction was how substantial the shaver was.</li>
            <li>This is the only electric razor that I have been able to use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors and all have left my face burning</li>
            <li>overall I just can&#x27;t say I feel in love with</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to go over the same area more than once for a close shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shave quality became better for me.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I can say is that the CoolTec technology does in fact work.  </li>
            <li>It messed with my mind for the first week.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that Braun is satisfied with the results of the CoolTec and decide to incorporate it into their entire razor line.  </li>
            <li>Thought the cooling thing was a gimmick, but for my beard it really helps!</li>
            <li>The shaver does well on the cheeks/jaw and chin, and does an okay job on the upper lip area (provided you use a blade to get the hairs just under your nose).</li>
            <li>First Shave:&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I received my Braun CoolTec Shaver System  and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first about the Cooltec technology</li>
            <li>This was also the first electric shaver I tried with the automatic cleaning.</li>
            <li>Solid product and glad I&#x27;m shaving with it.</li>
            <li>There were also no lights on to indicate what exactly was supposed to be happening.</li>
            <li>A great time saver when you&#x27;re running late.  </li>
            <li>I consistently had missed spots that no matter which way I moved the shaver, I could not get.  </li>
            <li>However I was willing to try and it and see.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the cooling feature actually works.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised though to find that not only does it offer an incredible shave but the cooling actually reduces irritation and at appears to create smoother skin.</li>
            <li>It feels heavy (in a good way) in your hand.</li>
            <li>for everyday up keep its good</li>
            <li>cleaning /charging base did an excellent job of cleaning, far superior to rinsing with water alone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good at everyday shaves.</li>
            <li>It felt as though i was putting in little to no effort for a nice quick and painless even shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans easily, by popping the top off and running a little bit of water on the heads.  </li>
            <li>but once you&#x27;re used to it feels very good, especially because it helped my skin feel less irritated after shaving, which has always been an issue for me with electric shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a simple way to clean the top, by running water on it, a deeper clean by simply pulling off the top and cleaning inside, or the third which is the easiest.</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend Kiehl&#x27;s shave lotion as it does a tremendous job coupled with the Panasonic</li>
            <li>I noticed that the power plug for the charging/cleaning pod did was not a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>The actual shave to was super close and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had somewhat sensitive skin that can get easily irritated by both electric shavers and straight razors.  </li>
            <li>My face is super smooth after a shave and stays that way for almost an entire day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky enough to have been selected to try out the CoolTec System for free via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar has not only made it possible to use an electric razor but has made it a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unique feature of the cold bar in between the two foils was somewhat interesting, but fairly lackluster.</li>
            <li>I just got this really cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System through a Braun program to try out</li>
            <li>The razor does an pretty good job in producing a close shave, but the biggest plus is the ice cool feeling from the center of the razor that seems to cool the face and stop the red irritation that normally occurs.</li>
            <li>I felt my face in both directions after completing my shave and it was a very similar result as I get from using a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Charge Station:&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge Station that is included with the Braun CoolTec System was a very nice addition as it can get very old having to clean out all the little areas that fill with hair in an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>first I was excited as this was my first foray into the electric shaving department, that excitement quickly turned to frustration, although not entirely the CoolTec products</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great shaver, especially if irritation is high on your priorities.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how cool the shaver got.  </li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin and the cool factor</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clean very shortly and gets a full</li>
            <li>Add the cool bar while you have to ease the redness in your face while you shave and you can definitely have a clean shave to remember.</li>
            <li>* Easy, quick to shave as long as you don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t because I am one of those that like to keep my things very clean, especially are razor that I rub all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, cooling feature is very nice, charge lasts a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Features that are not as good about the razor: when hair is long it pulls on the hair, my hair is thick and it pulled slightly even when short, did not do well shaving the neck</li>
            <li>Yet, it takes far more passes around my face to get the same shave as with Cool Tec.</li>
            <li>other nice aspect of Braun is the self cleaner.</li>
            <li>charger bases(two, one for travel, the other with the cleansing solution) was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>Seeing as how it already requires multiple passes to get a good shave, I don&#x27;t see this being my first choice on a regular basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt that the cooling has any use other than sounding like a nice addition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers in the past, and honestly I&#x27;ve never been impressed with any of them.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so I was excited for the CoolTec experience.</li>
            <li>The mini trimmer included in the other side of the shaver was a really nice &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Every time I used the shaver my skin was left irritation free and it gave me a more comfortable shave than other shavers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>New foils might make this shaver marginally better, but I have no desire to waste any more money on this product.  </li>
            <li>The side burn trimmer is also of the small and not very powerful variety which I see often in newer razors, however, my older Braun model has a great powerful one, would love to see that incorporated here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving was super fast and smooth and left my face feeling smoother than it has ever felt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is still good at not irritating my skin and have even used it on my head a few times.  </li>
            <li>In the end it just doesn&#x27;t give a good enough cut to be a daily</li>
            <li>The cold was good against razor burn, but I always thought warm was the way to go when it comes to getting the closest shave.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature is nice especially with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i have been able to shave fast and properly with the hassle of going over and over my face.</li>
            <li>got maintaining short facial hair but not so good on longer hair.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be more frugal with how much cleaning fluid it uses since I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cartridge</li>
            <li>I had to use the manual to help decipher what certain pieces provided were for (keep in mind this is my first shaving system).</li>
            <li>First, there is a large gap between the two foil cutters where the cooling element is located.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really add to the experience, other than feeling nice when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li>mean, a great company wants me to try their product</li>
            <li>I can definitely say that looking hot has never felt so cool!</li>
            <li>It cut right through all my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling.</li>
            <li>I had, based on conventional wisdom, always believed that a warm razor gives a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It took multiple passes to get some areas smooth, and with some areas that are more problematic with other shavers, this one too had issues getting those clean.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the Braun Cool Tec shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>, it was a bit loud but pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>entire package was very cool, though.</li>
            <li>it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and</li>
            <li>it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and</li>
            <li>I like having a close shave last for a day plus, but do love that I have experienced less irritation than with the multi-blade traditional razor.</li>
            <li>(though to be fair, it&#x27;s a little older model.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of Norelco shavers and was pleased to receive this shaving system to review.</li>
            <li>I had heard a long time ago that not everybodies faces work well with electric razors and that some faces after time get adapted and the shave gets better.</li>
            <li>and I could really tell how hot my face got during shaving.</li>
            <li>However, the many pieces and lack of instructions took way too long to decipher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much done it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After unpacking the box and setting the system up, I was ready to shave for the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving: This is obviously the most important aspect of a shaver, and this is where the results are a bit mixed.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a shave as close as those other shavers, but the comfort of the Braun CoolTec surpasses them, since the cooling bar actually works and doesn&#x27;t let the shaver irritate my skin from heat generated by the blades...</li>
            <li>This was my first real electric shaver</li>
            <li>first, I didn&#x27;t really notice the CoolTech feature.</li>
            <li>The Cooltec is still pretty neat, and I appreciate the chill as I scrape the lightening fast razors across my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the minor annoyance with the travel charging, I am extremely pleased with this shaving system.</li>
            <li>I tried my dad&#x27;s electric shaver when I first started shaving and it irritated the heck out of my face and didn&#x27;t really shave all that</li>
            <li>So, I decided to look into a more long term solution and when the opportunity came up to try the Braun CoolTec System through a program rub by Braun, I took a chance and said goodbye to my manual shaver.  </li>
            <li>Although all of those things was great about the shaver, the product fell short on some other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had avoided electrics in the past because I could never get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Yet somehow, this Cool Tec directly on my face glided across my skin with ease.</li>
            <li>Having the nice cool metal on your skin really soothes the skin and makes irritation a thing of the past, I can&#x27;t believe no one has thought of this concept before, thank you Braun for stepping it up a notch when it comes to electric shaving.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how cool the CoolTec got</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - Overall, I&#x27;m glad I was able to get a new shaver even if it isn&#x27;t a complete replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li>, Third, it is a clean shave every time because of the cleaning system that keeps it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor in the back is really handy as well for keeping your side burns clean, and my girlfriend even uses it to clean up the back of my head hair line which makes my hair cut last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I felt it left my face feeling fresh and clean after.</li>
            <li>It may take a few more passes on my face, but I never have to stop and clean it off.</li>
            <li>a quick update - Amazon resolved the return process quickly and simply.</li>
            <li>Battery life is a non-issue; you&#x27;ll have more than enough juice to get you through even a lengthy shave (which is one of this razor&#x27;s main downsides...more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with any new electric razor the first couple of shaves will not be ideal and can be irritating.  </li>
            <li>I slowly worked the shaver all over the right side and incredibly it was picking up those beard hairs of mine that grow in various directions with ease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys that like electric shavers but even with Braun the shaver head gets warm and sometimes a little hot and causes some skin redness and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>The small trimmer on the back of the unit is also a great feature, it helps when I need a quick trim.</li>
            <li>Before you shave there is a little cooling button you press and in a matter of seconds you can feel the cool and refreshing experience as you shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver is also washable (though not a wet shaver), so you can get it clean pretty easily and only use the cleaning system once in a while</li>
            <li>Before I received this product I really did not feel that the CoolTec technology would really effect the feel of shaving very much.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar only takes a few seconds to cool and feel pretty good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a cool, ergonomic shaver that rivals any rotary on the market!</li>
            <li>I experienced the same sensation after other uses of this shaver as well, and that is something I really like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which was useful when shaving new curves.</li>
            <li>First off it is huge and takes up a big space on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a shave thats as close as what I&#x27;d get if I used my typical Mach 3 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the plug to the outlet easily falls out of the charger.</li>
            <li>but the easy to use trimmer attachment picked up the stubborn hair; and also the cooking element could be bigger.</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning system that comes with it, one of the things a hate is having to clean my shaver and it does a great job with that.</li>
            <li>I figured they have made great products in the past, so what else could they do for my sensitive hair growing face?  </li>
            <li>When the razor arrived, I quickly opened the package, set it up, and waited for the charging to be complete.</li>
            <li>Its located on the back of the unit and is angled upwards, meaning that if its against your wall or mirror, its easy to bump causing the power cord to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference</li>
            <li>It also gave me a pretty close shave and left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For reference, my two previous electric razors were Norelco rotary type razors, which did a nice job.  </li>
            <li>first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, so I can&#x27;t say that I did a good job of stress testing the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I will be using this razor more then straight blade because I belie that it will be cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li>It honestly sounded gimmicky to me at first, but after using it, I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d make more sense to me if you could just plug the charger cable straight into the shaver, but as long as I don&#x27;t have to take the cleaning station on holiday with me</li>
            <li>I liked the cool soothing sensation and received a very close shave without irratation, even in the hard to shave neck area.</li>
            <li>Certainly saves some time.</li>
            <li>Certainly that&#x27;s a feature that you&#x27;re looking for in an electric shaver and this shaver has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That might be a bit picky, but would certainly be helpful as well in</li>
            <li>but it does certainly stand out.</li>
            <li>The system is too bulky, from a large and uncomfortable-to-hold shaver to a space-hogging cleaning and charging station.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For starters, let me just tell you that when it comes to shaving I have tried nearly every type of razor to ever be conceived, and very few have ever passed the test of a great shave.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec razor definitely surprised me by providing a very consistent and close shave on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>decided to give the Braun Cooltec an honest chance, first using it to do some touch-up work after shaving with my regular razor, then progressed to using it to touch up my face and neck after work before heading to events/functions, finally working up feeling like I could trust it to shave my face and neck</li>
            <li>The aluminum cooling bar was nice, but was not shockingly cool.</li>
            <li>This shaver was OK on the easy parts of my face but absolutely could not get the hard hairs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive of the Cooltec over a traditional razor is how close it gets and how smooth it leaves your skin.</li>
            <li>It originally felt like the razor was wet and water was dripping on my face keeping it cool.</li>
            <li>The Cooltec does help with the irritation, more so than my other electric razors when I first started using them.  </li>
            <li>It does decent work,but can&#x27;t exactly seem to get the neck beard cut that close.</li>
            <li>After using this razor the first time I had 2 main issues.</li>
            <li>had expected that in comparison to a manual razor, the electric razor would be allow me to complete my shave more quickly because no shaving creams were required and the cooling bar allowed for effortless gliding across my skin.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the shavers feel is much like the Philips/Norelco shavers which I don&#x27;t prefer because of the large head area that touches my face.  </li>
            <li>The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Series 7 and Gillette razors, comfort is night and day for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While the cool technology is a nice gimick, it isn&#x27;t enough to make up for some of the other drawbacks of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I think the Braun CoolTec is a nice feel with the cooling but takes a little longer to get the job done because the Series 7 has a faster motor than the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I am a five blade razor kind of guy, so I was a little apprehensive to try a shaver like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, the razor came with a nice little soft-covered hardshell case for travel.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation was nice since I always feel a little ‚Äúswollen‚Äù and beat up after shaving, this helped mitigate that.</li>
            <li>If you have a tough beard and like a great close shave, then give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>After finishing my first shave, it was time to put the razor back on the charger and give it a clean.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it is a good replacement for my older Braun 7</li>
            <li>The cleaning does a great job, only drawback is that it is a little noisy, but I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be, I ended up using a traditional razor for fine trimming around my sideburns because this product just wasn&#x27;t accurate enough for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, I&#x27;m new to electric razors, so I cannot state whether my difficulty is due to my own inexperience or the design of the razor.  </li>
            <li>far as the non-goatee areas this razor left my skin with an incredibly close shave, with little effort.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the cooling sensation but sometimes I feel that it be a little too cool for just getting out of a hot shower.</li>
            <li>The hard case is a great addition for some who travels frequently like myself.</li>
            <li>It cools the blade system to allow for a cool refreshing shave and little to no irritation afterward - definitely a sweet addition to regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Later that week, I used my Norelco and realized there was a huge difference between this one and the Braun and how much the cooltec part was working.</li>
            <li>The cold feeling it provides against my face is one of a kind amazing.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend this to a traditional razor user who wants to be free of the soaps and aftershave and the ability to shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would also recommend this to a traditional razor user who wants to be free of the soaps and aftershave and the ability to shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning a breeze and overall allows the whole experience to be worry free.</li>
            <li>I had not used an electric shaver for many years, so perhaps I expected too much.</li>
            <li>It is a nice razor but like most electric razors I have used its difficult to get my neck</li>
            <li>I turned on the cooling action, and was very pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li>First off let me say I normally use a straight razor and have never used any electric razor that shaves as close.  </li>
            <li>It would touch the spot because of the contour of my head and the extending trimmer didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li>and I must say it is really a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Everywhere else, it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>I thought the cooling bar would be a gimmick, but it really has worked at keeping my face from getting irritated.</li>
            <li>Cleaning refills are reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>It has a very close shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product has really changed my mind about electric razors.</li>
            <li>Thanks again bzzagent and way to go Braun for creating a fa-nominal product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - takes up a lot of counter space with the cleaning station and accessories, cleaning process is really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could that be why it&#x27;s not shaving close or really at all?</li>
            <li>me, it will be appreciated and NOT returned or re-gifted!&lt;br /&gt;Braun has outdone itself with this shaving system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the CoolTec, I really have to shave every day as if I wait a day or two inbetween, the shaver has some difficulty getting a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>And it really works.</li>
            <li>The charging station was better than expected and everything about this product screams &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like - I just don&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>so I was very eager to try this unit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work which is</li>
            <li>but it really made no difference.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t know how long the blades last, but so far its working as good as its first shave.  </li>
            <li>Deliver fast.</li>
            <li>Really different.&lt;br</li>
            <li>starters, the shave was really close.</li>
            <li>And really, isn&#x27;t that what we all want anyways - the close shave?</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re quickly ready to start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really had to push the shaver into my skin.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the cooling bar really helped.  </li>
            <li>I really like it because of the convenience and you will too.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, no irritation.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to the case is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the charger if you needed to take it.</li>
            <li>The charger makes the razor cumbersome for a traveler, but convenient for keeping it ready to shave.  </li>
            <li>, it really is a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>I found the razor works a hare better if you wet your skin.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t much of a factor for me.</li>
            <li>It also cools much quicker than they note in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I found myself stretching skin like you would shaving with a straight blade.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver to everyone!</li>
            <li>I get a foil shaver that gives me a very close shave, without the razor burn/skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cooling bar that it has and</li>
            <li>but then it really starts to kick in.</li>
            <li>It was a comfortable feeling, and smoothing to the face at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it is much wider than the series 5.</li>
            <li>, the shave itself was very close and effortless.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it does, very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun for sending this to me to review and evaluate.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>is really well designed and sleek.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, I really did.  </li>
            <li>I am a shaving snob ‚Äì having used straight razors, electric shavers, and every three, four, five, twelve bladed razor out there.</li>
            <li>When I received Braun‚Äôs CoolTec electric shaver, I really didn&#x27;t know much about it.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very jealous that there is a razor system out there that does what this does, but she says it looks a bit too manly for her to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will find it very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Provides a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>And I really like that it has a rubberized texture to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>The real surprise was that it did in fact reduce skin irritation.</li>
            <li>and I really do like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, since I&#x27;ve been trying this razor out, I have had continual issues with getting a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a better than expected experience and the CoolTec feature delivers.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTech traps all shavings in the head until you&#x27;re ready to dump them.  </li>
            <li>The shaver really does deliver all it says it will.  </li>
            <li>in all, I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>it really keeps my face from getting irritated.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cleaning station that comes with</li>
            <li>much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Philips Norelco would sometimes take a whole day to charge fully, whereas the CoolTec seems to charge in a matter of a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If I cleaned it every time the light came on, I would go through a cartridge that is supposed to last a couple of months in just a week or two.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This really does prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cooling technology really does make a difference both in the act of shaving and in the aftermath.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The system is very well put together.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>Everything was very intuitive for set up and use.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is also self cleaning which makes cleaning an absolute breeze.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know, but I do know I like it.  </li>
            <li>This is one electric shaver I would recommend to anyone who wants an electric Shaver that delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li>I will also go on to say that this shaver compares very well to the one I had revieved as a gift in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaner does however seem to run out much faster than it seems it would.</li>
            <li>I also really like about this</li>
            <li>I got to try the CoolTec system thanks to a program by Braun.  </li>
            <li>Even then, it wasn&#x27;t as close as a shave as I&#x27;m used to with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>If you need to shave daily, or like completely smooth skin, then you may wish to pass on this.</li>
            <li>but this absolutely gives it a run for</li>
            <li>This problem was not so noticeable on subsequent shaves when my beard-growth was not as advanced.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t looked into replacement cleaning cartridges, so I can&#x27;t speak to how much those are.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend actually commented on how smooth my shave was.  </li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>Braun could improve the cutting performance of the CoolTec razor, this would be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  </li>
            <li>CoolTec system itself works very well, and feels very cooling and soothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The shaving experience went fairly smooth, and the cooling element actually helps not feeling the &#x27;plucking&#x27;</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s just that the shave isn&#x27;t really that close.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clean&amp;Charge station, even after shaving just once, to get a feel for how it works.</li>
            <li>The Cooltech feature is a great idea and helps with razor burn, but does not outweigh the poor performance of the razor.</li>
            <li>Since it is a much heavier weight, I assume that was the cause.  </li>
            <li>It shaved all of my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling...</li>
            <li>Positives:  the cooling bar really works and</li>
            <li>the razor gives a reasonably close shave    </li>
            <li>After using it for a while I really like it.</li>
            <li>I got a very close shave in fewer strokes and fewer in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The Razor does tend to pull the longer hairs out, but no worse than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>this a real F-you to not  disclose that when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, went through help to find a chat window and customer service rep made everything ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really quantify that, but it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this shaver and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>my skin wasn&#x27;t really irritated.  </li>
            <li>(I like my face baby smooth after a shave, like slick, straight razor hot towel kinda smooth).  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34; aspect of this brand isn&#x27;t a gimmick; it really works.</li>
            <li>I got a really close, fast shave</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash on another high-end shaver after investing in the Norelco but the CoolTec was just calling to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, let me say that I&#x27;ve stuck to disposable razors over the years because every experience I&#x27;ve had with electric razors have really burned.</li>
            <li>completed, I was ready to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The razor leaves my face very well shaved.</li>
            <li>I have always been a shave in the shower using a standard over the counter cheap razor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the cleaning/charging station!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready Monday morning for the week.</li>
            <li>Even though it eats up the battery much faster, I can&#x27;t imagine that I will ever turn it</li>
            <li>Straight out of the package</li>
            <li>It was all charged so I was ready to go.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>and  I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive razor for its performance</li>
            <li>It made a very noticeable difference during my shave</li>
            <li>At any rate, the shave is still very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so bulky that it doesn&#x27;t shave the contours of your face and neck, and even where it does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I was finished, I did have a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>yes that really does</li>
            <li>It made the time spent shaving as enjoyable as I think it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the shaver and found it to not work very well.</li>
            <li>The cooling apparatus in the shaver does, however work very well.</li>
            <li>After using it once, I realized that this shaver is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My face felt much cooler and did not sting, compared to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>I am ready to ditch the cream and blades that I&#x27;ve had to deal with.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar stopped razor burn very well (5stars).  </li>
            <li>but for me, a guy who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, the drawbacks aren&#x27;t really worth the benefit of this razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a very soothing sensation and really did eliminate razor burn and the need for aftershave lotion, for me, anyway.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how much I paid for my 8595, or when,</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>It feels solid and sturdy, and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I wish that the shaver head itself was a bit narrower (too much of a gap between the screens, but the cooling bar had to go somewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>portable station is very compact and does not have any latching mechanisms.  </li>
            <li>Braun product does not provide a very close shave as to what I am use to when I compare this product with the Andis T-liner shaver.</li>
            <li>Though I got this electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun, I feel that the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have no clue how much it is to replace the cleaning solution it uses</li>
            <li>It really does everything they say it can.</li>
            <li>Somehow they managed to keep all the shaving power, but make it much quieter.  </li>
            <li>I am very use too using Electric Razors as they are my preferred method of shaving.</li>
            <li>, I did receive this system as from Braun as part of a campaign, so I figured I had nothing to lose, but it has really won me over.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be given the chance to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaving System by a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it really relieved my issues with skin irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who is looking for a close, smooth shave or anyone who has irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li>&amp; I found it inferior to my Norelco shaver which itself is inferior to the old reliable straight razor which I still have not been able to find a replacement for relative to closeness</li>
            <li>Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see a need to.  </li>
            <li>FAST ENOUGH&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very disappointing..am returning.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I let my facial hair grow all week and go to a barber to get a professional shave weekly.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar in the middle made my face feel extra nice</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make the Braun CoolTec better in my opinion would be the ability to plug a charger in directly to the razor when traveling without the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>price component is a big differentiator for many, with nearly a $100 USD difference between the two razors.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I received my Braun Cooltec shaver and my first impression was, damn, this is a really cool looking shaver, and it comes with al lthe necessary accessories, PLUS a cleaning station!</li>
            <li>The Braun Cooltec is a nice addition to my grooming routine and has replaced my older and less reliable electric razor.</li>
            <li>I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that became red and irritated when I shaved but not any more with the Braun CoolTec shaver.  </li>
            <li>It also has a smaller charging/cleaning station than my old unit so it looks much better in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is really a unique feeling and seems to significantly cut down or eliminate the power razor skin irritation/burn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My first use of this product was less than inspiring.</li>
            <li>My face is super sensitive normally to shaving</li>
            <li>So I switched to Panasonic ‚Äì and was willing to give this new Braun CoolTec</li>
            <li>The first time I used the razor I shaved a small amount of hair and the clean light went off.</li>
            <li>The things I liked that I felt was different from my previous electric shaver is that it gave a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li>Overall - if you shave every other day then this product would probably be good</li>
            <li>The mornings are the most hectic in our household and often times, I have to shave with one hand while the other hand is helping with my kids get ready.  </li>
            <li>I still need to use a traditional razor to clean up but it does do nicely for everyday maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have been a long time Braun shaver customer, so I was very excited when Braun sent me a new CoolTec electric razor to try.</li>
            <li>I used to get nice red marks on my neck especially with my old electric shaver, but that is non existent thanks to Braun ¬∞CoolTec!</li>
            <li>It was always to much hassle to clean the razor and always left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li>Just stash it away to charge, press the button to clean and it&#x27;s ready to go for you the next day.</li>
            <li>it is ready to go the next day all clean and charged.</li>
            <li>it is ready to go the next day all clean and charged.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a really cool idea for the active cooling technology, the aluminum cooling bar that keeps your skin cool during shaving.</li>
            <li>When you are finished shaving, you set the razor in the station, push a button, and in 3 minutes the razor is clean, lubricated, charged and ready for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>When you get all the cool accessories in the box, it really feels like the product is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I feel like there are other shavers out there that are better performing,</li>
            <li>I have used my shaver several times now, and am excited every time I need to shave now.  </li>
            <li>It seems to glide across my face better than any other electric I‚Äôve had and the coolness almost feels as though it‚Äôswet, but it‚Äôs not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How many other brands can boast all of these features??  </li>
            <li>It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.  </li>
            <li>Due to this, I have not being able to experience all that this product has to offer yet.  </li>
            <li>I wish that they sold the solution in a smaller package so you could keep the original solution chamber.</li>
            <li>Not a fault of the shaver but more due to my skin/hair</li>
            <li>I have other brands of e-razors and they do a bit better job then this.  </li>
            <li>I am currently on a three week trip, so I&#x27;m excited to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond the normal longer shaving time the only real issue I&#x27;ve come across is the sound when the charger is sitting idle.</li>
            <li>It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaving system allowed an extremely close shave and I was able to go against the grain without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was incredibly pleased that I did not receive any razor burn or other types of irritation after using this system.</li>
            <li>As someone who hasn&#x27;t used an electric razor in 10+ years, this is easily MUCH better than any other razor I tried in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clean and Charge station makes it very simple to keep the shaver clean and ready for use the next morning.</li>
            <li>It has a nice heavy, sturdy feel to it, and comes with what seems like a high end  cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Yes, the cool metal felt refreshing on my face during shaving but still I&#x27;m not sure if my sensitive skin would react positively to it.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new electric shaver as my old Philips Norelco was on its last legs, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to buy another one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that popping it back into the station is far more convenient than plugging the razor in and leaving it on the counter,plus the automatic cleaning makes it feel like a brand new shaver</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be disappointed!You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However when I gave the CoolTec a try I started to realize that the bumps weren&#x27;t just a necessary byproduct of a clean shave.</li>
            <li>With the simple click of a button, the shaver will self clean itself.</li>
            <li>Another pain with shaving is constantly having to clean your shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the CoolTec is extremely simple with the Charge and Clean station.  </li>
            <li>The shaver stays charged for an hoursa and can get enough power from five minutes of charging for one clean shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this won‚Äôt replace my straight razor as my main implement</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging station is convenient and also the fact its waterproof, running the electric razor under water like a regular razor does help clean away the shaved hair.</li>
            <li>I also like the alcohol based fluid that helps to clean the razor.  </li>
            <li>: Clean and close shave, Gets even those stubborn hairs easily, Significantly lesser skin irritation</li>
            <li>No need to manually clean it and oil it after every use like your traditional shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t that big a deal in my opinion because the shaver stays cool whether you activate the cooling system or not.  </li>
            <li>Second, my shaver didn&#x27;t come with a brush to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I find that it does help soothe any irritation to have the cool bar cross over my face as I shave and really like how it feels.</li>
            <li>so I made sure to use the CoolTec for at least a full month before writing a review.</li>
            <li>razor gets a full charge after only an hour of charging, and lasts much longer than I need for a shave.</li>
            <li>Without this cleaning system I would only be using water, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel that it was as clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The main attraction of this shaver is the CoolTec System which really works.</li>
            <li>first morning I used the razor, I was surprised at how much pressure I needed to use to move it along my face.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel it keeping my face cool during the entire shave.  </li>
            <li>So, this can easily be solved by letting it dry after its cleaned.</li>
            <li>my neck and small facial patches and the Braun does a great for this.  </li>
            <li>Within a few seconds of shaving, you can feel the razor getting cool on contact which makes for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program.</li>
            <li>It was easy to get going and prime with fluid, and so far seems like a very no-fuss</li>
            <li>and I actually trust that its clean now.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve tried a few electric shavers in the past, but have never been impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>To be honest though, I don&#x27;t know that I will continue using this shaver long enough to need a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn‚Äôt stick out long enough for it to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec shaves at a slower clip and cools the skin down, which means it will take longer to shave, but you will be very comfortable with that shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For one, it took me much longer than usual to complete a full shave, and secondly, it just wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like it to be (this probably wont be problem for most people seeing as I have to shave twice a day just to keep a clean face,</li>
            <li>The new razor with its adaptable 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade provides a nice clean shave that is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I change my facial hair fairly regularly, going from full beard to clean cut, and all points in between.</li>
            <li>I currently have been using the Braun series 7 shaver before giving this new Cooltec a try after receiving it through a free program from Braun.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old also thinks its fun to watch daddy shave with his new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun 8000 series razor for quite some time, and was fortunate enough to receive a new Braun CoolTec razor as part of a Braun promotion for testing and review.  </li>
            <li>As a person who is always warm (I live in shorts year round), the idea of having a cooling electric shaver intrigued me.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it</li>
            <li>I first started on the right chin, the shave felt totally different from what I thought it would feel like....</li>
            <li>For extra close shaves on special occassions, I would suggest finishing off with a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The specially designed shaving blades target and capture hairs growing in different directions.  </li>
            <li>I relate the significant reduction of irritation clearly to how cool the shaver really gets when you press the &#x27;Active cooling&#x27; button.</li>
            <li>I had been waiting for about 5 days from my previous shave; my facial hair was asking for a good shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is quite pleasant and took only a few minutes to get used to.</li>
            <li>When I was finished, I placed the shaver in the slick cleaning station, which did a very nice job for my next use.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and I have to take great care not to make it worse when I shave.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a comfortable, less-expensive (in the long run), slower, not quite as close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried electric razors in the past but to be honest</li>
            <li>The same is true for the CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered to try the Braun CoolTech shaver CT5cc thru a program run by Braun, my natural first reaction was...\\&quot;Its</li>
            <li>This was the first foil topped shaver I have used in my adult life; I have always used a three headed spiral type shaver before.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec shaver definitely delivers on its promise of getting you a cool shave.  </li>
            <li>but I always seem to go back to a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; multi-blade manual razor full time.</li>
            <li>It works out, but definitely not if you have a face full of hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend for someone who has sensitivity, but not a face full of hair.</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars was because the shave still didn&#x27;t rival that of a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is  cool.</li>
            <li>this is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;ve used it once so far.</li>
            <li>the Braun Cooltec if you do a full face shave on a regular basis and don&#x27;t like the burn of your existing equipment.</li>
            <li>Just cool enough that you can feel that its colder than the surrounding air.</li>
            <li>The system comes with a shaver with trimming capabilities and a charging/washing/lubrication station which is cool because not only does it charge</li>
            <li>And it appears, at least initially, the shaver is better put together and more durable</li>
            <li>This time, the charge actually turns off when the battery is full.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a part-time early adopter.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m somebody that would constantly suffer from razor burn so the thought of something like this to keep everything cool in the process</li>
            <li>It really does help to reduce the irritation I would normally get while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I was not able to get as close a shave as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It only takes an hour till a full charge is achieved.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the cool bar actually did</li>
            <li>So far, I would definitely say its much more comfortable than any other electric razor I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually had a closer shave with the Braun I ever had from my razor, and it left the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean out without little pockets of hair being perpetually stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a little longer than my Braun seven series shaver and in the end seemed to have a little closer shave and a much more pleasant experience during the actual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received this new CoolTec electric shaver thanks to a program by Braun and so far it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I am not sure how quickly the cleaning station will go through the solution, but it will cost to replace and I enjoy using an electric razor so that I don&#x27;t spend as much on disposable razors.</li>
            <li>That is super convenient, but there is still a little clean up if you want to remove that hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this to anyone who is in the market to purchase a new shaver!  </li>
            <li>Tossed it that day and went and bought the new Braun series 7!</li>
            <li>After 3 days of not shaving I powered up my new razor and it worked like a champ!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think the CoolTec system would be great for someone without a very heavy beard like me, as the cool bar technology provides a very positive improvement to the typical electric shave.  </li>
            <li>a pretty simple, effective, precise and for sure less irritating shaver.</li>
            <li>But those trivial issues pale in comparison to the clean, close, COOL shave this thing gives.</li>
            <li>I think the CoolTec is a great product and other than the extra couple minutes I have to spend shaving, I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and cooling bar works better than any other shaver I have used on minimizing the irritation.</li>
            <li>All in all I really do like the new Braun CoolTec shaving system, with having lots of experience with electric shavers</li>
            <li>and now I have graduated to a whole new level of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>This shaver takes revolutionary to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all thanks to the new cooling feature on the CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li>I recently tried out the Braun CoolTec System and have to say that the icy coolness was amazing.</li>
            <li>The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair into the unit like my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this shaver for over a month now, I will say that I do have to go over the same area a few more times to get a clean shave</li>
            <li>Many times sunday morning I would have a slight rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have run the shaver through the same area a few more times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The clean and charge system is another nice feature - I&#x27;ve never liked dismantling a razor and going in there with those tiny</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super convenient to simply throw it on the charger after using it and just by pressing a button it cleans it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also final feature is how quick it charges from the time it is put on the charger and charges under an hour.  </li>
            <li>Its a fairly decent shaver.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is under powered for the thicker beard, but might be a decent edging and shaping tool.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be selected by Braun to test this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try the Shaving System during a participation in a Braun promotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an older Braun 7000 series</li>
            <li>I end up having to break out the ol&#x27; classic to get the rest.</li>
            <li>I recently received the Braun Cooltec Electric shaver as a promo run by Braun and quickly unwrapped it.  </li>
            <li>I received my Braun a week ago and it quickly came a part of my daily morning regimen.</li>
            <li>it is decent with so</li>
            <li>I have used it wet with no shave lotion, and it does as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old with sensitive skin, shaving isn&#x27;t fun at times.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to participate in a program ran by Braun, I have used the electric razor for a some time now and would like to provide some thoughts to help guide your electric razor decision.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an electric shaver that not only cuts close but quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this razor from a program through Braun.</li>
            <li>For the purposes of this review, I will compare to the Braun Series 7 because it is similar in design and branding, as well as a traditional Gillette razor because many will be coming from this setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we all had a good look at them again as an essential part of our everyday routine.....</li>
            <li>I have been using the CoolTec for the past 45 days and have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did provide a good shave, but there were a few areas that I needed to go back and touch up.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a decently close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I wish the shaver could operate with the power cord, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal since it charges so quickly.</li>
            <li>I would put the shave from CoolTec on par with shaves I&#x27;ve had from  professional barbers with a straight edge razor but without the high price and time investment!</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say that I do not typically use electric shavers</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t bought an electric razor in over 5 years and had switched to buying blade cartridges, which can be a hassle and can start to cost a decent amount after a while.</li>
            <li>That gave me a chance to test the mettle of the pop-up trimmer in the back which was sturdy and took beard to stubble quite quickly.</li>
            <li>you have the main unit with the cleaning solution in, you can&#x27;t move it around without spilling the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>This should be sealed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about moving the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt it did an adequate job, but I did have to shave the next day, unlike if I used a manual</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is easy and decent, but I wish the shaving head itself did not feel quite so wide.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, since I need to shave and go quickly, I would stick with a different razor.</li>
            <li>This was great for me because I usually shy away from electric razors as they really irritate my skin during and after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to setup - pretty much out of the box ready to use (with a small charge of course)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The instructions are only mildly helpful.  </li>
            <li>After going over the same areas over and over again I was able to finish about 20 minutes after starting.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive one via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>It just doesnt work particularly well.</li>
            <li>I wish it had the pivoting head of the older Pulsonic that I had, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>main selling point of this Braun is the CoolTec system.</li>
            <li>After a few shaves I got very use to the Coolness and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I still see myself shaving with a regular razor most often, but I can see the potential for the Braun to fill in one to two days a week.</li>
            <li>I already had an older model of Braun shaver, but obtained a CoolTec shaving system via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec‚Äôs main selling point is that it has a cooling bar, which is meant to minimize redness, burning, and skin irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li>As a fan of electric razors (the convenience of being able to quickly shave for those mornings when you just don&#x27;t have time to shave with a regular razor), I have found that many times I&#x27;m forced to shave my neck area first, then my face due to the skin irritation I received from an electric razor that quickly warms up after only 20 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Cooltec system with do that with an awesome cool feeling, but it just makes it a little too difficult to do the job</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new electronic shaver!</li>
            <li>Being a person of very sensitive skin I never quite found one that really didn&#x27;t  irritate me and leave me looking and feeling like I had hives.</li>
            <li>The long hair trimmer is perfect for that hard to maintain and trim mustache and upper lip hair.  </li>
            <li>I expected this new product to better right above the Adam&#x27;s apple region</li>
            <li>The cleaning light literally seems to come on after every single shave even if I have just cleaned it.  </li>
            <li>Not freezing, but also not sure it is really doing too much to make my skin feel any better.  </li>
            <li>With my first use of it, I was already impressed on how cold the razor actually got.</li>
            <li>I found it very challenging to get a similar level of closeness in my shave using the Braun CoolTec even after going over the same areas several times.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers in the past and they leave my face with mild irritation, with the Cooltec the cooling bar leaves my face irritation free.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is easy to break down, clean and put back together.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Shaver.  </li>
            <li>product is high quality and lives up to all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>product is high quality and lives up to all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Then again neither is high end shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is the shaver to buy if you suffer from razor burn and want a high end shaver.</li>
            <li>shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to the Gillette and Schick disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li>shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I knew that this was a high quality piece of manliness.</li>
            <li>When my brother and dad saw this high teck, sleek looking device they both wanted it.</li>
            <li>However I would highly recomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>When I got asked to participate in a Braun promotion I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself works well and is made with high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>I does appear that this razor does not run as high of an RPM as my 7-series.  </li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>but it washes the shaver with alcohol to maintain a high level of hygiene and then lubricates to keep the shaver at peak</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All the parts, pieces, and accessories are high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaving system.</li>
            <li>product is a premium razor with high quality construction.</li>
            <li>think the preference for choice of shaving device is highly dependent upon the user.</li>
            <li>The Clean Station is a little bulky and takes up counter space, but I feel it&#x27;s worth the space!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while it was often slow to cut, I found the cooling effect was still well worth the new technology and was glad to get the opportunity to try the shaver through a trial program with Braun.</li>
            <li>The CoolTec System will likely be copied by other companies, but I doubt it will duplicate the amazing experience that the CoolTec System provides.</li>
            <li>charger is a &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34; that you can only use if it is laying flat, taking up more room.  </li>
            <li>It also come with a travel charger which will come in handy due to its low profile.</li>
            <li>It also come with a travel charger which will come in handy due to its low profile.</li>
            <li>After using the Braun product on the first day to shave, the cooling system really did provide less irritation to the skin, although it was not as cool as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I were a new comer to the worl of Braun electric shavers I would appreciate the new feature much more.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>This shaver is very easy to use compared to ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>As expected the head comes off for easy cleaning and also comes with a cleaning solution helping the razor feel like new for every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically shave using a razor, but was tempted into trying out an electric shaver again with Brauns innovative new cooling system.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more costly than others.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little better than holding a brick to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did seem like I had to press harder than other Brauns to be able to feel the cool bar also.  </li>
            <li>so you have to pay a little more attention to the angle of the shaver</li>
            <li>It still does the work just takes a little more time.</li>
            <li>5 is because the one thing I thought the Norelco circular blades did better was handle the shave when hair got a little longer (i.e. 4 days + without shaving.)  </li>
            <li>The direction could certainly be a little better and explain things a little more.  </li>
            <li>You could skip the fluid, clean it yourself, and save some money, but then you won&#x27;t feel like much of an early adopter, now will</li>
            <li>I also love the locking feature for the razor as I have had my older unit come on while in plane storage which resulted in the unit beind dead when I arrived at my destination.  </li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need and it also comes with a nice HARD case for if you are traveling with it to keep it sage or just to store it in.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard to explain</li>
            <li>a charging / cleaning station is excellent as I like that there is a cleaning solution (alchol base) that really gives the shaver head a deep clean, so it works as well as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally the type to shave completely clean, I mainly use a beard trimmer to keep a stubble look.</li>
            <li>I love the CoolTec technology that leaves my skin feeling less ittitated that any other electric shaver while still giving me a close shave that is comfortable.</li>
            <li>My older Braun 1775 shaver is still working after 9 years but decided to upgrade and try the new Braun CoolTec CT5cc model.</li>
            <li>The Braun CoolTec System so far has worked really well.</li>
            <li>The cooling feature really prevents the after-burn that my old razor was giving me every time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I would never pay as much as the MSRP suggests- near $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this feels like a great expensive razor, from the weight to the quality of the materials.</li>
            <li>It takes up so much space on my counter, and the cord sticks so far out from the wall that I am considering the product&#x27;s removal from my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how much I like the cooling feature too.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver as it&#x27;s not irritating to skin and gives you soft shaving even when the cooling is switched off .</li>
            <li>The chilling effect really is great idea</li>
            <li>I also owned a Panasonic Arc 4 before the Norelco, and I would say the Braun CoolTec shaves nearly on par with the Panasonic and much closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I also owned a Panasonic Arc 4 before the Norelco, and I would say the Braun CoolTec shaves nearly on par with the Panasonic and much closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>The cooling action does make a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoy the bar, as it makes my face feel wet, like with a cartridge razor, as I shave.  </li>
            <li>so I‚Äôd often just go with the old fashioned straight razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor continues to give me a shave that is nearly as close as a straight razor (without the risk of grave</li>
            <li>The cooling effect that this razor has really caters to those with sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li>I have used several of the top brands before including Braun and never really noticed much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra features are worth the price of admission.  </li>
            <li>The extra features are worth the price of admission.  </li>
            <li>Red light was blinking instead of the normal green light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with it for a week now and for the most part I like it, with a few quibbles over the function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so not that big a deal but worth mentioning nonetheless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The regular non-electric razor still wins in the close shave department, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick to non-electric.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed about the shaver is its grip, it has a very ergonomic solid feel to</li>
            <li>The shaver could provide a closer shave, but it does close enough for what I need and the cooling bar is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li>When the kit arrived, it took only moments to assemble and get ready for it&#x27;s first run.  </li>
            <li>if you allow a few days growth it takes some more effort, as with any razor.</li>
            <li>I found myself using the travel stand for normal charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Cooling feature was neat and extremely refreshing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was really needed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll keep at it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s defiantly a different experience but the tech alone makes it worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>and I that would have to use a normal razor to shave.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, I thought I would add some more insight on CoolTec CT5cc shaving system, which was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it still works like a normal shaver during that</li>
            <li>So normally i have to use a trimmer than shave after.</li>
            <li>I have had the chance to use the CoolTec razor for a few weeks now as part of a promotion from Braun and have to say that it is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, that the cool bar, piece of metal, that gets really cold, is refreshing and cool.  </li>
            <li>razor is water resistant up to a few meters, like most, so you could use it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>charging station worked well and the charge lasted a long time before the shaver needed a full charge.</li>
            <li>a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is not your normal shaver.</li>
            <li>So, with full beard, I used the &amp;#34;powerful long hair trimmer&amp;#34; on the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver to trim up.  </li>
            <li>me tell you about my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li>I need to shave on a daily basis for my job and was exciting to give this razor a try.</li>
            <li>Just pop the top off and tap it in the sink or trash then just take the brush and do a few swipes on the unit and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>burn you&#x27;d normally have.  </li>
            <li>The base is nice as well, an easy way to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Normally, I tend to get some cuts and almost always have some razor burn and/or bumps with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I think the cooling sensation and lack of facial irritation is worth the trade, though.</li>
            <li>I think the infrared photo on the product review is real because it actually does get pretty cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with any shaver it takes a few weeks to get through the irritation period, however as I have purchased many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li>however that was tempered by the fact that it took quite a few more passes to get it to that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also after using this razor I noticed my &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; was appearing sooner than normal</li>
            <li>If travelling for extended time without ability to charge you could eek out a few more days if you turned off the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you let your hair go more than a few days</li>
            <li>During that time I always believed that you just couldn&#x27;t beat the closeness of normal blade based razors.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôll give it a few more weeks and post a follow up review</li>
            <li>I have arrived at a destination with a dead razor more than once.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll have a better sense for this in a few weeks, so</li>
            <li>This may be normal, but I see cleaning cartridge refills substantially adding to the cost over time.  </li>
            <li>cleaning pack solutions last a pretty reasonable time and refills are not to pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get razor bumps from electric razors, so I don&#x27;t normally use them, however the cooling technology prevented that from happening.  </li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m a safety razor user, but when I received my Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to switch over to electric shaving since long before I could grow a beard; it looked so cool in all the movies and &amp;#34;Grandpa does it while he drives his car to work&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>like I normally do so</li>
            <li>I was immediately aware of the cooling bar and it added a whole different level to the shaving experience.</li>
            <li>get a few more pennies out of us, but I am reserving judgement.  </li>
            <li>I was able to test the shaver through a program run by Braun and have been working with it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then sadly used the trimmer on my epic beard I had grown over Movember, which was oddly satisfying for my wife, and was pleased with the smoothness and effectiveness of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>charged up the shaver, it seems to have good battery life, although that is decreased when using the cooling system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but not a great one.</li>
            <li>couple of items that could be improved in my opinion are that the sideburn shaver does not cut a clear defined line, which makes my sideburns look a little ragged; the cooling mechanism works, but I would really like it produce a much colder sensation; and the cleaning solution/catridges seem to be used up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar (which sticks up between the two foil screens) kicks in immediately, doing an amazing job at keeping down the irritation that normally comes with using an electric razor, especially in the area under the jaw bone.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend giving this a try for anyone looking to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>have fairly sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t tend to shave often, and mostly just trim it down when I do anything.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair grows in pretty quickly and relatively coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have have to use a Swiss army knife to open anything up and this kit was easy to open.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, Braun Cooltech shaver felt like it was build solid with no loose parts, ergonomic to hold, the main beard blade was on the top with two moving parts and the straight blade for trimming was on the back and located clearly out of the way.</li>
            <li>started in on my first shave, and the cold sensation is very nice.  </li>
            <li>normally complains of irritation and razor burn when he gets a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it has a retractable razor on the back in case you need to do a major shave and not just a clean up.</li>
            <li>When I finally received my shaver I plugged it right up to charge and put everything together.  </li>
            <li>Now I can shave right next to the bed without her waking up!</li>
            <li>and when I don‚Äôt have enough time to really do it right.</li>
            <li>When I received the Braun Cooltec through a promotional program by Braun, I was right in the middle of growing out my beard for Movember.</li>
            <li>A regular razor and the right shaving cream could probably duplicate the effect.  </li>
            <li>You will want to open it right away.</li>
            <li>I wished it were longer so that I could place the cradle further away from the socket to charge as right now</li>
            <li>Since I didn‚Äôt need to shave right away, I let it charge in its station for about an hour, then came back to it.</li>
            <li>maybe from the set of Demolition Man, right next to the 3 shells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I finally got the beard, and asked dad why he DIDN&#x27;T use an electric razor, he explained that he could never get one that worked right.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone with or without sensitive skin and to friends and family!</li>
            <li>quick and is long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Also, because of the cool bar, the shaver head is quite large, which makes it difficult to shave between my nose and top lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from needing to be thoughtful as to the placement of the base, its a great system and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>While the performance was great on my face, it was very poor on my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li>Went on a trip this past weekend and the small case and dock fit nicely in to my luggage and didn&#x27;t take much room on the counter when</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the cooltec is a solid shaver it works the best of any electric ive used in the past and the cooling really helps with the irritation ive gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>This razor was very helpful with the latter and only a bit better with the former.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is only appropriate for evening out sideburns; precision facial hair detailing simply cannot be accomplished with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On a side note the long hair trimmer was not as powerful as older razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many electric razors in the past (including older Braun models)</li>
            <li>me start off by saying that for the previous decade, I had been a loyal Braun user ‚Äì first the predecessor to their 500 series and then the 790 series until just this year.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer provided accurate and sharp cut&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>and I would like it to be available on other shavers of its type.</li>
            <li>I first started using it, I noticed what others commented about re: not cutting a lot of barely too long hairs.</li>
            <li>¬∞CoolTec System left me with a shave just as close as a blade, and the cooling factor prevented the red burn marks that I have experienced in the past.</li>
            <li>I usually shave with cartridge razors, but this Braun is able to get a very close shave which surprised me.</li>
            <li>There were one or two pulls around my chin, but it was smooth other than that.</li>
            <li>but it is not something i couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>Which means that the machine keep working and giving noisy until the battery run out!&lt;br /&gt;Although P&amp;G provide a change service, it takes 1-2 weeks before they give me a new (I doubt) body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this new shaver, i don&#x27;t have the problem of razor burn or the feeling of hairs being pulled out of my face at all.</li>
            <li>so thr Braun setup was new to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I&#x27;m not setting any new speed records, I gave this product 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - I found my new fave shaver ...again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - I found my new fave shaver ...again.</li>
            <li>Sounded like a new idea</li>
            <li>Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞</li>
            <li>new technology.</li>
            <li>About a month ago I was shopping for the replacement head for the 790CC when I came across the new Cooltec.  </li>
            <li>So after a month I returned it and purchased the new 790CC.  </li>
            <li>I found them on Amazon.com for about $5 a piece, but having never paid for a solution for my shaver, this is a new cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received this new shaver &amp; of course decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyday I use this shaver I feel like I&#x27;m setting new speed records.  </li>
            <li>I had been anticipating this new type of electric razor from Braun for quite a while.</li>
            <li>This shaver features a Braun&#x27;s new CoolTec aluminum cooling bar which causes a cooling sensation when shaving.</li>
            <li>I received the new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by the Braun company.</li>
            <li>After i used it all week, i went home and put it in the docking station and when I pulled it out it looked all new and shiny again.</li>
            <li>I was exited to try out the new CoolTec system because I thought it would speed up my shaving process.</li>
            <li>I was intereseted to try a new model and see if the technology had improved.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new electric razor</li>
            <li>I recieve this product through a promotion from Braun and I was stoked to try the new &amp;#34;cool tec&amp;#34; feature.</li>
            <li>I saw the promotion that Braun was running to try out the new CoolTec, I did some research.</li>
            <li>I looked forward to the arrival of my new razor that I was selected to receive through a promotion from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels and smells like a new razor every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a chance to use the new Braun CoolTec System provided via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>I was given the chance to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System, through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>When I got my new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System through a program they offer, I had to put it to the test.  </li>
            <li>I was provided  Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already retired my old razor for this new one!</li>
            <li>The cold bar really did reduce irritation and felt great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I found that the Braun CoolTec delivers on its promises regarding the active cooling technology, cleaning system, and comfortable design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I had tried before felt more like it pulled the hair out versus cutting it.  </li>
            <li>The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face.</li>
            <li>For anyone with sensitive skin, one of the main issues with electric shavers is that they generate heat, followed by redness and irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li>Overall I found the shave better than expected, but still not as close on the neck as I need.</li>
            <li>The cooling features are pretty cool (no pun intended) and aren&#x27;t as gimmicky as I imagined they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it when I want an extra close shave, because I feel only a blade, shaving against the grain can get my face baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>with some previous Braun models, this include the built-in cleaning system, and is very convenient to clean your razor at the push of a button.  </li>
            <li>When you do open the box you will see more parts than expected.</li>
            <li>and I have never really been satisfied with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The cleaning base and CoolTec functionality are wonderful features to have in an electric shaver, and they really do work as advertised.</li>
            <li>The main reason I switched to manual razors years ago is because I have sensitive skin and pushing an electric shaver around my face used to leave me with blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job for an electric shaver on his thick facial hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting back to its not the CoolTecs Fault, because I have thick follicles, as others may have, the system is tougher for us to use, electric shavers are not for everyone, but this one does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cooling bar really does cut down on irritation and just plain feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used my new shaver that I received through a program run by Braun for a few weeks now and while it provides some unique qualities it certainly missed the mark on others.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really hold this against it though since no other razor I&#x27;ve seen can handle longer hair (1/8th - 1/4 inch) with any competency.  </li>
            <li>The manual is very clear and it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face and shaving often leads to razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you will find is that the Series 7 is the Lexus of the group, with very fast performance, extra bells and whistles (three modes of shaving), and nicer aesthetics.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and after three weeks of using this product 3 times a week</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the old reliable razor and shaving gel over this high tech gizmo though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and almost always just a razor, however with the CoolTec</li>
            <li>Another drawback is that it takes up a lot of counter space and the self-cleaning is very loud.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and electric razor tear up my face.  </li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and the CoolTec razor has an added bonus of a cooling bar built into the razor.</li>
            <li>As a man with very sensitive skin, I was hesitant yet intrigued to try out the shaver.</li>
            <li>I found it very difficult to get into the curvier areas of my face and neck and feel like I had to make multiple passes in multiple directions to get any kind of good</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for about 15 years now, but I have only owned Norelco razors, so I was interested to try out a new brand to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll whirr and buzz a bit for about 5 minutes, but when you use the razor the next morning, it feels as new as the first time you fired it up.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the shave that it provides is only decent at best, especially compared to my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have tough facial hair and like the smooth closeness that I am able to achieve using my manual razor.</li>
            <li>head of the shaver seemed to clog up pretty quick when clearing heavy stubble.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, especially around my neck, but I haven&#x27;t even had as much as one red mark.</li>
            <li>It did cut a bit, but required too much work for those little results, which wasn&#x27;t the clean shave</li>
            <li>In the past I felt like I was doing a lot of stubble clean up after the first go around, and now with my new CoolTec razor</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is pretty big.</li>
            <li>I will most likely put it in storage and just rinse out the shaver head like I do with all my other shavers.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation soothes the burn I normally feel on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And the first time i used it, a red mark and irritation occurred on my neck</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and have to shave often this is a must!</li>
            <li>I have pretty low expectations for shaving</li>
            <li>The reason I can&#x27;t give this product a higher rating is because I found I had to go over my lower neck a number of times for the hair there to finally be fully removed.</li>
            <li>First to lead off I am a lifetime disposable razor user my entire life.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station/charger is pretty big for a shaver this size also but understandable since it cleans your shaver as well.</li>
            <li>I used to operate electric razors for many years until this past year.</li>
            <li>Having a higher speed for this specific purpose would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First the obvious one, the cooling bar.</li>
            <li>This is the complete package!  </li>
            <li>After the third use my skin didn&#x27;t have that after shave hot feeling!&lt;br</li>
            <li>kit comes with cleaning liquid, apparently making the whole package ineligible for return.  </li>
            <li>but I usually put coconut oil/teatreeoil blend on as aftershave most days.</li>
            <li>I would not say I normally have overly sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li>I recemend you purchase this razor a significant other.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who is used to electric shavers and especially to anyone looking to get one for the first time..  </li>
            <li>This shaver is definitely better than all of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am not usually one for electric razors</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I would actually recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>first impression when I received my CoolTec shaver in the mail were that aesthetics were simple, yet sleek.</li>
            <li>First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  </li>
            <li>Indeed it was better than any other shaving machine I used (although last time was about 5 years ago).</li>
            <li>If I did experience redness or irritation, I can see how the really &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooling bar might help, and the 3-stage cutting system might be a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>If you can afford the higher end model, I would definitely say you should skip this one and move up to the 790cc.</li>
            <li>I never thought it could be my old razor doing this!  </li>
            <li>Shave 5 star - may not be as close as other systems, but my need is to be able to shave daily at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW at the stuff!  </li>
            <li>WOW at the reading material!  </li>
            <li>Shaving is not my favorite thing to do, my skin usually doesn‚Äôt react well to this activity.</li>
            <li>At first, this sensation felt different on my face</li>
            <li>It took about a week to two weeks before I was comfortable enough/skilled enough to trim around the facial hair I wanted without having to supplement with my old razor.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to be willing to go over those areas around the edges of your sideburns and facial hair (ie moustaches, goatees)</li>
            <li>I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with electric razors, but when I‚Äôve used them I did experience a pretty substantial amount of irritation especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Normally I shave every other day, so this was a true test.</li>
            <li>First of all I am no grizzly Adams when it comes to growing facial hair.</li>
            <li>I usually do not use an electric razor</li>
            <li>Like most other similar razors, it keeps it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned electric razors in the past which were better at doing this.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation feels pleasant on the skin, and there&#x27;s definitely less irritation than the old Norelco that I previously used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After i was done i took of the screen and brushed away the hairs using the supplied brush and put it in its cradle for its first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>All I can say is Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried several different electric shavers and razors, but most of them end up causing moderate to severe razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the first time I used the cleaning station, I set it at night before going to bed and the thing kept running through the night and was still going when I woke up 7 hours later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first batch of cleaning fluid</li>
            <li>First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this razor does have a cool (but bulky) base, a nice cool bar in the middle (which seems more of a gimmick than actually a benefit), and a  solid weight.</li>
            <li>It does the job, though certainly not as close and clean of a shave as the old Braun 790 or the new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I do find that its a little too easy to turn off the cooling feature with the location of the button on the handle.</li>
            <li>With the touch of a button, the charging/cleaning station takes care of all the messy cleaning and it will be ready to use, clean and charged,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, my girlfriend believes it&#x27;s actually closer than my manual razor (I&#x27;m not totally sold on that, but I look clean shaven afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this out by growing out some decent facial hair to really test this shaver out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge system is similar to my 7 Series and uses the SAME cleaning cartridges</li>
            <li>After making several passes and different directions, I still needed to use a disposable razor to clean up what this electric missed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The long hair shaver/groomer on the back works just fine, it helps for straightening sideburns and around my neck line.</li>
            <li>The cleaning base also does a great job of keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li>Likewise, no matter how I maneuvered the device, I was left with stray hair below my jaw line and neck, which I ultimately had to clean up using a manual razor.</li>
            <li>well keeps the blades clean and sharp</li>
            <li>No matter how careful I may be, my neck most especially becomes very irritated, red, and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried an electric shaver since I was in high school, when I discovered that my facial hair was very course.</li>
            <li>With that said this razor only gets the cooling liquid on maybe a third of my face which is then pointless for the rest of my face, there needs to be a better way for it to meter the amount applied to the face so that you can get full coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of shaving brands and products in my adult life, and this might be one of my new favorites.  </li>
            <li>It offers a bunch of features that some don&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Putting the head back on was just as easy and popping it on the cleaning station for a fresh, complete clean was a snap, much easier than other razors that you need to disassemble piece by piece, then lubricate with a spray or other third party agent, then most likely next time you use will need to apply a pre-electric shave gel or other prepping agent.  </li>
            <li>It is not too heavy and the handle fits easily in my hand.</li>
            <li>For my first shave, I let my beard grow as long as I normally do for about a week.  </li>
            <li>I have been always told that the best time to shave is after a hot shower because that&#x27;s when the pores are opened; considering that, I was somewhat fearful of how my face will react to the cooltec system.</li>
            <li>The cool bar in the Braun gives a nice cold sensation which seems to help reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a higher end electric razor for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the only issue i would have is the price, i am not sure i would spen that kind of money on a shaver, but i do see the value in it.</li>
            <li>I have never really found an electric razor that performs adequately on my skin.  </li>
            <li>stand is solid and the cleaning functionality is really cool and actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cooling technology should be built into the razor head system to keep the shaver head cool, it doesn&#x27;t actually need to touch the skin (unless that&#x27;s the only way it works).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had razor burn issues with electric shavers in the past, but so far this thing is as smooth as, well, ice!</li>
            <li>You still need to splash your face with cold water after you shave but during the shave it is a nice cool</li>
            <li>I got the CoolTec shaver the other day from a special program conducted by Braun and all that changed.</li>
            <li>When Braun asked me to participate in a trial of a new razor, I was excited because of the experience I have had with my previous razor.</li>
            <li>For longer hair, I find it always better to use a trimmer to shave down as much as possible before using this razor for finer hair shaving.  </li>
            <li>The only positive I can truly come up with</li>
            <li>But overall, my feelings are positive and I would recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a positive experience overall.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is moderate to light, so I mainly groom instead of shaving everything and the Braun CoolTec can cut close enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does get nice and cold, yet not uncomfortable, and provides a shave that does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li>If you have a small bathroom with a tiny vanity, plan on this baby taking up more real estate</li>
            <li>If you have a small bathroom with a tiny vanity, plan on this baby taking up more real estate</li>
            <li>I was not itchy or irritated during or after the shaving process (which is not always true with other razors).</li>
            <li>After the shave, there was no irritation and my face felt cool rather than on fire as with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fancy ones) for a clean and closer shave, I was looking for something new with less irritation, bumps, etc.</li>
            <li>My regular razor does too, but I&#x27;m spending probably $15-20 on disposables each week to keep that \\&quot;new blade\\&quot; look, and it adds up fast.</li>
            <li>I recently received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System thanks to a program run by Braun and it has been a mind-blowing shaving experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s being advertised heavily and it&#x27;ll be the first thing you&#x27;ll notice right away on your face, the cooling factor.  </li>
            <li>My previous shaver left my skin feeling much more irritated.</li>
            <li>I think it is less an issue with the shaver and more a problem with the thickness of my facial hair.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation is more is less the same sensation you&#x27;d get by pulling a can of Coke out of your fridge and rubbing it on your face.  </li>
            <li>but above a 3 because of how much better it did over previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair grows quickly and I got pulling from the razor and did not get a close shave at all, even after trying multiple angles and doing a pre-trim.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to pull my skin tight to get a close shave and also perform a light shave with a disposable razor to ensure all the whiskers were gone.  </li>
            <li>The fact is that my facial hair is course, grows fast, and the skin below all of this is very sensitive to razor burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The razor did fine in a few spots on my neck but would still leave hair in some areas</li>
            <li>The cleaning fluid also smells nice and you get a slight whiff of it once you start shaving the next time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimmer smaller and doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous Braun models, i have an old one from about 5 years ago and love the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to shave my entire face in a quarter of the time it took with my old Braun razor (less passes), and even after not shaving in over a month</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is easy to use and works very well, I actually let the hair on my head grow out a few days to see if the Cooltec could handle it and to see how well the cleaning system works.</li>
            <li>I turned the shaver &#x27;on&#x27; and the &#x27;active cool&#x27;....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while it is a little bit more money than some of the Philips Norelco electric shavers and a few other brands, I do think it is a much better value with the CoolTec included, particularly if you have sensitive skin and electric shavers tend to irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To give a little more background, my skin is pretty sensitive so with the manual I always suffered from those bumps due to irritation from the shave</li>
            <li>With the CoolTec razor, I certainly FEEL like this thing is from the future...</li>
            <li>This causes little irritation and results in a comfortable shave experience.</li>
            <li>It is very weak, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job for precision</li>
            <li>Since I have been using the clean and charge station daily, which charges the shaver, I can‚Äôt confirm how long the battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also one of the main perks I think of a electric shaver would be the whole saving money in the long run.</li>
            <li>It trims down alright, wasn&#x27;t like a clean shave though.</li>
            <li>However, because I found myself having to go over the same areas (particularly on the neck) several times in order to get a clean shave, it actually took me almost 10 minutes longer to complete my shave using the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li>product is worth every single penny!  </li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4 because I thought the foil on the 7000 series cut a little better on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Cooltec left me a little more stubbly than I would have</li>
            <li>, I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to a family member or friend if they have a little more to invest in their shaver system - short term and long-term.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most electric shavers, it still missed a little that needed a follow-up with a manual razor to get everything, but I will definitely add this to my routine.  </li>
            <li>and although I love the CoolTech system the shaving falls a little short.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great shaver for on those cold, windy, razor-burn prone days</li>
            <li>The cooling system which is a metal bar that gets quite cold is great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning light comes on everyday even if I rinse it off completely...  </li>
            <li>so I can clear my counter and not have the bulky cleaning system taking up space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since getting this, I have alternated between using my old Norelco for daily touch ups, as it is much lighter and quicker to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my thicker beard hair I&#x27;ve become accustomed to having to clear the blades of manual razors after every stroke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would probably be great for someone with light/moderate facial hair growth but probably won&#x27;t work out for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li>but my old shaver left me with a much smoother finish than this Braun ¬∞CoolTec</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who has sensitive skin or suffers from razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week, I was reaching for my old Braun instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would be the razor that fixed this problem.  </li>
            <li>(disclaimer...there wasn&#x27;t much hair left) and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised by the performance of the razor.  </li>
            <li>However, I was surprised by the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>It works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs by the back of my jawline.  </li>
            <li>The cooling feature was strange at first</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I recommend this shaving system to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have had it for nearly a month</li>
            <li>Q: this one was designed for sensitive skin where my husbands is not.  </li>
            <li>It charges fast and to know that my shaver is cleaner than it would be with a regular water rinse</li>
            <li>But for those that frequently shave, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use the self cleaning station often.</li>
            <li>It may be to early to tell if this will change my habits, but I am going to give it another 3-4 weeks and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>The cooling bar cools almost instantly, no need to wait, and absolutely reduced the irritation.  </li>
            <li>For the price it cost, I still would still to the generic razors who can give me a close shave regardless of how much growth I have had.</li>
            <li>was about 8 years old and in need of replacement.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m thinking about pulling the old model out of the drawer...</li>
            <li>It helps with the sensitive skin that I have.</li>
            <li>-Cleaner is loud - You don&#x27;t have to use it too often</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;15 years ago my face became so sensitive I had to stop using a razor and shave gel</li>
            <li>And it irritates my skin (likely because I need to shave so much).</li>
            <li>The adaptable 3 -stage cutting system and sensoBlade seems to be giving a nice comfortable shave, but doesn&#x27;t pick up all the facial hair in one run.  </li>
            <li>Have to look a few time and even feel in the area after shaving to see if it is smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell but</li>
            <li>Also, now that I think about it, I do not believe I can plug a cable directly into the razor in order to charge it.</li>
            <li>This razor is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looooooved the cooling aspect immediately.</li>
            <li>I have literally been shaving my face daily, which is something unusual for me because of the ease and close</li>
            <li>I had been using an old Braun model I got when I started college years ago</li>
            <li>Finally a shaver that really has it all.</li>
            <li>I just hope the cleaning fluid is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no matter my choice of shaving</li>
            <li>and it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>It also has that barber shop smell to it while shaving that reminds you of the old guy who used to cut your hair growing up or the guy that lines you up at the barber</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but my skin was to sensitive to continue use.</li>
            <li>I like the way that my series 7 shaver&#x27;s head moves with the curvature of my face where as this razor has a fixed head and does not move.  </li>
            <li>user‚Äôs manual was clearly written and concise.  </li>
            <li>far as effectiveness goes, I find the shave to be a close as any electric I‚Äôve tried‚Äî</li>
            <li>but since the station is meant to store the shaver when not in use, this is no trouble.  </li>
            <li>I found that the shaver works really well if your hair is already trimmed or short.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to men who want to shave frequently and have sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>I happen to have sensitive skin, and this shave made a difference even from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to my crummy old ones</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>I still use a manual razor to trim up sideburns, it has a trimmer built in the side, but for me it is quicker and easier to do it the old way.</li>
            <li>and I thought the cooling sensation reduced irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that it WAY outperforms my old razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately there are a couple negative aspects to this razor, but from what I hear they are an issue with most electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only real issue that might turn you off the CoolTec is the fact that the cooling element seems to overheat after about 15-20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it this far.</li>
            <li>The product also includes a docking station that cleans and charges your shaver having it ready to go for the next time you need to shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize, Braun has a real winner here and a very big product differentiator from competitors.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, but not too light.</li>
            <li>This causes me to have to go over areas multiple times and really pull the skin to get it to trim the hair.</li>
            <li>I got this as an upgrade to my old Braun Activator 8600 when its trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li>The shave is inferior to my almost 10 year old Activator 8600.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is also loud and it sounds like a trash compactor, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of irritation, WOW.  </li>
            <li>This was the first foil shaver I have used in a long time</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>What follows is a point-by-point review of this shaver, and for reference, I&#x27;ll be comparing it to my old rotary</li>
            <li>Another issue for me was the fact that it seems easier to maneuver my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>than my old electric shaver could get.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I seem to have to spend a lot of time on my neck to get it completely</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that there was no irritation or hair pulling</li>
            <li>The Razor is supposed to tell you when it needs cleaning, so far the icon has turned on after every use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Evidently this shaver is not designed to deal with longer hair, with the exception of the trimmer on the back, but I was not going to use that on my whole face.</li>
            <li>found the low temperature feature to really facilitate shaving.</li>
            <li>I recieved my kit and was taken back by just how much Braun provided in the package.  </li>
            <li>For someone like myself by that has sensitive neck skin</li>
            <li>The old Braun 8985 allows me to do this</li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t cut the hair very well, and I keep flipping between the trimmer in the back and the front blades to try to get it.</li>
            <li>As far as the CoolTec technology goes, I could take it or leave it.</li>
            <li>like I feel with my old electric razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is completely</li>
            <li>BUT since we have the cleaning system to fall back on every once in a while, I don&#x27;t worry as much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use an electric too often, but my old Norelco just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it any longer for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out went the Norelco, and the Braun is now making its home near my sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it on three trips so far and haven&#x27;t been concerned with it breaking.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I was quite surprised with all that came with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for the last 8 years and really like the brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will completely give up my manual razor</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d probably give 3.5 stars instead of 4 just for how long it took me to shave, but this product does exactly what it states it&#x27;s going to do and worked very well.</li>
            <li>It allows me to shave while doing another task if I am in a big hurry getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li>It was very soothing to the my skin and definitely helped with razor burn.</li>
            <li>So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another Braun razor, because I really like them, a different model</li>
            <li>Was given this as a early birthday gift.</li>
            <li>This shaver let&#x27;s me hit the big areas fast</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Braun CoolTec for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the blades are breaking in or my skin and the razor are becoming friends,</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to razor burn, I would say yes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>second time I tried it - I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days, which was reasonable for using a machine.</li>
            <li>I immediately tested it out and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It really struggles to get neck hairs on only 24 hours of not shaving.  </li>
            <li>Since I was in college, in the early 1990&#x27;s, I have used blade razors.  </li>
            <li>I still have and works my 8 year old Braun 7526 which kills this model.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as a razor.  </li>
            <li>I was provided this shaver by Braun to test in early November and have been using now for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>shaver charge lasted nearly 7 days using the CoolTec functionality for all the shaves.  </li>
            <li>It is so loud that I won&#x27;t use it early in the morning for fear that I will wake up my wife.  </li>
            <li>My razor was cleaned, charged, and ready to go the next morning after setting it up.</li>
            <li>This is by far the nicest shaver I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>It has some weight to it but its not heavy.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is need of an electric shaver who wants to have a clean-shaven look in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect can really be felt and while you are shaving it puts you under the notion that you aren&#x27;t irritated but as soon as you are done the itch and redness come back.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to really compare it to because I have not used shaving lotion with my last Braun razor.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and struggle to find an electric razor that both leaves me with a close shave and without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I got the cooltec shaver system a few weeks ago for free through the braun program and have been using it exclusively since.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, what can I say, I am a sensitive guy.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn like I do with my old one.</li>
            <li>I know that I‚Äôm not going to get anywhere near a cartridge razor shave with an electric, but this wasn‚Äôt close to acceptable.</li>
            <li>I have had an old shaver for quite sometime</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t grow facial hair exceptionally fast.  </li>
            <li>I went 3 days without shaving, and it took me about 15 minutes to complete my shave...</li>
            <li>and you have to change the plane of your shaving frequently in order to get those stubborn whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is nicer than the run-of-the-mill Braun, quieter, and faster.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cooling feature it definitely helps keep my face from getting irritated.</li>
            <li>I got a close shave with out razor burn which often happpens to my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Close shave - by far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I told my brother about it since we both have the sensitive skin issue and I am waiting to hear how he likes it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would completely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, A+ on the cooling action, but just a B on the shave.</li>
            <li>My old electric razor just yanked out the hair</li>
            <li>but my old razor was thrown out.</li>
            <li>consider myself very picky about my shave, especially on my head</li>
            <li>I received this razor directly from Bruan in a marketing campaign.</li>
            <li>As this is my first electric razor that has had a cleaning AND charging station in one, I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I can say that it works extremely well and seems to keep the blades sharp and it definitely keeps the razor in top working order because of its cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would try this razor again if Braun fixed it</li>
            <li>The CoolTech ranks up there with my Series 7 and maybe even above my Series 7 (at a much lower price</li>
            <li>I have had an old Braun for about 5 years</li>
            <li>I do find that it takes a longer time to complete my shave than if I use a manual razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the cooling on the razor.  </li>
            <li>only reason I give this razor 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 is because the trimmer attachment leaves MUCH to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Always have a break out after shaving because of sensitive skin but with this it has not been an issue at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys electric shavers, but has sensitive skin or breaks.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back and forth with straight razors vs electric</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to work around your skin for coverage and a complete shave.</li>
            <li>My Adam&#x27;s Apple stick out fairly far</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the unit and between the old experience and now this improved experience...</li>
            <li>So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>The cooling kicked in almost immediately and provided a marked difference to the feel of the shaver against my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very pricey and not up to standard.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether or not its worth the extra money for cooling technology that I don&#x27;t actually need.  </li>
            <li>So I think the razor is not cutting as deep as my regular razor is.</li>
            <li>Awesome sleek look of the shaver while seated in the base.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want or need poorly made tools and was thrilled upon opening this gift to find a well built machine.</li>
            <li>The initial shave, after trimming my beard down took a really long time compared to a safety razor, but subsequent shaves were really good and didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charge and clean station has only a power connection and a single button that activates the cleaning</li>
            <li>I had a full beard, so I used the built-in trimmer to bring my beard down to stubble.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the stubble down, and it leaves my skin feeling cool and soothed afterward.</li>
            <li>The shaver is completely clean without any mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the shaver also comes with a little brush and a sturdy shaver-shaped travel case which is handy in avoiding getting hair &#x27;crumbs&#x27; on other toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the razor, but it was not strong enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new CoolTec shaver does offer a small light on the shaver that indicates when it needs cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I currently have a series 7 Braun razor that I normally use but have put that aside to test this new razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something about the cooling technology just works better, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>This also makes shaving right under my nose more difficult.</li>
            <li>Its so insanely easy to use, and requires very little effort to upkeep.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a smooth face and doesn&#x27;t leave any redness behind, all thanks to the active cooling technology.</li>
            <li>Its head does not swivel (which is a downside as discussed later), but it is quite easily to manipulate up and down the face and into those nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>I normally use just regular disposable shavers, and although im not a huge fan of electric shavers, I was excited to try the new Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but unless there is some catastrophically epic failure then I&#x27;ve likely found my new favorite shaver!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close electric shave while keeping your skin free of bumps from irritation of other electric razors.</li>
            <li>For the first shave, I did what the instructions suggested and did a completely dry shave.</li>
            <li>The cooltec does not get as close of a shave, the trimmer is in a odd position, and the while it does cool</li>
            <li>The cool tech make the shave have less irritation</li>
            <li>This is pretty minor though since the overall shave feels better with the CoolTec technology, and any irritation I had in the past is gone.</li>
            <li>so if this new system causes me less irritation than it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it‚Äôs not due for a cleaning, the charging station is even smaller and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few different brands of electric razors in the past, including other Braun razors, but this system has by far impressed me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as my other razor</li>
            <li>It has a very small cooling surface, so in my case, it wasn&#x27;t able to keep up with the heat put out by my water.  </li>
            <li>No mess no fuss.</li>
            <li>shaver provides the same above average closeness as many high-end systems but, there was literally zero irritation.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Cooltec to anyone, especially to men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe these style shavers work for some guys, but for me, a high quality 3 head lift and cut would be my second choice (old school lather and blade razor</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a foil razor and as such comes pretty close to a clean shave, but there was still a little bit of stubble left despite the direction or number of times</li>
            <li>It is not the same plastic that the shaver uses and the putting the cleaning solution in the base can be a pain because the solution container has large openings at the top so it tens to spill easy while taking the old out and putting the new in.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, you&#x27;re instructed to clean via an included cleaning kit.</li>
            <li>the only thing I could complain about the product are it does not do as decent of a job on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>The 7000 side was all red and the CoolTec was a cool pink and no redness at all.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not typically an electric shaver type of person.  </li>
            <li>The contrast of the hot shower and the nice cold bar made shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li>That first instant of cooling on your face was different...</li>
            <li>With sensitive skin that usually dries out with shaving, the cooltec system allows me to get a close, comfortable shave without the irritation.  </li>
            <li>the Braun CoolTec is a decent shaver system, but I probably would not buy it for the price it currently being sold for.</li>
            <li>The cooling part keeps me from becoming irritated for sure, which would make the experience significantly worse, but having to cover the same spots multiple times makes for a long shave.</li>
            <li>main thing I like about the CoolTec shaver over a traditional cartridge shaver is it seems to be a bit quicker.</li>
            <li>Overall is a decent razor and cleaner than using a manual razor.</li>
            <li>so I usually end up going back to clippers pretty quick after trying a razor, and just forgetting about a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I continue let me say that, I work in the spa industry and am fully aware of all thing steps need before shaving, I am a mix race hispanic/african american male with, medium course hair.</li>
            <li>However, I cleaned it again after my first use and the next time I shaved with it, there was no fluid leaking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I have used it for the past several weeks and as an electric razor, this is top notch.</li>
            <li>I used the big holder on my counter top and kept the small one for travel.</li>
            <li>And the cleaning process itself, while quick, is a little loud.</li>
            <li>The charger also contains alcohol based fluid to keep it clean which other razors can not say that.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend the Braun CoolTek Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li>I personally think its high time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, though, I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who uses electric razors regularly or is looking to try one out.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this razor, as I received it as part of a program run by Braun, and it came through on some and fell short on others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you have any type of irritation or redness while shaving.</li>
            <li>The new CoolTec shaver is a recharging nearly self cleaning gadget with a cooling plate above and below the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>There was definitely an adjustment period for me when it came to switching from my old rotary shaver to this new one.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to electric shavers after nearly 30 years of shaving with various Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li>(how many times in your life are you in the market for a new electric razor?), but this could indeed be a game changer for</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a definite huge upgrade from my previous electric shaver and will make me ditch my razors.</li>
            <li>It felt great and seemed like it was heck of a lot less irritating.</li>
            <li>I like that you can use it wet or dry and truly enjoy the fact that it cools as it shaves.  </li>
            <li>(strange).&lt;br /&gt;Charging time was surprisingly fast, straight out of the box it has no jiuce, and about a half hour on the charger</li>
            <li>It did a much better job of close shaving if used every day but did have a tough time (as expected) with dealing with a weeks worth of scruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been using the new CoolTec shaver for the past three weeks to get thru the initial stage, as most shavers requires some time to adjust to your specific skin and hair type.</li>
            <li>Since I frequently use safety razors, I&#x27;m used to getting right down close to the skin.</li>
            <li>The bar is cool to the skin, but not enough to make it feel unpleasant, it cools the skin as it shaves it and gives it a nice relaxing feeling to wake you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much to shave since I grow a beard, so I would expect it not to take that long to shave my face.</li>
            <li>I really like how close of a shave I can get with this system as well, it&#x27;s as close as a blade shave as long as you maintain,</li>
            <li>My facial hair is very think and coarse and combine that with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It can take me 3-4 times as long to get all the hair removed as opposed to just using my straight razor.</li>
            <li>but I was never able to get a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally just use a razor but that I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different shavers and blades and normally end up with an irritated spot on my neck.  </li>
            <li>But the shave was pretty close, just not as close as I expected.</li>
            <li>One last thing, it didn&#x27;t seem to be any quicker than my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious though how this shaver feels once hot in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I normally shave with a traditional razor 2) I have owned and used 2 electric razors in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive used the Braun Cooltec a few times already, which I had received from Braun through a promotional campaign, which admittedly has been tricky since I have decided to go beard/scruff for a while, and grooming my neck/jawline is simply easier with a more traditional grooming tool and a Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a few stragglers, but that is true when using any electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar does take extra space in the unit&#x27;s head, so the foils are noticeably further apart than my other foil shaver, which is fine on the face and neck, but</li>
            <li>The razor definitely feels cool against the face while shaving but not very cool.</li>
            <li>This was just the right side, so now I had to see if it would hold the same performance for the left side and front neck area on the same charge.</li>
            <li>I usually only use electric shavers and I have to sometimes go over certain hairs several times to get them.</li>
            <li>but I expected it to work a little better than it did.</li>
            <li>The shaver gets a close enough shave that it feels smooth going with the grain, but you can feel a little stubble going against the grain of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall it isn&#x27;t that bad the cooling is also pretty neat its worth giving it a shot for sure</li>
            <li>only drawback was that it seems the product did not have super sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Is there any way I could send this one back and get a new one?  </li>
            <li>He works on them and drop kicks them into functioning one last time for about a year and then gives in to a new purchase.</li>
            <li>With the new CoolTec technology, I can finally get a close shave without my skin feeling like it&#x27;s on fire.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a new Braun CoolTec Shaver as part of a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes a solid product and this new unit feels just a rugged.</li>
            <li>I was checking several times a day to receive the new state-of-the-art product.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun electric shaver for several years now, so when offered the opportunity to participate in a trial program for some new technology</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, the Braun CoolTec would definitely be my suggestion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this shaver 2-3 times a week for the last 3 weeks I have formed a new opinion.</li>
            <li>Well, after finally deciding to get a new Braun shaver I ended up settling with the Cooltec.</li>
            <li>I recently got to try out the new Braun Cooltec shaver.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs not so big that it takes over my sink space, but the foil and blades come out like new each time.</li>
            <li>Because of the new CoolTec razor, I can leave for work in the morning knowing that I don&#x27;t have those red streaks to hide on my neck nor</li>
            <li>The cooling feature works well  and is new and different.</li>
            <li>It took a month for my facial hair to become accustomed to the new razor.  </li>
            <li>He had a lot of trouble with patchy red blotches on his skin with his old razor, probably skin fungus because there was no way to really clean the razor heads.  </li>
            <li>The unit has a pretty long charge life, and as such travels well.  </li>
            <li>I found myself going over the same spot multiple times and having to really stretch my skin to get some hairs.</li>
            <li>facial hair and this razor would not cut it very well and it was definitely a close shave.</li>
            <li>I thought this may have happened because my hair was too long the first time I tried the shaver out, but each time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem.</li>
            <li>The shaver effortlessly performed the same way through out my whole face and neck, shaving off all my beard hair and giving me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>It totally eliminated that irritation I would get on my neck is gone, and at the same time, I also get a much closer shave than ever</li>
            <li>It dealt with a few days of stubble with no issue, and left me silky smooth, which quite frankly I was suprised at.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was completely amazed with the quality of shave and ease of use of the Braun CoolTec shaver and my expectations, low as they were, were far exceeded.  </li>
            <li>I couldn‚Äôt really afford to spend this extra time in the mornings before work, especially when the results were subpar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY</li>
            <li>their circular cutting head does a far superior job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The actual foil shavers are spaced very far apart in comparison to series 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, especially on my neck</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to leave it to (ironically) cool down after that before you can get the cooling benefit back.</li>
            <li>the shave is comparable to the Braun 8985 with the main difference being that the head is large and spread out due to the cooling bar in the middle.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t awful, but really extended the shaving session and mitigated theconvenience of shaving without a sink full of water.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean light.</li>
            <li>Cheeks, the broad strokes of your neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a major plus in my book.  </li>
            <li>The CoolTec system definitely helped to reduce that irritation, considerably!  </li>
            <li>Not like other electric shavers that leave the skin feeling hot.  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily and have tried other Braun products in the past, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and normally use a different Braun cordless shaver since a standard razor irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was immediately evident that the manufacturer has observed problems with other razors and has systematically attempted to solve them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often times I have had problems with skin irritation whether I used a manual or electric razor, shaving cream or gel, hot water, or any other method to minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>amazing battery on the CoolTec means you only have to charge it for less than an hour once a week in a funky little charging stand that comes with</li>
            <li>My face stayed cool during my entire shave and I felt less itchiness and redness when I was finished.</li>
            <li>I first used the CoolTec razor, the cooling bar took a few moments to cool down.  </li>
            <li>Overall the shave base is nice in that my sink real estate is saved a bit by sprawling cords and shaver parts drying all over the place, and I feel the investment is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>Right out of the package you can tell that this is not your typical electric razor.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to try something new, have sensitive skin, or hair that grows in a lot of different directions, this one is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li>For me, around a buck a week is a small price to pay for a clean, sanitized razor every day.</li>
            <li>For me, around a buck a week is a small price to pay for a clean, sanitized razor every day.</li>
            <li>If you have used an electric shaver in the past, you know it can sometimes have a funky smell you have to clean with vinegar, not this one.  </li>
            <li>decent: the long hair trimmer leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>I think this is just a minor inconvenience to deal with seeing how cool the razor stays and how I don&#x27;t get the irritation like I did from my other shaver.</li>
            <li>It seemed to take much longer for a typical shave, but was this because this was just a new shaver that I wasn&#x27;t used</li>
            <li>The cooling bar takes a little while to reach 44 degrees, but once it does it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>The thing that I really did like was the active cooling technology that the razor offers.</li>
            <li>Form fitting, tough.  </li>
            <li>It works, feels nice, and the base keeps the razor clean and lubricated for you every morning.  </li>
            <li>My only negative is that, like with many other shavers, it was very tricky getting some of those pesky hairs that refused to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face grows very thickly, and the hair grows in more than one direction.</li>
            <li>My old Braun razor gave me a clean, close shave even if I skipped a few days of shaving; with the CoolTec I have to shave everyday or it becomes a real</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>That being said, there definitely some clear pros and cons that I&#x27;ll outline for</li>
            <li>This razor is very efficient as long as you take your time to hit all areas of your face multiple times.</li>
            <li>To be clear, the cleaning station DOES have a latch, but the smaller charging station DOES NOT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>note that because it comes with the cleaning solution, you apparently cannot return this to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a guy with sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t say enough about this CoolTec system.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no irritation and a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The Cooltec shaver does offer a cooling feature that you can feel, though it didn&#x27;t seem to help with my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I eventually reverted back to my old shaver and I&#x27;m sticking with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried my old razor the next day just to see the difference</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a quality shaver with a neat cooling action and closeness of cut isn&#x27;t critical</li>
            <li>had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to my old razor for now.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, you should definitely try the Braun CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li>but since I knew it was coming and was on vacation, decided to let my facial hair be wild for a week or so.</li>
            <li>I spent so much time trying to contort my face to work the razor into all the areas.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how close the shave actually got.  </li>
            <li>Feel soft yet solid when shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes for one of the only electric shavers today tailor made for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li>I have never spent a lot of money on shavers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  apparently the rechargeable battery is the reason it cannot be returned, but Amazon&#x27;s customer service contacted me about a resolution.  </li>
            <li>My old razor could only be rinsed off, which</li>
            <li>The manual was not organized very well, and not much help.</li>
            <li>I put the shaver to use and was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the cooltec tecnology actually worked.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, never really having used an electric shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Electric Razors since my teen years, when my beard was weaker and technologies not so well developed.</li>
            <li>I still feel a barely noticeable stubble.</li>
            <li>I have Very coarse beard hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;ve spent much of my life trying razor after razor and shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun (twice).</li>
            <li>It solves multiple problems, especially for frequent travelers and those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the shaver initially when I first felt it because the sensation was not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Normally in the past I have had shavers that leave my face feeling hot or almost burned</li>
            <li>At first I thought my face was wet, but it was actually just the cooling feature.</li>
            <li>From my first use, I noticed that the irritation was minimal and it has only improved.  </li>
            <li>I am able to achieve a close shave without irritating  myself.  </li>
            <li>I received the cool tec razor a few weeks back from a program run by braun</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great smooth shave with zero razor burn, but can be slow at times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great smooth shave with zero razor burn, but can be slow at times.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling element that keeps your skin cool as you shave thus reducing the irritation and redness that my past shavers have caused.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one more reason for a poor rating.  </li>
            <li>Sad to say it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would in the shower, it didn&#x27;t get as close as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this out with a variety of stubble from the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow to a few days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>The razor does not come with a plastic shield over the foil, which I would have liked to have included, as foils and cutters are so expensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad shaver overall, just a few things to improve on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through multiple electric shavers since my first shaver was handed down to me from my dad when my beard just started coming in at the ripe old age of 8...</li>
            <li>While it did cut most of the hairs, it did leave a few stubborn hairs that were laying down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending back under the 60 day money back guarantee and will be ordering a new Series 7.</li>
            <li>After  a month or so ill update post  a new review and see if I have been able to iron out these</li>
            <li>After  a month or so ill update post  a new review and see if I have been able to iron out these</li>
            <li>The 60-day money back guarantee sold me, I figured I could just get my money back when it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Instructions are a bit confusing for an old guy like me but are adequate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sleek Design, easy to hold and love the charging base</li>
            <li>I have got a quick growing dark beard with a lot of grey.  </li>
            <li>The cooling bar is pretty cool and helps to some degree, but I find that other Braun models - such as the Series 7 - achieve the same or similar results with less</li>
            <li>After using the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System I will be using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Lots of blotches and some bleeding, even after a few weeks, lead me to think that this product just isn&#x27;t right for</li>
            <li>I also have trouble with it shaving right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>First, the trimmer is not very strong</li>
            <li>Majority of those previous opinions changed the first time I fired up my Braun CoolTec</li>
            <li>The shave is less than stellar.  </li>
            <li>It actually gives you a pretty close shave without the pulling I&#x27;ve gotten from other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I would personally recommend looking at other brands for a razor first.  </li>
            <li>Having used their electric shavors before, regularly in the past, I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>This was better than almost every other razor I used in the past.</li>
            <li>The Razer didn&#x27;t clean very well within the charger station and when I shaved with it it would regularly leave behind longer hairs.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very very cold while it shaves, which makes it infinitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It really provides a close shave and the cooling feeling while shaving seems to reduce the irritation I am used to experiencing from other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy with this shaver, very solid non-slip grip, battery last a long time with out charging, charger and cleaner</li>
            <li>Comparatively this razor shaved to a much smoother level than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Gillette Fusion is gets me a much closer shave and my other electric shaver is still closer then the CoolTec.</li>
            <li>the cleaning/charging station really makes the product stand out in comparison to other razors I‚Äôve used.  </li>
            <li>then maybe they can make the center cutter the cooling bar (i.e. cool the center cutter) to keep the shaver head as compact as possible.    </li>
            <li>Green when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;d had that shaver so long I have been a big fan of Braun and had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>It makes a strange high pitched squeal when the razor is left in it, so we&#x27;ve taken to either unplugging it or leaving the razor off the dock.</li>
            <li>all in one space saving, the ice cold feature just a press of a button and activate almost instantly, it does get really cold, love the feature that it have and combine together really well, but one thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t work very if the beard gets a little longer, and it still left over little bit of hair that it didn&#x27;t catch which i have to use my old fashion shaver to finish the job (no big deal, it still catches 99% of it), but over all great shaver!</li>
            <li>trimmer is very narrow, and without being able to tilt the head out of the way, difficult to use precisely.  </li>
            <li>But overall I benefit so much from the cooling of the CoolTec that this is my new everyday shaver.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be more awkward and less comfortable and seems to take longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors since I have a thick, coarse beard.  </li>
            <li>The old foils still work, but I need a trimmer to really hit some of the trouble spots.    </li>
            <li>only negative comment I have about the unboxing was that the instructions weren&#x27;t super clear.</li>
            <li>I am a younger guy (in my 20&#x27;s) and do have fairly sensitive skin so the cooling bar definitely got my attention.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this to our 14-year old son, who is starting to shave regularly himself.</li>
            <li>I currently have a Braun shaver that is over ten yrs old and is still going.  </li>
            <li>I have brushed from old razors but this would be a bigger deal</li>
            <li>burn which to me is a big plus, and therefore I would recommend it to a person that has the same problem with razor burn or just doesn&#x27;t have to shave as frequently as I.</li>
            <li>These things don&#x27;t provide a totally bald shave but that microscopic hair that is left is feathery soft.</li>
            <li>This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and it blows my old one out of the water.</li>
            <li>just never really got close enough for my liking or really irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I usually suffer from razor burn, so the Cool Tech is a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li>The cleansing solution is more antiseptic than &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34;, so if that&#x27;s important, then the base will benefit you.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning station does all the cleaning for you, and everyday my shaver smells and operates like it&#x27;s fresh out of the hygienic shaver factory back in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>loved that the Cooling bar was cold instantly.</li>
            <li>cooling bar definitely works and added a level of refreshing comfort to my skin which I had never experienced before.</li>
            <li>I think I‚Äôm just one of those men who prefers a classic wet shave with shaving lotion and a manual razor.</li>
            <li>I keep a mustache and a goatee, but there are certain spots that need to be shaved around both areas that were a little more difficult using the new shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a little weird at first as it goes through several cleaning cycles, but the result is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor so getting used to it and the cool sensation was a little weird at first</li>
            <li>(This is a big pain point of mine, the Norelco leaves my neck completely red and itchy, and it still doesn&#x27;t get the hair very well because the grain on the right side of my neck goes a different direction and is really hard to get without the ProGlide.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference compared to what I was no traditional</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them in the past, and I love the mobility of them but for some reason I usually drift back towards a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>Certainly is no closer than an older Panasonic shaver i have.</li>
            <li>It does provide a clean, close shave without skin irritation provided that you remember to shave everyday and do not let your facial hair get too long.</li>
            <li>When I was shaving my upper lip, I was only using the top blade which took a little longer than with my previous razor.</li>
            <li>If I have a special event on a saturday, I literally would not shave for at least 4 days and then just before I put on my shirt and headed out the door</li>
            <li>I generally have problems with electric shavers, both due to my sensitive skin and the difficulties in truly keeping them clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t usually purchase one but for this was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer extension is a little smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my last one.</li>
            <li>would say that I have medium-thickness facial hair, at least enough to need to shave every day, or occasionally get away with waiting 2 days, as well as slightly sensitive skin, and this razor system has kept me looking clean and without irritation for over a month now.</li>
            <li>Compared to a Series 7 the results are similar, but because the Series 7 has a faster motor, less passes are required, although this benefit also comes at the expense of higher prices.</li>
            <li>If you happened to forget to charge it after your last use it only takes a few minutes to charge if you only need it for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor handle itself has been slimmed down from previous models making it comfortable to hold and manipulate around the curves your face.</li>
            <li>The cold feeling the razor gives off is actually quite intense, and much more noticeable than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Braun CoolTec Shaver is for someone who has sensitive skin, not thick facial hair or has more time patience to shave and would like to save the money spent on disposable expensive blades.</li>
            <li>The first trial run was on my face (2 days of growth) and cleaned up all, except the small patches near my jaw, with ease and only took about 5-6 min.  </li>
            <li>Also, apparently, this shaver is the only shaver accredited by the Skin Health Alliance (whatever that is)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my receipt of this product happens to coincide with Movember - a time where I am not shaving to support men&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten rid of my old shaver and will be using this one for a long time.</li>
            <li>my upper lip just about every time I use it if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>First off, I received the CoolTec through a Braun promotion and figured I&#x27;d use if for a few weeks and see how it went.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it took getting used to</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to get this item as I was growing tired of my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li>A small bottle to refill it i feel would be both environmentally and economically</li>
            <li>The cooltec aspect is pretty gimmicky -</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that the trimmer part could not also be cleaned, as that was the part of the razor that I probably got the most use out of, and was therefore the &amp;#34;dirtiest,&amp;#34; but there is no actual physical way for the cleaning station to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>simply because they seem to have made my everyday life much easier, less messy, more hygienic, cleaner and</li>
            <li>As I use the cooling function intermittently, I can&#x27;t speak to how much it runs down the charge compared to not using</li>
            <li>I tried all sort of techniques like going in a circular formation, straight up and down, etc.  </li>
            <li>Get a really close shave and absolutely NO burn !!</li>
            <li>first off the opening of the box and seeing all the parts was a little bit intimidating, but after glancing at the instructions putting it together and had it working properly in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>&quot; feature instantly activates the cool strip in between the two (2) cutting elements, which actually provides a soothing, cool feeling on your skin during the shave.</li>
            <li>So my expectations were not very high for this shaver, but I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This should be moved and also hold tighter since the power cord is not very long and any pull of the cord, pulls the cord</li>
            <li>After the month I found it easier to use the shaver to shave the main majority of my facial hair and then switch a disposable razor or a straight razor to finish up the hard shave areas.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Remington shaver, and cleaning was more tedious due to the way the motor assembly attached to the shaver head, and it really tore up my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little confused in the beginning with the metal part in between the razor but its a plus to have it makes my skin feel nice and cool and not hot like other shavers.</li>
            <li>My wife bought me this Braun as a gift, not realizing my history with lift and cut razors or that I had just spent money on a new one that I was keeping at work as a back-up.  </li>
            <li>Also the trimmer is easily utilzed and easier to get into the tight little lip crevaces that larger razor and trimmers have issues with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall minuses would be: non rotating/tilting head makes shaving more difficult and takes more time due to having to go over certain spots over and over again, razor doesn&#x27;t begin to cool down without having to turn the whole thing on which in the car makes things more difficult and the case doesn&#x27;t allow room for charger cord and base.</li>
            <li>and I typically wait 1-2 weeks between cleanings so that I do not use up too much of the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>I will admit, the razor gives you a very close shave, but there is typically a lot of pain involved in the process.</li>
            <li>My previous model was a Toni &amp; Guy that I picked up in Europe - it went straight in the wastebin once I tried the Braun CoolTec.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Currently swear by the Braun 8985 shaver (with the old \\&quot;skinny bladed\\&quot; cutter block refills) whose life expectancy is long overdue.  </li>
            <li>main selling point of the CoolTech is that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;World&#x27;s 1st shaver with active cooling technology\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The razor I have used for the past few years came with the comodity as well, but to have become acustomed to the cleaning system I&#x27;m glad that the Braun CoolTec shaver does as well.</li>
            <li>The shave was not the closest shave I have ever had, but using the Braun Cooltec shaver is definitely worth it for me since it soothed that swollen, irritated feeling I usually have after shaving with traditional shavers.</li>
            <li>Just a simple click of a button, and the cooling bar is activated, cooling down to a 44 degree mark, and provides a very soothing effect during my shaving activities.  </li>
            <li>I also wish that you could begin cooling down the razor without actually having to turn the whole thing on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Braun CoolTec Shaving system will not completely replace other methods of shaving for me, but it certainly does enhance the experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d venture to say that its specifically responsible for my skin not being an irritated mess after I&#x27;m done shaving.  </li>
            <li>in all, I am a big fan of Braun electric razors (have used the 360 Complete 8985 for about 5 years and the 790cc for the past 3 or so), but those razors just shave so much closer than this model.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to other men who haven‚Äôt had much success with other electric shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shaving with my normal razor, I came back in a couple of days to try the Cooltec again, this time with only minimal stubble.</li>
            <li>several times and when you are first starting you may find a few straggling hairs.</li>
            <li>so I figured why not - from the first time I used this shaver I knew it was different - it seriously was cool to the skin the entire shave (which was kind of odd, but not in a bad way) - I completely shaved and no irritation.</li>
            <li>It really works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I am rather hairy and my facial hair grows quickly and rather thick.</li>
            <li>Very unhappy after all the great things I heard.</li>
            <li>The shave went relatively fast and I did not find myself needing to go over many areas repeatedly, except for a few small trouble areas.  </li>
            <li>So I thought maybe my facial hair was oily, since it was in the middle of the afternoon when I shaved instead of right after a shower like I usually do.  </li>
            <li>The other thing that I&#x27;m not keen on is how long the cleaning solution lasts, how much it costs and how it is refilled.</li>
            <li>The primary issue I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past was extreme irritation.  </li>
            <li>only negative comment I have about the razor is that with the cooling bar in the middle, the 2 blades are pretty far apart and the head is quite larger than my 9595.</li>
            <li>At the sink was fine, but still a bit irritating.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get everything with just an electric razor (I usually go over it with a manual one after), but it does just as good as any other I have tried out.  </li>
            <li>I have some pretty long, tough beard hair and the long hair trimmer didn&#x27;t seem big enough, nor powerful enough to make any headway.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the little travel shaver stand was a neat idea along with the very sturdy case for your shaver.  </li>
            <li>the shave I&#x27;ve gotten from the Braun razor has been a very close shave with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>The new CoolTec system is unlike any other shaver I have seen.</li>
            <li>It was tough to get it smooth but the cooltec kept me from getting irritated which meant I could use it every morning without issue.</li>
            <li>What happened next was somewhat unexpected, but also mixed a slew of positive and negative factors for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a slight oddity in that Braun has designed this with the shaver at an angle when cleaning/charging (I believe to allow for the cleaning solution to drain from the shaver more efficiently) that does mean you may have to occasionally reposition the shaver to get the shaver charging.  </li>
            <li>My hair was a little long on my face the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Also, the razor is a bit big and bulky and a little bit much to conveniently hold and maneuver around your face while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the lubricants undo the harm my hard water does to the razor as long as I run it though a full rinse cycle every couple of weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>My neck is very sensitive has gotten irritated with other electric razors.</li>
            <li>This can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  </li>

            <li> The cooling sensation it leaves on your skin when you shave is awesome and feels good.  </li>
            <li> It has great precision, feels great on my face, and even the cleaning system works great.</li>
            <li> Pound and wasn&#x27;t happy with the shave</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did a great job.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec shaver gives a great shave and the cooling bar</li>
            <li> feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> It works great, gives me one of the closest shaves for an electric shaver and looks great on the counter.</li>
            <li> That in itself is a great feature.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is also a great feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great shaver for those people who are looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but once it did, it provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> (I have used it in the shower with great results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great for gym bag or something like that.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation works great while shaving with the CoolTec on.</li>
            <li> Now the razor is great, but takes up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> The cleaner works great.</li>
            <li> Over all i used it all the time and the shaver is a great buy.</li>

            <li> The clipper side just isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> When you are shaving with out the CoolTec feature activated the battery life is 45 minutes which is great.</li>

            <li> After using the Braun CoolTec, I havent experienced any irritation.</li>

            <li> Now that I have experienced the CoolTec feature, I don&#x27;t want to give it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The built in charger and cleaning system does a great job of taking the hassle out of shaving.  </li>

            <li> I get a great shave.</li>
            <li> The cooling does make a noticeable difference and feels great on my face.</li>

            <li> The cooling effect is great</li>

            <li> Got mine from a program run by Braun, and so happy i did.  </li>
            <li> In the shower the shave was great.</li>
            <li> What a great idea.</li>
            <li> and it felt great on my face.  </li>
            <li> ¬∞CoolTec function is great.  </li>
            <li> On my face, the razor works great and provides a shave comparable to the Series 7 and a cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I am certainly happy that I have made the switch to the CoolTec</li>
            <li> The CoolTec experience is like nothing that I have experienced before from a shaving system.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for even weekend trips away from home.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but it felt great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatically cleaning station is great.  </li>
            <li> this truly is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However from a shaver perspective I gotta say it was alright.</li>
            <li> on my face it worked well gave a great</li>
            <li> Braun has come out with a great product and it is working great for me.</li>
            <li> I work varying hours and using this product has been great.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric razor.</li>

            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aesthetically, the razor looks great.</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and cleaning system does a great job cleaning the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> It felt great.</li>
            <li> Having everything all together and organized in the station is  great.</li>
            <li> All in all, the cooling technology was a great idea</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> It provides a great shave, and immediately starts cooling once it&#x27;s turned on.  </li>
            <li> So when I heard that this razor would greatly reduce this</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy that I had the opportunity to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think it make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the result I got from this razor.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great</li>
            <li> it is a great shaver would recommend.</li>
            <li> But anyway the product is great.</li>
            <li> it gives a great shave</li>
            <li> I am so thankful to have been able to try this razor!!</li>
            <li> The razor does a very nice job and the CoolTec cooling bar</li>
            <li> did a very nice job soothing my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice to just place the shaver in the cleaner</li>
            <li> I have to say that on a day to day basis, this thing works very nicely.</li>
            <li> The included travel case/charging adapter were very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CoolTec feature is a very nice sensation.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect comes in very handy when I go on a shaving holiday.</li>
            <li> cleaning and charging station is very nice.</li>
            <li> the cooling technology is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice looking unit, the dock solves the problem of where to store the shaver</li>
            <li> The &#x27;CoolTec&#x27; feature is very nice.</li>
            <li> What most impressed me about the Braun CoolTec was how great the shaver felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Good shave, takes a while, not the best on the neck, like the cool shave bar in the razor probably the best feature of the razor.</li>
            <li> all it was just an okay razor, but not the best out there.</li>
            <li> and it provides a good shave, so I am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is without a doubt, the most awesome shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I feel like the razor is so much more sanitary with the awesome cleaning system it uses.  </li>
            <li> As with any shaver, there are good things and not so great things about the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price point, I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money for this razor even though it&#x27;s really nice to get as a gift!</li>
            <li> I have used many Braun&#x27;s including the Series 7, which I feel is still the best Braun available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how the razor cleans itself, and the travel case will come in handy this Christmas!  </li>
            <li> best part was the automatic cleaning mode did a outstanding job cleaning the blade...</li>
            <li> After having the Braun CoolTec System for over a week I&#x27;m more impressed with it&#x27;s capabilities.</li>
            <li> I feel that the shave was good, but the I still experienced razor burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor for a couple weeks now, I am thrilled with its quality and ability!  </li>
            <li> I always have issues with getting me neck just the way I want and with this razor I was able to get it the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a very nice shaver and the cooltec makes for a good feature and experience.</li>
            <li> I use the cleaning station after immediately after every shave and find it does an excellent job at removing hair from the razor and keeping it very clean and</li>
            <li> razor has a very sleek design, the cooling bar is awesome and the housing kit is perfect</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cools your face as you shave, creating a really pleasant experience when you groom.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice</li>
            <li> Very glad to have the opportunity to try this great razor.  </li>
            <li> It feels good, shaves close, and even comes with its own cleaning/charging station!</li>
            <li> It has excellent craftsmanship - extremely easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver was extremely easy, and have the cleaning cradle was awesome as well.</li>
            <li> It makes the shaving experience so much more pleasant!</li>
            <li> and I must say this is by far the best shaver I have ever used the best feature</li>
            <li> In case you are going to be gone for a good while, the unit ships with a &amp;#34;mobile charger&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My wife is quite impressed with how smooth my face is after I finish with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for the price, it gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> It also feels good in my hand, ergonomically speaking.</li>
            <li> The razor also keeps a good charge.</li>
            <li> but I just could not get a good, even shave.</li>
            <li> product arrived in what I would call superior packaging and build quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the good.</li>
            <li> Ideally Braun will figure out a way to get this CoolTec technology into their top Series 7 shaver as an optional model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I feel good knowing the razor has a self cleaning option.</li>
            <li> but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Jumping to the point, the shaver doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately that the good also comes with some negatives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver does a nice close shave, the cooling system is a great sensation .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels good on skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> even my beloved Series 7‚Äîand</li>
            <li> The travel case is durable and provides good protection for the razor.  </li>
            <li> Which is a good thing since, in the end, i find this product to be overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> I own this razor and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I think the price is fair on this razor.  </li>
            <li> It gives my a close shave and because of the CoolTek technology, my face feels really good.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is good, although it seems to me that it is a bit pricey to use this system rather than just cleaning it out myself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar felt good on my face, when using and prevented irritation.</li>
            <li> Also the hair trimmer works great for my sideburns and keeping my mustache and goatee trimmed nicely for my wife.</li>
            <li> To give a good perspective, I have ranked them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it probably is good for maintaining the blades,</li>
            <li> blah, blah, but it felt good on my face.  </li>
            <li> The charge stays good for days, even in using the cooling technology with every shave, every day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> idea of the cleaning system is a good idea, but takes up room that I just don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> good when you haven&#x27;t shaved for a longer amount of time</li>
            <li> No need to dilute good drinks like a bourbon with ice cubes.  </li>
            <li> The electric razor alone doesn&#x27;t do a good job around my neck, and I always get razor burn.</li>
            <li> is an all around good product.</li>
            <li> Purchase this razor for yourself or a loved one and it will preform to expectations.</li>
            <li> Pro: Good for razor burns with the cooling effect.</li>
            <li> but this worked good for me.</li>
            <li> Hence, I give the product 3 stars because its a good razor</li>
            <li> give it 3/5 stars because it&#x27;s a good razor, but not something I would be bragging about to everyone.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> is good - no tugging on my skin</li>
            <li> While it was good, the price premium did not justify the added cooling and cleaning benefits.</li>
            <li> But over all it is a good razor.</li>
            <li> shave itself was not as superior however.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Features that are good about the razor:</li>
            <li> Having never been a fan of electric razors I was weary of the idea that the razor would be any good</li>
            <li> Over all a good razor.</li>
            <li> Good job Amit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slower and not as good of a shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a cleaner built into it, which does rather good.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes and is surprisingly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I want to give it 4 stars because it works good.</li>
            <li> That cooling bar just feels so good.</li>
            <li> in a good way.  </li>
            <li> All guys deal with some level of irritation after shaving and this adaptation to the shaver does a good job combatting that issue.  </li>
            <li> and it feels really good when the coolness kicks in.  </li>
            <li> The greatest part of all is that this product was a free test that I received from Braun.</li>
            <li> and it did provide a good deal of comfort while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are also sturdy and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> CoolTec didn&#x27;t cut as good as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> All in all a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar does help sooth the skin and feels good while shaving.</li>
            <li> I suppose the pluses of this would be if you want a five o clock shadow that sort of atheistic good look to your jaw..</li>
            <li> The razor worked good in the shower and after use I just put it in the charger and it cleans itself.</li>
            <li> the Braun works good</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s an 8500 model and this does not work as good.  </li>
            <li> It does have a couple of good features.  </li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec Shaving system is a good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is really nice and works great.  </li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t the best, but it does provide a smooth, non-irritating shave.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver , I am a believer in the Braun product and will always own one .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Worked smoothly and perfectly without skin</li>
            <li> The battery life is good.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t take away from the fact that it delivered a good close</li>
            <li> Good job Braun.</li>
            <li> It hits the spot with close shave and my skin feeling good after I use it.</li>
            <li> One of the things I loved about this trimmer was the sleek look it had.</li>
            <li> Good shaving...fine days...</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as I‚Äôve been on the hunt for the best shaving solution for years.  </li>
            <li> It better be good for that price!  </li>
            <li> clean and charge station is great!</li>
            <li> like knowing my shaver is clean before each use so the Clean&amp;Charge Station was something I was really impressed with</li>
            <li> What was really awesome about this shaver is it comes with a Clean &amp; Charge station.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a month now, I have not had to clean it as the cleaning station does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although if you are using this to keep your face neat and clean - this is perfect - just not for me!</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Charge system worked perfectly and I was quite amazed to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It is awesome that this cleans itself with the Clean &amp; Charge station.</li>
            <li> Every manufacturer of electric razors claims to have the best unit when it comes to a clean shave and preventing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I just received my cooltec shaver from Braun through a special program and was instantly impressed by the look and feel of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The product looks sleek, the packaging was nice, the directions were easy to follow, and the charging station is the perfect size - not too bulky.</li>
            <li> I received this product through a program run by Braun and I have been very pleased by how good this shaver is.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s move onto the Cool Bar feature, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> A cool feeling on your face instead of a burning sensation is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was particularly impressed by how cool the shaver felt.  </li>
            <li> The cool tec feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li> all I still give it a 4 because the shave is still one of the best and the cool shave feature works</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best of all worlds would be the cool shave feature on the 790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> As a cheaper version to the series 7, this is not a bad razor at all and is a very great entry level shaver.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this device!</li>
            <li> in all, this is a great razor that gives you an all around great shave and leaves your face smooth and feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a nice light, and the bells and whistles are really impressive.  </li>
            <li> While the razor is great and also gives a great clean and close shave, I do not feel that the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; aspect is needed.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver the cooling factor is something else it truly makes for a better shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for many years and it has been great.</li>
            <li> cooltec gel feels very refreshing and clean&lt;</li>
            <li> in all I‚Äôm very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec system.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of counteracting the shaver heating up as find with most shavers.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The comfort of the styling grip was great, and the cooling sensation of the aluminum bar is even better.</li>
            <li> I was more than happy to jump in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sensation, and I really love using it.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> a great Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-term, the Clean&amp;Charge station, while providing some healthy conditioning of the shaver, is a long-term expense, too.</li>
            <li> And I am very glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very glad I didn&#x27;t buy one</li>
            <li> all I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend this to friends and family</li>
            <li> One more great thing , the shaver cleans it self and that saves a lot of time .</li>
            <li> The cut was close and the cooling part made it very comfortable!</li>
            <li> The face on my skin stayed cooler than the rest of my body which led to a very enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave on my face, but i struggle with getting a good close shave on my jawline and neck area.</li>
            <li> This one works so good and cleans so easy, no face burn or discomfort great item a must have.</li>
            <li> When I got the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System in the mail I was very excited to see how great it was going to work.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in my hands, holds a charge and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> That said, I think this was the best shave I&#x27;ve received from an electric right out of the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its great - LOVE LOVE this system!</li>
            <li> The charging station is very nice looking, and much better looking than my Series 7 unit.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec razor provided a real nice clean close shave.</li>
            <li> one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, and possibly most importantly, the CoolTec provides an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> When I first received it I was highly impressed.  </li>
            <li> , that was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a program from Braun and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> what a brilliant idea to cool the skin during the shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> The cool bar felt incredible.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> And he did and I am ok with it!</li>
            <li> The CoolTec System is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Let me start with one of the most remarkable features for me...</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The CoolTec System is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> This attempt was more successful although still had it&#x27;s share of issues.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that feature!</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to put lotion on and not have pain after!</li>
            <li> I really love my CoolTec Shaving System!</li>
            <li> The Cooling Bar is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Watching the adds for it, and reading what it can do, it sounds like a pretty awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> does its job really well too; the foil feels great after being cleaned, and on top of that it comes out smelling like lemons, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I get better at maneouvering around and also finishing my shaving sooner every time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li> Also - the cleaning basin is great and easy to operate while the unit is in it&#x27;s charging</li>
            <li> The cool tec is awesome because it keeps your skin from getting too hot/warm and more irritated.</li>
            <li> The shave is still pretty close and nice, however it is a noticeable difference compared to the best in the price</li>
            <li> First, its cooling effect is simply incredible, feels great and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li> The cool temperature feels so good on my face!  </li>
            <li> The shave that the CT5cc gave me was more than adequate, and the popup trimmer was excellent on my goatee.</li>
            <li> The best benefit for me was being able to come off after work and get a quick shave in before going out that evening.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice for the skin and is easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> This CoolTec shaver system, provided to me via a program fun by Braun to try out, does a very good job.</li>
            <li> but i really enjoy it and it leaves my face feeling great</li>
            <li> It gives me a great COMFORTABLE close shave.  </li>
            <li> it has been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The cooling mechanism is amazing,</li>
            <li> The cooling technology is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does an amazing job shaving without skin irritation&lt;</li>
            <li> My husband said the cooling feature was amazing on his face.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing and amazing in its simplicity.  </li>
            <li> The cooling element works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> The cooling technology feels absolutely amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I must be honest, it didn&#x27;t work amazingly.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The close shave that Braun CoolTec provides is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It felt amazing shaving my cheeks</li>
            <li> I have a light beard which this razor is great on.</li>
            <li> I did not feel that this razor did an amazing job shaving hair that was growing in every direction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun CoolTec is an amazing piece of technology and innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cooltec works amazing</li>
            <li> The razor itself is extremely comfortable to hold and does a great job of staying evenly pressed against my face when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, YES.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Also the cleaning/charging system, while effective, takes up a lot of space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> or my face get warm.</li>
            <li> cooling technology is fairly nice.  </li>
            <li> The hold of the razor is nice as well.  </li>
            <li> This razor is spectacular.  </li>
            <li> is the perfect gift holiday season if you want to really impress someone.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is you do not have to use the cooling technology if you chose not to.</li>
            <li> Cleaning works wonderful and is much easier than manually cleaning it.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar felt nice, minimized burn etc.</li>
            <li> Its a nice change in design which gives me another option while shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fully understand how it works, but the cooling effect is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I kind of like that</li>
            <li> Nice battery life and travel case.</li>
            <li> Again, nice materials.</li>
            <li> But it has a nice build to it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m being as honest as I can.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is nice but just like the series 7 cleaning system, they can get a expense and need replaced about once a month depending on usage.</li>
            <li> I can honestly admit that this was</li>
            <li> the docking/cleaning station is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a nice, close shave</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice close shave too.  </li>
            <li> but I think I might change to being a Braun kind of guy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like those automated car washes.</li>
            <li> With my participation in a Braun promotion, I have used the electric razor for several weeks now and would like to weigh in on whether it is a great shaver, or the greatest shaver!</li>
            <li> and it even includes a nice cleaning station.</li>
            <li> The accessories are nice too.</li>
            <li> but when doing your head and face it cuts it kind of close.</li>
            <li> The shaver fits nicely in my hand in the shower, but it is heavier than what I am used to holding.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun 790CC since 2008 and have always really liked that model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Kind of nice to have a push-button cleaning system</li>
            <li> I really liked the cooling effect</li>
            <li> It is also nice to have something that I can travel with and also use in the car on my way to work for those days when life just pushes you to the brink.</li>
            <li> It is also nice for around my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received the razor through a program run by Braun, that allows people to try the product in order to give their honest opinion.</li>
            <li> In addition, it was great to be able to shave in the shower, which saved even more time in the</li>
            <li> I have never been a guy who liked to use a razor period.  </li>
            <li> The cooling mechanism the starts cooling as the shaver is turned on is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I still like to go over it with a my Gillette ProGlide razor every once in awhile, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like I have to.</li>
            <li> These are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> The shaver feels really nice in my hand --</li>
            <li> is a nice touch</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one nice thing about this shaver is the CoolTec technology.  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest</li>
            <li> The technology and built into these shavers was impressive: lithium ion battery that charges fast, waterproof and washable, LED display and self cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec part of this all was nice; I didn&#x27;t notice any razor burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And in my bathroom it feel kind of aggressive having it stick out like that</li>
            <li> Design of the shaver is nice.</li>
            <li> The cool-tec feature is really nice &amp; soothing.</li>
            <li> Nice option to have for traveling.</li>
            <li> That said, what follows are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy in your hands, and it mostly does a good job.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like a warm razor when trying to shave.  </li>
            <li> It made it effortless to charge the unit and I liked the cleaning feature as well...</li>
            <li> Also I liked the fact that the shaver was waterproof, had a cleaning station, and had a cooling bar to combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have time but have a nice day wherever you reside in the United States of America-have to go now</li>
            <li> but honestly i like my skin to be warm as it opens the pores in the skin and makes it an easier shave.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels like a treat when using.</li>
            <li> and i really liked it.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect does work which is nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I liked the razor but would not purchase it at this price range.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning function is handy and the charging dock is nice and compact for when I travel.</li>
            <li> I the like cleaning feature that is nice</li>
            <li> When I grew my beard out some, this didn&#x27;t trip as close as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t select the product to return with a note about it containing hazardous materials.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to have a shaving option</li>
            <li> I liked that it had a cleaning system</li>
            <li> Braun sent this to me to test out and give an honest review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This thing is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall:  I liked this razor, but I can&#x27;t justify the price of it for that &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooltec strip.  </li>
            <li> Nice and close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of design, it looks really nice-</li>
            <li> After shaving with the CoolTec feature, I honestly feel like I don&#x27;t even need aftershave</li>
            <li> kind of guy.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice my skin felt after my shave.  </li>
            <li> You have the ability to turn off the cooling bar while shaving if you do not like the feeling of it, but I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you that nice kick that you need to wake you up.  </li>
            <li> travel case and charger are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The rest of your face will be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel case is handy and well made.  </li>
            <li> When the cooltec is activated by the &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; button, it does feel really nice.  </li>
            <li> I also really liked the self cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li> The whole experience and the product, were awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who keeps a beard not because I like it</li>
            <li> Since there are no words, you kind of just have to go for</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs nice to know my razor can go with me.  </li>
            <li> The station fits nicely on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> And of course you will feel a bit of a cooling sensation which is nice...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> The cooling technology was nice but not a must have for me.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try out the Braun cooltec razor to see what it was all about.</li>
            <li> I would have to say there are many good things about this razor.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec feature is a nice addition to this shaver.  </li>
            <li> cooling feature is a nice feature I use it each time</li>
            <li> face felt nice after the shave.  </li>
            <li> It was nice.  </li>
            <li> Basically they provide a string of pictures which is nice but no detail into all the parts and</li>
            <li> Nice having a cradle to just set the shaver in for charging instead of messing around with cords.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is also handy and works well.</li>
            <li> This one has a built-in cleaning system, but also is a much cleaner shave - works great!</li>
            <li> I honestly have not found any electric shaver that give me a shave that I consider close.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight with balance.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> - Although it feels good in the hand, it is a bit more cumbersome to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The cooltec would also be nice if it was on the perimeter of the shaving head rather than the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is especially good for me since I am prone to real irritation from electric shavers.</li>
            <li> The cooling does help, it feels nice when the razor glides over your face.</li>
            <li> Nice to shave in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Cooling system is a nice feature, but</li>
            <li> It is compact, sleek, and comes with a nice case&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it feels kind of nice, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Got cleaning and charging station...very effective.</li>
            <li> The cool feature is great and thus works great  for a good quick shave.  </li>
            <li> This has been a very good experience and I am excited to be able to use the system going forward.</li>
            <li> I am a very warm blooded person and thoroughly enjoy the cooling feature of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> seriously great product and worth trying!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s great for me because i don&#x27;t have time in the mornings to clean my shaver.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cool Tec Shaving system is fabulous , the best shaver I have EVER</li>
            <li> The ability to clean is also great.  </li>
            <li> was impressed with the design and the CoolTec system in this particular</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and highly recommend you giving this product a shot.  </li>
            <li> This would be great gift for the special guy, brother, dad, or grandad in your life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Shaving System for more than a month now, and I will say, it has provided me with a much more pleasant electric shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as a razor but its good for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> What you gain is the ability to cool your face downand greatly increase comfort during the shaving process.</li>
            <li> cool technology is great and helps with the irritation that shaving always brings.  </li>
            <li> The chamber is easy to clean and the battery life is very good.  </li>
            <li> me start off by saying that this razor is very cool - literally!  </li>
            <li> After trying this wonderful shaver, I would recommend it to anyone who was in the market for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> and this is almost as impressive a new feature as the cooling system</li>
            <li> After opening the package, setting it up in my bathroom and letting it charge, I was stoked to think I had a new awesome electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The new Braun CoolTec System is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned and was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> The shaver is amazing, by far the best shaver i have had the pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> - I take a great deal of time to make sure that it perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> I loved the razor itself and how easy it was to handle.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly, feels great on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station works great also quick and leaves the shaver spotless.</li>
            <li> The blades made my whole face feel awesome even after I was done shaving :)  </li>
            <li> Make it quick with this great shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels good in my hand, is balanced well, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be a super well groomed and happy camper.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the cooling feature as it actually felt really good on my skin and boy</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used a good one, but I was very happy that the noise level was so low.  </li>
            <li> that said, with self-cleaning, this is a great product to have when I just need a close shave, and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I find this to be great for quick one handed access to the razor.  </li>
            <li> cool is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s cool though, the cooling sensation is a very nice feeling while I shaved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to put together</li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor was also very easy -  </li>
            <li> razor is also built very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> I received the product through a program run by Braun and could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Its a great razor in its own right.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual says that water is ok to use to clean it out but that the solution is recommended because it does lubricate the shaver and clean it the best.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been using the clean &amp; charge station and my razor came out looking clean and smelling wonderful, way better than what I‚Äôve been accustomed too.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I own a Braun 9595 electric shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I just have to say this is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say this electric shaver is more than just a gimic.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice form fitting case.</li>
            <li> The trimmer though is better and provides a nice close shave</li>
            <li> I was able to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free from a program run by Braun, but honestly, the hype just isn&#x27;t as good as it</li>
            <li> This effectively keeps your skin from getting irritated during shaving and keeps your skin feeling refreshing all throughout</li>
            <li> I have been using cartridge refill type blades for some time now, not being too impressed with my old Norelco electic shaver.  </li>
            <li> A great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is nice, and is probably my favorite aspect of the device.</li>
            <li> Although I could have charged it in my room, the battery lasted all 5 days, which most of you guys know is amazing.</li>
            <li> While it took a couple of shaves to get used to, I&#x27;m impressed at how soft and refreshed my skin feels after shaving.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks of using it, I can honestly say that I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This electric razor has two blades that contour nicely to my and the cooling feature is actually refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Charging/Cleaning station is nice and stylish.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned and not used to electric shavers, but this product gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also want the case to be able to hold the cord to keep everything tidy in one place when traveling.  </li>
            <li> If there was a bit more articulation to the shaving head would come in handy.</li>
            <li> It is actually my first electric razor, but after a lot online research and speaking to friends, I figured that it would be a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> what turned out to be perfect timing, I was able to get my hands on a new CoolTec shaver via a Braun promotional program.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great ergonomic shape and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or easily breakable&lt;br</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning is exceptional and it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll always be shaving with a squeaky clean razor.</li>
            <li> it is right for you, then it is a great</li>
            <li> It cools quickly, works remarkably well and delivers the benefit it advertises.  </li>
            <li> The cooling technology at first is very surprising and then it feels great to shave with especially early in the morning to wake you up &#x3D;D.</li>
            <li> but the more I used it the more I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Despite good reviews, the shave isn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an instant burst of coolness that feels so great against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec is already an awesome product, but it&#x27;d be better as the complete Braun gadget package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a nice close shave and my face felt nice and smooth after using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many razors, both electric and manual and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li> The clean &amp; charge station works really good and clean my shaver really good.</li>
            <li> The razor provides a good clean shave for an electric razor</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome idea how cool the shaver is</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times so far and it has been a very pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> shaver itself has a good grip and is more weighty which I like because it gives me more accurate</li>
            <li> But within seconds I was amazed as I felt this cooling sensation as I experienced my first shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> First, the shaving performance itself is not that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that this is the first electric shaver that I have felt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric with this feature before but was pretty happy with the operation.</li>
            <li> However great the features are, it is first and foremost supposed to be a razor.  </li>
            <li> The Cool Tec feature is good.</li>
            <li> The idea of having a cool feeling razor on your skin as your shaving is a great idea and feels pretty good, but</li>
            <li> It feels real cool while shaving.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is cool and it makes my face feel good after the shave (even if it&#x27;s all in my head).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also loved to cool feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning - I have used the included Clean &amp; Renew system yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been an issue given the fact that this shaver is really best for trimming stubble.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very comfortable shave and the cooling mechanism</li>
            <li> The feel of the shaver itself is very comfortable and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec as it provided a very comfortable shave which is the number 1 priority for me when it comes to electric units.</li>
            <li> My skin showed no irritation after the shave and had a very smooth feeling, even with some pesky stubble remaining.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it was honestly a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> In the end of the day shavers are meant to do one very important thing, shave your hair.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs very comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> The actaul shaver did leave my skin very smooth and</li>
            <li> On the contrary, the shaver feels well-built and is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec strip would chill my skin as the razor made each pass making a very very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> When plugging the cord to the charger/cleaner unit, the plug did not seem to be very securely attached but it charged just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is very good and gives you a nice clean shave without too much hassle.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the cooling bar is really great and quite innovative.</li>
            <li> Nice an easy to use with the push of a button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> The side trimmer is effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked that it&#x27;s waterproof and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> The shaver recharges quickly and has a good, comfortable-to-hold shape.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Braun shaver because it was easy to use, except for refilling the alcohol cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning process runs through quickly and it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> do really enjoy this razor and am glad I have had the chance to use it!</li>
            <li> I love the color scheme, and the LED lights that are super bright and futuristic.  </li>
            <li> I thought the scent was nice and it has been very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I love it, very smooth.</li>
            <li> But gets a close shave irritation free and most of all razor bumps free!!</li>
            <li> would highly recommnend this product to any friends or family that is looking for a great shave with the added benefit that the electric razor is water proof and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I certainly would not be happy paying well over $100 for a shaver that doesn&#x27;t execute its job.</li>
            <li> Clean, cool shave, great trimmer with some neck negligence.</li>
            <li> When this razor fist arrived I was super happy and excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is also a huge plus!</li>
            <li> have used several Braun models over the years, including the series 7, which in my opinion is their best model.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the cooling function</li>
            <li> Granted, I can shave without it and experience no irritation, but it does feel better to have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All around okay shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall i am very happy with this product and would recommend it to my friends that use power shavers!</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s now my favorite one.</li>
            <li> The coolness is soothing and let&#x27;s me shave longer and more continuously than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try the cleaning station on this one yet to know if it&#x27;s better though, but I hope it is.</li>
            <li> My last Braun was a pulsonic which I was very happy with and used it until it practically fell apart.  </li>
            <li> Instead of getting irritated by the blades and having your face feel like it is on fire, Braun has come up with a better way.</li>
            <li> have been using a triple or quad blade razor for many years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric razor, I don&#x27;t think you could do better than the CoolTec Shaving System from Braun.</li>
            <li> anyone who likes electric razors, you will love the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> So pleased to try this product out from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> After using the razor for a week now I have to say I am pleased, it makes shaving with a electric an option again.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> so I was able to test this shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros - very close shave, cleaning of the blades between shave, the cleaner provides a great smell after you shave.  </li>
            <li> I love the case and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun in which I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li> and it takes your face a week or more to get used to an electric razor...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my skin is thanking me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those of you who enjoy shaving in the shower, it is nice to have that feature.</li>
            <li> and now I love it.</li>
            <li> I always used just a razor and shaving cream until I was able to try this.  </li>
            <li> It has its own cleaning station which makes me feel more comfortable about the sanitation of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cooling bar.  </li>
            <li> If you like electric shavers give it a try, its better than rotary blades that&#x27;s for sure...</li>
            <li> After using the Braun Cooltec for almost a month now, i and thoroughly enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> but if for sure was noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do love the aluminum cooling bar and the sensation it provides.  </li>
            <li> I have been growing out my sexy mustache for movember</li>
            <li> I decided to play it safe and try out the electric shaver that I got from Braun yesterday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a triple head Phillips electric razor for many years</li>
            <li> Great close shave that really hits the mark.&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the cake is the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> Instead through conduction you get an easier more efficient way to remove the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> face will love you for it.</li>
            <li> then I can&#x27;t think of something better.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I was able to get the cleaning station setup</li>
            <li> I also love the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> cleaning station was interesting, and I trust that it cleaned the head of the razor well since it uses an alcohol based solution for three minutes of cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $200.00 on it</li>
            <li> It seems to work much better when the hair is shorter and better maintained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Braun and most of their products</li>
            <li> but I honestly think their might be better options out there available.</li>
            <li> I figured I would give it one more</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun&#x27;s top shaver&#x27;s from the Activator to the Series 7.</li>
            <li> which is one more thing to bring along when traveling.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m very impressed by how close the shave is for an electric razor because it&#x27;s almost as close as an actual razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this one the benefit of the doubt that I will get more efficient in how I manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the series 7 before and it was much better.</li>
            <li> I love the innovation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given this shaving system through a program by Braun, and after using the Cooltec, I am extremely glad I was chosen.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The one thing I did love was the cleaning mechanism and couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li> Before turning it on I would say I was about 80% sure I wouldn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Knowing it is cleaning and sanitizing the razor keeps me confident that I am treating my face well.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice ergonomic fit for your hand, but it is heavier than most others.  </li>
            <li> I feel you get more for the price with this razor.  </li>
            <li> As for the cleaning system provided, I must admit that it ends up taking up more counter space than I would like to give to my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is truly an innovative product you will need to try firsthand.</li>
            <li> now shave more than twice a week&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> As the title suggest, I have tried many electric razors and have not found one to be satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Just flip of the top and run it through water.</li>
            <li> The most I went was two days, but did mostly because it was a nuisance to see.</li>
            <li> Holding the unit a a 90 degree angle seems to help it cut better and get closer to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I received the feeling thati would be able to give myself a salon quality shave at home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used many razors and electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet tried this, but this is an excellent feature especially when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver, as it reduces irritation.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that my favorite part of this system would be the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> And like i said, while the cooling feature does work, for what this model sells for, I&#x27;d expect much better performance on the shaving end.</li>
            <li> As for the cleaning station, i do like it better than using just water</li>
            <li> This package deal did not come with cover for razor head but had the travel case which I love.  </li>
            <li> Also, since the head of the shaver (aka the cassette) needs more room to house the coolTec bar</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> defiantly won&#x27;t win any speed records; I found it much slower then my safety razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s Bad?&lt;br /&gt;Braun sells an excellent cleaning stand for its foil shavers, but even on a premium product like the CoolTec, it&#x27;ll cost you extra.</li>
            <li> The close shave for me along with the cooling bar put it over the top.</li>
            <li> and I am enjoying telling others about my &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best bday present</li>
            <li> The cooling technology sounded great, and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Still, an interesting idea.  </li>
            <li> Received a Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program by Braun and am glad to have received it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the gripping points on the razor.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind this razor is at its best when you use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me my a program ran by Braun, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> The cool-tec keeps my skin happy for whole day,</li>
            <li> CoolTech has many benefits and features I do like...</li>
            <li> There was many aspects to this shaver.</li>
            <li> With the trimmer built in it is definately more convenient.</li>
            <li> It did a top notch job on my lip, cheeks, and chin.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> CoolTec is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Top of the line.</li>
            <li> Well, after a month it did not get any better and the shave was just not as close as the 790CC.  </li>
            <li> now if they could only add the Cooltec feature to the 790CC I think they would have the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t hurt me any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I give this 3 stars for being just &#x27;Okay&#x27;.</li>
            <li> too many days!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (But most electric razors aren&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed the quality, comfort, and ease of the Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the best when it comes to shaving, as it is a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could get a better shave out of this.</li>
            <li> I mention this because so many electric shavers \\&quot;leak\\&quot; shavings all over your sink and counter</li>
            <li> It feels that the shave would be more efficient if the two blades were together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was never quite sure how to hold the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten used to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works perfectly - cleaning the shaver back to out-of-the-box condition.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works perfectly - cleaning the shaver back to out-of-the-box condition.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> All around I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It still provided an impressive improvement in the amount of times I had to go back over an area of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have been electrics around for a while that do this, so that isn&#x27;t by itself that impressive, but it is VERY quiet compared to others that I have used (when cleaning).  </li>
            <li> The recharging/cleaning station is great and makes re-use that much easier.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Could be better.</li>
            <li> I have always used disposable razors, but am glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say, it was nice to be able to try out this product for free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks, and I&#x27;m generally satisfied with it although it isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery - Honestly, the battery life on this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver from Braun to try out and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.  </li>
            <li> I love the CoolTec cooling strip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The performance of the shaver could be better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning after using was a cinch -- just pop off the top and dust it off with an included brush.</li>
            <li> The more proficient I get with the shaver</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no question that this shaver is more efficient and faster then</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, so this shaver was great for me, and it did the job it said it would!</li>
            <li> You can purchase replacements from many places; I found them for 2 for about $10.</li>
            <li> This comes off a bit like a tactic to get more of my money.</li>
            <li> I love how close it shaves and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> but without using it on my entire face, I just can&#x27;t give a perfect opinion.  </li>
            <li> This razor did a great job on my neck, and gave me a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than my Norelco, so I&#x27;m happy with that feature, though I don&#x27;t expect much from it.  </li>
            <li> And I love the feel of the cooling bar.  </li>
            <li> I was able to feel the cooling bar</li>
            <li> I had no skin irritation at all which definitely makes this the best electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I must say I am impressed with the cleaning features and the nice smooth shave I receive, especially post- Movember trimming.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of manual and electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the self-cleaning dock more than once a week because I&#x27;m so used to popping the head off and tapping/brushing the shavings out.</li>
            <li> Noneed for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> On the note of a beard trimmer with no guard, the precision trimmer is an OK feature but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It IS a great feature because it does enhance the performance of the razor as a whole.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor.</li>
            <li> travel 5 days out of the week and was happy to find that I didn&#x27;t have to bring the whole docking station with.</li>
            <li> but I was able to get this product through a program that Braun is running</li>
            <li> It was almost like the blades weren&#x27;t able to reach the hair, no matter what I did to stretch out</li>
            <li> It is stylish and sleek and zippers up rather than being a bulky plastic case that I am used to travelling with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cooling technology is what I really love about this shaver.</li>
            <li> Just flip of the top and run it through water.</li>
            <li> The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely love to see the cooling system in more razors but until then I think i&#x27;m sticking with my Gillette ProGlide Styler.</li>
            <li> The best part is that the aluminum cooling bar ACTUALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make the shave any better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I tried every type of pressure (light-hard), every direction (360), varying speeds (slow-fast), still wasn&#x27;t able to get all my hair.  </li>
            <li> Most of the hair that I wasn&#x27;t able to get was along my neck and my side burn areas.  </li>
            <li> scalp seems to like the electric shaver much more than a razor.  </li>
            <li> Also, the razer itself is probably one of the better setups for waterproof/cleaning that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely love the packaging and the travel case that you put the razor in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
            <li> but I am kind of cheap anyway.</li>
            <li> If my stubble gets longer than 1/16th of an inch, it feels more like</li>
            <li> more than once, I&#x27;ve had to stop shaving to run the device through its cleaning cycle before finishing my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> self-cleaning seems to work better than my 7-series self cleaner</li>
            <li> I was able to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I got a tester unit from a program run by Braun, and man am I glad that I was able to snag</li>
            <li> favorite part of the bundle was the clean/charge dock.</li>
            <li> so i have avoided most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the capability of being able to just bring it into the shower and get two things done at once.</li>
            <li> I love about the system now:  </li>
            <li> I can use an electric shaver a lot more often without the irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is also more time consuming as you have to pay attention to some parts that are missed and you have to shave them again - I was shaving after a week</li>
            <li> : You wouldn&#x27;t think they could come up with a gadget that can make shaving any better, but they did.</li>
            <li> Either way, it seems to make for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I should start however, by saying that I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for the better part of 30 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using a Panasonic ES-LA 63, which in my opinion, may be the best shaver out there for the price / performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sticking with the Panasonic brand as its 13,000 RPM motors work a lot better for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of places took more than a couple of passes to get to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit itself has a great feel, very weighty and grippy.</li>
            <li> I recommend confidently.</li>
            <li> had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is a good size, looks very sleek, and provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> I love that it cools my face</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel a burn after like I do with most razors.  </li>
            <li> This way the shaver head can remain more compact without warming up while shaving.  </li>
            <li> but it surpassed most of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have always bought disposable razors, I just believed they did better than electric razors.  </li>
            <li> do I love about the Braun CoolTec system.  </li>
            <li> understand not being able to return the \\&quot;flammable\\</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with that feature.  </li>
            <li> Meh... it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I also love the cleaning and recharging station.  </li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is absolutely ingenious.</li>
            <li> Sure.  </li>
            <li> I gave up on using electric razors more than a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I have never had an enjoyable shaving experience until I got this product  via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping I would be getting something better than I had, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all I really need is a great shave and the CoolTec delivers.</li>
            <li> had no problems with my noreclo, but with this style shaver, I find that is is more troublesome to turn the shaver to hit all the angle of my face,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re getting better, but not quite there yet.</li>
            <li> The concept made sense, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel this much better.</li>
            <li> this one device does a better job than all those things combined.  </li>
            <li> am still enjoying this razor after almost two months.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy to add the CoolTec shaver to my shaving routine!</li>
            <li> and I was especially interested in trying this because the Cooltec technology was not something I had ever seen or heard of before in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it fit in my hand, and it had some weight to it.</li>
            <li> I love the cooling sensation as you&#x27;re shaving after a shower.</li>
            <li> years i have used razors and shaving gels, every once in a while getting a cut, and then having to go out and get more razors.</li>
            <li> The Series 7 is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used on my neck, but still falls short of matching a cartridge.  </li>
            <li> the cleaning process is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a try to see if they‚Äôd come up with something more durable and</li>
            <li> The shaver is good ‚Äì certainly worth the lower price that Braun charges, and I‚Äôd say a better value than their top of the line 700 series.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is also refreshing (especially first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have been able to try the Braun CoolTec Shaving System provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> These 2 items are great but what anyone really wants to know is do you get a close shave?</li>
            <li> This system is just ok.</li>
            <li> the cooling bar really helped reduce irritation that I had previously experienced with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I wasn‚Äôt too pleased by how ineffective the razor was at removing hair, but the cooling bar made up for my displeasure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a chance to try out this electric razor as part of a Braun program and was fairly pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is refreshing to have that coolness while you&#x27;re shaving, and there&#x27;s a bonus on/off switch to turn off the cooling if you&#x27;re trying to save battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can pop the top off the razor and see for yourself that the cleaning works.  </li>
            <li> I love the Braun CoolTec Mens Shaving System.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is touted to be more hygenic than just rinsing with water.  </li>
            <li> The Shaver gets most hairs on the face but the longer you let it grow the more passes you will need.</li>
            <li> It delivers a great shave that is, in my opinion, as close as you can get without a straight razor.</li>
            <li> With this shaver I haven&#x27;t experienced it once thanks to the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> also thoroughly enjoyed how it&#x27;s charged.</li>
            <li> to recap, love the Cooltec system</li>
            <li> , I will continue using it and hopefully with more use I will get faster with it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with skin irritation since using this phenomenal razor.</li>
            <li> I was also expecting more out of this as well).</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, I enjoyed the feeling of the cooling bar on my skin.</li>
            <li> so when I was able to try this one through a program run by Braun</li>
            <li> The shaver did a great job on my face of getting really close.  </li>
            <li> The precision trimmer seemed more like an afterthought.</li>
            <li> you love electric razors</li>
            <li> its worth a shot, if your somebody like me that doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close or as good a shave from one you might want to pass on it.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaving system from a program run through Braun and let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be MORE PLEASED with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to get some lotion to use with shaver.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the cool-tec feature.  </li>
            <li> once i get out of the 60&#x27;s and in with technology :)</li>
            <li> If I had that in my 8000 series razor, I would absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> but after having tried out this razor, would pay $30-$50 more to have the CoolTec bar on it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is comfortable to hold and looks really nice.</li>
            <li> I opened up the box, set up the ingenious cleaning station, and charged it for an hour.</li>
            <li> Ok if used every day but miss a day it leaves patches on face</li>
            <li> I like my rotary unit  much better, except it can not be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> The razor cut through my beard and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, not even on my neck, which is a sure thing.  </li>
            <li> I also love the cleaning station that makes it sterile.  </li>
            <li> in all, this product is great for men who do not need a very close shave and for men who suffer from razor bumps or skin irritation when shaving.  </li>
            <li> , I just think it should be implemented on a better quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the cooling tech is all integrated with the blade, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to cost quite a bit when I need to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was sent a Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I have grown to love this</li>
            <li> A problem that many electric shavers have is the friction can make your face feel warm and not as comfortable.</li>
            <li> This razor was able to resolve both issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love about the system now:  </li>
            <li> ok maybe 15.  </li>
            <li> It was refreshing and kept my skin from sticking to the shaver and my hair from getting pulled.  </li>
            <li> two factors that matter most to</li>
            <li> Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> The cooling bar was suprising at first, but quickly felt very good against what would otherwise be irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> clean and charge station was phenomenal!</li>
            <li> My face feels good during the shave and right after.  </li>
            <li> it was very nicely packaged and everything is very high-quality.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system itself has been very nice and very convenient.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know but being able to clean while charging is nice.  </li>
            <li> The clean and renew system is great for keeping it fresh and preventing germs and infections.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver after  hearing that it reduces shaving irritation.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this shaver and my Bruan 7526 Syncro</li>
            <li> The advertised cooling sensation that promised a more comfortable and irritation-free shave seemed to be too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the idea of using an electric shaver rather than a manual one in which I often get cut.  </li>
            <li> was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> When I received my Braun CoolTec System (provided via a program run by Braun), I was very excited.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec as part of a promotional program run by Braun and was very excited.  </li>
            <li> CoolTec System via a program run by Braun and was very excited to try the cooling feature that was well hyped up.</li>
            <li> , I was very excited about this product because I often suffer from skin irritation and sometimes razor bumps from electric or non-electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very excited to get hold of the CoolTec</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually a nice (unique) feature.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec shaving system as part of a promotional program by Braun and after about 3 weeks of using it, I can honestly say it meets up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I have since thrown that old plastic razor away for good!</li>
            <li> but , so far so good!</li>
            <li> The cool feeling while shaving is wonderful, and the shave is as good as to be expected from a Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> As soon as the cool bar kicks in you feel like your shaving with an ice cube, but in a good, smooth, refreshing way.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I am able to shave quicker and that cooling bar feels as good on my face as when a barber puts hot shaving cream on my neck.</li>
            <li> After use, you can either clean it with warm running water or you can stick it in the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> but it never felt like a nice cool refreshing shave.</li>
            <li> But it does keep the razor clean which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> In turn I would have to use a manual razor to clean up leaving me a nice case of razor burn.  </li>
            <li> , I not only feel good after a shave, but I get a good shave and actually use a perfectly cleaned shaving system.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that when I started using this razor that the cooling system has kept the irritation of my face to a minimum; which is awesome because I have super sensitive</li>
            <li> Just smells very clean and</li>
            <li> The shave is very clean and is closer</li>
            <li> This makes the shaver smell very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I really love is that this shaver was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say this is the frustration free packaging advertised is very nice.</li>
            <li> i got the Braun Cool Tec from a program being ran by Braun, and I have to say it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The cooling experience is great for reducing razor burn and irritation from the normal electric or non-electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The first shave was wonderful, it shaved close and smooth the first time without any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> When I first received this Braun cooltec electric razor via a program run by Braun, I was sporting a good mountain man sized beard.</li>
            <li> Takes many passes to get a patch done, many more to make it smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the shave just doesnt match up to the nice cool feeling.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cool Tec feels great to use and leaves my face feeling cool and comfortable after each use.</li>
            <li> and I have to say its pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t perform nearly as good as when I first got it.</li>
            <li> The cool touch feature is really nice.</li>
            <li> The shaving itself was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave while providing a nice cool sensation on the skin that takes the sting out of shaving.</li>
            <li> Good things first.</li>
            <li> At any rate, the cleaning station seems to do a pretty good job clearing the head of cut hair.</li>
            <li> When you use it, it gives your skin a nice, cool sensation.</li>
            <li> All in all the razor was pretty good, it didn&#x27;t get the closest of shaves, but it did help with the razor</li>
            <li> so i had a pretty good beard.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin doesn&#x27;t normally get incredibly irritated when I shave, but it also doesn&#x27;t normally feel GOOD after a shave like it does with the CoolTec.</li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job shaving my face.</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is pretty good for electric.</li>
            <li> The shaver cuts very nice and closer than my older rotating electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I would say it was about 95% as good as the best manual razor I&#x27;ve used, which was miles ahead of any other shaver I have experienced previously, and there was almost no irritation, which again, was unexpected and impressive.  </li>
            <li> The cool feeling truly feels very good on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause the normal skin irritation that I&#x27;m used to getting from these types of shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown up using electric shavers, so I was excited to give this shaver a chance!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product, and for any guy looking for a new shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that the CoolTec does live up to hype with regards to skin irritation, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the new 790CC...</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, before buying a Braun CoolTec system, consider whether the great new cooling bar technology will solve an issue you might have with redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> I got a close comfortable shave and the cooling strip really works and feels great.  </li>
            <li> The both together give a smooth, irritation free razor and my skin has felt amazing.</li>
            <li> It fits easily into my hands and holds the charge for a more than ample amount of time.</li>
            <li> And to my pleasant surprise, I think I&#x27;ve accomplished that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation was pleasant and would really help minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is extremely easy and allows for a refreshing experience even after repeated uses.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a convenient shaver that does the job, but not as good as a good shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product, with a good shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that you don&#x27;t need shaving gel or anything to have a comfortable, smooth and close shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall pluses would be: easy to clean and cleaning station works well, cooling effect is soothing on skin and keeps from getting irritated, nice travel case and</li>
            <li> Also, its good if you&#x27;re on the run, travelling or need a good daily shave.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec shaver has a nice quality build, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and the travel accessories are perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the man on the go who wants a irritation free shave</li>
            <li> It was very refreshing and was a smooth, cool feeling.  </li>
            <li> you are the type that shaves every morning, this is sure to make that process easier and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Storing the cleaning station is a bit more of a challenge as the cleaning agent in the system can spill if it is tilted too much, but the plug and cord detach which is good for storage</li>
            <li> In addition, the shaver was very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean in the cleaning system that is provided and</li>
            <li> the parts are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the better shave you get, but I think this is true for most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> travel case that this shaver comes with is pretty nice as well, although it would be nice if it could fit the cord and plug as well.</li>
            <li> It came nicely packaged with the instructions right on top.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec Shaving System also comes with a clean &amp; charge station that is unparalleled!</li>
            <li> With that being said, Braun&#x27;s CoolTec razor gives me a close and clean shave!</li>
            <li> love the cooling feature and quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love Braun and I was so excited to be able to test this razor.  </li>
            <li> I was also impressed with the weight and feel of the shaver in my hand, it felt very comfortable and solid, like if I dropped it on the tile it would be fine, not the cheap light plastic feel I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is great and cleans it very well and leaves a clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love keeping the unit clean, and the alcohol does a better job at killing the bacteria which is a plus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally the clean and charge station is one of the greatest features.</li>
            <li> However, it does clean really well in the cleaning station, so this is a great feature for me to periodically renew the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gave me a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system not only comes with a cooling option that leaves your skin flawless, it also has a cleaning kit for helping to clean the inside without any</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec electric razor has a cooling area between the blades that is very cool to the touch and gives a soothing sense as the razor glides over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the heads are very good at following all the countours of my neck, face, and head.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec is the only part of the shaver I found to be very good</li>
            <li> It is a very cool shaving on summer.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This razor delivers a superior shave and the product seems to have the appreacance in the shape and size as a very high end product.</li>
            <li> Together with the charging/cleaning station and the soft case that will allow me to take this on the road with me, I think this is a great razor for a close shave without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the CoolTec feature or not</li>
            <li> That feature would be great for someone with sensitive skin or razor</li>
            <li> Love the cool tech thing how ever the shave could be better.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly smooth, even better than a manual razor.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m happy to omit any shaving aids, since they often just irritate my sensitive</li>
            <li> the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I have some difficulty with consistency of shaving my neck, but this is usually my own skin type problem as this is a consistent problem with most shavers.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet with shave lotion, and it does awesome.</li>
            <li> It came at the perfect time, as I was about ready to replace my more than 10 year old Braun Synchro 7505.  </li>
            <li> I must have rotated it twenty times while shaving just to see 1) the most comfortable way to hold it and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a precision blade for closer and more precise shaving.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun was great which is why I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I was also questioning whether or not it would be able to provide me with an irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> This cooling of the skin seems to have kept my skin from becoming irritated when using the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I enjoy the acoustics when I am gettting my vocals warmed up in the shower. :-)</li>
            <li> However the expense of using blade razors is becoming quite cost prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> The good is my nephew will be getting his first Braun shaver for free....</li>
            <li> Great travel case included - I travel for business frequently and having this case</li>
            <li> and it is more of a cheap gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li> It gave my skin a nice cool and smooth feeling, but that feature alone does not change my mind about keeping my manual razor.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, the shave is great as far as the cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> I love the product because it gives a smooth close shave .</li>
            <li> shave is the most important thing here, and for me it was the closest I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this shaver because of the close and smooth shave it provided me.</li>
            <li> Now what I don&#x27;t really care for out weighs all the good I just described.</li>
            <li> After cleaning, the razor was nice and fresh and smelled clinical, which I do not mind.  </li>
            <li> i found that it gives you a very close shave (almost as good as the Razor)</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT WORKS GOOD AND FAST</li>
            <li> The razor is waterproof so you do not have to worry much about giving it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not pull or cause irritation, and it is quite nice to have that cooling bar go over the freshly shaved areas.  </li>
            <li> Immediately loved the cooling sensation on my face and eventually when I was finished it did feel much better than a normal shave.</li>
            <li> Automatic cleaning in the Charge and Clean station is very effective and doesn‚Äôt require much manual cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clean &amp; charge station is also a pretty nice feature as it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and fully charged!  </li>
            <li> I like this new system so much that I recommended it to my best friend of 20+ years.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun customer for many, many years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels nice in your hand, but i feel that the on/off and cooling button should be switched (my thumb rested right on the cooling button).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Five stars is a must for the close shave, easy and quick recharge, simple instructions and wonderful cistomer service</li>
            <li> the foil blades clean easily if rinsed under warm water and if that doesn&#x27;t work the clean station cleans it in about 3 minutes which is very quick.</li>
            <li> First off the solution gives you a good 5-10 cleanings depending on how often you clean it.</li>
            <li> The charge life is great, the fact you can use it wet/dry is another huge plus as I usually shave in the shower, and the CoolTec technology is like nothing I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> every other day, this razor is perfect.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave without the razor burn and leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the cooling bar and you&#x27;ll notice a significant decrease in skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other electric razors with cleaning systems and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> And by all means reread my original review as most of it still applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it takes a significant amount of time more to shave than with a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now I can say that it is one cool cat!</li>
            <li> You are a true pioneer!</li>
            <li> Get a cool close shave!</li>
            <li> but the Cool Tec doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck!</li>
            <li> Some give you great traction, some give you great fuel mileage, hardly any will give you both.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth and kept my face cool with the CoolTec system throughout the shave.</li>
            <li> would recommend this shaver to any guy that&#x27;s looking for an easy to maintain razor that leaves you with a clean smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> ; that is compact and easy to haul along.  </li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> the cooling bar, the handle itself is easy to hold and maneuver around your face.</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to use.</li>
            <li> with Jet Clean System]] and really love it.</li>
            <li> Really easy.  </li>
            <li> The better station is the charge and clean station.</li>
            <li> But if I miss a day or two then the thicker hairs do not get cut as easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use and even easier to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Since taking the beard off, I have cleaned the shaver and noted how easy the process was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The cover pops off easily for easy maintenance and care.</li>
            <li> Easy setup with charging station, shaver, and additional</li>
            <li> &gt; - It is easy to use and easy to store in your travel bag</li>
            <li> The charging dock station is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The traveling case is portable and easy to bring along on trips.  </li>
            <li> the package and the instuctions were easy to follow as well.</li>
            <li> But then...I was able to experience the ¬∞CoolTec Shaving system as I used it to clean up my neck.  </li>
            <li> like the ease of the charging/cleaning station and how it makes it easy to care for the unit.</li>
            <li> You could easily forgo the cleansing solution once it runs out if you are not worried about that(or use on occasion rather than every time?).  </li>
            <li> Easily packs in my carryon luggage.</li>
            <li> You have to decide for yourself what is more important, a baby smooth shave, or the convenience of an electric shave with the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> On most of my face the shave is nice and close, but on  on my chin under my lip I find that I can not get a very close</li>
            <li> self-cleaning works well and is easy</li>
            <li> I love the ability to clean the shaver at the push of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you start looking over everything though it began to make sense, and was rather easy to work</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Charging is easy, just drop it in and press.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are easy, the readouts are simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can still easily maneuver around your face and</li>
            <li> it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The cleaning portion is easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bulky and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is made of a non-slick material so you can easily push the trimmer up and lock in place.  </li>
            <li> made it easy to travel with -</li>
            <li> The waterproof design makes shaving easy and carefree, wherever I decide to shave.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to know that I can pack for a business trip and not have to worry about the power button getting hit while it&#x27;s in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It easily came out of its socket.  </li>
            <li> burns easily so that it is even all the way around.</li>
            <li> The square head makes it easy to control if you have a goatee or mustache</li>
            <li> I am not a regular shaver but was more than happy to try this out as part of a Braun promotion.</li>
            <li> and I break out easily.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t something you can easily keep out.</li>
            <li> Storing the razor safely is easy with the travel case and docking station provided.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to rinse the razor in the sink since it comes with a easily detachable head.</li>
            <li> The handle fits easily in my hand and the razor contours to the shape of my face effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Because of its compact size, it is easy to carry along when travelling and comes with a sleek travel</li>
            <li> strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> anyone that is used to use a classic shaving  machine - this is surely a good product.</li>
            <li> After shaving with it for 2 weeks, I put my older Braun shaver up for good.  </li>
            <li> and they are staying strong.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the shaver works as good as the older models.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, my fact isn&#x27;t red, its COMFORTABLE (for the first time in many years) - its awesome!  </li>
            <li> Deffinatlly would recommend this to everyone its one nice shaver and works very very well</li>
            <li> it self feels good in the hand and feels like its made high quality materials.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Above all - Braun&#x27;s CoolTec (provided to me by a program run by Braun) looks good and of high quality.</li>
            <li> It will leave your face smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> It gives a nice quick and close shave and has a neat cooling bar feature that will cool your skin while shaving.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I felt that I got a really close shave, and was very satisfied with the end</li>
            <li> However, on general day to day shaving, it gets the job done and feels great doing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked using electric for the convenience, but always knowing that a razor gets much closer and is a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It really is an enjoyable feel to have a cool shave, when activated.</li>
            <li> However for someone with Rosacea I will gladly trade off the heat and irritation that come with the Series 7&#x27;s close shave for the CoolTec&#x27;s cool bar shave.</li>
            <li> My son loves this the most as it makes all kinds of cool noises.</li>
            <li> The shave was of average quality, and the cooling system was not as impressive as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor and I liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to do the full beard yet, because I am waiting for Movember to be over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually feels good on your skin, you should really check this out.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system seems to work pretty well and the carrying case is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> A good thing too, considering I had to go over my face so many more times than I would have with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use for the Braun Cool Tec Mens Shaving System.</li>
            <li> But this shaver is pretty good at getting most of them the first time.</li>
            <li> The cool feeling as I shave is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Good shave for no thick or course hair&lt;</li>
            <li> A razor is pretty intuitive, but it would have been nice to see clearer instructions on connecting the cleaning solution cartridge, using the travel charger, and manual cleaning.</li>
            <li> So the idea of the cool strip was interesting.</li>
            <li> It feels great and is a nice change from other shavers that feel like they&#x27;re going to burn your skin by the time you get done shaving.  </li>
            <li> That said, this &#x27;shaving system&#x27; is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Love the cool tec feel.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and the charging station is the right size.</li>
            <li> While the older unit still worked perfectly, I immediately switched over and have ditched the old unit for this one.</li>
            <li> The directions weren&#x27;t super easy or esthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> It is nice to use a razor that is clean and smells fresh for every use.  </li>
            <li> However, the end result - a smooth, clean shave - is achievable with most Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was overly thrilled with it , my older braun might have been better</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electronic shaver that is out there that is out there in the market today.</li>
            <li> In summary, if you don&#x27;t already own an electric razor, and think you really need or would enjoy the cooling feature, this razor could work for you but if you already own a razor that works for you, i doubt this is worth switching to.</li>
            <li> , is light, feels good in my hand, and is highly maneuverable.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this and intrigued by the cool technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then the cleaning station makes it good as new</li>
            <li> or so I am less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I was less impressed over time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of the cool feature I will say that it worked well and kept my skin free from irritation - a problem I&#x27;ve had on many shavers before this</li>
            <li> Also, I picked up the series 7 (black version) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that purchase!</li>
            <li> this is fine</li>
            <li> The CoolTec feels WONDERFUL on my face after the shave and leaves it feeling less irritated.  </li>
            <li> The idea of the cool bar integrated on it is a innovative and fantastic idea.  </li>
            <li> I have always just rinsed my shavers under the sink after each use and this has work just fine for years.  </li>
            <li> I was very lucky to receive a free razor from Braun ¬∞CoolTec System for a trail.  </li>
            <li> really love the clean and charge station that came with the set, it is easy to keep the razor clean, and even easier to keep it charged.  </li>
            <li> in that it fits comfortably in my hands and easy to use without worry that I would nick myself.  </li>
            <li> The cool technology makes shaving so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> One thing I always took as a truth was the more hot the skin was the better a shave you could get.</li>
            <li> I would say that part works fine</li>
            <li> The braun cool tec razor provided for a free trail by braun has been a pleasant surprise with a close shave combined with cool roller blades instead of the hot one</li>
            <li> love the self cleaning station , sterile and quick</li>
            <li> this quick!</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent at shaving and very precise and quick without missing some hairs not cut .</li>
            <li> And This new CoolTec system is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> and I was really impressed by the Clean &amp; Charge Station that actively cleans your shaver after use while also recharging it.</li>
            <li> The LED display is bright and easy to see in my dimly lit bathroom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec Solo and would highly recommend one for purchase.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a first time shaver buyer in look for a great and painless shaver.</li>
            <li> I love that the blade/foil unit pops right off the top making it super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> However, the Charging/Cleaning station is huge.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be any more surprised or happier with the amazing results I have gotten.</li>
            <li> the topic of the cleaning/charging station: Its huge.</li>
            <li> is HUGE, takes up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;-Travel</li>
            <li> I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running.</li>
            <li> I then used the CoolTec Shaver to make my face silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the razor about a dozen times now with various degrees of hair length and can say that I am mostly happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always chalked it up to buying a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great after a short charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li> Comfortable shave -</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar feels nice against your face, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much by way of keeping my face from being irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, not only did this razor surpass my every expectation, it looks and feels great as well.</li>
            <li> CoolTec System for free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> Then there is the cleaning light.</li>
            <li> Though that is where the cleaning feature will really come in handy.</li>
            <li> so for me I am not trying to get a baby&#x27;s butt smooth shave on my face to replace my razor.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and close.</li>
            <li> The cartridge does need to be replaced and there is an indicating light that tells you when it does.  </li>
            <li> The electric shaver was provided free from Braun, but it does not affect my review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never thought that I&#x27;d enjoy a cooling sensation while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec,(provided free to try from Braun)I</li>
            <li> The shave was close and my skin felt comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning feature is convenient and easy to use, it even has a reminder on the shaver to clean it.</li>
            <li> cooltec gel is awesome, but refills are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> the important part: the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> my face is comfortable afterwards with no</li>
            <li> The razor has a light that illuminates if the razor needs a cleaning</li>
            <li> received my shaver for free, courtesy of Braun.</li>
            <li> Effortless and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with the Braun, my face was a smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li> automatic cleaning systems also provides a fresh clean feel, and easily cleans and maintains the shaver in top shape.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, would give it a 5 star</li>
            <li> I received this shaver to try for free as part of a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> but again, i am low maintenance and am perfectly happy just rinsing &amp; tapping.</li>
            <li> I was provided the shaver via a program run by Braun, the instructions for use were clean and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Hopefully that process goes smoothly.</li>
            <li> All in all though, this is a fantastic razor</li>
            <li> Even though it is slower the convenience being able to shave without water or shave lotion almost anywhere makes the loss of speed almost worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Braun gives me a great close shave, and the cooling sensation is great and really helps the hairs stand straight so they can be shaved evenly and after only one pass.  </li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System for free to try out from a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> travel charger + case which isn&#x27;t the cheap stuff you can get with some razors</li>
            <li> If you shave every 2-3 days then you may want to consider more powerful options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that the Braun CoolTec shaver was FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the CoolTec system</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is great because it save you time from doing the standard breakdown cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not having to spend countless dollars on aftershave/lotion alone makes this razor a great return on investment.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver going on 3 days now, and there is no irritation, and when I am done shaving I have a baby butt smooth face.  </li>
            <li> Any doubts in buying this for a close comfortable shave don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It does need the charger, so if you travel, you will need to take it with you which can be somewhat of a hassle when you are trying to travel light.</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; period needed between in order to feel comfortable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We buy a lot from Amazon and never had a problem, and the way they handled this issue was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and like the feel that the CoolTec system provides.</li>
            <li> It even works great for me shaving my head since I wear my hair so low.</li>
            <li> I have found this razor to be excellent for everyday</li>
            <li> For men with finer facial hair this would be a great buy.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Bzzagent, and tried it immediately.</li>
            <li> I received Braun CoolTec shaving system for free from Braun as part of a trial program, and I was ecstatic to be receiving a $200 shaver from a well-respected company.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would take too much additional space and would be nice to keep both together.</li>
            <li> With a push of a button it is easy to clean .</li>
            <li> I enjoy sing my cooltec shaver, the cooling blade allows for a soothing shave.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when my Braun Cooltec in the mail thanks to a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, I received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver in the mail from Braun, free of charge, under the guise that I would speak about my experience.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely comfortably shave and the CoolTec System works noticeably well.</li>
            <li> However, the SensoBlade still gave me a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver for free from a program run by Braun to review.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec was provided to me free to try by Braun, but I didn&#x27;t let that bias my review in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> i could change anything, it would be to adjust the location of the button for the cooling button, and perhaps adjust the size of the openings in the foil to fit a thicker whisker like mine.</li>
            <li> Effortless and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Everything else was great, I could shave and just rinse the shaver under the sink and put it back in the stand.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall a great shaver that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I received the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free as part of a promotion from Braun.</li>
            <li> Had I not gotten this shaver for free, I wouldn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I was offered a Braun CoolTec shaver for free as part of a Braun promotion in which I was supposed to try the product and give a review of my thoughts on the shaving system.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the shave, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the cheap flimsy plastic</li>
            <li> I thinnk this is a great shaver for the man with a medium facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and</li>
            <li> was free</li>
            <li> For myself it was one of the only gifts I was truly happy to get this year.</li>
            <li> would recommend this razor if you you have want a comfortable shave, and enjoy using electric razors.</li>
            <li> shave is close and his skin is smooth, even in the afternoon (which is quite a feat for his whiskers!)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the fantastic things about any Braun shaver -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ability to provide a decently smooth shave.</li>
            <li> When I want an area of my face to be hair free, it has to be hair</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec for free from a program Braun runs.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I Received my Braun CoolTec Shaver free from a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> The cooling strip is nice and really does seem to help reduce the irritation.</li>
            <li> but if you have longer facial hair it doesn&#x27;t do the job to great</li>
            <li> I received the shaving system for free from a program through Braun.  </li>
            <li> At the $200 level, it made me wince a bit, but at $135, it was more than worth it.</li>
            <li> The electric razors help to keep a smooth looking face and no burn.  </li>
            <li> The base/stand does a great final job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nextis the cooling strip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric shaver kind of guy.</li>
            <li> It was a close comfortable shave in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> and you can feel patches in your face that you just can&#x27;t get smooth out with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-Horrible on the neck area.</li>
            <li> Zero discomfort issues, no razor burn whatsoever, and I get a comfortable close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this item via a program with Braun.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth and painless.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for the next great thing when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked the design, it is very sleek looking and the shaver itself</li>
            <li> This shaver also drastically improved my opinion of electric shavers and how much technology has been improved to alleviate irritation while getting a nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s not forget about the primary purpose: shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes some practice and you need to counter space to set up the Clean&amp;Charge station, but my face is just as smooth as when I used my Gillette razor</li>
            <li> you are looking for a great daily shaver,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave is baby smooth, As soon as you turn on the cooling functionality</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the only thing I wasn‚Äôt happy with was the shave, which doesn‚Äôt bode well for a razor.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver for free to write my review of the product.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor free.</li>
            <li> The device causes absolutely no rashes or burns and works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and the cooling system kept the razor burn at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received this system free from a Braun program that they were running.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec.  </li>
            <li> I think this kinda makes this point not as great as if the actual shaver it self worked.</li>
            <li> I got a very close shave and the cooling sensation feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Compared to my Norelco electric razor that I had years ago, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Compared to my Norelco electric razor that I had years ago, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> so when I got a chance to participate in a promotion where I received a cooltech razor from Braun for free</li>
            <li> CoolTech provides a comfortable, smooth shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> The cool strip that is suppose to keep your face from becoming irritated from shaving works,</li>
            <li> It actually works great.</li>
            <li> cleaning solution that was supplied smells like cheap vodka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can imagine it took quite a bit of engineering to fit a cooling system into a shaver.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning dock is great and very quiet!  </li>
            <li> This shaver looks great, and since it doesn&#x27;t have a port to plug it in, you can actually use it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to just return the razor and have the unit clean and charge it for me.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product from Braun to try and keep for free.</li>
            <li> I got the braun cooltec for free from a program</li>
            <li> However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and</li>
            <li> was free</li>
            <li> clean system is good at clean the shaving and use it very faster to clean</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I placed it in the container and it was surprisingly cleaned up many tiny hairs.  </li>
            <li> and so far it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> up was super easy - the instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the cleaning system is that it requires additional purchases for more cleaning solution ‚Äì hopefully I can find a good deal on those.  </li>
            <li> However, when I let my hair grow for 2 days or more the growth seems to be more than this razor can handle in a reasonable amount of time...</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It provides an awesome cool sensation for your skin and helps cut down on irritation.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the razor to anyone needing a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the shaver very easy to use and the dock/cleaning system was pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li> The first time I uses the Clean and Charge station, the Braun did come out nice and clean but again I don&#x27;t see a need to use it every shave.</li>
            <li> The entire unit is a nice size, and does not take up too much space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec technology was a very nice feature</li>
            <li> Also, consider your budget and the great many other Braun models available at a lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it says cool, it means cool!  </li>
            <li> I love how the trimmer is right on the razor</li>
            <li> and I feel like it isn‚Äôt able to get right up to the edge of my beard, even with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, I realized that I needed to make more room on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the cool tech idea would work, but it makes the shave very comfortable.</li>
            <li> That said, I have gotten the plug to stay for the most part, and that quirk has not damaged my positive experience with this razor!</li>
            <li> That‚Äôs fine with me as I got a clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was happy I was able to test the shaver and would give it as a gift to other members of my family.</li>
            <li> Its easy to turn the cool bar on and off with no problems.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this product 3 stars because I did not feel it was worth the money but wanted to give it more time to see if I would get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, cool charger.</li>
            <li> clean the foils, the top of the shaver comes right off to allow you to clean the hair out of the mechanism easily.  </li>
            <li> The travel charge kit is also very nice since I travel a lot for work and like to keep my neck properly groomed.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a quality electric razor that&#x27;s easy to use, extremely effective, and effortless to clean.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is a very nice shaver</li>
            <li> Since you can shave closer, faster, and more comfortably with the 790cc-4 I&#x27;m sticking with that, but would be happy to buy a new top of the line razor with shave performance similar to the 790cc which includes the cooling tech, however, there is some work to be done by Braun.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, just set the shaver in the Clean &amp; Charge station and press</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver is as good as the Panasonic and shaves as close as most electric shavers can.&lt;br /&gt;The system also has a clean and charge station with a replaceable cleaning fluid that installs super easily at the bottom of the station.</li>
            <li> For the most part it gets a pretty close shave and the CoolTech system works great, but the actual shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to get every hair on your face.</li>
            <li> While that doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like a very satisfying sensation, I&#x27;ll take a cool &amp; comfortable face over the burning and irritation I have experienced with other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I get a great shave in no time flat with the Braun ‚Å∞CoolTec.</li>
            <li> cooling feature is indeed really cool (pun intended), but if you want a perfect shave, I would suggest a straight razor or a different electric razor.</li>
            <li> This razor should be, first and foremost, a device for shaving and, though the technology built into it (and around it, if you consider the cleaning station) is nice, it does not and cannot make up for its lack of a good shave for me personally.</li>
            <li> Aside from the high price tag, I definitely think its an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to be awesome and had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> The CoolTech is nice, quality shaving system and is definitely worth a look should you be on the market for a new shaver.d to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you like that clean smooth feeling...this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when you do take it on the road, you can clean it under running water if the cleaning station isn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to remove from the box.</li>
            <li> The cleaning machine was super easy, just set it and forget it.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is really nice and it really does keep your skin cool.  </li>
            <li> I think its awesome that it cleans its self and is ready for the next time you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Overall product is okay and works better for somebody whom has lighter facial hair but the packaging and cleaning kit is great to have and thats one thing i love about Braun</li>
            <li> it was super easy to setup, too.</li>
            <li> From the first shave I found it faster, closer and definitely more comfortable than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once it kicked in it really felt nice and cool.</li>
            <li> And quick and easy use.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad shave and the CoolTec has a very nice feel, but I expected more for the price.    </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Clean &amp; Charge station, it&#x27;s a very modern looking station yet would fit in well in any bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I very much have enjoyed having the cooling aluminium running across the lenght of the razor head</li>
            <li> The new Braun CoolTech delivers a perfect shave and finally comparable to manual razors.</li>
            <li> you use electric razors and need a new one, this one (Braun CoolTec) is worth the $200, you still get a good shave</li>
            <li> The cleaning station that comes with it is great and really does keep the razor blades feeling new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I am very impressed by the Braun CoolTec System and would definitely recommend this to a family member or friend looking at getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I think the razor will be a great quick shave tool, especially since it causes zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the shaver was easy to use and gave a clean quick shave.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows rather quickly and if I shave every day it provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is a great feature and it is super simple to use.  </li>
            <li> and it is quick and easy to clean and charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how smooth the shave was and how cool my face stayed throughout the shave.</li>
            <li> and i was excited to get it</li>
            <li> This product has some &#x27;cool&#x27; hi-tech features providing a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure my beard beat the blades into submission.</li>
            <li> First electric that I can use more than twice a week without bumps of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave me a cool comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Next, the shave itself is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> I have had excellent results with Braun products and I have no reason to believe that, if properly taken care of, this CoolTech shaver will last me many years.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the skin cool and provided a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> With the Cool Tec shaver, which i received free from a promotion from Braun, all i have to do is press a button and the shaver cleans itself.  </li>
            <li> I tried this, but of course the hot water negated most of the cooling effect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to have the privilege to test the Braun CoolTec CT5cc shaver that was given to me for evaluation and review by Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get another one I&#x27;ll explore this option more. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This system keeps your skin feeling smooth and cool and it has helped reduce skin irritation when I shave.</li>
            <li> I am typically a normal razor kind of guy.</li>
            <li> When I just need to go over my face quickly in the morning before work, then it works fine.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver, and I love that I can rinse it off in water.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product as it was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> My skin felt cool and smooth after each shave.  </li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> my first use I immediately fell in love with the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m noticing a better shave the first time around which is saving me time</li>
            <li> Update to original review</li>
            <li> Original ------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found myself doing many more passes than I did with the 790cc and actually caused more irritation.  </li>
            <li> the razor looks cool and is totally comfortable to hold an maneuver while shaving.  </li>
            <li> and I must tell you that it makes me laugh when I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li> but I was excited to see how this worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am interested in trying anything on the market that is innovative</li>
            <li> Upon turning on the shaver and applying it to my face, I did not notice a significant amount of cooling on my face.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a cool, irritation free, quality electric shave?&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read about the features of the CoolTec by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li> have to say after reading about it I was really excited to give it a try</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> and I am excited about it.  </li>
            <li> It has significantly reduced the appearance of razor bumps for me.  </li>
            <li> This shaver, just like all electric shavers,does not like longer whiskers so be sure to use the trimmer first if your beard is longer.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to just throw it on the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station after each use and not have to worry about it being charged or cleaned when I went to shave next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being cleaned and charged, I tried it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> Instead of hiding the shaver in cabinets or drawers in my bathroom, I excitedly set it up on my bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> As a guy who has used electric shavers most of his life, I was very excited when I received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System via a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> They gave the razor, a very nice travel case, and small travel sized travel charger as well as an amazing charge and clean station.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Build: My old rotary shaver is very light and made mostly of rubber and plastic, so it was a bit of a surprise to hold the CoolTec, which has quite a bit of heft to it.  </li>
            <li> So the prospect of a Braun razor that would provide a clean, close shave and minimize skin irritation was something I was truly excited about.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it because this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Braun CoolTec Shaving System, I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> not as great above the lip.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a great system when compared to other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> However, if you have realistic expectations, such as comparing it to other electric shavers, none of which will shave as close as the best manual razors, then the Braun CoolTec may be a great choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This new CoolTec shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> This new technology is amazing from the closest shave ever with no irritation to talk about.  </li>
            <li> I like knowing my shaver is clean before each</li>
            <li> With the CoolTec system, you can clean and charge this shaver with the push of a button by putting the razor in the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free directly from Braun to try it out and give my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have to follow up with my razor to keep my neck completely clean.  </li>
            <li> The indicator is telling me to clean after each use.  </li>
            <li> the cooling sensation makes my skim feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> so it knew the intensity to clean at.  </li>
            <li> to clean -&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to clean it with a brush.</li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;d go over my face over and over with my Panasonic ES8103S Shaver just to get halfway clean shaven, the CoolTec was probably 1/2 the passes.</li>
            <li> system also comes with a clean and charge station that is recommended to use after every shave.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is place the shaver in the clean and charge station and push the power button, it runs through a 3-minute self clean cycle.</li>
            <li> They irritate my skin and/or a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best way to shave my neck with no red marks.&lt;br /&gt;Thee</li>
            <li> The package contained the razor, the charger and cradle, the Charge and Clean station, cleaning solution, a cleaning brush, travel case, and user‚Äôs</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also clean the CoolTec under running water.  </li>
            <li> It gives me peace of mind that after I am done that my razor will be clean and disinfected.</li>
            <li> While it is amazing, the bar will actually HEAT UP if you use it for more than about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also waterproof so you can have a shave in the shower or just take it apart when you&#x27;re done shaving and stick it under the tap to clean it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this item to anyone who is not as worried about a clean shave but do get irritated areas when shaving.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it makes my skin and no burning after shaving thanks to the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> This razor is excellent and honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong selecting this on a deal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Of the 15+ shavers I have used in my lifetime (and some manual shaving too), this razor is by far the best because instead of making the motors bigger and faster, Braun decided to focus on comfort as well.</li>
            <li> The shaver also came with a charge and clean system.</li>
            <li> Once I was done shaving I placed the shaver on the &#x27;Clean and Charge&#x27; station and the station started to clean my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> \\&quot;clean and Renew\\&quot; system refills every three months.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it gets as clean and sterilized as the 7.</li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is sub-par, and doesn&#x27;t properly clean the razor.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Charge Station</li>
            <li> Close clean</li>
            <li> Cost of additional clean and renew solution cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of electric shavers that claim you can clean them and</li>
            <li> However, if you like to keep a completely clean look, then I imagine the shaver would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor and the cooling effect is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> - The indicator on the shaver that tells you when it needs to be cleaned seems to be a bit too sensitive and a bit of a scam to get you to clean it more and buy more cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say you should clean it about once a week</li>
            <li> It has a charging/cleaning station to ensure a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It also has a built in trimmer to help clean up your beard, goatee etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tended to start out with the electric, and clean at the end with my blade.  </li>
            <li> to clean.  </li>
            <li> have since kept the beard but tried to keep my neck line clean.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that the electric razor would give me a close clean shave.</li>
            <li> I tried again as a dry shave and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Charge station keeps the unit clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to brushing my Braun with the provided brush, keeping it neat and clean.</li>
            <li> When I am at home, I can just drop the shaver into the Clean and Charge station and it will charge automatically.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor clean without me having to do anything.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to take the heads off to clean the razor blades.  </li>
            <li> had my doubts I would be able to use this because I haven&#x27;t been able to frequently use any shaving system, ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a trimmer attachment is another plus because it helps to clean up the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A brush and some rubbing alcohol and about 1 minute of your time will clean this.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll find the razor, cleaning station, power cord, zippered travel case, charging cradle, one Clean and Renew cartridge, cleaning brush and manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cooling Bar works, but a clean shave would be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;1)Try to clean shave around adams apple or under chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - Although it takes me more time, I do get a very close shave with no burn and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen an electric shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li> To get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Clean at the press of a button.  </li>
            <li> But, it is a shaver that is mid-range when it comes to a close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> albeit spotty this will give it to you since you wont get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth and quick shave when I am on the go.</li>
            <li> The shaver provided clean shave for halfe my face, then it needed cleaning in order to continue.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> so I use it to clean up</li>
            <li> so keeping the shaver clean was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The system also helps to clean up the blade so it prolong the blade</li>
            <li> Its comfortable, powerful, and precise.</li>
            <li> Well I set it up and let it clean the razor</li>
            <li> Once the shave was complete I was honestly amazed with how close and smooth of a shave I had received from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the product clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> But Braun&#x27;s unique cool technology has me hooked.</li>
            <li> But Braun&#x27;s unique cool technology has me hooked.</li>
            <li> so I got really excited when I got the Braun cool Tec Shaving System.</li>
            <li> It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  </li>
            <li> The Braun Cool Tec electric shaver is by far the best shaver I have used ever since switching over to electric shavers (I have purchased five different electric shavers before purchasing the Braun Cool Tec shaver) and is well-worth the money.</li>
            <li> The battery does not have a very large capacity so if traveling for more than a couple of shaves worth</li>
            <li> Setup was easy and everything was provided to get you started right away.</li>
            <li> The head pops right off and is easily rinsed, as is the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li> This was a very good razor, but I have to admit that I use it mainly for in between standard razor shaves.</li>
            <li> It was a close, clean, and cool shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that I need too many passes for a good shave, a lot fewer than the Norelco in fact.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that I need too many passes for a good shave, a lot fewer than the Norelco in fact.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning solution is really cool and it leaves the razor smelling clean.  </li>
            <li> But I will use this Cooltec as my travel shaver as its much more compact, certainly good enough as a daily shaver, and ‚Äì since I fall for almost every gimmick ‚Äì has a cool bar that makes my face feel nice in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best if you trim it first, then use this shaver after, to clean it up a little and create the look</li>
            <li> and it is certainly the most &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; electric I have tried.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo through a special program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> I still have to make repeated passes over certain portions of my face, mostly around my mouth and on my neck.</li>
            <li> It cuts closely and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It cleans the shaver well enough, but I think I can get as good of a clean if I just did it myself.  </li>
            <li> it makes sure your razor is clean and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine because you get a full shave&#x27;s worth of juice in 5 minutes, just as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> I keep having to clean up with a cartridge razor to get an actual good shave out of the device.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about it and really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t chafe your skin no matter how hard you press it against your skin, but in order to get the closest shave possible, you will have to apply a good amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li> I was immediately thrilled about the CoolTec system that keeps the head of the shaver very cool for the entire shave, keeping my skin cool and un-irritated.  </li>
            <li> technology is amazing in this thing as far as the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; element.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face especially in the hot shower.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have issues with skin irritation with electric razors but this is just more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers I have owned in the past never did a great job on my neck hairs</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus on my end, and the fact that it has a battery guage telling you how much life you have left in the shaver is great too.</li>
            <li> Who knows why it took so long to think of something so obviously amazing!</li>
            <li> Because of this, I have never really found an electric shaver that works great for me.</li>
            <li> That is definitely cool.</li>
            <li> Clean&amp;Charge Station was really cool and something I have not seen before.</li>
            <li> I say when activated because this system allows you to turn the cool bar on and off.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec system also comes with a travel case and travel lock feature to prevent it from turning on in your luggage-how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can feel that it is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the cleaning station was a really cool added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that if electric razors work well for you, this is a good razor to try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true or not.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely a cool piece of tech</li>
            <li> It does feel cool, and eliminates the need for shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> They told me I was receiving a CoolTec razor that kept my face cool during shaving.</li>
            <li> I let the cooling bar cool off before I started to shave.</li>
            <li> I kept shaving and my face stayed cool.</li>
            <li> the automatic cleaner works wonders and always keeps the blades nice and clear from hair and skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to just slide in and fit snugly in the station, it seems as though you need to manipulate it a bit to make sure that the prongs on the back of the shaver are touching the connectors on the station</li>
            <li> It really just helps to make the whole shaving experience more satisfying.</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea you will understand the need to keep your face cool.</li>
            <li> The technology geek snob in me wants the top of the line series 7 shaver.</li>
            <li> Just a cool gimmick trying to make a sell.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that this Cool Tec could dethrone Norelco&#x27;s nifty 3D blades, but the Braun&#x27;s Cool Technology piqued my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good thing we got Prime now, since I know I&#x27;ll never find them locally.</li>
            <li> But the Cool Tec is just ...</li>
            <li> But the Cool Tec is just ...</li>
            <li> the Cool bar thing was really sweet.</li>
            <li> My wife even commented on how nice and soft my skin</li>
            <li> It was really cool and kept my face from feeling the heat of the electric blades.  </li>
            <li> cool.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation felt like a cool breeze on your face and gave a sense of freshness to it.</li>
            <li> It was a good feeling and made your skin feel rejuvenated after the you got used to the initial exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packing was cool.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered a Braun CoolTech razor to review, I went in with somewhat of a bias, but the razor sounded cool</li>
            <li> I have come to the conclusion that it is a good razor to use in combination with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cool Tec shaver has provided a quality shave, comparable to when I used razors.  </li>
            <li> I turned on the cool bar on and began shaving.</li>
            <li> The skin truly feels cool to the touch and provides an invigorating feel.</li>
            <li> Works extermely well and the CoolTec feature is cool...</li>
            <li> I could tell the razor would get cool but never felt 44 degrees.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to be a good product overall</li>
            <li> Keep your skin cool</li>
            <li> Keep your skin cool</li>
            <li> I havent found many electric shavers which I like too much.</li>
            <li> Which is good , since I usually only get that close of a shave with my Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> Now the cooling bar on this thing is surprisingly cool.  </li>
            <li> I figured it does such a good job with my face</li>
            <li> the Braun Cool Tec shaver system has a built in cleaner and lubricator.  </li>
            <li> This feature is designed to cool your skin and reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li> CoolTec System via a program run by Braun, and really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I like knowing that my shaver is getting a full cleaning and being sanitized without any effort on my part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if the price of the razor is a concern it will be good to note that there will be additional future fees to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s shaving system through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> By keeping your skin cool during shaving, the ¬∞CoolTec shaver minimizes redness, burning and itching sensations and leaves skin cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll like this when I give a full face shave.  </li>
            <li> but it does have some really cool features.</li>
            <li> I was in full beard mode when I got my CoolTec through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I thought the Braun Cool Tec shaver worked well.  </li>
            <li> Overall, i was very pleased with the shaver and enjoy the cool feeling when i go to shave.  </li>
            <li> (Everything from the packaging to the design of the shaver itself is cool and ergonomic).  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good electrice razor.</li>
            <li> After a couple passes, the cool sensation did feel soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does leave a cool feeling on the face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool.</li>
            <li> The Cooltec feature is cool</li>
            <li> : It does a good job on the bigger surfaces.</li>
            <li> Returning the Cool - Tec&lt;br /&gt;2  </li>
            <li> but I have a full beard</li>
            <li> Keeping it simple is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I have also always preferred a rotary shaver because I did not get a good shave with the last foil shaver I tried.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to say that I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything before and gotten the cool, soothing sensation that this gives.</li>
            <li> But because its a Braun, and it does have some cool features (pun intended)</li>
            <li> This unit utilizes a CoolTec bar that keeps cool and soothes the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice feature particularly on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> Its almost a relaxing experience to have the cool metal brush against your cheeks.</li>
            <li> In my 25 years of shaving, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of gimmicks come and go and most of them really didn&#x27;t add anything to the shave.</li>
            <li> This is a cool idea for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used the razor four times before I came back to write a review because I wanted to give it a fair go.</li>
            <li> Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not So Cool Stuff:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll NEVER get as close a shave as with a regular razor, it does a fairly good job for an electric.  </li>
            <li> The cool bar is a neat feature</li>
            <li> They were just good enough.</li>
            <li> It does work, it does feel cool, and is pleasant(although</li>
            <li> But for full price?</li>
            <li> Anyway cool idea on paper,</li>
            <li> I like the cool feeling of the bar on my face and had no burning after.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good shaving system and gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CoolTec is surprising quiet for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It does cool the skin while shaving&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like cool rag against your skin without the redness after a close shave.</li>
            <li> Then the moment of truth, would this thing actually shave good?</li>
            <li> Better than the really pricy 7000 which it is replacing.</li>
            <li> But the Braun cool shaver does what it says  it would do and that it would take the redness out and cool your skin .</li>
            <li> Another cool feature of this Braun shaver is the speed at which it recharges the battery.  </li>
            <li> I just dont feel like I get a good shave with an electric razor and really prefer a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; disposable blade razor.</li>
            <li> That is just cool.</li>
            <li> but after the initial shock absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m more impressed than I expected to be.  </li>
            <li> The Cooling System is a piece of metal that, you guessed it, gets cool during shaving.</li>
            <li> Quick, clean, and efficient</li>
            <li> It drains the battery faster and it doesn&#x27;t really make the shave any better.</li>
            <li> There are two holders/chargers that come with this system, both of which are very sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;REFRESHINGLY COOL</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first day after the shave and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would be able to skip using lotion to cool my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no a bad thing though because the added weight doesn&#x27;t make it cumbersome to hold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t prefer the shaver it&#x27;s not shockingly bad.  </li>
            <li> No razor burn, feels fresh, cool, light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok the trimmer works great, that&#x27;s nice but not terribly surprising.  </li>
            <li> The two blades contour nicely to my face without much effort, the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice if you&#x27;re in a hot shower, and the handle fits easily in my hand and has enough weight to feel a little luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two blades contour nicely to my face without much effort, the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice if you&#x27;re in a hot shower, and the handle fits easily in my hand and has enough weight to feel a little luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, as of right now I&#x27;m very satisfied but not quite sure if I&#x27;m ready to through away my old manual razor just</li>
            <li> I plan to enjoy the new CoolTec razer for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new, more advanced machine</li>
            <li> it is decent and the cooling technology is new and pleasant.</li>
            <li> The CoolTech is nice, quality shaving system and is definitely worth a look should you be on the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really stand the beard anymore, so I thought it would be a good time and pull out my new Cooltec</li>
            <li> Speaking of CoolTec, this is a great feature, that while you may think is gimmicky, actually feels very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> The cooling strip is an excellent idea and really did reduce the skin irritation that I typically had to endure after shaving.</li>
            <li> hey it&#x27;s free right,</li>
            <li> The shaver does feel super cool once the feature is turned on.</li>
            <li> I however was not as impressed with the closeness of the shave, i had to use a disposable razor to clean up several areas that it would not get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> cleaning option is great and it only takes a couple minutes to have a fully clean and lubricated razor ready to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a cleaning station that is super cool.</li>
            <li> expected the cooling system to be a novelty, but it&#x27;s actually very effective.  </li>
            <li> After trying both the regular setting as well as the cool setting, I have to say that both were pretty nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is really nice as well and did a great job cleaning the shaver after a shave ‚Äì much better than I would have done ‚Äì and it only takes a few minutes and its done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the sleekness of the razor, and the awesome cooling sensation that seems to actually keep the irritation away, this entire system is very well-designed and stylish.</li>
            <li> have to say there were a lot of things to like about the razor and the CoolTec feature: close shave, calm skin, cool feel, quick charge, familiar Braun charging and cleaning station, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor for anyone who likes a smooth, clean shave!</li>
            <li> When I received this razer from Braun as part of a promotion, there wasn&#x27;t really any special events occurring for me, so I just went with it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave, again, wasn&#x27;t really all that effective.  </li>
            <li> The reasonably priced &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; refill packages keep the shaver very clean and ultra sanitary....</li>
            <li> My Norelco still works great, and certainly cost enough.</li>
            <li> My Norelco still works great, and certainly cost enough.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product works great</li>
            <li> cleaning system works great as I am used to with my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other great thing is that this is a system.</li>
            <li> But with the cool tech after using for more than a week daily my face is in tip top shape no break outs no irritation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna spend money on a shaver, why not spend a little more and get a really good one?</li>
            <li> would use this razor every day if I needed to stay fresh and clean and presentable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the active cooling technology is great and it does its job</li>
            <li> cleaning station works well and leaves the razor with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> cleaning station works well and leaves the razor with a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> cleaning in charging station feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li> i was super stoked.</li>
            <li> After a quick charge I had to give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to people that are looking for a great electric razor that gives a very close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> It will give me a super close shave while keeping my face chilled (from the built in cooling system.</li>
            <li> I quickly plugged it in</li>
            <li> As far as being an actual shaver goes, though, it was incredibly disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never shaved as close or quick as a razor in addition</li>
            <li> The cooling bar has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> While i did find the cooling feature innovative and refreshing, it&#x27;s not exactly necessary.</li>
            <li> Nothing a quick stroke with a disposable can&#x27;t fix, however.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is isopropyl alcohol based for sterilizing the razor &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; allowing for quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually mitigated this by using after shave or lotions, but what this razor has done is very innovative and honestly has saved me a lot of money in aftershave and skin lotions.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed no skin irritation, no drag on the skin and over all a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> , Fast charge, 4+ shaves per charge, Easy clean &amp; charge, Trimmer included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cos</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best overall shaver that I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I need a quick, close shave&amp;#34; shaver.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job and left my skin very</li>
            <li> It does a great job and fits very well in my hand for being a larger guy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s solid, a comfortable weight and has nice grips.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The foils do pivot side-to-side which is adequate for the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> The charging is super</li>
            <li> When I use the Braun CoolTec, I can get a quick shave and run off to whatever I need to do.  </li>
            <li> The shaver heads clog quickly too, and</li>
            <li> However, if you are mainly after a close shave, there are better options in the price range without the cooling</li>
            <li> As a 30 something male that absolutely hates shaving, I have found the Braun CoolTec System to be a great razor.  </li>
            <li> I had to shave quickly</li>
            <li> and this razor did not come close to quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did feel the cooling sensation coming from the razor which did feel good, but it was not cutting the facial hairs off like</li>
            <li> This razor definitely cut better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; aspect of this shaver was extraordinary.</li>
            <li> The pores would open and thus allowing more hair to protrude giving you a better shave.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, being fully waterproof is a huge plus that I honestly didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li> Maybe a quick start guide with color pictures</li>
            <li> received the razor through a program run by Braun and have never been more satisfied with a personal grooming device!</li>
            <li> The equipment added to clean the shaver is easy fast to set up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not as quick as a safety razor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the long-term cooling effect improves irritation, but the instant cooling effect feels nice and seems to provide a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The best way I can equate the cooling feature is if you put a cold can of soda on your warm face/forehead.  </li>
            <li> the cooling effect left my face feeling great and it cut very close to the skin..</li>
            <li> is the ability to drain the blade rather quickly after the cleaning since the liquid tend to drip all over.</li>
            <li> so it dries up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using this shaving system, I could never get an adequate shave.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver has been in FREQUENT use for over 4 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver which was provided via a program run by Braun, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would probably say that this razor best suits somebody who shaves every single day, as it seemed to struggle to do anything to even a light beard, and could not evenly trim very short hair.</li>
            <li> Not quite the absolute baby smooth fine feeling (across the grain, so to speak), but very close and very adequate for a day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric  razor for many years and was impressed with how the CoolTec left little irritation.</li>
            <li> Shaver also leaves your skin feeling very refreshed and feeling very cool.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s just ok but might be good for someone with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great shaver and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I found that it was not as close a shave as I normally get from a razor which meant shaving more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently grown a &amp;#34;chinstrap beard&amp;#34;, and while I can maintain it with this unit, it requires far too much work to doso without taking out a chunk of a perfectly manicured line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently grown a &amp;#34;chinstrap beard&amp;#34;, and while I can maintain it with this unit, it requires far too much work to doso without taking out a chunk of a perfectly manicured line.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son who has been using his father&#x27;s for years and was so excited to finally have his own.  </li>
            <li> Braun shaver owner and enjoy their products and the features that are offered, but this by far was the most exciting.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec keeps my face cool and calm.</li>
            <li> the cooling feature is cool and does calm the skin</li>
            <li> I received this shaving system through a free promotion from Braun and first thing I will say is the design wasn&#x27;t overly bulky in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric razor and was provided to me through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> There is a bar that sits in the middle between the foil elements that draws heat away from the foil and is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Pretty close and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the flip side to the razor.</li>
            <li> I never would have changed on my own simply because I dealt with what was familiar.  </li>
            <li> I first got the Braun CoolTec Shaving System via a program with Braun for free</li>
            <li> think this shaver sits in a niche market, those who don&#x27;t need to shave often, or can&#x27;t due to sensitive skin,and don&#x27;t need a perfect shave when they do.  </li>
            <li> First off I received this shaver for free as part of a marketing program.</li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and for an electric razor, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar in the middle of the razor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar in the middle of the razor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> , the bar keeps my face cool and calm while shavings so on that front</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec electric razor through a program run by Braun and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I am still quite pleased with the razor and think that the cooltec feature is a nice addition to an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I think the Braun CoolTec is an innovative product and will definitely be loved by a lot of individuals, especially those with sensitive skin that suffer from irritation.</li>
            <li> The sensation is surprising at first, but ultimately provides a cool, fresh-feeling shave.</li>
            <li> When using the razor the cooling effect was really strange, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li> The cooling works good and makes difference but not WOW as you expect .</li>
            <li> The aluminum cooling bar is not cold, just cool.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is rather large but easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great if you have already trimmed your beard down to a \\&quot;1\\&quot; or lower.</li>
            <li> gives me a nice clean shave same as my Series 7.</li>
            <li> The next shave starts out nice and clean just like it should.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action leaves the blades clean and provide a better shave.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase the cool tec shaver, as I was hoping it would be the \\&quot;magic bullet\\&quot; in my desire to get a clean, close shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> I recently starting using the Braun Cool Tec electric shaver (as I recently received it through a program with Braun) and I have been pretty impressed with the overally shave and how close to the skin the razor gets.  </li>
            <li> Although you feel the cooling action of the aluminum bar, its still no replacement for a  good pre shave lotion like Lectric Shave or an actual shave gel or foam which I currently use with my ES-LA63 with great</li>
            <li> I was able to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> &quot; November is over, I was finally able to use my new Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li> Once I made the adjustment, I started to get better results from the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely my new favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with my new Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> my new primary shaver and will be recommending it!</li>
            <li> Every generation of new Braun product keeps getting better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only experienced very mild irritation once with this razor and that was probably my fault for pressing it too hard to my face the first time I used it as I didn&#x27;t know how easily and effectively it would cut the &amp;#34;little</li>
            <li> like the CoolTec cooling band, it seems to cool your face right away, feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great product and leaves your face less irritated, I would have not used it on my dome if it didn&#x27;t work so well on my face.</li>
            <li> This cooltec system has greatly reduced the amount of redness, and soreness over my previous electric.  </li>
            <li> : I really wish it would provide a closer shave, as I really do enjoy the cool tec technology on the shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaving system broke the mold and also left my face feeling cool after the shave which I really liked.</li>
            <li> razor was easy to setup, as the instructions explained the process reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> - i don&#x27;t shave daily and don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m perfectly clean shaven, but to give a fair review, this shaver didn&#x27;t give that closer of a shave.</li>
            <li> the shaver felt cool and light on my skin and it was really giving me a shave....</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is water proof and cleans easily</li>
            <li> travel charger worked pretty good, but the kit I received only had 1 power cable that had to be shared between the travel  charging sled and the cleaning/charging</li>
            <li> the Cooltec shaver  is beefy but quite ergonomic and easily to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li> This gets a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works as good as they say that it does in the ads.</li>
            <li> Setup was easy straight out of the box</li>
            <li> Battery life seems pretty good, I can go a week+ on one charge so on short trips all you need</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it at first, since we are all used to the notion of a &amp;#34;hot shave&amp;#34;, but I find it to be really soothing.</li>
            <li> That first shaver was awesome, it signified my transition to manhood, but it was ultimately a heaping pile of junk and soon replaced with a regular razor as it just did not give as close or as quick a shave.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to get as good coverage with this razor as I have been able to with other products (most recently a Philipps/Norelco Senso Touch).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a smooth, clean shave in areas that are easy to get to and have to make some adjustments in other areas.  </li>
            <li> On top of all that, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other systems would clean, but not as good as the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> tried it couple more times and it worked better with the hairs pretty short.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost, what a generous thing for them to do!  </li>
            <li> was so excited when i first received Braun CoolTec razor System from</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job but is it worth the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor for the past 11 years and loved it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to keep it because the cool feature felt really good, but the shave was just not close enough</li>
            <li> I was excited to see a razor that did not get really hot when you are using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first time using the shaver I was sold!  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the shaver was the price, almost $200 retail?!  </li>
            <li> cleaning station is amazing, really does make it like a new shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, great new technology -- I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw the new &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out this new shaver as I have been wanting to ditch the disposal</li>
            <li> always get very excited to try new technology, and because of a program run by Braun I was provided with a CoolTec electric shaver to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out this new</li>
            <li> recharging dock is really easy to use and the cleaning fluid guarantees a more thorough cleansing of your equipment.</li>
            <li> Charging, cleaning and most other maintenance is very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is great for what it is, but I would love to have something that can really cut some long hairs AND give me a smooth shave in one.</li>
            <li> This is an innovative product and has great potential, it just didn&#x27;t give me as clean a shave as other products have.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as a straight razor but for someone trying to avoid skin issues this is fine trade.</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I put it in the charger/cleaning system and let it clean before I shaved for my first time.</li>
            <li> The auto clean feature is pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is thoughtfully designed and the built-in cleaner / charger combo is a smart idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly a high-tech well manufactured piece of equipment and is extremely comfortable to hold, use and shave with.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to use a nice electric razor for my shaving instead of always using shaving cream and a multiblade razor thinking that this will be quicker, more convenient and give me a nice close shave without slight razor burn or possible nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little strip of cooling surface feels great against my face, and it also seems to reduce the irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to anyone who wants a cool clean shave</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no irritation or redness, just a cool clean feeling that I really enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin was calm and not irritated</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the cooling feature is nice - really better than the gimmicky feature it sounds</li>
            <li> I got this electric shaver a few days ago through a program run by Braun and it works great.</li>
            <li> must say that I am very grateful that Braun gave me this razor to enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Still, for a product that I got for free, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> This is the ideal &amp;#34;running late for work</li>
            <li> I plan on traveling with work soon and hope that I enjoy it on the road as much as I have at home.</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely smooth and very close, even without using a preshave lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like the performance of the shaver and the resulting smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well, and is accurate...</li>
            <li> It really does make a huge difference in skin irritation and razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CoolTec System is fantastic, I got to try this razor thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li> The travel case gives the razor a very snug fit, however, there is no room for the charging cradle, or the cord, as my 8000 series case does.  </li>
            <li> the indicator light went off and it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It provides a great shave for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the CoolTec is an intriguing option, it did nothing to help enhance my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.  </li>
            <li> I truly wanted to like this razor, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any kind of razor blades again.</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased this razor on my own because of that (since there are cheaper models out there that likely work just as well).</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> and it is worth the price of the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the cooling strip is novel and pretty cool</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shave is still good-- just not AS good, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I would definitely buy it on my own.  </li>
            <li> I have travelled with the CoolTec and miss the fact that I don&#x27;t have a fresh razor in the morning.  </li>
            <li> For a razor, the Braun CoolTec is quite fun to play with, when you consider all of its features.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t necessary but it is nice.</li>
            <li> long time to get a true close shave - had to go over some areas 15-20 times just to try to get a smooth shave (mostly on the neckline&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> I do not feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But I prefer Norelco&#x27;s cleaning solution; it&#x27;s cheaper and seems to be more readily available locally.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec is a pretty cool shaver, no pun</li>
            <li> the auto-cleaner device is pretty cool to use.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar did scare me as the possibility of a gimmick, but in reality it really is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> My first impressions of the Cool Bar was that it felt like a mini air conditioner for my face.</li>
            <li> correctly&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;not having success yet.</li>
            <li> It was securely packaged but didn‚Äôt require the jaws of life to open as many things</li>
            <li> stand that comes with the razor is pretty cool in the fact that it cleans to razor for you with alcohol at the push of a button and also charges the razor between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He had about a days worth of porcupine like growth.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint really has nothing to do with this awesome razor:</li>
            <li> also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.</li>
            <li> The skin at first does feel cool from the \\&quot;Cooltec</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand and will not slip even if wet.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec part of this razor is a feature that surprised me the most.</li>
            <li> I honestly will never go back to a blade!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would work on some people&#x27;s faces, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That means you&#x27;ll need a second sculpting razor handy.  </li>
            <li> The shave i better thsan my old electric shavers</li>
            <li> Overall I would say this is a great razor geared for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For me, who at times has sensitive skin, it really was a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside was that the shave was not as close as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Personally, I won&#x27;t use the cleaning solution after every use but this is the only real downside to this wonderful razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had been about 2 weeks worth of growth.</li>
            <li> Not only is a nice feeling on your face as I think it cools the skin for an optimal</li>
            <li> Love the cooling feature, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Cooltec as part of a promotion from Braun, and I have thus far highly enjoyed this experience.</li>
            <li> I like that it came with a two different charging stations -- one for cleaning/charging (also a nice feature) and the cradle for just charging.</li>
            <li> As far as the closeness of the shave, I still think my 5 blade manual razor does a better job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool, pun intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a really nice case for it and smaller charging cradle.</li>
            <li> It was nice to have it simple.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Power plug when plugged into the main unit easily pulls out, even without moving the unit.  </li>
            <li> It also had a nice travel pouch to carry the shaver with me outside of the house.</li>
            <li> Also the item is very bulky, so be sure to have enough space in your bathroom counter top before you purchase it.</li>
            <li> So far though I&#x27;m enjoying the Cooltech.</li>
            <li> so that made it much better since my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First impression is that the thing is cool, cool as in really neat.</li>
            <li> This is my 3 one, and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It actually feels nice to shave.  </li>
            <li> Dual wide heads do a good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> cleaning system is a nice gimmick, but not necessary or worth the expense of having to buy replacement cartridges of solution.  </li>
            <li> so I start with my cheeks before moving to the more sensitive areas on the neck.</li>
            <li> During my first shave I noticed it didn&#x27;t cut as closely as I would have liked on the first or second pass over my skin but after working it around for awhile I got the desired result of a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Now, as for the cooling action... I thought it was a gimmick, but now I know better.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with skin irritation from razors the better part of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> But after 6 years, I thought it was worth it, and that is why I decided to go with Braun again.</li>
            <li> , so far I love the razor.</li>
            <li> That cool bar soothes my skin as I shave and keeps my face from getting hot and irritated.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> bought a nice Norelco but still fought with the irritation of a daily shave.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar is a nice touch, and does seem to improve the overall experience.  </li>
            <li> The hair trimmer on the back side of the shaver is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the CoolTec system if you looking for a nice hand help wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and cooling feature is really neat and different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth checking this out if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> After years of rarely shaving, I decided to try The Braun CoolTec Shaving System.</li>
            <li> All in all though, as far as electric razors go, the Braun CoolTec is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of rarely shaving, I decided to try The Braun CoolTec Shaving System.</li>
            <li> All in all though, as far as electric razors go, the Braun CoolTec is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so nice to have a charging system that cleans the razor at the same time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of an electric razor guy, but I was actually quite impressed this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this would have to be the aluminum cooling bar it helps my sensitive skin from getting razor burn &amp; irritation.</li>
            <li> I would rather not have the charging cradle, and would prefer to be able to plug the cord directly into my razor for charging and shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet for an electric razor too which is nice.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s around 5 bucks a month to keep the cleaning solution flowing, but for now, it&#x27;s worth every of those 500 pennies.)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, though, and overall, this product provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and for that it deserves praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may need to follow up with a pass of a traditional blade to ensure closeness, which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Either price point is WELL worth</li>
            <li> I believe the Packaging kit is worth it because it comes with extras that are actually useful .&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It DOES have a cool feeling when shaving... which was somewhat surreal.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> If it prevents my shaver from clogging up then it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> travel dock is a useful addition, allowing you to charge the shaver out of the cleaning dock.  </li>
            <li> and I found a nice spot under my sink to set the system until next time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used it dry with the cool mode on and it actually does a very good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if this is true as its one of my main issues with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning of this razor is easy, just slide off the blue sleeve remove the heads, shake over a can, and it&#x27;s clean!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the Cooltec shaver and will be continuing to use it as my new primary electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My current Braun doesn&#x27;t have a fancy cooling bar, but it does a great job with my morning shave, so I was interested to see how well the new Braun CoolTec system worked in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean the idea of being able to shave without using water and shaving cream sounds good.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s razor is very smooth and only requires a couple of passes for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive the cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System.  </li>
            <li> , one important note is that the cradle is very large and takes up a decent amount of counter space, couple that with the $5 cartridges it can get pricey quick.</li>
            <li> I love the no mess cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to say that this is an excellent product due to the drawbacks I&#x27;ve mentioned above but the unique cooling technology is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the shaver was also freshly cleaned was noticeable as well, it kept the blades very smooth and lubricated, unlike any electric shaver I had experienced previously, even when freshly cleaned with a third party lubricating agent.  </li>
            <li> So overall i would highly recommend it, and one of my favorite parts is how easy they made it to clean.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested in how the system would work when I first heard about it and was excited to start using it.  </li>
            <li> you drop it in, hit a button and walk away, next time you are ready for a shave, your razor is there waiting for you, nice and clean and all charged up.</li>
            <li> This is extremely important with guys with sensitive skin as the irritation is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I can enjoy a fast, smooth close shave in between my main shaves and it doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this out when I first received it.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver for a week, and while the cooling part of the unit is a very interesting effect, the fact that the head does not pivot really limited my ability to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a a clean and charge station that not only recharges the razor in between uses but also cleans the blades and lubricates them to keep them in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> So seriously, this razor is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li> This unit is much quieter than the older unit I had and more compact.  </li>
            <li> I can attest that compared to many of Braun&#x27;s older shavers, this feature does work very well.</li>
            <li> In lieu of this, you can clean the shave under running water and invest in a bottle of Shaver Saver to get the same results but with more manual intervention.</li>
            <li> When I think electric razor I think quick and easy, but this was far from what happened.</li>
            <li> The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is flat out amazing.</li>
            <li> Other then that, its been a good shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver and the cleaning system were just as good as other braun models (i have also used the series 5).</li>
            <li> If Braun were to change just a couple other things about this shaver, it would have a superior product on its hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they always keep their products modernized and with this Cool Technology, they are taking a big leap in whats to come in the innovative and fresh world of shaving.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar in between the shaver blades does a good job cooling the skin to circumvent shaver burns and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn‚Äôt irritated after shaving, and the cleaning system did a good job just like my other Braun system.</li>
            <li> CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is an upgrade compared to other electric shavers but for me it still is not as good as an &amp;#34;old fashion razor.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a niche product, its designed extremely well, built like a tank, and reliable like any good razor should be.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Just plug in (although the plug could have a longer cord; but I solved that by stretching the included one out for it to work), drop in the CoolTec and flip to the right</li>
            <li> This shaver just didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel right&#x27; to me</li>
            <li> the cooling bar was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> The Seven series can plug right into it&#x27;s cord.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs well made and has the right amount of ‚Äúheft.‚Äù  </li>
            <li> I also wish that the cord plugged right into the razor (allowing me to shave while it is plugged in) instead of plugging into the charging station.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box you will notice a difference with this system.</li>
            <li> This program came at the right time.</li>
            <li> Taking part in Movember, and have to keep the right trim</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the right razor for me</li>
            <li> However, the cooling tech does in fact do one thing right, and that is prevent/</li>
            <li> I also like the set-up / holder- which I put right on my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> (it is a shaver, right?)</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t chafe right away</li>
            <li> and I could not feel it right away, but</li>
            <li> So although I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this for others of you it might be something that is right up your alley, I am just not a fan of electric razors and this did not sway me to start liking them.</li>
            <li> You need to practice to get it right</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> my Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The cooling function is defaulted to On so it started cooling right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> system not only does the job from a clean shave standpoint, but it also is a very unique experience.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s another positive: all the hair stays inside the head of the shaver!  </li>
            <li> This new razor allows me to freely shave my face and neck without having to worry about the red streaks of skin irritation from a warm razor surface.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, I will keep using it for quick touch ups on my face and head, but when I wantto look extra fly, there is nothing better than my plain ol&#x27; razor with shaving cream,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for several weeks now and it is still as amazing as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off it charges extremely fast and has a Led light display to make everything easier to see.</li>
            <li> But I will have to stick to a straight razor when I want a truly clean mug.</li>
            <li> It gives a clean shave, retains its charge well, and recharges fast when needed.</li>
            <li> After a month of no shaving during Movember, I was ready to clean up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I was more than willing to try the CoolTec and give my Series 7 a rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the shaver for about two full weeks, I am still satisfied with the overall use and results from the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It takes many passes to even get short hairs and it feels like the cool bar detracts from the shave quality by spacing out two of the foil elements.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much hair that going to build up under the blades, and it&#x27;s easy enough to remove the top of the trimmer and rinse it</li>
            <li> at first I&#x27;m taken aback by the different sensation, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> It really does clean well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From there the main razor did the rest, getting my face smooth with no effort.</li>
            <li> Having a separate charging dock that takes the exact same cord was nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> But every now and then I do have to go clean shaven, and I really dislike razors</li>
            <li> I just pop it in there to charge and it keeps it clean, ready to go and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun provides a close clean shave and does not make too much noise.  </li>
            <li> :clean system runs our to fast for cost&lt;br /&gt;3.Not</li>
            <li> It is also much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the latest innovation is the cool bar on the razor head.  </li>
            <li> To summarize, ok shave, but better than the average electric razor.  </li>
            <li> everything is clean, charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer works great, but it&#x27;s nothing innovative; other electric razors have this feature.  </li>
            <li> When i received this shaver from braun through a special program i wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> cleaning station is very large for a bathroom where there isn&#x27;t a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> Station very large.</li>
            <li> I had a light beard at the time of shaving, which should be easily taken care of by a razor such as this one.</li>
            <li> Finally, it&#x27;s still light and easy to hold despite the added gadgetry within, making shaving easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was Braun Activator which worked for me about 9 years and was the top at the time I bought it, I believe that this CT2CC is better shaver than Braun Activator .</li>
            <li> The cooling element really works and it would easy the transition from a real razor to electric.</li>
            <li> customer service - 5 stars - took care of my problem and made what I was sure was going to be a frustrating ordeal into a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning system and this version allows to you control how often it cleans so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of fluid quickly.  </li>
            <li> It ran great for two weeks on a single charge (YMMV), and it is completely sealed so you can use it in the shower,</li>
            <li> It really does stay cool.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast it became cool.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, I have been looking for a great electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cool sensation when shaving, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a cleaning unit that looks really cool, but appears to be very impractical.  </li>
            <li> it kept sensitive areas from becoming irritated which I always have issues with when shaving.</li>
            <li> This system really does leave the skin feeling closely shaven and cool.  </li>
            <li> The cool tech feature really does cool the shaving area and really did seem to keep off any skin irritations.</li>
            <li> My whole thought process on buying shavers has changed forever after getting the Braun Cool Tec shaver through a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> top of the cooling comfort, the adaptable three stage cutting system with the Sensoblade provides and excellent, very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I get a close shave, the cool tec option really helps with getting the hair close and it sooths the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It really does cool your face a</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that I have used that was useful, without giving me the nose-need-to-sneeze-tickle that all the others seem to do.  </li>
            <li> travel case that comes with the system is a great improvement over others in the past.  </li>
            <li> The cool bar in the shaver really helps.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the CoolTec was just going to be marketing filler, but it really did feel cool while shaving.</li>
            <li> It was worth trying, although I do not think I would have purchased if I had not had a chance to try it first.</li>
            <li> You really think about the cool sensation each time you shave.</li>
            <li> I will say I use a cartridge most of the time, because I have a heavy beard, and a cartridge has always been far superior in providing a close shave on my neck without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li> . Does not shave as closely as a straight razor, but that is true with all electric razors, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and frequently have razor burn, but with the cooling bar on the razor, i&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the design of the razor head with the cool strip, it doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave without a LOT of passes over your face.  </li>
            <li> After all it is known as a hot shave and not a cold one.</li>
            <li> Also, due to the coolig head that is ceramic it gives you a nice cool feeling while you are shaving</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun electric shavers in the past with mostly good results and was excited to try this one out as it was provided via a program by Braun.</li>
            <li> battery life is pretty good, in comparison with other wireless systems in the price range.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be easy to use right out of the box and feel like it will be a shaver that will last with me for a good long while.</li>
            <li> The design and feel of the razor is good and fits in your hands with ease which i think is very important when shaving due to the constant movements.</li>
            <li> I have had some sort of facial har for the last ten years, so I didn&#x27;t completely clean shave, but this razor is the perfect match.  </li>
            <li> I have had Braun shavers in the past and have loved the clean and renew system.  </li>
            <li> all I really need is a great shave and the CoolTec delivers.reen when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed right away was the cooling system on my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different shavers and electric and other wise but hadn&#x27;t found one that wouldn&#x27;t cause me problems after using it, until I got my Braun CoolTec Shaving System free to try from Braun.</li>
            <li> My previous experiences haven&#x27;t been good.  </li>
            <li> I really would like the razor to be warm as to open and relax my hair</li>
            <li> The refills for the cleaning feature come three to a pack and are easy to switch out with the old cartridge.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensetive and the cool technology really works!</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, simple to use, and the zipper case, makes traveling easier as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because its cordless, so you can use it in the shower, it&#x27;s rechargeable, so you don&#x27;t need batteries and the best part is the self cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a Panasonic electric razor that worked fairly well, but I have needed to replace the blade too often in order to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a nice long charge, I had my first shave.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, I have to say that this might be the best electric razor I have every used.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the machine, I dint use the cool tech to see how much of the difference was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a traditional shaving cream, and straight razor kind of guy.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system through a program offer by Braun and was presently surprised on how easily it was to set up and use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried this, but the instructions are clear and should be easily</li>
            <li> The cooling bar is great, but regular charging (every 2-3 shaves) is necessary for it to work.</li>
            <li> If I shave every day, it does the job nicely because it keeps hair growth to a minimum, but if you like to skip a few days at a time between shaves, it can take a while to get that smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a great shaver as far as electric shavers are concerned but as you would expect, it will not give you the close shave that you get from a wet shave.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to the feeling and preferred it to my straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Overall if you love electric razors this will be worth</li>
            <li> Although the cooling bar felt awesome and it is probably one of the closest shaves ive had with an electric razor, it did leave me with some irritation a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> I have had several different shavers over the years and none seemed to do great.</li>
            <li> so while you are sitting there, annoyed with the amount of time it&#x27;s taking to trim your &#x27;stache, you&#x27;re also dealing with the added frustration of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, despite from the trimmer being inadequate for my needs, the CoolTec seems to be a great razor that delivers a comfortable and close shave even to the standards of someone as picky as myself.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was the cooling bar, at first it made me jump a little but got used to it pretty quick and after time, it felt really good and helped to keep irritation at bay.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to any of my friends who enjoy a good, clean shave; especially those with sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li> you want a clean-shaven look, and as long as you shave every day (every other day at the most), you&#x27;ll be okay with this razor and may even love it.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that stats that the station is not as high of quality as the series 7 Braun clean and charge station.</li>
            <li> The cooling action start pretty quick after pressing the cooling button and leaves the skin feeling clean close shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The cooling action start pretty quick after pressing the cooling button and leaves the skin feeling clean close shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Its only redeeming quality is it&#x27;s barely functional trimmer (you can buy better ones for cheaper).  </li>
            <li> The cool sensation it provides was my favorite part, especially when waking up and getting ready to go in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The cool bar does feel good, but the shaver simply did not cut my hair, so I needed to go over my face countless times to get a half-decent shave.  </li>
            <li> After trimming the longer hair with the handy long hair trimmer, I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shaver went across my face.</li>
            <li> Men that have a goatee or a mustache will be just fine, but if you are doing anything around your jawline, you will experience much frustration in trying to use the main head of this</li>
            <li> Men that have a goatee or a mustache will be just fine, but if you are doing anything around your jawline, you will experience much frustration in trying to use the main head of this</li>
            <li> Once I had it all set up; however, it was pretty clear and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I loved my previous Braun shaver but one of my biggest complaints was how hot it would get; and how my face would burn when finished shaving.</li>
            <li> I was more than excited to try it out as I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past and had been looking for a new model that would be a good option for my sensitive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  </li>
            <li> Razor charges very fast.</li>
            <li> I was very much anti electric before trying this razor.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> CoolTec shaver is very much a specialty razor.</li>
            <li> , I think it would be a great match, but as it is, I will probably go back to using my 7-series most of the time and save this one for maybe vacations when I don&#x27;t want to bring my more expensive shaver on the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the pop-up trimmer very much yet, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the pop-up trimmer very much yet, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Some places such as my chin feel very smooth shaving, however places on the sides of my neck don‚Äôt do as well in the smoothness department.</li>
            <li> It actually helps make the shave feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li> As I stated before, the cooling feature was neat, but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me other than feel good in and of</li>
            <li> The cooling bar is a nice and unique feature, you basically activate it while shaving and the little bar in between the blades will give your skin a nice cool little blast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of use I still stand by my original review in that it is a nice close shave and the cooltec feature is an added benefit.</li>
            <li> Use in the shower - as I typically shave in the shower, it was great to have a new razor that also works in the shower -</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out the new shaver.</li>
            <li> As a new user to electric shavers, I was excited to learn that I was chosen to participate in a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 year user of a Norelco circular blade shavor, and I was excited to be a part of a program that allowed me to try out something new.  </li>
            <li> , I was so excited to try something to new.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer of the \\&quot;3 floating heads \\&quot; for years easy to use but always got the red blotches on my neck.</li>
            <li> Despite my negative comments it does a good clean shave for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It is what I&#x27;d call a middle of the line electric that does a decent job with a nice feature to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; your face while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very fast when I first started using a manual razor, so</li>
            <li> I have never been able find a shaver that has done a great job QUICKLY without irritation for those days that I‚Äôm running late and need to go out the door or when I‚Äôve got dry</li>
            <li> It did a good job with making your face look clean shaven, but a swipe of the hand told me it was just short enough not to really see</li>
            <li> If that is the case that&#x27;s a huge disadvantage, as I do travel fairly frequently for a week at a time</li>
            <li> The idea of it was pretty \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, however after using for a week</li>
            <li> I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 standard razor and this is way better.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to work better on my head than it did on my face.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the cooling feature, where an aluminum cooling bar is chilled to reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> I also managed to get a pretty close shave as well.</li>
            <li> I used to use electric razors almost exclusively then switched back to manual ones (since I do most of my shaving the shower).</li>
            <li> I first got my razor</li>
            <li> I have never once felt the razor get hot</li>
            <li> It is more of a daily maintenance shaver.  </li>
            <li> It has two foils which help catch whatever you miss on the first pass.</li>
            <li> I first got this razor, I told my brother (who is an electric guy through and through)</li>
            <li> so this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> At first touch I had my reservations when the Braun CoolTec razor was provided to me through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> After all, this was the first shaver that I had with the cooling technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small charging station is also great and it was ready within an hour of opening the package.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about it I thought &amp;</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s exactly the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a couple of days now and overall am pleased with the way it performs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that my face was hot and the feeling of an electric shaver was better than trying not to cut my face with traditional razors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And can be rinsed under a stream of hot water.  </li>
            <li> but I thoroughly enjoy the cooling affect of the shaver during shaving and will definitely enjoy using this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this razor</li>
            <li> When I tried it the first time the cooling bar worked well</li>
            <li> For myself and my beard, it will most likely end up under the sink like the rest of them.</li>
            <li> First off, I need to mention I was provided this electric CoolTec shaver as part of a program run by Braun</li>
            <li> how many times I went back and forth over them&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really love the idea of electric shavers but have NEVER found one that actually gives me a quality shave.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty darn</li>
            <li> price component is a big differentiation for many, with almost a $100 difference between the two razors</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me</li>
            <li> my knowledge, Braun was the first to innovate this gimmick.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I haven&#x27;t had to give it a once over with the disposable razor.</li>
            <li> After getting the Braun cooltec razor from a program by Braun, I tried it for the first time</li>
            <li> &#x27;s get started with first impression.</li>
            <li> When I opened up the box the first thing I noticed about the razor was its heft.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar feels exactly like that ...</li>
            <li> the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t going to be my first.</li>
            <li> I was able to repeat each area of my face multiple times and didn&#x27;t experience any shave bumps at all.</li>
            <li> and most recently the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first impression of the CoolTec was the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed the build quality of the CoolTec.  </li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I am just using my girlfriends account with amazon because I don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cooling technology works pretty well also, during the first couple of minutes of a shave you don&#x27;t notice it as well</li>
            <li> but this was pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was how well the cooling element works.</li>
            <li> Finally, not only is the shaver waterproof, but it is even designed to be safe to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and you know exactly where to place your pointer finger and thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last Braun electric shaver I used was an ultra inexpensive razor I purchased at the PX Store at Fort Lee (Army) more than 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was exactly like taking a soda can out of the refrigerator and putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> She thinks my facial hair is better groomed with the cooltec by Braun.</li>
            <li> Each shaver has Braun Optifoil screen which is essential a set of oblong shapes on the foil to catch more hairs.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the smooth shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> but then becomes hot after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> The first day I tried it, I had 3 days growth, and I gave the shaver a work out.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it has been the easiest to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> Second, the cleaning system and extra charging station are perfect, especially if you are the person that shaves in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Next, Ive never been one to be on top of cleaning my shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have always shaved a &amp;#34;dry run,&amp;#34; and my skin reacts to additional products such as the lotions and gels that can be used with many electric razors.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES it!  </li>
            <li> It does pretty well on my face and chin area</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never thought about shaving with the razor being &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, and I was interested in how this was going to work.  </li>
            <li> I was also interested in seeing how the cleaning/charging system would work.  </li>
            <li> It also was great to have a long hair trimmer attached to the back, which allowed me to trim up my mustache.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on first thing when I woke up, and it worked like a beauty.</li>
            <li> My first thoughts after receiving this shaver was all of the items that was included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To test the trimmer (and to make sure it was actually getting power), I touched it to a piece of cardboard.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the cleaning station</li>
            <li> have really enjoyed using this razor, and may not go back to shaving exclusively with a DE Safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Then pop the top back on</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me</li>
            <li> After the first time using the shaver I realized that this was the case.  </li>
            <li> my first shave I was taken aback.  </li>
            <li> and I actually used the shaver more often with</li>
            <li> Plus, I love occasionally skipping shaving with the strait</li>
            <li> I shave every day and while I like the closest shave I can get from a manual razor I am willing to sacrifice some closeness for a still-great shave while avoiding irritation and speeding up the process.</li>
            <li> The cooling technology really works!  </li>
            <li> Not only did this take more time, it increased skim irritation.  </li>
            <li> I think its more meant to get you to use cleaner regularly so you will buy replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Determined to keep an optimistic outlook I decided to use it several more times.</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging seems a bit intimidating, however after putting it together, I was shaving in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec shaver almost seemed too gimicky when I first heard of it.  </li>
            <li> my first shave after the month of MoVember.</li>
            <li> first thing you will immediately notice- as I did- is the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> It feels over-engineered to deliver benefits that more simple shavers can deliver, but, hey, if you want to of the line this is your product.</li>
            <li> I must first say I was trying this shaver as part of a program for Braun.</li>
            <li> but the shave is still very close and worth it.</li>
            <li> but i had to use my razor at the end of the shave to make sure i covered those missed parts and the region above my Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I wish was somewhat better.</li>
            <li> : The solid build, fast and close overall shave and ease of cleaning make it a great product.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this is a series 5 shaver as noted on the box.  </li>
            <li> did ok by my chin and upper lip area  </li>
            <li> After my first time using this razor I can say that it actually does make shaving feel much more</li>
            <li> It definitely made shaving feel more</li>
            <li> As with most electric shavers, you&#x27;re never going to get as close a shave as you would with a traditional blade, but this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m not a fan of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Upon the first use, however, I realized my fears were not founded at all.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty and gadgety.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Overall im pleased with the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one button on the top to start the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was in a rush.  </li>
            <li> Most do not get nearly close enough to give me that smooth feeling and almost all irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver free directly from Braun to test out and review.  </li>
            <li> First, is the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> like I wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li> so I had a pretty dense forest of hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> /week I would suggest going over it with some clippers first.  </li>
            <li> Braun wins and the pricing from Amazon made it a real deal.</li>
            <li> felt like one needed a degree in aeronautical engineering to operate this when I first opened it up.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work to well (numerous days).  </li>
            <li> my first if I had the time).  </li>
            <li> Again, much better than the tiny slide-out trimmer on the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have heard others complain about the cost of refills, but each refill is only about $5-$6 and lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li> Again, much better than the tiny slide-out trimmer on the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have heard others complain about the cost of refills, but each refill is only about $5-$6 and lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li> the back and forth method of shaving leave many areas with hair still on the face, and the adam apple is a nightmare, either you rush and pinch</li>
            <li> first impression was that there were a lot of pieces.</li>
            <li> Most very big and bulky.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a way to only run the razor over my skin once.</li>
            <li> Would I be willing to switch and give up my disposable?</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> Essentially it is like most electric shavers -- a convenience item.</li>
            <li> I have to remember to do it well before bed time, because my wife can hear it even through the closed bathroom door, and if the door is open the bright flashing light bothers her too, so it needs to be done before we go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to comment more than my initial impression here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it over the coming weeks and giving a more in-depth review of actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, 45 days later:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so much better than the manual razor alone.  </li>
            <li> The first time, I used it</li>
            <li> After using my shaver I made sure to check every inch of my skin to see if there was any red blotching, there was none.</li>
            <li> (I use a cartridge razor about 70% of the time - shaving daily), and have always been pleased with that product.  </li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec System through a program run by Braun and I love it.  </li>
            <li> First of all I received this shaver via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> First thing&#x27;s first.  </li>
            <li> first reaction was how substantial the shaver was.</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor that I have been able to use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and all have left my face burning</li>
            <li> overall I just can&#x27;t say I feel in love with</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to go over the same area more than once for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shave quality became better for me.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I can say is that the CoolTec technology does in fact work.  </li>
            <li> It messed with my mind for the first week.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that Braun is satisfied with the results of the CoolTec and decide to incorporate it into their entire razor line.  </li>
            <li> Thought the cooling thing was a gimmick, but for my beard it really helps!</li>
            <li> The shaver does well on the cheeks/jaw and chin, and does an okay job on the upper lip area (provided you use a blade to get the hairs just under your nose).</li>
            <li> First Shave:&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec Shaver System  and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first about the Cooltec technology</li>
            <li> This was also the first electric shaver I tried with the automatic cleaning.</li>
            <li> Solid product and glad I&#x27;m shaving with it.</li>
            <li> There were also no lights on to indicate what exactly was supposed to be happening.</li>
            <li> A great time saver when you&#x27;re running late.  </li>
            <li> I consistently had missed spots that no matter which way I moved the shaver, I could not get.  </li>
            <li> However I was willing to try and it and see.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the cooling feature actually works.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised though to find that not only does it offer an incredible shave but the cooling actually reduces irritation and at appears to create smoother skin.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy (in a good way) in your hand.</li>
            <li> for everyday up keep its good</li>
            <li> cleaning /charging base did an excellent job of cleaning, far superior to rinsing with water alone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good at everyday shaves.</li>
            <li> It felt as though i was putting in little to no effort for a nice quick and painless even shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans easily, by popping the top off and running a little bit of water on the heads.  </li>
            <li> but once you&#x27;re used to it feels very good, especially because it helped my skin feel less irritated after shaving, which has always been an issue for me with electric shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a simple way to clean the top, by running water on it, a deeper clean by simply pulling off the top and cleaning inside, or the third which is the easiest.</li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend Kiehl&#x27;s shave lotion as it does a tremendous job coupled with the Panasonic</li>
            <li> I noticed that the power plug for the charging/cleaning pod did was not a tight fit.  </li>
            <li> The actual shave to was super close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had somewhat sensitive skin that can get easily irritated by both electric shavers and straight razors.  </li>
            <li> My face is super smooth after a shave and stays that way for almost an entire day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough to have been selected to try out the CoolTec System for free via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar has not only made it possible to use an electric razor but has made it a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unique feature of the cold bar in between the two foils was somewhat interesting, but fairly lackluster.</li>
            <li> I just got this really cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System through a Braun program to try out</li>
            <li> The razor does an pretty good job in producing a close shave, but the biggest plus is the ice cool feeling from the center of the razor that seems to cool the face and stop the red irritation that normally occurs.</li>
            <li> I felt my face in both directions after completing my shave and it was a very similar result as I get from using a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Charge Station:&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge Station that is included with the Braun CoolTec System was a very nice addition as it can get very old having to clean out all the little areas that fill with hair in an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> first I was excited as this was my first foray into the electric shaving department, that excitement quickly turned to frustration, although not entirely the CoolTec products</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great shaver, especially if irritation is high on your priorities.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how cool the shaver got.  </li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin and the cool factor</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clean very shortly and gets a full</li>
            <li> Add the cool bar while you have to ease the redness in your face while you shave and you can definitely have a clean shave to remember.</li>
            <li> * Easy, quick to shave as long as you don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t because I am one of those that like to keep my things very clean, especially are razor that I rub all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , cooling feature is very nice, charge lasts a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Features that are not as good about the razor: when hair is long it pulls on the hair, my hair is thick and it pulled slightly even when short, did not do well shaving the neck</li>
            <li> Yet, it takes far more passes around my face to get the same shave as with Cool Tec.</li>
            <li> other nice aspect of Braun is the self cleaner.</li>
            <li> charger bases(two, one for travel, the other with the cleansing solution) was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> Seeing as how it already requires multiple passes to get a good shave, I don&#x27;t see this being my first choice on a regular basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt that the cooling has any use other than sounding like a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers in the past, and honestly I&#x27;ve never been impressed with any of them.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so I was excited for the CoolTec experience.</li>
            <li> The mini trimmer included in the other side of the shaver was a really nice &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Every time I used the shaver my skin was left irritation free and it gave me a more comfortable shave than other shavers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> New foils might make this shaver marginally better, but I have no desire to waste any more money on this product.  </li>
            <li> The side burn trimmer is also of the small and not very powerful variety which I see often in newer razors, however, my older Braun model has a great powerful one, would love to see that incorporated here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving was super fast and smooth and left my face feeling smoother than it has ever felt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is still good at not irritating my skin and have even used it on my head a few times.  </li>
            <li> In the end it just doesn&#x27;t give a good enough cut to be a daily</li>
            <li> The cold was good against razor burn, but I always thought warm was the way to go when it comes to getting the closest shave.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is nice especially with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i have been able to shave fast and properly with the hassle of going over and over my face.</li>
            <li> got maintaining short facial hair but not so good on longer hair.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be more frugal with how much cleaning fluid it uses since I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cartridge</li>
            <li> I had to use the manual to help decipher what certain pieces provided were for (keep in mind this is my first shaving system).</li>
            <li> First, there is a large gap between the two foil cutters where the cooling element is located.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really add to the experience, other than feeling nice when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li> mean, a great company wants me to try their product</li>
            <li> I can definitely say that looking hot has never felt so cool!</li>
            <li> It cut right through all my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling.</li>
            <li> I had, based on conventional wisdom, always believed that a warm razor gives a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It took multiple passes to get some areas smooth, and with some areas that are more problematic with other shavers, this one too had issues getting those clean.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Braun Cool Tec shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> , it was a bit loud but pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> entire package was very cool, though.</li>
            <li> it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and</li>
            <li> it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and</li>
            <li> I like having a close shave last for a day plus, but do love that I have experienced less irritation than with the multi-blade traditional razor.</li>
            <li> (though to be fair, it&#x27;s a little older model.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Norelco shavers and was pleased to receive this shaving system to review.</li>
            <li> I had heard a long time ago that not everybodies faces work well with electric razors and that some faces after time get adapted and the shave gets better.</li>
            <li> and I could really tell how hot my face got during shaving.</li>
            <li> However, the many pieces and lack of instructions took way too long to decipher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much done it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After unpacking the box and setting the system up, I was ready to shave for the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving: This is obviously the most important aspect of a shaver, and this is where the results are a bit mixed.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a shave as close as those other shavers, but the comfort of the Braun CoolTec surpasses them, since the cooling bar actually works and doesn&#x27;t let the shaver irritate my skin from heat generated by the blades...</li>
            <li> This was my first real electric shaver</li>
            <li> first, I didn&#x27;t really notice the CoolTech feature.</li>
            <li> The Cooltec is still pretty neat, and I appreciate the chill as I scrape the lightening fast razors across my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the minor annoyance with the travel charging, I am extremely pleased with this shaving system.</li>
            <li> I tried my dad&#x27;s electric shaver when I first started shaving and it irritated the heck out of my face and didn&#x27;t really shave all that</li>
            <li> So, I decided to look into a more long term solution and when the opportunity came up to try the Braun CoolTec System through a program rub by Braun, I took a chance and said goodbye to my manual shaver.  </li>
            <li> Although all of those things was great about the shaver, the product fell short on some other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had avoided electrics in the past because I could never get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Yet somehow, this Cool Tec directly on my face glided across my skin with ease.</li>
            <li> Having the nice cool metal on your skin really soothes the skin and makes irritation a thing of the past, I can&#x27;t believe no one has thought of this concept before, thank you Braun for stepping it up a notch when it comes to electric shaving.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how cool the CoolTec got</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - Overall, I&#x27;m glad I was able to get a new shaver even if it isn&#x27;t a complete replacement for my old one.  </li>
            <li> , Third, it is a clean shave every time because of the cleaning system that keeps it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor in the back is really handy as well for keeping your side burns clean, and my girlfriend even uses it to clean up the back of my head hair line which makes my hair cut last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I felt it left my face feeling fresh and clean after.</li>
            <li> It may take a few more passes on my face, but I never have to stop and clean it off.</li>
            <li> a quick update - Amazon resolved the return process quickly and simply.</li>
            <li> Battery life is a non-issue; you&#x27;ll have more than enough juice to get you through even a lengthy shave (which is one of this razor&#x27;s main downsides...more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with any new electric razor the first couple of shaves will not be ideal and can be irritating.  </li>
            <li> I slowly worked the shaver all over the right side and incredibly it was picking up those beard hairs of mine that grow in various directions with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys that like electric shavers but even with Braun the shaver head gets warm and sometimes a little hot and causes some skin redness and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The small trimmer on the back of the unit is also a great feature, it helps when I need a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Before you shave there is a little cooling button you press and in a matter of seconds you can feel the cool and refreshing experience as you shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver is also washable (though not a wet shaver), so you can get it clean pretty easily and only use the cleaning system once in a while</li>
            <li> Before I received this product I really did not feel that the CoolTec technology would really effect the feel of shaving very much.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar only takes a few seconds to cool and feel pretty good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a cool, ergonomic shaver that rivals any rotary on the market!</li>
            <li> I experienced the same sensation after other uses of this shaver as well, and that is something I really like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which was useful when shaving new curves.</li>
            <li> First off it is huge and takes up a big space on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a shave thats as close as what I&#x27;d get if I used my typical Mach 3 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the plug to the outlet easily falls out of the charger.</li>
            <li> but the easy to use trimmer attachment picked up the stubborn hair; and also the cooking element could be bigger.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning system that comes with it, one of the things a hate is having to clean my shaver and it does a great job with that.</li>
            <li> I figured they have made great products in the past, so what else could they do for my sensitive hair growing face?  </li>
            <li> When the razor arrived, I quickly opened the package, set it up, and waited for the charging to be complete.</li>
            <li> Its located on the back of the unit and is angled upwards, meaning that if its against your wall or mirror, its easy to bump causing the power cord to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> It also gave me a pretty close shave and left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> For reference, my two previous electric razors were Norelco rotary type razors, which did a nice job.  </li>
            <li> first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, so I can&#x27;t say that I did a good job of stress testing the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I will be using this razor more then straight blade because I belie that it will be cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> It honestly sounded gimmicky to me at first, but after using it, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d make more sense to me if you could just plug the charger cable straight into the shaver, but as long as I don&#x27;t have to take the cleaning station on holiday with me</li>
            <li> I liked the cool soothing sensation and received a very close shave without irratation, even in the hard to shave neck area.</li>
            <li> Certainly saves some time.</li>
            <li> Certainly that&#x27;s a feature that you&#x27;re looking for in an electric shaver and this shaver has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That might be a bit picky, but would certainly be helpful as well in</li>
            <li> but it does certainly stand out.</li>
            <li> The system is too bulky, from a large and uncomfortable-to-hold shaver to a space-hogging cleaning and charging station.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For starters, let me just tell you that when it comes to shaving I have tried nearly every type of razor to ever be conceived, and very few have ever passed the test of a great shave.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec razor definitely surprised me by providing a very consistent and close shave on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> decided to give the Braun Cooltec an honest chance, first using it to do some touch-up work after shaving with my regular razor, then progressed to using it to touch up my face and neck after work before heading to events/functions, finally working up feeling like I could trust it to shave my face and neck</li>
            <li> The aluminum cooling bar was nice, but was not shockingly cool.</li>
            <li> This shaver was OK on the easy parts of my face but absolutely could not get the hard hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive of the Cooltec over a traditional razor is how close it gets and how smooth it leaves your skin.</li>
            <li> It originally felt like the razor was wet and water was dripping on my face keeping it cool.</li>
            <li> The Cooltec does help with the irritation, more so than my other electric razors when I first started using them.  </li>
            <li> It does decent work,but can&#x27;t exactly seem to get the neck beard cut that close.</li>
            <li> After using this razor the first time I had 2 main issues.</li>
            <li> had expected that in comparison to a manual razor, the electric razor would be allow me to complete my shave more quickly because no shaving creams were required and the cooling bar allowed for effortless gliding across my skin.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the shavers feel is much like the Philips/Norelco shavers which I don&#x27;t prefer because of the large head area that touches my face.  </li>
            <li> The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Series 7 and Gillette razors, comfort is night and day for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While the cool technology is a nice gimick, it isn&#x27;t enough to make up for some of the other drawbacks of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I think the Braun CoolTec is a nice feel with the cooling but takes a little longer to get the job done because the Series 7 has a faster motor than the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I am a five blade razor kind of guy, so I was a little apprehensive to try a shaver like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the razor came with a nice little soft-covered hardshell case for travel.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation was nice since I always feel a little ‚Äúswollen‚Äù and beat up after shaving, this helped mitigate that.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard and like a great close shave, then give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> After finishing my first shave, it was time to put the razor back on the charger and give it a clean.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it is a good replacement for my older Braun 7</li>
            <li> The cleaning does a great job, only drawback is that it is a little noisy, but I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case may be, I ended up using a traditional razor for fine trimming around my sideburns because this product just wasn&#x27;t accurate enough for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I&#x27;m new to electric razors, so I cannot state whether my difficulty is due to my own inexperience or the design of the razor.  </li>
            <li> far as the non-goatee areas this razor left my skin with an incredibly close shave, with little effort.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the cooling sensation but sometimes I feel that it be a little too cool for just getting out of a hot shower.</li>
            <li> The hard case is a great addition for some who travels frequently like myself.</li>
            <li> It cools the blade system to allow for a cool refreshing shave and little to no irritation afterward - definitely a sweet addition to regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later that week, I used my Norelco and realized there was a huge difference between this one and the Braun and how much the cooltec part was working.</li>
            <li> The cold feeling it provides against my face is one of a kind amazing.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend this to a traditional razor user who wants to be free of the soaps and aftershave and the ability to shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would also recommend this to a traditional razor user who wants to be free of the soaps and aftershave and the ability to shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes cleaning a breeze and overall allows the whole experience to be worry free.</li>
            <li> I had not used an electric shaver for many years, so perhaps I expected too much.</li>
            <li> It is a nice razor but like most electric razors I have used its difficult to get my neck</li>
            <li> I turned on the cooling action, and was very pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li> First off let me say I normally use a straight razor and have never used any electric razor that shaves as close.  </li>
            <li> It would touch the spot because of the contour of my head and the extending trimmer didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li> and I must say it is really a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Everywhere else, it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> I thought the cooling bar would be a gimmick, but it really has worked at keeping my face from getting irritated.</li>
            <li> Cleaning refills are reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> It has a very close shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really for anyone.  </li>
            <li> Really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product has really changed my mind about electric razors.</li>
            <li> Thanks again bzzagent and way to go Braun for creating a fa-nominal product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - takes up a lot of counter space with the cleaning station and accessories, cleaning process is really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could that be why it&#x27;s not shaving close or really at all?</li>
            <li> me, it will be appreciated and NOT returned or re-gifted!&lt;br /&gt;Braun has outdone itself with this shaving system.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the CoolTec, I really have to shave every day as if I wait a day or two inbetween, the shaver has some difficulty getting a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> And it really works.</li>
            <li> The charging station was better than expected and everything about this product screams &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like - I just don&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> so I was very eager to try this unit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work which is</li>
            <li> but it really made no difference.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t know how long the blades last, but so far its working as good as its first shave.  </li>
            <li> Deliver fast.</li>
            <li> Really different.&lt;br</li>
            <li> starters, the shave was really close.</li>
            <li> And really, isn&#x27;t that what we all want anyways - the close shave?</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re quickly ready to start.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really had to push the shaver into my skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where the cooling bar really helped.  </li>
            <li> I really like it because of the convenience and you will too.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, no irritation.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to the case is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the charger if you needed to take it.</li>
            <li> The charger makes the razor cumbersome for a traveler, but convenient for keeping it ready to shave.  </li>
            <li> , it really is a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I found the razor works a hare better if you wet your skin.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t much of a factor for me.</li>
            <li> It also cools much quicker than they note in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I found myself stretching skin like you would shaving with a straight blade.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver to everyone!</li>
            <li> I get a foil shaver that gives me a very close shave, without the razor burn/skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cooling bar that it has and</li>
            <li> but then it really starts to kick in.</li>
            <li> It was a comfortable feeling, and smoothing to the face at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it is much wider than the series 5.</li>
            <li> , the shave itself was very close and effortless.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it does, very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun for sending this to me to review and evaluate.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> is really well designed and sleek.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, I really did.  </li>
            <li> I am a shaving snob ‚Äì having used straight razors, electric shavers, and every three, four, five, twelve bladed razor out there.</li>
            <li> When I received Braun‚Äôs CoolTec electric shaver, I really didn&#x27;t know much about it.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very jealous that there is a razor system out there that does what this does, but she says it looks a bit too manly for her to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will find it very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Provides a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> And I really like that it has a rubberized texture to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> The real surprise was that it did in fact reduce skin irritation.</li>
            <li> and I really do like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, since I&#x27;ve been trying this razor out, I have had continual issues with getting a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a better than expected experience and the CoolTec feature delivers.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTech traps all shavings in the head until you&#x27;re ready to dump them.  </li>
            <li> The shaver really does deliver all it says it will.  </li>
            <li> in all, I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> it really keeps my face from getting irritated.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning station that comes with</li>
            <li> much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Philips Norelco would sometimes take a whole day to charge fully, whereas the CoolTec seems to charge in a matter of a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If I cleaned it every time the light came on, I would go through a cartridge that is supposed to last a couple of months in just a week or two.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This really does prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cooling technology really does make a difference both in the act of shaving and in the aftermath.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The system is very well put together.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Everything was very intuitive for set up and use.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is also self cleaning which makes cleaning an absolute breeze.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know, but I do know I like it.  </li>
            <li> This is one electric shaver I would recommend to anyone who wants an electric Shaver that delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li> I will also go on to say that this shaver compares very well to the one I had revieved as a gift in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaner does however seem to run out much faster than it seems it would.</li>
            <li> I also really like about this</li>
            <li> I got to try the CoolTec system thanks to a program by Braun.  </li>
            <li> Even then, it wasn&#x27;t as close as a shave as I&#x27;m used to with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave daily, or like completely smooth skin, then you may wish to pass on this.</li>
            <li> but this absolutely gives it a run for</li>
            <li> This problem was not so noticeable on subsequent shaves when my beard-growth was not as advanced.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t looked into replacement cleaning cartridges, so I can&#x27;t speak to how much those are.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend actually commented on how smooth my shave was.  </li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Braun could improve the cutting performance of the CoolTec razor, this would be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  </li>
            <li> CoolTec system itself works very well, and feels very cooling and soothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The shaving experience went fairly smooth, and the cooling element actually helps not feeling the &#x27;plucking&#x27;</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s just that the shave isn&#x27;t really that close.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clean&amp;Charge station, even after shaving just once, to get a feel for how it works.</li>
            <li> The Cooltech feature is a great idea and helps with razor burn, but does not outweigh the poor performance of the razor.</li>
            <li> Since it is a much heavier weight, I assume that was the cause.  </li>
            <li> It shaved all of my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling...</li>
            <li> Positives:  the cooling bar really works and</li>
            <li> the razor gives a reasonably close shave    </li>
            <li> After using it for a while I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got a very close shave in fewer strokes and fewer in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The Razor does tend to pull the longer hairs out, but no worse than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> this a real F-you to not  disclose that when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, went through help to find a chat window and customer service rep made everything ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really quantify that, but it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this shaver and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> my skin wasn&#x27;t really irritated.  </li>
            <li> (I like my face baby smooth after a shave, like slick, straight razor hot towel kinda smooth).  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34; aspect of this brand isn&#x27;t a gimmick; it really works.</li>
            <li> I got a really close, fast shave</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash on another high-end shaver after investing in the Norelco but the CoolTec was just calling to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, let me say that I&#x27;ve stuck to disposable razors over the years because every experience I&#x27;ve had with electric razors have really burned.</li>
            <li> completed, I was ready to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The razor leaves my face very well shaved.</li>
            <li> I have always been a shave in the shower using a standard over the counter cheap razor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the cleaning/charging station!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready Monday morning for the week.</li>
            <li> Even though it eats up the battery much faster, I can&#x27;t imagine that I will ever turn it</li>
            <li> Straight out of the package</li>
            <li> It was all charged so I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> and I really like that.</li>
            <li> and  I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive razor for its performance</li>
            <li> It made a very noticeable difference during my shave</li>
            <li> At any rate, the shave is still very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so bulky that it doesn&#x27;t shave the contours of your face and neck, and even where it does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close.  </li>
            <li> very comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I was finished, I did have a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> yes that really does</li>
            <li> It made the time spent shaving as enjoyable as I think it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver and found it to not work very well.</li>
            <li> The cooling apparatus in the shaver does, however work very well.</li>
            <li> After using it once, I realized that this shaver is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My face felt much cooler and did not sting, compared to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I am ready to ditch the cream and blades that I&#x27;ve had to deal with.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar stopped razor burn very well (5stars).  </li>
            <li> but for me, a guy who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, the drawbacks aren&#x27;t really worth the benefit of this razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a very soothing sensation and really did eliminate razor burn and the need for aftershave lotion, for me, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how much I paid for my 8595, or when,</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and sturdy, and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I wish that the shaver head itself was a bit narrower (too much of a gap between the screens, but the cooling bar had to go somewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> portable station is very compact and does not have any latching mechanisms.  </li>
            <li> Braun product does not provide a very close shave as to what I am use to when I compare this product with the Andis T-liner shaver.</li>
            <li> Though I got this electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun, I feel that the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have no clue how much it is to replace the cleaning solution it uses</li>
            <li> It really does everything they say it can.</li>
            <li> Somehow they managed to keep all the shaving power, but make it much quieter.  </li>
            <li> I am very use too using Electric Razors as they are my preferred method of shaving.</li>
            <li> , I did receive this system as from Braun as part of a campaign, so I figured I had nothing to lose, but it has really won me over.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be given the chance to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaving System by a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it really relieved my issues with skin irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who is looking for a close, smooth shave or anyone who has irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> &amp; I found it inferior to my Norelco shaver which itself is inferior to the old reliable straight razor which I still have not been able to find a replacement for relative to closeness</li>
            <li> Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see a need to.  </li>
            <li> FAST ENOUGH&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very disappointing..am returning.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I let my facial hair grow all week and go to a barber to get a professional shave weekly.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar in the middle made my face feel extra nice</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make the Braun CoolTec better in my opinion would be the ability to plug a charger in directly to the razor when traveling without the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> price component is a big differentiator for many, with nearly a $100 USD difference between the two razors.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cooltec shaver and my first impression was, damn, this is a really cool looking shaver, and it comes with al lthe necessary accessories, PLUS a cleaning station!</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec is a nice addition to my grooming routine and has replaced my older and less reliable electric razor.</li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that became red and irritated when I shaved but not any more with the Braun CoolTec shaver.  </li>
            <li> It also has a smaller charging/cleaning station than my old unit so it looks much better in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is really a unique feeling and seems to significantly cut down or eliminate the power razor skin irritation/burn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My first use of this product was less than inspiring.</li>
            <li> My face is super sensitive normally to shaving</li>
            <li> So I switched to Panasonic ‚Äì and was willing to give this new Braun CoolTec</li>
            <li> The first time I used the razor I shaved a small amount of hair and the clean light went off.</li>
            <li> The things I liked that I felt was different from my previous electric shaver is that it gave a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li> Overall - if you shave every other day then this product would probably be good</li>
            <li> The mornings are the most hectic in our household and often times, I have to shave with one hand while the other hand is helping with my kids get ready.  </li>
            <li> I still need to use a traditional razor to clean up but it does do nicely for everyday maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Braun shaver customer, so I was very excited when Braun sent me a new CoolTec electric razor to try.</li>
            <li> I used to get nice red marks on my neck especially with my old electric shaver, but that is non existent thanks to Braun ¬∞CoolTec!</li>
            <li> It was always to much hassle to clean the razor and always left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li> Just stash it away to charge, press the button to clean and it&#x27;s ready to go for you the next day.</li>
            <li> it is ready to go the next day all clean and charged.</li>
            <li> it is ready to go the next day all clean and charged.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a really cool idea for the active cooling technology, the aluminum cooling bar that keeps your skin cool during shaving.</li>
            <li> When you are finished shaving, you set the razor in the station, push a button, and in 3 minutes the razor is clean, lubricated, charged and ready for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> When you get all the cool accessories in the box, it really feels like the product is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I feel like there are other shavers out there that are better performing,</li>
            <li> I have used my shaver several times now, and am excited every time I need to shave now.  </li>
            <li> It seems to glide across my face better than any other electric I‚Äôve had and the coolness almost feels as though it‚Äôswet, but it‚Äôs not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How many other brands can boast all of these features??  </li>
            <li> It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.  </li>
            <li> Due to this, I have not being able to experience all that this product has to offer yet.  </li>
            <li> I wish that they sold the solution in a smaller package so you could keep the original solution chamber.</li>
            <li> Not a fault of the shaver but more due to my skin/hair</li>
            <li> I have other brands of e-razors and they do a bit better job then this.  </li>
            <li> I am currently on a three week trip, so I&#x27;m excited to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond the normal longer shaving time the only real issue I&#x27;ve come across is the sound when the charger is sitting idle.</li>
            <li> It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaving system allowed an extremely close shave and I was able to go against the grain without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was incredibly pleased that I did not receive any razor burn or other types of irritation after using this system.</li>
            <li> As someone who hasn&#x27;t used an electric razor in 10+ years, this is easily MUCH better than any other razor I tried in the past&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Clean and Charge station makes it very simple to keep the shaver clean and ready for use the next morning.</li>
            <li> It has a nice heavy, sturdy feel to it, and comes with what seems like a high end  cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Yes, the cool metal felt refreshing on my face during shaving but still I&#x27;m not sure if my sensitive skin would react positively to it.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new electric shaver as my old Philips Norelco was on its last legs, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that popping it back into the station is far more convenient than plugging the razor in and leaving it on the counter,plus the automatic cleaning makes it feel like a brand new shaver</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However when I gave the CoolTec a try I started to realize that the bumps weren&#x27;t just a necessary byproduct of a clean shave.</li>
            <li> With the simple click of a button, the shaver will self clean itself.</li>
            <li> Another pain with shaving is constantly having to clean your shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the CoolTec is extremely simple with the Charge and Clean station.  </li>
            <li> The shaver stays charged for an hoursa and can get enough power from five minutes of charging for one clean shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this won‚Äôt replace my straight razor as my main implement</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging station is convenient and also the fact its waterproof, running the electric razor under water like a regular razor does help clean away the shaved hair.</li>
            <li> I also like the alcohol based fluid that helps to clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> : Clean and close shave, Gets even those stubborn hairs easily, Significantly lesser skin irritation</li>
            <li> No need to manually clean it and oil it after every use like your traditional shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t that big a deal in my opinion because the shaver stays cool whether you activate the cooling system or not.  </li>
            <li> Second, my shaver didn&#x27;t come with a brush to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I find that it does help soothe any irritation to have the cool bar cross over my face as I shave and really like how it feels.</li>
            <li> so I made sure to use the CoolTec for at least a full month before writing a review.</li>
            <li> razor gets a full charge after only an hour of charging, and lasts much longer than I need for a shave.</li>
            <li> Without this cleaning system I would only be using water, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel that it was as clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The main attraction of this shaver is the CoolTec System which really works.</li>
            <li> first morning I used the razor, I was surprised at how much pressure I needed to use to move it along my face.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel it keeping my face cool during the entire shave.  </li>
            <li> So, this can easily be solved by letting it dry after its cleaned.</li>
            <li> my neck and small facial patches and the Braun does a great for this.  </li>
            <li> Within a few seconds of shaving, you can feel the razor getting cool on contact which makes for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program.</li>
            <li> It was easy to get going and prime with fluid, and so far seems like a very no-fuss</li>
            <li> and I actually trust that its clean now.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve tried a few electric shavers in the past, but have never been impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> To be honest though, I don&#x27;t know that I will continue using this shaver long enough to need a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn‚Äôt stick out long enough for it to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec shaves at a slower clip and cools the skin down, which means it will take longer to shave, but you will be very comfortable with that shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For one, it took me much longer than usual to complete a full shave, and secondly, it just wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like it to be (this probably wont be problem for most people seeing as I have to shave twice a day just to keep a clean face,</li>
            <li> The new razor with its adaptable 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade provides a nice clean shave that is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I change my facial hair fairly regularly, going from full beard to clean cut, and all points in between.</li>
            <li> I currently have been using the Braun series 7 shaver before giving this new Cooltec a try after receiving it through a free program from Braun.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old also thinks its fun to watch daddy shave with his new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun 8000 series razor for quite some time, and was fortunate enough to receive a new Braun CoolTec razor as part of a Braun promotion for testing and review.  </li>
            <li> As a person who is always warm (I live in shorts year round), the idea of having a cooling electric shaver intrigued me.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it</li>
            <li> I first started on the right chin, the shave felt totally different from what I thought it would feel like....</li>
            <li> For extra close shaves on special occassions, I would suggest finishing off with a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The specially designed shaving blades target and capture hairs growing in different directions.  </li>
            <li> I relate the significant reduction of irritation clearly to how cool the shaver really gets when you press the &#x27;Active cooling&#x27; button.</li>
            <li> I had been waiting for about 5 days from my previous shave; my facial hair was asking for a good shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is quite pleasant and took only a few minutes to get used to.</li>
            <li> When I was finished, I placed the shaver in the slick cleaning station, which did a very nice job for my next use.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive and I have to take great care not to make it worse when I shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a comfortable, less-expensive (in the long run), slower, not quite as close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors in the past but to be honest</li>
            <li> The same is true for the CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered to try the Braun CoolTech shaver CT5cc thru a program run by Braun, my natural first reaction was...\\&quot;Its</li>
            <li> This was the first foil topped shaver I have used in my adult life; I have always used a three headed spiral type shaver before.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec shaver definitely delivers on its promise of getting you a cool shave.  </li>
            <li> but I always seem to go back to a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; multi-blade manual razor full time.</li>
            <li> It works out, but definitely not if you have a face full of hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend for someone who has sensitivity, but not a face full of hair.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars was because the shave still didn&#x27;t rival that of a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is  cool.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;ve used it once so far.</li>
            <li> the Braun Cooltec if you do a full face shave on a regular basis and don&#x27;t like the burn of your existing equipment.</li>
            <li> Just cool enough that you can feel that its colder than the surrounding air.</li>
            <li> The system comes with a shaver with trimming capabilities and a charging/washing/lubrication station which is cool because not only does it charge</li>
            <li> And it appears, at least initially, the shaver is better put together and more durable</li>
            <li> This time, the charge actually turns off when the battery is full.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a part-time early adopter.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m somebody that would constantly suffer from razor burn so the thought of something like this to keep everything cool in the process</li>
            <li> It really does help to reduce the irritation I would normally get while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to get as close a shave as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It only takes an hour till a full charge is achieved.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the cool bar actually did</li>
            <li> So far, I would definitely say its much more comfortable than any other electric razor I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually had a closer shave with the Braun I ever had from my razor, and it left the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean out without little pockets of hair being perpetually stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than my Braun seven series shaver and in the end seemed to have a little closer shave and a much more pleasant experience during the actual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received this new CoolTec electric shaver thanks to a program by Braun and so far it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I am not sure how quickly the cleaning station will go through the solution, but it will cost to replace and I enjoy using an electric razor so that I don&#x27;t spend as much on disposable razors.</li>
            <li> That is super convenient, but there is still a little clean up if you want to remove that hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this to anyone who is in the market to purchase a new shaver!  </li>
            <li> Tossed it that day and went and bought the new Braun series 7!</li>
            <li> After 3 days of not shaving I powered up my new razor and it worked like a champ!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think the CoolTec system would be great for someone without a very heavy beard like me, as the cool bar technology provides a very positive improvement to the typical electric shave.  </li>
            <li> a pretty simple, effective, precise and for sure less irritating shaver.</li>
            <li> But those trivial issues pale in comparison to the clean, close, COOL shave this thing gives.</li>
            <li> I think the CoolTec is a great product and other than the extra couple minutes I have to spend shaving, I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and cooling bar works better than any other shaver I have used on minimizing the irritation.</li>
            <li> All in all I really do like the new Braun CoolTec shaving system, with having lots of experience with electric shavers</li>
            <li> and now I have graduated to a whole new level of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> This shaver takes revolutionary to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all thanks to the new cooling feature on the CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Braun CoolTec System and have to say that the icy coolness was amazing.</li>
            <li> The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair into the unit like my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this shaver for over a month now, I will say that I do have to go over the same area a few more times to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Many times sunday morning I would have a slight rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have run the shaver through the same area a few more times to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The clean and charge system is another nice feature - I&#x27;ve never liked dismantling a razor and going in there with those tiny</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super convenient to simply throw it on the charger after using it and just by pressing a button it cleans it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also final feature is how quick it charges from the time it is put on the charger and charges under an hour.  </li>
            <li> Its a fairly decent shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is under powered for the thicker beard, but might be a decent edging and shaping tool.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be selected by Braun to test this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try the Shaving System during a participation in a Braun promotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an older Braun 7000 series</li>
            <li> I end up having to break out the ol&#x27; classic to get the rest.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun Cooltec Electric shaver as a promo run by Braun and quickly unwrapped it.  </li>
            <li> I received my Braun a week ago and it quickly came a part of my daily morning regimen.</li>
            <li> it is decent with so</li>
            <li> I have used it wet with no shave lotion, and it does as good as can be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old with sensitive skin, shaving isn&#x27;t fun at times.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to participate in a program ran by Braun, I have used the electric razor for a some time now and would like to provide some thoughts to help guide your electric razor decision.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an electric shaver that not only cuts close but quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this razor from a program through Braun.</li>
            <li> For the purposes of this review, I will compare to the Braun Series 7 because it is similar in design and branding, as well as a traditional Gillette razor because many will be coming from this setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we all had a good look at them again as an essential part of our everyday routine.....</li>
            <li> I have been using the CoolTec for the past 45 days and have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this shaver via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did provide a good shave, but there were a few areas that I needed to go back and touch up.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a decently close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I wish the shaver could operate with the power cord, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal since it charges so quickly.</li>
            <li> I would put the shave from CoolTec on par with shaves I&#x27;ve had from  professional barbers with a straight edge razor but without the high price and time investment!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I do not typically use electric shavers</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought an electric razor in over 5 years and had switched to buying blade cartridges, which can be a hassle and can start to cost a decent amount after a while.</li>
            <li> That gave me a chance to test the mettle of the pop-up trimmer in the back which was sturdy and took beard to stubble quite quickly.</li>
            <li> you have the main unit with the cleaning solution in, you can&#x27;t move it around without spilling the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> This should be sealed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about moving the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt it did an adequate job, but I did have to shave the next day, unlike if I used a manual</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving is easy and decent, but I wish the shaving head itself did not feel quite so wide.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, since I need to shave and go quickly, I would stick with a different razor.</li>
            <li> This was great for me because I usually shy away from electric razors as they really irritate my skin during and after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to setup - pretty much out of the box ready to use (with a small charge of course)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The instructions are only mildly helpful.  </li>
            <li> After going over the same areas over and over again I was able to finish about 20 minutes after starting.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive one via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt work particularly well.</li>
            <li> I wish it had the pivoting head of the older Pulsonic that I had, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> main selling point of this Braun is the CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves I got very use to the Coolness and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I still see myself shaving with a regular razor most often, but I can see the potential for the Braun to fill in one to two days a week.</li>
            <li> I already had an older model of Braun shaver, but obtained a CoolTec shaving system via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec‚Äôs main selling point is that it has a cooling bar, which is meant to minimize redness, burning, and skin irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> As a fan of electric razors (the convenience of being able to quickly shave for those mornings when you just don&#x27;t have time to shave with a regular razor), I have found that many times I&#x27;m forced to shave my neck area first, then my face due to the skin irritation I received from an electric razor that quickly warms up after only 20 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec system with do that with an awesome cool feeling, but it just makes it a little too difficult to do the job</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new electronic shaver!</li>
            <li> Being a person of very sensitive skin I never quite found one that really didn&#x27;t  irritate me and leave me looking and feeling like I had hives.</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer is perfect for that hard to maintain and trim mustache and upper lip hair.  </li>
            <li> I expected this new product to better right above the Adam&#x27;s apple region</li>
            <li> The cleaning light literally seems to come on after every single shave even if I have just cleaned it.  </li>
            <li> Not freezing, but also not sure it is really doing too much to make my skin feel any better.  </li>
            <li> With my first use of it, I was already impressed on how cold the razor actually got.</li>
            <li> I found it very challenging to get a similar level of closeness in my shave using the Braun CoolTec even after going over the same areas several times.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers in the past and they leave my face with mild irritation, with the Cooltec the cooling bar leaves my face irritation free.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is easy to break down, clean and put back together.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Shaver.  </li>
            <li> product is high quality and lives up to all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> product is high quality and lives up to all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Then again neither is high end shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is the shaver to buy if you suffer from razor burn and want a high end shaver.</li>
            <li> shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to the Gillette and Schick disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I knew that this was a high quality piece of manliness.</li>
            <li> When my brother and dad saw this high teck, sleek looking device they both wanted it.</li>
            <li> However I would highly recomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> When I got asked to participate in a Braun promotion I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself works well and is made with high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> I does appear that this razor does not run as high of an RPM as my 7-series.  </li>
            <li> high quality.</li>
            <li> but it washes the shaver with alcohol to maintain a high level of hygiene and then lubricates to keep the shaver at peak</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All the parts, pieces, and accessories are high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaving system.</li>
            <li> product is a premium razor with high quality construction.</li>
            <li> think the preference for choice of shaving device is highly dependent upon the user.</li>
            <li> The Clean Station is a little bulky and takes up counter space, but I feel it&#x27;s worth the space!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, while it was often slow to cut, I found the cooling effect was still well worth the new technology and was glad to get the opportunity to try the shaver through a trial program with Braun.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec System will likely be copied by other companies, but I doubt it will duplicate the amazing experience that the CoolTec System provides.</li>
            <li> charger is a &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34; that you can only use if it is laying flat, taking up more room.  </li>
            <li> It also come with a travel charger which will come in handy due to its low profile.</li>
            <li> It also come with a travel charger which will come in handy due to its low profile.</li>
            <li> After using the Braun product on the first day to shave, the cooling system really did provide less irritation to the skin, although it was not as cool as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I were a new comer to the worl of Braun electric shavers I would appreciate the new feature much more.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> This shaver is very easy to use compared to ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> As expected the head comes off for easy cleaning and also comes with a cleaning solution helping the razor feel like new for every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically shave using a razor, but was tempted into trying out an electric shaver again with Brauns innovative new cooling system.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more costly than others.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little better than holding a brick to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did seem like I had to press harder than other Brauns to be able to feel the cool bar also.  </li>
            <li> so you have to pay a little more attention to the angle of the shaver</li>
            <li> It still does the work just takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> 5 is because the one thing I thought the Norelco circular blades did better was handle the shave when hair got a little longer (i.e. 4 days + without shaving.)  </li>
            <li> The direction could certainly be a little better and explain things a little more.  </li>
            <li> You could skip the fluid, clean it yourself, and save some money, but then you won&#x27;t feel like much of an early adopter, now will</li>
            <li> I also love the locking feature for the razor as I have had my older unit come on while in plane storage which resulted in the unit beind dead when I arrived at my destination.  </li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need and it also comes with a nice HARD case for if you are traveling with it to keep it sage or just to store it in.  </li>
            <li> Kind of hard to explain</li>
            <li> a charging / cleaning station is excellent as I like that there is a cleaning solution (alchol base) that really gives the shaver head a deep clean, so it works as well as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally the type to shave completely clean, I mainly use a beard trimmer to keep a stubble look.</li>
            <li> I love the CoolTec technology that leaves my skin feeling less ittitated that any other electric shaver while still giving me a close shave that is comfortable.</li>
            <li> My older Braun 1775 shaver is still working after 9 years but decided to upgrade and try the new Braun CoolTec CT5cc model.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec System so far has worked really well.</li>
            <li> The cooling feature really prevents the after-burn that my old razor was giving me every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I would never pay as much as the MSRP suggests- near $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this feels like a great expensive razor, from the weight to the quality of the materials.</li>
            <li> It takes up so much space on my counter, and the cord sticks so far out from the wall that I am considering the product&#x27;s removal from my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how much I like the cooling feature too.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver as it&#x27;s not irritating to skin and gives you soft shaving even when the cooling is switched off .</li>
            <li> The chilling effect really is great idea</li>
            <li> I also owned a Panasonic Arc 4 before the Norelco, and I would say the Braun CoolTec shaves nearly on par with the Panasonic and much closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I also owned a Panasonic Arc 4 before the Norelco, and I would say the Braun CoolTec shaves nearly on par with the Panasonic and much closer than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The cooling action does make a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy the bar, as it makes my face feel wet, like with a cartridge razor, as I shave.  </li>
            <li> so I‚Äôd often just go with the old fashioned straight razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor continues to give me a shave that is nearly as close as a straight razor (without the risk of grave</li>
            <li> The cooling effect that this razor has really caters to those with sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li> I have used several of the top brands before including Braun and never really noticed much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra features are worth the price of admission.  </li>
            <li> The extra features are worth the price of admission.  </li>
            <li> Red light was blinking instead of the normal green light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with it for a week now and for the most part I like it, with a few quibbles over the function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so not that big a deal but worth mentioning nonetheless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The regular non-electric razor still wins in the close shave department, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick to non-electric.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed about the shaver is its grip, it has a very ergonomic solid feel to</li>
            <li> The shaver could provide a closer shave, but it does close enough for what I need and the cooling bar is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> When the kit arrived, it took only moments to assemble and get ready for it&#x27;s first run.  </li>
            <li> if you allow a few days growth it takes some more effort, as with any razor.</li>
            <li> I found myself using the travel stand for normal charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Cooling feature was neat and extremely refreshing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was really needed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep at it for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defiantly a different experience but the tech alone makes it worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and I that would have to use a normal razor to shave.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I thought I would add some more insight on CoolTec CT5cc shaving system, which was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it still works like a normal shaver during that</li>
            <li> So normally i have to use a trimmer than shave after.</li>
            <li> I have had the chance to use the CoolTec razor for a few weeks now as part of a promotion from Braun and have to say that it is just okay.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, that the cool bar, piece of metal, that gets really cold, is refreshing and cool.  </li>
            <li> razor is water resistant up to a few meters, like most, so you could use it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> charging station worked well and the charge lasted a long time before the shaver needed a full charge.</li>
            <li> a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is not your normal shaver.</li>
            <li> So, with full beard, I used the &amp;#34;powerful long hair trimmer&amp;#34; on the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver to trim up.  </li>
            <li> me tell you about my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li> I need to shave on a daily basis for my job and was exciting to give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> Just pop the top off and tap it in the sink or trash then just take the brush and do a few swipes on the unit and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> burn you&#x27;d normally have.  </li>
            <li> The base is nice as well, an easy way to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Normally, I tend to get some cuts and almost always have some razor burn and/or bumps with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I think the cooling sensation and lack of facial irritation is worth the trade, though.</li>
            <li> I think the infrared photo on the product review is real because it actually does get pretty cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with any shaver it takes a few weeks to get through the irritation period, however as I have purchased many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li> however that was tempered by the fact that it took quite a few more passes to get it to that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also after using this razor I noticed my &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; was appearing sooner than normal</li>
            <li> If travelling for extended time without ability to charge you could eek out a few more days if you turned off the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you let your hair go more than a few days</li>
            <li> During that time I always believed that you just couldn&#x27;t beat the closeness of normal blade based razors.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôll give it a few more weeks and post a follow up review</li>
            <li> I have arrived at a destination with a dead razor more than once.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have a better sense for this in a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> This may be normal, but I see cleaning cartridge refills substantially adding to the cost over time.  </li>
            <li> cleaning pack solutions last a pretty reasonable time and refills are not to pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get razor bumps from electric razors, so I don&#x27;t normally use them, however the cooling technology prevented that from happening.  </li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m a safety razor user, but when I received my Braun ¬∞</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to switch over to electric shaving since long before I could grow a beard; it looked so cool in all the movies and &amp;#34;Grandpa does it while he drives his car to work&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> like I normally do so</li>
            <li> I was immediately aware of the cooling bar and it added a whole different level to the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> get a few more pennies out of us, but I am reserving judgement.  </li>
            <li> I was able to test the shaver through a program run by Braun and have been working with it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then sadly used the trimmer on my epic beard I had grown over Movember, which was oddly satisfying for my wife, and was pleased with the smoothness and effectiveness of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> charged up the shaver, it seems to have good battery life, although that is decreased when using the cooling system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but not a great one.</li>
            <li> couple of items that could be improved in my opinion are that the sideburn shaver does not cut a clear defined line, which makes my sideburns look a little ragged; the cooling mechanism works, but I would really like it produce a much colder sensation; and the cleaning solution/catridges seem to be used up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar (which sticks up between the two foil screens) kicks in immediately, doing an amazing job at keeping down the irritation that normally comes with using an electric razor, especially in the area under the jaw bone.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend giving this a try for anyone looking to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> have fairly sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t tend to shave often, and mostly just trim it down when I do anything.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair grows in pretty quickly and relatively coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have have to use a Swiss army knife to open anything up and this kit was easy to open.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, Braun Cooltech shaver felt like it was build solid with no loose parts, ergonomic to hold, the main beard blade was on the top with two moving parts and the straight blade for trimming was on the back and located clearly out of the way.</li>
            <li> started in on my first shave, and the cold sensation is very nice.  </li>
            <li> normally complains of irritation and razor burn when he gets a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it has a retractable razor on the back in case you need to do a major shave and not just a clean up.</li>
            <li> When I finally received my shaver I plugged it right up to charge and put everything together.  </li>
            <li> Now I can shave right next to the bed without her waking up!</li>
            <li> and when I don‚Äôt have enough time to really do it right.</li>
            <li> When I received the Braun Cooltec through a promotional program by Braun, I was right in the middle of growing out my beard for Movember.</li>
            <li> A regular razor and the right shaving cream could probably duplicate the effect.  </li>
            <li> You will want to open it right away.</li>
            <li> I wished it were longer so that I could place the cradle further away from the socket to charge as right now</li>
            <li> Since I didn‚Äôt need to shave right away, I let it charge in its station for about an hour, then came back to it.</li>
            <li> maybe from the set of Demolition Man, right next to the 3 shells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I finally got the beard, and asked dad why he DIDN&#x27;T use an electric razor, he explained that he could never get one that worked right.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone with or without sensitive skin and to friends and family!</li>
            <li> quick and is long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Also, because of the cool bar, the shaver head is quite large, which makes it difficult to shave between my nose and top lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from needing to be thoughtful as to the placement of the base, its a great system and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> While the performance was great on my face, it was very poor on my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li> Went on a trip this past weekend and the small case and dock fit nicely in to my luggage and didn&#x27;t take much room on the counter when</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the cooltec is a solid shaver it works the best of any electric ive used in the past and the cooling really helps with the irritation ive gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> This razor was very helpful with the latter and only a bit better with the former.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is only appropriate for evening out sideburns; precision facial hair detailing simply cannot be accomplished with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a side note the long hair trimmer was not as powerful as older razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric razors in the past (including older Braun models)</li>
            <li> me start off by saying that for the previous decade, I had been a loyal Braun user ‚Äì first the predecessor to their 500 series and then the 790 series until just this year.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer provided accurate and sharp cut&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> and I would like it to be available on other shavers of its type.</li>
            <li> I first started using it, I noticed what others commented about re: not cutting a lot of barely too long hairs.</li>
            <li> ¬∞CoolTec System left me with a shave just as close as a blade, and the cooling factor prevented the red burn marks that I have experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with cartridge razors, but this Braun is able to get a very close shave which surprised me.</li>
            <li> There were one or two pulls around my chin, but it was smooth other than that.</li>
            <li> but it is not something i couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Which means that the machine keep working and giving noisy until the battery run out!&lt;br /&gt;Although P&amp;G provide a change service, it takes 1-2 weeks before they give me a new (I doubt) body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this new shaver, i don&#x27;t have the problem of razor burn or the feeling of hairs being pulled out of my face at all.</li>
            <li> so thr Braun setup was new to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not setting any new speed records, I gave this product 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - I found my new fave shaver ...again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - I found my new fave shaver ...again.</li>
            <li> Sounded like a new idea</li>
            <li> Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞</li>
            <li> new technology.</li>
            <li> About a month ago I was shopping for the replacement head for the 790CC when I came across the new Cooltec.  </li>
            <li> So after a month I returned it and purchased the new 790CC.  </li>
            <li> I found them on Amazon.com for about $5 a piece, but having never paid for a solution for my shaver, this is a new cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received this new shaver &amp; of course decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyday I use this shaver I feel like I&#x27;m setting new speed records.  </li>
            <li> I had been anticipating this new type of electric razor from Braun for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This shaver features a Braun&#x27;s new CoolTec aluminum cooling bar which causes a cooling sensation when shaving.</li>
            <li> I received the new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by the Braun company.</li>
            <li> After i used it all week, i went home and put it in the docking station and when I pulled it out it looked all new and shiny again.</li>
            <li> I was exited to try out the new CoolTec system because I thought it would speed up my shaving process.</li>
            <li> I was intereseted to try a new model and see if the technology had improved.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new electric razor</li>
            <li> I recieve this product through a promotion from Braun and I was stoked to try the new &amp;#34;cool tec&amp;#34; feature.</li>
            <li> I saw the promotion that Braun was running to try out the new CoolTec, I did some research.</li>
            <li> I looked forward to the arrival of my new razor that I was selected to receive through a promotion from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels and smells like a new razor every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a chance to use the new Braun CoolTec System provided via a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System, through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> When I got my new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System through a program they offer, I had to put it to the test.  </li>
            <li> I was provided  Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already retired my old razor for this new one!</li>
            <li> The cold bar really did reduce irritation and felt great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I found that the Braun CoolTec delivers on its promises regarding the active cooling technology, cleaning system, and comfortable design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I had tried before felt more like it pulled the hair out versus cutting it.  </li>
            <li> The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face.</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive skin, one of the main issues with electric shavers is that they generate heat, followed by redness and irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li> Overall I found the shave better than expected, but still not as close on the neck as I need.</li>
            <li> The cooling features are pretty cool (no pun intended) and aren&#x27;t as gimmicky as I imagined they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it when I want an extra close shave, because I feel only a blade, shaving against the grain can get my face baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> with some previous Braun models, this include the built-in cleaning system, and is very convenient to clean your razor at the push of a button.  </li>
            <li> When you do open the box you will see more parts than expected.</li>
            <li> and I have never really been satisfied with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base and CoolTec functionality are wonderful features to have in an electric shaver, and they really do work as advertised.</li>
            <li> The main reason I switched to manual razors years ago is because I have sensitive skin and pushing an electric shaver around my face used to leave me with blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job for an electric shaver on his thick facial hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting back to its not the CoolTecs Fault, because I have thick follicles, as others may have, the system is tougher for us to use, electric shavers are not for everyone, but this one does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cooling bar really does cut down on irritation and just plain feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used my new shaver that I received through a program run by Braun for a few weeks now and while it provides some unique qualities it certainly missed the mark on others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really hold this against it though since no other razor I&#x27;ve seen can handle longer hair (1/8th - 1/4 inch) with any competency.  </li>
            <li> The manual is very clear and it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face and shaving often leads to razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you will find is that the Series 7 is the Lexus of the group, with very fast performance, extra bells and whistles (three modes of shaving), and nicer aesthetics.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and after three weeks of using this product 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I think I prefer the old reliable razor and shaving gel over this high tech gizmo though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and almost always just a razor, however with the CoolTec</li>
            <li> Another drawback is that it takes up a lot of counter space and the self-cleaning is very loud.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and electric razor tear up my face.  </li>
            <li> very sensitive skin and the CoolTec razor has an added bonus of a cooling bar built into the razor.</li>
            <li> As a man with very sensitive skin, I was hesitant yet intrigued to try out the shaver.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get into the curvier areas of my face and neck and feel like I had to make multiple passes in multiple directions to get any kind of good</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for about 15 years now, but I have only owned Norelco razors, so I was interested to try out a new brand to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll whirr and buzz a bit for about 5 minutes, but when you use the razor the next morning, it feels as new as the first time you fired it up.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shave that it provides is only decent at best, especially compared to my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have tough facial hair and like the smooth closeness that I am able to achieve using my manual razor.</li>
            <li> head of the shaver seemed to clog up pretty quick when clearing heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, especially around my neck, but I haven&#x27;t even had as much as one red mark.</li>
            <li> It did cut a bit, but required too much work for those little results, which wasn&#x27;t the clean shave</li>
            <li> In the past I felt like I was doing a lot of stubble clean up after the first go around, and now with my new CoolTec razor</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is pretty big.</li>
            <li> I will most likely put it in storage and just rinse out the shaver head like I do with all my other shavers.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation soothes the burn I normally feel on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And the first time i used it, a red mark and irritation occurred on my neck</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and have to shave often this is a must!</li>
            <li> I have pretty low expectations for shaving</li>
            <li> The reason I can&#x27;t give this product a higher rating is because I found I had to go over my lower neck a number of times for the hair there to finally be fully removed.</li>
            <li> First to lead off I am a lifetime disposable razor user my entire life.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station/charger is pretty big for a shaver this size also but understandable since it cleans your shaver as well.</li>
            <li> I used to operate electric razors for many years until this past year.</li>
            <li> Having a higher speed for this specific purpose would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First the obvious one, the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> This is the complete package!  </li>
            <li> After the third use my skin didn&#x27;t have that after shave hot feeling!&lt;br</li>
            <li> kit comes with cleaning liquid, apparently making the whole package ineligible for return.  </li>
            <li> but I usually put coconut oil/teatreeoil blend on as aftershave most days.</li>
            <li> I would not say I normally have overly sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li> I recemend you purchase this razor a significant other.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who is used to electric shavers and especially to anyone looking to get one for the first time..  </li>
            <li> This shaver is definitely better than all of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am not usually one for electric razors</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I would actually recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> first impression when I received my CoolTec shaver in the mail were that aesthetics were simple, yet sleek.</li>
            <li> First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  </li>
            <li> Indeed it was better than any other shaving machine I used (although last time was about 5 years ago).</li>
            <li> If I did experience redness or irritation, I can see how the really &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooling bar might help, and the 3-stage cutting system might be a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> If you can afford the higher end model, I would definitely say you should skip this one and move up to the 790cc.</li>
            <li> I never thought it could be my old razor doing this!  </li>
            <li> Shave 5 star - may not be as close as other systems, but my need is to be able to shave daily at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW at the stuff!  </li>
            <li> WOW at the reading material!  </li>
            <li> Shaving is not my favorite thing to do, my skin usually doesn‚Äôt react well to this activity.</li>
            <li> At first, this sensation felt different on my face</li>
            <li> It took about a week to two weeks before I was comfortable enough/skilled enough to trim around the facial hair I wanted without having to supplement with my old razor.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to be willing to go over those areas around the edges of your sideburns and facial hair (ie moustaches, goatees)</li>
            <li> I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with electric razors, but when I‚Äôve used them I did experience a pretty substantial amount of irritation especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Normally I shave every other day, so this was a true test.</li>
            <li> First of all I am no grizzly Adams when it comes to growing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use an electric razor</li>
            <li> Like most other similar razors, it keeps it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned electric razors in the past which were better at doing this.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation feels pleasant on the skin, and there&#x27;s definitely less irritation than the old Norelco that I previously used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After i was done i took of the screen and brushed away the hairs using the supplied brush and put it in its cradle for its first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> All I can say is Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different electric shavers and razors, but most of them end up causing moderate to severe razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the first time I used the cleaning station, I set it at night before going to bed and the thing kept running through the night and was still going when I woke up 7 hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first batch of cleaning fluid</li>
            <li> First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this razor does have a cool (but bulky) base, a nice cool bar in the middle (which seems more of a gimmick than actually a benefit), and a  solid weight.</li>
            <li> It does the job, though certainly not as close and clean of a shave as the old Braun 790 or the new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I do find that its a little too easy to turn off the cooling feature with the location of the button on the handle.</li>
            <li> With the touch of a button, the charging/cleaning station takes care of all the messy cleaning and it will be ready to use, clean and charged,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close, my girlfriend believes it&#x27;s actually closer than my manual razor (I&#x27;m not totally sold on that, but I look clean shaven afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this out by growing out some decent facial hair to really test this shaver out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge system is similar to my 7 Series and uses the SAME cleaning cartridges</li>
            <li> After making several passes and different directions, I still needed to use a disposable razor to clean up what this electric missed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long hair shaver/groomer on the back works just fine, it helps for straightening sideburns and around my neck line.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base also does a great job of keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li> Likewise, no matter how I maneuvered the device, I was left with stray hair below my jaw line and neck, which I ultimately had to clean up using a manual razor.</li>
            <li> well keeps the blades clean and sharp</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I may be, my neck most especially becomes very irritated, red, and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried an electric shaver since I was in high school, when I discovered that my facial hair was very course.</li>
            <li> With that said this razor only gets the cooling liquid on maybe a third of my face which is then pointless for the rest of my face, there needs to be a better way for it to meter the amount applied to the face so that you can get full coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of shaving brands and products in my adult life, and this might be one of my new favorites.  </li>
            <li> It offers a bunch of features that some don&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Putting the head back on was just as easy and popping it on the cleaning station for a fresh, complete clean was a snap, much easier than other razors that you need to disassemble piece by piece, then lubricate with a spray or other third party agent, then most likely next time you use will need to apply a pre-electric shave gel or other prepping agent.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and the handle fits easily in my hand.</li>
            <li> For my first shave, I let my beard grow as long as I normally do for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I have been always told that the best time to shave is after a hot shower because that&#x27;s when the pores are opened; considering that, I was somewhat fearful of how my face will react to the cooltec system.</li>
            <li> The cool bar in the Braun gives a nice cold sensation which seems to help reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a higher end electric razor for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the only issue i would have is the price, i am not sure i would spen that kind of money on a shaver, but i do see the value in it.</li>
            <li> I have never really found an electric razor that performs adequately on my skin.  </li>
            <li> stand is solid and the cleaning functionality is really cool and actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cooling technology should be built into the razor head system to keep the shaver head cool, it doesn&#x27;t actually need to touch the skin (unless that&#x27;s the only way it works).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had razor burn issues with electric shavers in the past, but so far this thing is as smooth as, well, ice!</li>
            <li> You still need to splash your face with cold water after you shave but during the shave it is a nice cool</li>
            <li> I got the CoolTec shaver the other day from a special program conducted by Braun and all that changed.</li>
            <li> When Braun asked me to participate in a trial of a new razor, I was excited because of the experience I have had with my previous razor.</li>
            <li> For longer hair, I find it always better to use a trimmer to shave down as much as possible before using this razor for finer hair shaving.  </li>
            <li> The only positive I can truly come up with</li>
            <li> But overall, my feelings are positive and I would recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a positive experience overall.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is moderate to light, so I mainly groom instead of shaving everything and the Braun CoolTec can cut close enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does get nice and cold, yet not uncomfortable, and provides a shave that does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> If you have a small bathroom with a tiny vanity, plan on this baby taking up more real estate</li>
            <li> If you have a small bathroom with a tiny vanity, plan on this baby taking up more real estate</li>
            <li> I was not itchy or irritated during or after the shaving process (which is not always true with other razors).</li>
            <li> After the shave, there was no irritation and my face felt cool rather than on fire as with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fancy ones) for a clean and closer shave, I was looking for something new with less irritation, bumps, etc.</li>
            <li> My regular razor does too, but I&#x27;m spending probably $15-20 on disposables each week to keep that \\&quot;new blade\\&quot; look, and it adds up fast.</li>
            <li> I recently received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System thanks to a program run by Braun and it has been a mind-blowing shaving experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s being advertised heavily and it&#x27;ll be the first thing you&#x27;ll notice right away on your face, the cooling factor.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver left my skin feeling much more irritated.</li>
            <li> I think it is less an issue with the shaver and more a problem with the thickness of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation is more is less the same sensation you&#x27;d get by pulling a can of Coke out of your fridge and rubbing it on your face.  </li>
            <li> but above a 3 because of how much better it did over previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair grows quickly and I got pulling from the razor and did not get a close shave at all, even after trying multiple angles and doing a pre-trim.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to pull my skin tight to get a close shave and also perform a light shave with a disposable razor to ensure all the whiskers were gone.  </li>
            <li> The fact is that my facial hair is course, grows fast, and the skin below all of this is very sensitive to razor burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The razor did fine in a few spots on my neck but would still leave hair in some areas</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid also smells nice and you get a slight whiff of it once you start shaving the next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimmer smaller and doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous Braun models, i have an old one from about 5 years ago and love the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to shave my entire face in a quarter of the time it took with my old Braun razor (less passes), and even after not shaving in over a month</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is easy to use and works very well, I actually let the hair on my head grow out a few days to see if the Cooltec could handle it and to see how well the cleaning system works.</li>
            <li> I turned the shaver &#x27;on&#x27; and the &#x27;active cool&#x27;....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, while it is a little bit more money than some of the Philips Norelco electric shavers and a few other brands, I do think it is a much better value with the CoolTec included, particularly if you have sensitive skin and electric shavers tend to irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To give a little more background, my skin is pretty sensitive so with the manual I always suffered from those bumps due to irritation from the shave</li>
            <li> With the CoolTec razor, I certainly FEEL like this thing is from the future...</li>
            <li> This causes little irritation and results in a comfortable shave experience.</li>
            <li> It is very weak, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job for precision</li>
            <li> Since I have been using the clean and charge station daily, which charges the shaver, I can‚Äôt confirm how long the battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also one of the main perks I think of a electric shaver would be the whole saving money in the long run.</li>
            <li> It trims down alright, wasn&#x27;t like a clean shave though.</li>
            <li> However, because I found myself having to go over the same areas (particularly on the neck) several times in order to get a clean shave, it actually took me almost 10 minutes longer to complete my shave using the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> product is worth every single penny!  </li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 because I thought the foil on the 7000 series cut a little better on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec left me a little more stubbly than I would have</li>
            <li> , I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to a family member or friend if they have a little more to invest in their shaver system - short term and long-term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most electric shavers, it still missed a little that needed a follow-up with a manual razor to get everything, but I will definitely add this to my routine.  </li>
            <li> and although I love the CoolTech system the shaving falls a little short.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great shaver for on those cold, windy, razor-burn prone days</li>
            <li> The cooling system which is a metal bar that gets quite cold is great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning light comes on everyday even if I rinse it off completely...  </li>
            <li> so I can clear my counter and not have the bulky cleaning system taking up space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since getting this, I have alternated between using my old Norelco for daily touch ups, as it is much lighter and quicker to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my thicker beard hair I&#x27;ve become accustomed to having to clear the blades of manual razors after every stroke.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would probably be great for someone with light/moderate facial hair growth but probably won&#x27;t work out for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but my old shaver left me with a much smoother finish than this Braun ¬∞CoolTec</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who has sensitive skin or suffers from razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week, I was reaching for my old Braun instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be the razor that fixed this problem.  </li>
            <li> (disclaimer...there wasn&#x27;t much hair left) and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised by the performance of the razor.  </li>
            <li> However, I was surprised by the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> It works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs by the back of my jawline.  </li>
            <li> The cooling feature was strange at first</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I recommend this shaving system to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have had it for nearly a month</li>
            <li> Q: this one was designed for sensitive skin where my husbands is not.  </li>
            <li> It charges fast and to know that my shaver is cleaner than it would be with a regular water rinse</li>
            <li> But for those that frequently shave, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use the self cleaning station often.</li>
            <li> It may be to early to tell if this will change my habits, but I am going to give it another 3-4 weeks and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar cools almost instantly, no need to wait, and absolutely reduced the irritation.  </li>
            <li> For the price it cost, I still would still to the generic razors who can give me a close shave regardless of how much growth I have had.</li>
            <li> was about 8 years old and in need of replacement.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m thinking about pulling the old model out of the drawer...</li>
            <li> It helps with the sensitive skin that I have.</li>
            <li> -Cleaner is loud - You don&#x27;t have to use it too often</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;15 years ago my face became so sensitive I had to stop using a razor and shave gel</li>
            <li> And it irritates my skin (likely because I need to shave so much).</li>
            <li> The adaptable 3 -stage cutting system and sensoBlade seems to be giving a nice comfortable shave, but doesn&#x27;t pick up all the facial hair in one run.  </li>
            <li> Have to look a few time and even feel in the area after shaving to see if it is smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell but</li>
            <li> Also, now that I think about it, I do not believe I can plug a cable directly into the razor in order to charge it.</li>
            <li> This razor is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looooooved the cooling aspect immediately.</li>
            <li> I have literally been shaving my face daily, which is something unusual for me because of the ease and close</li>
            <li> I had been using an old Braun model I got when I started college years ago</li>
            <li> Finally a shaver that really has it all.</li>
            <li> I just hope the cleaning fluid is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no matter my choice of shaving</li>
            <li> and it will be ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> It also has that barber shop smell to it while shaving that reminds you of the old guy who used to cut your hair growing up or the guy that lines you up at the barber</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but my skin was to sensitive to continue use.</li>
            <li> I like the way that my series 7 shaver&#x27;s head moves with the curvature of my face where as this razor has a fixed head and does not move.  </li>
            <li> user‚Äôs manual was clearly written and concise.  </li>
            <li> far as effectiveness goes, I find the shave to be a close as any electric I‚Äôve tried‚Äî</li>
            <li> but since the station is meant to store the shaver when not in use, this is no trouble.  </li>
            <li> I found that the shaver works really well if your hair is already trimmed or short.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to men who want to shave frequently and have sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> I happen to have sensitive skin, and this shave made a difference even from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to my crummy old ones</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I still use a manual razor to trim up sideburns, it has a trimmer built in the side, but for me it is quicker and easier to do it the old way.</li>
            <li> and I thought the cooling sensation reduced irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that it WAY outperforms my old razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately there are a couple negative aspects to this razor, but from what I hear they are an issue with most electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only real issue that might turn you off the CoolTec is the fact that the cooling element seems to overheat after about 15-20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it this far.</li>
            <li> The product also includes a docking station that cleans and charges your shaver having it ready to go for the next time you need to shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize, Braun has a real winner here and a very big product differentiator from competitors.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, but not too light.</li>
            <li> This causes me to have to go over areas multiple times and really pull the skin to get it to trim the hair.</li>
            <li> I got this as an upgrade to my old Braun Activator 8600 when its trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li> The shave is inferior to my almost 10 year old Activator 8600.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is also loud and it sounds like a trash compactor, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of irritation, WOW.  </li>
            <li> This was the first foil shaver I have used in a long time</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> What follows is a point-by-point review of this shaver, and for reference, I&#x27;ll be comparing it to my old rotary</li>
            <li> Another issue for me was the fact that it seems easier to maneuver my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> than my old electric shaver could get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I seem to have to spend a lot of time on my neck to get it completely</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that there was no irritation or hair pulling</li>
            <li> The Razor is supposed to tell you when it needs cleaning, so far the icon has turned on after every use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Evidently this shaver is not designed to deal with longer hair, with the exception of the trimmer on the back, but I was not going to use that on my whole face.</li>
            <li> found the low temperature feature to really facilitate shaving.</li>
            <li> I recieved my kit and was taken back by just how much Braun provided in the package.  </li>
            <li> For someone like myself by that has sensitive neck skin</li>
            <li> The old Braun 8985 allows me to do this</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t cut the hair very well, and I keep flipping between the trimmer in the back and the front blades to try to get it.</li>
            <li> As far as the CoolTec technology goes, I could take it or leave it.</li>
            <li> like I feel with my old electric razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is completely</li>
            <li> BUT since we have the cleaning system to fall back on every once in a while, I don&#x27;t worry as much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an electric too often, but my old Norelco just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it any longer for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out went the Norelco, and the Braun is now making its home near my sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it on three trips so far and haven&#x27;t been concerned with it breaking.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised with all that came with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for the last 8 years and really like the brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will completely give up my manual razor</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d probably give 3.5 stars instead of 4 just for how long it took me to shave, but this product does exactly what it states it&#x27;s going to do and worked very well.</li>
            <li> It allows me to shave while doing another task if I am in a big hurry getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li> It was very soothing to the my skin and definitely helped with razor burn.</li>
            <li> So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another Braun razor, because I really like them, a different model</li>
            <li> Was given this as a early birthday gift.</li>
            <li> This shaver let&#x27;s me hit the big areas fast</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Braun CoolTec for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the blades are breaking in or my skin and the razor are becoming friends,</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to razor burn, I would say yes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> second time I tried it - I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days, which was reasonable for using a machine.</li>
            <li> I immediately tested it out and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It really struggles to get neck hairs on only 24 hours of not shaving.  </li>
            <li> Since I was in college, in the early 1990&#x27;s, I have used blade razors.  </li>
            <li> I still have and works my 8 year old Braun 7526 which kills this model.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as a razor.  </li>
            <li> I was provided this shaver by Braun to test in early November and have been using now for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> shaver charge lasted nearly 7 days using the CoolTec functionality for all the shaves.  </li>
            <li> It is so loud that I won&#x27;t use it early in the morning for fear that I will wake up my wife.  </li>
            <li> My razor was cleaned, charged, and ready to go the next morning after setting it up.</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest shaver I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It has some weight to it but its not heavy.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is need of an electric shaver who wants to have a clean-shaven look in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect can really be felt and while you are shaving it puts you under the notion that you aren&#x27;t irritated but as soon as you are done the itch and redness come back.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to really compare it to because I have not used shaving lotion with my last Braun razor.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and struggle to find an electric razor that both leaves me with a close shave and without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I got the cooltec shaver system a few weeks ago for free through the braun program and have been using it exclusively since.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , what can I say, I am a sensitive guy.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn like I do with my old one.</li>
            <li> I know that I‚Äôm not going to get anywhere near a cartridge razor shave with an electric, but this wasn‚Äôt close to acceptable.</li>
            <li> I have had an old shaver for quite sometime</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t grow facial hair exceptionally fast.  </li>
            <li> I went 3 days without shaving, and it took me about 15 minutes to complete my shave...</li>
            <li> and you have to change the plane of your shaving frequently in order to get those stubborn whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is nicer than the run-of-the-mill Braun, quieter, and faster.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cooling feature it definitely helps keep my face from getting irritated.</li>
            <li> I got a close shave with out razor burn which often happpens to my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Close shave - by far</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I told my brother about it since we both have the sensitive skin issue and I am waiting to hear how he likes it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would completely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, A+ on the cooling action, but just a B on the shave.</li>
            <li> My old electric razor just yanked out the hair</li>
            <li> but my old razor was thrown out.</li>
            <li> consider myself very picky about my shave, especially on my head</li>
            <li> I received this razor directly from Bruan in a marketing campaign.</li>
            <li> As this is my first electric razor that has had a cleaning AND charging station in one, I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I can say that it works extremely well and seems to keep the blades sharp and it definitely keeps the razor in top working order because of its cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would try this razor again if Braun fixed it</li>
            <li> The CoolTech ranks up there with my Series 7 and maybe even above my Series 7 (at a much lower price</li>
            <li> I have had an old Braun for about 5 years</li>
            <li> I do find that it takes a longer time to complete my shave than if I use a manual razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the cooling on the razor.  </li>
            <li> only reason I give this razor 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 is because the trimmer attachment leaves MUCH to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Always have a break out after shaving because of sensitive skin but with this it has not been an issue at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys electric shavers, but has sensitive skin or breaks.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth with straight razors vs electric</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to work around your skin for coverage and a complete shave.</li>
            <li> My Adam&#x27;s Apple stick out fairly far</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the unit and between the old experience and now this improved experience...</li>
            <li> So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> The cooling kicked in almost immediately and provided a marked difference to the feel of the shaver against my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very pricey and not up to standard.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether or not its worth the extra money for cooling technology that I don&#x27;t actually need.  </li>
            <li> So I think the razor is not cutting as deep as my regular razor is.</li>
            <li> Awesome sleek look of the shaver while seated in the base.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want or need poorly made tools and was thrilled upon opening this gift to find a well built machine.</li>
            <li> The initial shave, after trimming my beard down took a really long time compared to a safety razor, but subsequent shaves were really good and didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge and clean station has only a power connection and a single button that activates the cleaning</li>
            <li> I had a full beard, so I used the built-in trimmer to bring my beard down to stubble.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the stubble down, and it leaves my skin feeling cool and soothed afterward.</li>
            <li> The shaver is completely clean without any mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the shaver also comes with a little brush and a sturdy shaver-shaped travel case which is handy in avoiding getting hair &#x27;crumbs&#x27; on other toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the razor, but it was not strong enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new CoolTec shaver does offer a small light on the shaver that indicates when it needs cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I currently have a series 7 Braun razor that I normally use but have put that aside to test this new razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something about the cooling technology just works better, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This also makes shaving right under my nose more difficult.</li>
            <li> Its so insanely easy to use, and requires very little effort to upkeep.  </li>
            <li> First off, this is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a smooth face and doesn&#x27;t leave any redness behind, all thanks to the active cooling technology.</li>
            <li> Its head does not swivel (which is a downside as discussed later), but it is quite easily to manipulate up and down the face and into those nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> I normally use just regular disposable shavers, and although im not a huge fan of electric shavers, I was excited to try the new Braun CoolTec Shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but unless there is some catastrophically epic failure then I&#x27;ve likely found my new favorite shaver!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close electric shave while keeping your skin free of bumps from irritation of other electric razors.</li>
            <li> For the first shave, I did what the instructions suggested and did a completely dry shave.</li>
            <li> The cooltec does not get as close of a shave, the trimmer is in a odd position, and the while it does cool</li>
            <li> The cool tech make the shave have less irritation</li>
            <li> This is pretty minor though since the overall shave feels better with the CoolTec technology, and any irritation I had in the past is gone.</li>
            <li> so if this new system causes me less irritation than it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it‚Äôs not due for a cleaning, the charging station is even smaller and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different brands of electric razors in the past, including other Braun razors, but this system has by far impressed me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as my other razor</li>
            <li> It has a very small cooling surface, so in my case, it wasn&#x27;t able to keep up with the heat put out by my water.  </li>
            <li> No mess no fuss.</li>
            <li> shaver provides the same above average closeness as many high-end systems but, there was literally zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Cooltec to anyone, especially to men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe these style shavers work for some guys, but for me, a high quality 3 head lift and cut would be my second choice (old school lather and blade razor</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a foil razor and as such comes pretty close to a clean shave, but there was still a little bit of stubble left despite the direction or number of times</li>
            <li> It is not the same plastic that the shaver uses and the putting the cleaning solution in the base can be a pain because the solution container has large openings at the top so it tens to spill easy while taking the old out and putting the new in.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, you&#x27;re instructed to clean via an included cleaning kit.</li>
            <li> the only thing I could complain about the product are it does not do as decent of a job on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> The 7000 side was all red and the CoolTec was a cool pink and no redness at all.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not typically an electric shaver type of person.  </li>
            <li> The contrast of the hot shower and the nice cold bar made shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> That first instant of cooling on your face was different...</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin that usually dries out with shaving, the cooltec system allows me to get a close, comfortable shave without the irritation.  </li>
            <li> the Braun CoolTec is a decent shaver system, but I probably would not buy it for the price it currently being sold for.</li>
            <li> The cooling part keeps me from becoming irritated for sure, which would make the experience significantly worse, but having to cover the same spots multiple times makes for a long shave.</li>
            <li> main thing I like about the CoolTec shaver over a traditional cartridge shaver is it seems to be a bit quicker.</li>
            <li> Overall is a decent razor and cleaner than using a manual razor.</li>
            <li> so I usually end up going back to clippers pretty quick after trying a razor, and just forgetting about a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I continue let me say that, I work in the spa industry and am fully aware of all thing steps need before shaving, I am a mix race hispanic/african american male with, medium course hair.</li>
            <li> However, I cleaned it again after my first use and the next time I shaved with it, there was no fluid leaking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I have used it for the past several weeks and as an electric razor, this is top notch.</li>
            <li> I used the big holder on my counter top and kept the small one for travel.</li>
            <li> And the cleaning process itself, while quick, is a little loud.</li>
            <li> The charger also contains alcohol based fluid to keep it clean which other razors can not say that.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend the Braun CoolTek Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> I personally think its high time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, though, I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who uses electric razors regularly or is looking to try one out.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor, as I received it as part of a program run by Braun, and it came through on some and fell short on others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product especially if you have any type of irritation or redness while shaving.</li>
            <li> The new CoolTec shaver is a recharging nearly self cleaning gadget with a cooling plate above and below the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> There was definitely an adjustment period for me when it came to switching from my old rotary shaver to this new one.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shavers after nearly 30 years of shaving with various Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li> (how many times in your life are you in the market for a new electric razor?), but this could indeed be a game changer for</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a definite huge upgrade from my previous electric shaver and will make me ditch my razors.</li>
            <li> It felt great and seemed like it was heck of a lot less irritating.</li>
            <li> I like that you can use it wet or dry and truly enjoy the fact that it cools as it shaves.  </li>
            <li> (strange).&lt;br /&gt;Charging time was surprisingly fast, straight out of the box it has no jiuce, and about a half hour on the charger</li>
            <li> It did a much better job of close shaving if used every day but did have a tough time (as expected) with dealing with a weeks worth of scruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using the new CoolTec shaver for the past three weeks to get thru the initial stage, as most shavers requires some time to adjust to your specific skin and hair type.</li>
            <li> Since I frequently use safety razors, I&#x27;m used to getting right down close to the skin.</li>
            <li> The bar is cool to the skin, but not enough to make it feel unpleasant, it cools the skin as it shaves it and gives it a nice relaxing feeling to wake you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much to shave since I grow a beard, so I would expect it not to take that long to shave my face.</li>
            <li> I really like how close of a shave I can get with this system as well, it&#x27;s as close as a blade shave as long as you maintain,</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very think and coarse and combine that with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It can take me 3-4 times as long to get all the hair removed as opposed to just using my straight razor.</li>
            <li> but I was never able to get a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally just use a razor but that I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different shavers and blades and normally end up with an irritated spot on my neck.  </li>
            <li> But the shave was pretty close, just not as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> One last thing, it didn&#x27;t seem to be any quicker than my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious though how this shaver feels once hot in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I normally shave with a traditional razor 2) I have owned and used 2 electric razors in my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive used the Braun Cooltec a few times already, which I had received from Braun through a promotional campaign, which admittedly has been tricky since I have decided to go beard/scruff for a while, and grooming my neck/jawline is simply easier with a more traditional grooming tool and a Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a few stragglers, but that is true when using any electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar does take extra space in the unit&#x27;s head, so the foils are noticeably further apart than my other foil shaver, which is fine on the face and neck, but</li>
            <li> The razor definitely feels cool against the face while shaving but not very cool.</li>
            <li> This was just the right side, so now I had to see if it would hold the same performance for the left side and front neck area on the same charge.</li>
            <li> I usually only use electric shavers and I have to sometimes go over certain hairs several times to get them.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to work a little better than it did.</li>
            <li> The shaver gets a close enough shave that it feels smooth going with the grain, but you can feel a little stubble going against the grain of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall it isn&#x27;t that bad the cooling is also pretty neat its worth giving it a shot for sure</li>
            <li> only drawback was that it seems the product did not have super sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Is there any way I could send this one back and get a new one?  </li>
            <li> He works on them and drop kicks them into functioning one last time for about a year and then gives in to a new purchase.</li>
            <li> With the new CoolTec technology, I can finally get a close shave without my skin feeling like it&#x27;s on fire.  </li>
            <li> I recently received a new Braun CoolTec Shaver as part of a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> Braun makes a solid product and this new unit feels just a rugged.</li>
            <li> I was checking several times a day to receive the new state-of-the-art product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun electric shaver for several years now, so when offered the opportunity to participate in a trial program for some new technology</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, the Braun CoolTec would definitely be my suggestion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this shaver 2-3 times a week for the last 3 weeks I have formed a new opinion.</li>
            <li> Well, after finally deciding to get a new Braun shaver I ended up settling with the Cooltec.</li>
            <li> I recently got to try out the new Braun Cooltec shaver.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs not so big that it takes over my sink space, but the foil and blades come out like new each time.</li>
            <li> Because of the new CoolTec razor, I can leave for work in the morning knowing that I don&#x27;t have those red streaks to hide on my neck nor</li>
            <li> The cooling feature works well  and is new and different.</li>
            <li> It took a month for my facial hair to become accustomed to the new razor.  </li>
            <li> He had a lot of trouble with patchy red blotches on his skin with his old razor, probably skin fungus because there was no way to really clean the razor heads.  </li>
            <li> The unit has a pretty long charge life, and as such travels well.  </li>
            <li> I found myself going over the same spot multiple times and having to really stretch my skin to get some hairs.</li>
            <li> facial hair and this razor would not cut it very well and it was definitely a close shave.</li>
            <li> I thought this may have happened because my hair was too long the first time I tried the shaver out, but each time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem.</li>
            <li> The shaver effortlessly performed the same way through out my whole face and neck, shaving off all my beard hair and giving me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> It totally eliminated that irritation I would get on my neck is gone, and at the same time, I also get a much closer shave than ever</li>
            <li> It dealt with a few days of stubble with no issue, and left me silky smooth, which quite frankly I was suprised at.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was completely amazed with the quality of shave and ease of use of the Braun CoolTec shaver and my expectations, low as they were, were far exceeded.  </li>
            <li> I couldn‚Äôt really afford to spend this extra time in the mornings before work, especially when the results were subpar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY</li>
            <li> their circular cutting head does a far superior job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual foil shavers are spaced very far apart in comparison to series 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, especially on my neck</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to leave it to (ironically) cool down after that before you can get the cooling benefit back.</li>
            <li> the shave is comparable to the Braun 8985 with the main difference being that the head is large and spread out due to the cooling bar in the middle.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t awful, but really extended the shaving session and mitigated theconvenience of shaving without a sink full of water.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean light.</li>
            <li> Cheeks, the broad strokes of your neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a major plus in my book.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec system definitely helped to reduce that irritation, considerably!  </li>
            <li> Not like other electric shavers that leave the skin feeling hot.  </li>
            <li> I use this product daily and have tried other Braun products in the past, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and normally use a different Braun cordless shaver since a standard razor irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was immediately evident that the manufacturer has observed problems with other razors and has systematically attempted to solve them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often times I have had problems with skin irritation whether I used a manual or electric razor, shaving cream or gel, hot water, or any other method to minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> amazing battery on the CoolTec means you only have to charge it for less than an hour once a week in a funky little charging stand that comes with</li>
            <li> My face stayed cool during my entire shave and I felt less itchiness and redness when I was finished.</li>
            <li> I first used the CoolTec razor, the cooling bar took a few moments to cool down.  </li>
            <li> Overall the shave base is nice in that my sink real estate is saved a bit by sprawling cords and shaver parts drying all over the place, and I feel the investment is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li> Right out of the package you can tell that this is not your typical electric razor.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to try something new, have sensitive skin, or hair that grows in a lot of different directions, this one is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li> For me, around a buck a week is a small price to pay for a clean, sanitized razor every day.</li>
            <li> For me, around a buck a week is a small price to pay for a clean, sanitized razor every day.</li>
            <li> If you have used an electric shaver in the past, you know it can sometimes have a funky smell you have to clean with vinegar, not this one.  </li>
            <li> decent: the long hair trimmer leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> I think this is just a minor inconvenience to deal with seeing how cool the razor stays and how I don&#x27;t get the irritation like I did from my other shaver.</li>
            <li> It seemed to take much longer for a typical shave, but was this because this was just a new shaver that I wasn&#x27;t used</li>
            <li> The cooling bar takes a little while to reach 44 degrees, but once it does it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> The thing that I really did like was the active cooling technology that the razor offers.</li>
            <li> Form fitting, tough.  </li>
            <li> It works, feels nice, and the base keeps the razor clean and lubricated for you every morning.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is that, like with many other shavers, it was very tricky getting some of those pesky hairs that refused to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face grows very thickly, and the hair grows in more than one direction.</li>
            <li> My old Braun razor gave me a clean, close shave even if I skipped a few days of shaving; with the CoolTec I have to shave everyday or it becomes a real</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> That being said, there definitely some clear pros and cons that I&#x27;ll outline for</li>
            <li> This razor is very efficient as long as you take your time to hit all areas of your face multiple times.</li>
            <li> To be clear, the cleaning station DOES have a latch, but the smaller charging station DOES NOT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> note that because it comes with the cleaning solution, you apparently cannot return this to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Coming from a guy with sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t say enough about this CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation and a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The Cooltec shaver does offer a cooling feature that you can feel, though it didn&#x27;t seem to help with my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I eventually reverted back to my old shaver and I&#x27;m sticking with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried my old razor the next day just to see the difference</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a quality shaver with a neat cooling action and closeness of cut isn&#x27;t critical</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to my old razor for now.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, you should definitely try the Braun CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li> but since I knew it was coming and was on vacation, decided to let my facial hair be wild for a week or so.</li>
            <li> I spent so much time trying to contort my face to work the razor into all the areas.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how close the shave actually got.  </li>
            <li> Feel soft yet solid when shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes for one of the only electric shavers today tailor made for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li> I have never spent a lot of money on shavers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  apparently the rechargeable battery is the reason it cannot be returned, but Amazon&#x27;s customer service contacted me about a resolution.  </li>
            <li> My old razor could only be rinsed off, which</li>
            <li> The manual was not organized very well, and not much help.</li>
            <li> I put the shaver to use and was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the cooltec tecnology actually worked.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, never really having used an electric shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Electric Razors since my teen years, when my beard was weaker and technologies not so well developed.</li>
            <li> I still feel a barely noticeable stubble.</li>
            <li> I have Very coarse beard hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ve spent much of my life trying razor after razor and shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun (twice).</li>
            <li> It solves multiple problems, especially for frequent travelers and those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had to remove the shaver initially when I first felt it because the sensation was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Normally in the past I have had shavers that leave my face feeling hot or almost burned</li>
            <li> At first I thought my face was wet, but it was actually just the cooling feature.</li>
            <li> From my first use, I noticed that the irritation was minimal and it has only improved.  </li>
            <li> I am able to achieve a close shave without irritating  myself.  </li>
            <li> I received the cool tec razor a few weeks back from a program run by braun</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great smooth shave with zero razor burn, but can be slow at times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great smooth shave with zero razor burn, but can be slow at times.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling element that keeps your skin cool as you shave thus reducing the irritation and redness that my past shavers have caused.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one more reason for a poor rating.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would in the shower, it didn&#x27;t get as close as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this out with a variety of stubble from the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow to a few days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> The razor does not come with a plastic shield over the foil, which I would have liked to have included, as foils and cutters are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad shaver overall, just a few things to improve on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through multiple electric shavers since my first shaver was handed down to me from my dad when my beard just started coming in at the ripe old age of 8...</li>
            <li> While it did cut most of the hairs, it did leave a few stubborn hairs that were laying down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending back under the 60 day money back guarantee and will be ordering a new Series 7.</li>
            <li> After  a month or so ill update post  a new review and see if I have been able to iron out these</li>
            <li> After  a month or so ill update post  a new review and see if I have been able to iron out these</li>
            <li> The 60-day money back guarantee sold me, I figured I could just get my money back when it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Instructions are a bit confusing for an old guy like me but are adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Sleek Design, easy to hold and love the charging base</li>
            <li> I have got a quick growing dark beard with a lot of grey.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar is pretty cool and helps to some degree, but I find that other Braun models - such as the Series 7 - achieve the same or similar results with less</li>
            <li> After using the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System I will be using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lots of blotches and some bleeding, even after a few weeks, lead me to think that this product just isn&#x27;t right for</li>
            <li> I also have trouble with it shaving right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> First, the trimmer is not very strong</li>
            <li> Majority of those previous opinions changed the first time I fired up my Braun CoolTec</li>
            <li> The shave is less than stellar.  </li>
            <li> It actually gives you a pretty close shave without the pulling I&#x27;ve gotten from other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I would personally recommend looking at other brands for a razor first.  </li>
            <li> Having used their electric shavors before, regularly in the past, I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> This was better than almost every other razor I used in the past.</li>
            <li> The Razer didn&#x27;t clean very well within the charger station and when I shaved with it it would regularly leave behind longer hairs.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very very cold while it shaves, which makes it infinitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It really provides a close shave and the cooling feeling while shaving seems to reduce the irritation I am used to experiencing from other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy with this shaver, very solid non-slip grip, battery last a long time with out charging, charger and cleaner</li>
            <li> Comparatively this razor shaved to a much smoother level than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Gillette Fusion is gets me a much closer shave and my other electric shaver is still closer then the CoolTec.</li>
            <li> the cleaning/charging station really makes the product stand out in comparison to other razors I‚Äôve used.  </li>
            <li> then maybe they can make the center cutter the cooling bar (i.e. cool the center cutter) to keep the shaver head as compact as possible.    </li>
            <li> Green when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;d had that shaver so long I have been a big fan of Braun and had high expectations.  </li>
            <li> It makes a strange high pitched squeal when the razor is left in it, so we&#x27;ve taken to either unplugging it or leaving the razor off the dock.</li>
            <li> all in one space saving, the ice cold feature just a press of a button and activate almost instantly, it does get really cold, love the feature that it have and combine together really well, but one thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t work very if the beard gets a little longer, and it still left over little bit of hair that it didn&#x27;t catch which i have to use my old fashion shaver to finish the job (no big deal, it still catches 99% of it), but over all great shaver!</li>
            <li> trimmer is very narrow, and without being able to tilt the head out of the way, difficult to use precisely.  </li>
            <li> But overall I benefit so much from the cooling of the CoolTec that this is my new everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be more awkward and less comfortable and seems to take longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors since I have a thick, coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> The old foils still work, but I need a trimmer to really hit some of the trouble spots.    </li>
            <li> only negative comment I have about the unboxing was that the instructions weren&#x27;t super clear.</li>
            <li> I am a younger guy (in my 20&#x27;s) and do have fairly sensitive skin so the cooling bar definitely got my attention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this to our 14-year old son, who is starting to shave regularly himself.</li>
            <li> I currently have a Braun shaver that is over ten yrs old and is still going.  </li>
            <li> I have brushed from old razors but this would be a bigger deal</li>
            <li> burn which to me is a big plus, and therefore I would recommend it to a person that has the same problem with razor burn or just doesn&#x27;t have to shave as frequently as I.</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t provide a totally bald shave but that microscopic hair that is left is feathery soft.</li>
            <li> This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and it blows my old one out of the water.</li>
            <li> just never really got close enough for my liking or really irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually suffer from razor burn, so the Cool Tech is a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li> The cleansing solution is more antiseptic than &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34;, so if that&#x27;s important, then the base will benefit you.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning station does all the cleaning for you, and everyday my shaver smells and operates like it&#x27;s fresh out of the hygienic shaver factory back in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> loved that the Cooling bar was cold instantly.</li>
            <li> cooling bar definitely works and added a level of refreshing comfort to my skin which I had never experienced before.</li>
            <li> I think I‚Äôm just one of those men who prefers a classic wet shave with shaving lotion and a manual razor.</li>
            <li> I keep a mustache and a goatee, but there are certain spots that need to be shaved around both areas that were a little more difficult using the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a little weird at first as it goes through several cleaning cycles, but the result is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor so getting used to it and the cool sensation was a little weird at first</li>
            <li> (This is a big pain point of mine, the Norelco leaves my neck completely red and itchy, and it still doesn&#x27;t get the hair very well because the grain on the right side of my neck goes a different direction and is really hard to get without the ProGlide.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference compared to what I was no traditional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them in the past, and I love the mobility of them but for some reason I usually drift back towards a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> Certainly is no closer than an older Panasonic shaver i have.</li>
            <li> It does provide a clean, close shave without skin irritation provided that you remember to shave everyday and do not let your facial hair get too long.</li>
            <li> When I was shaving my upper lip, I was only using the top blade which took a little longer than with my previous razor.</li>
            <li> If I have a special event on a saturday, I literally would not shave for at least 4 days and then just before I put on my shirt and headed out the door</li>
            <li> I generally have problems with electric shavers, both due to my sensitive skin and the difficulties in truly keeping them clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t usually purchase one but for this was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer extension is a little smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my last one.</li>
            <li> would say that I have medium-thickness facial hair, at least enough to need to shave every day, or occasionally get away with waiting 2 days, as well as slightly sensitive skin, and this razor system has kept me looking clean and without irritation for over a month now.</li>
            <li> Compared to a Series 7 the results are similar, but because the Series 7 has a faster motor, less passes are required, although this benefit also comes at the expense of higher prices.</li>
            <li> If you happened to forget to charge it after your last use it only takes a few minutes to charge if you only need it for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor handle itself has been slimmed down from previous models making it comfortable to hold and manipulate around the curves your face.</li>
            <li> The cold feeling the razor gives off is actually quite intense, and much more noticeable than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Braun CoolTec Shaver is for someone who has sensitive skin, not thick facial hair or has more time patience to shave and would like to save the money spent on disposable expensive blades.</li>
            <li> The first trial run was on my face (2 days of growth) and cleaned up all, except the small patches near my jaw, with ease and only took about 5-6 min.  </li>
            <li> Also, apparently, this shaver is the only shaver accredited by the Skin Health Alliance (whatever that is)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my receipt of this product happens to coincide with Movember - a time where I am not shaving to support men&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of my old shaver and will be using this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> my upper lip just about every time I use it if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> First off, I received the CoolTec through a Braun promotion and figured I&#x27;d use if for a few weeks and see how it went.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it took getting used to</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to get this item as I was growing tired of my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li> A small bottle to refill it i feel would be both environmentally and economically</li>
            <li> The cooltec aspect is pretty gimmicky -</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the trimmer part could not also be cleaned, as that was the part of the razor that I probably got the most use out of, and was therefore the &amp;#34;dirtiest,&amp;#34; but there is no actual physical way for the cleaning station to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> simply because they seem to have made my everyday life much easier, less messy, more hygienic, cleaner and</li>
            <li> As I use the cooling function intermittently, I can&#x27;t speak to how much it runs down the charge compared to not using</li>
            <li> I tried all sort of techniques like going in a circular formation, straight up and down, etc.  </li>
            <li> Get a really close shave and absolutely NO burn !!</li>
            <li> first off the opening of the box and seeing all the parts was a little bit intimidating, but after glancing at the instructions putting it together and had it working properly in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> &quot; feature instantly activates the cool strip in between the two (2) cutting elements, which actually provides a soothing, cool feeling on your skin during the shave.</li>
            <li> So my expectations were not very high for this shaver, but I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This should be moved and also hold tighter since the power cord is not very long and any pull of the cord, pulls the cord</li>
            <li> After the month I found it easier to use the shaver to shave the main majority of my facial hair and then switch a disposable razor or a straight razor to finish up the hard shave areas.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington shaver, and cleaning was more tedious due to the way the motor assembly attached to the shaver head, and it really tore up my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little confused in the beginning with the metal part in between the razor but its a plus to have it makes my skin feel nice and cool and not hot like other shavers.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this Braun as a gift, not realizing my history with lift and cut razors or that I had just spent money on a new one that I was keeping at work as a back-up.  </li>
            <li> Also the trimmer is easily utilzed and easier to get into the tight little lip crevaces that larger razor and trimmers have issues with.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall minuses would be: non rotating/tilting head makes shaving more difficult and takes more time due to having to go over certain spots over and over again, razor doesn&#x27;t begin to cool down without having to turn the whole thing on which in the car makes things more difficult and the case doesn&#x27;t allow room for charger cord and base.</li>
            <li> and I typically wait 1-2 weeks between cleanings so that I do not use up too much of the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, the razor gives you a very close shave, but there is typically a lot of pain involved in the process.</li>
            <li> My previous model was a Toni &amp; Guy that I picked up in Europe - it went straight in the wastebin once I tried the Braun CoolTec.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Currently swear by the Braun 8985 shaver (with the old \\&quot;skinny bladed\\&quot; cutter block refills) whose life expectancy is long overdue.  </li>
            <li> main selling point of the CoolTech is that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;World&#x27;s 1st shaver with active cooling technology\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The razor I have used for the past few years came with the comodity as well, but to have become acustomed to the cleaning system I&#x27;m glad that the Braun CoolTec shaver does as well.</li>
            <li> The shave was not the closest shave I have ever had, but using the Braun Cooltec shaver is definitely worth it for me since it soothed that swollen, irritated feeling I usually have after shaving with traditional shavers.</li>
            <li> Just a simple click of a button, and the cooling bar is activated, cooling down to a 44 degree mark, and provides a very soothing effect during my shaving activities.  </li>
            <li> I also wish that you could begin cooling down the razor without actually having to turn the whole thing on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Braun CoolTec Shaving system will not completely replace other methods of shaving for me, but it certainly does enhance the experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d venture to say that its specifically responsible for my skin not being an irritated mess after I&#x27;m done shaving.  </li>
            <li> in all, I am a big fan of Braun electric razors (have used the 360 Complete 8985 for about 5 years and the 790cc for the past 3 or so), but those razors just shave so much closer than this model.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other men who haven‚Äôt had much success with other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After shaving with my normal razor, I came back in a couple of days to try the Cooltec again, this time with only minimal stubble.</li>
            <li> several times and when you are first starting you may find a few straggling hairs.</li>
            <li> so I figured why not - from the first time I used this shaver I knew it was different - it seriously was cool to the skin the entire shave (which was kind of odd, but not in a bad way) - I completely shaved and no irritation.</li>
            <li> It really works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I am rather hairy and my facial hair grows quickly and rather thick.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy after all the great things I heard.</li>
            <li> The shave went relatively fast and I did not find myself needing to go over many areas repeatedly, except for a few small trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> So I thought maybe my facial hair was oily, since it was in the middle of the afternoon when I shaved instead of right after a shower like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that I&#x27;m not keen on is how long the cleaning solution lasts, how much it costs and how it is refilled.</li>
            <li> The primary issue I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past was extreme irritation.  </li>
            <li> only negative comment I have about the razor is that with the cooling bar in the middle, the 2 blades are pretty far apart and the head is quite larger than my 9595.</li>
            <li> At the sink was fine, but still a bit irritating.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get everything with just an electric razor (I usually go over it with a manual one after), but it does just as good as any other I have tried out.  </li>
            <li> I have some pretty long, tough beard hair and the long hair trimmer didn&#x27;t seem big enough, nor powerful enough to make any headway.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the little travel shaver stand was a neat idea along with the very sturdy case for your shaver.  </li>
            <li> the shave I&#x27;ve gotten from the Braun razor has been a very close shave with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> The new CoolTec system is unlike any other shaver I have seen.</li>
            <li> It was tough to get it smooth but the cooltec kept me from getting irritated which meant I could use it every morning without issue.</li>
            <li> What happened next was somewhat unexpected, but also mixed a slew of positive and negative factors for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slight oddity in that Braun has designed this with the shaver at an angle when cleaning/charging (I believe to allow for the cleaning solution to drain from the shaver more efficiently) that does mean you may have to occasionally reposition the shaver to get the shaver charging.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a little long on my face the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Also, the razor is a bit big and bulky and a little bit much to conveniently hold and maneuver around your face while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the lubricants undo the harm my hard water does to the razor as long as I run it though a full rinse cycle every couple of weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> My neck is very sensitive has gotten irritated with other electric razors.</li>
            <li> This can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that the size of the shaving head is so large it&#x27;s not easy to shave your mustache area.  </li>
            <li> The only down side has been with the position of the cool bar on/off switch, I have pushed it by mistake a few times while shaving.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows in different directions and normally I would experience hair pulling with my other shaver, but not with CoolTec!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and even tried with less hair on my face a week later.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this razor to anybody who has had a previous model or is looking to upgrade or try out using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The attached trimmer tool was also not strong enough to make much of a</li>
            <li> have been using my normal multiple blade razor the beginning of my work week and hitting the electric razor half way</li>
            <li> someone who has been using a regular disposable razor to shave for a while, I can say that there was a less irritation than I normally feel using the CoolTec razor.</li>
            <li> I thought this was really cool and made things a lot less messy.</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t be switching over completely to electric shavers due to the length I tend to keep my facial hair, I will definitely break this out when I need to get close.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough or give a close enough shave or if my skin and hair is too soft for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit larger than my older Braun</li>
            <li> have tough facial hair and am accustomed to a clean, close shave with my manual razor.</li>
            <li> Typically with a new electric razor, it takes several weeks or months for my skin to not turn red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin definitely deeds something on it while shaving with any other method.</li>
            <li> The other thing that really surprised me was how quiet the thing is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read it, but after I used it once, I knew I would never again use any other kind of electric razor.</li>
            <li> Comparing this product to other electric razors that I have purchased in the past, this razor gives me the closest shave, and leaves my skin feeling cool.</li>
            <li> but for travelling and for a quick touch up the Braun CoolTec Shaver is miles ahead of other shavers if you can get over the price and have a little bit of storage under your sink!  </li>
            <li> With the easing cleaning station and proper lotions I had as little irritation as I have with a regular razor which I normally resort</li>
            <li> After trying out the new CoolTec shaver, I have to say that it didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it&#x27;s better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I feel like this might be a bit unnecessary since I am currently growing a beard and am using this razor to clean up the stubble onmy neck and checks.</li>
            <li> of the annoying things is the Clean light.</li>
            <li> It referenced parts that weren&#x27;t included in my particular model which made me initially think that there was something missing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using the razor for a few weeks now and, overall, I like it and will continue to use it as my main electric razor.</li>
            <li> My skin not only typically reacts to the use of additional products, but it is also very sensitive to the rub and warmth of the electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> those instances, when a normal shaver/razor would leave my skin in a ball of itchy mess</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the cooling action, the shave would not have been pleasurable due to the duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this about a month, but this thing feels sturdy enough to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It did take me a little longer to shave than normal, but the end result did not feel any different.</li>
            <li> I have very fast growing, thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little bit much, and maybe it will get less sensitive over time.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you are not super concerned about getting the closest shave, but have sensitive skin prone to irritation, the cooling sensation this provides makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve always been a cartridge razor user because I‚Äôve never had a clean shave using anything else due to thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> only other thing I could mention is that the plug the fits into the wall sticks straight out and doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the wall like other plugs might.  </li>
            <li> It seemed that the new aluminum cooling bar may be the answer to my previous problem.</li>
            <li> When I first received my Braun CoolTec shaving system through a program that Braun is running, I was a little pessimistic as to whether or not it would be any different than any other electric razor.</li>
            <li> Based on past experience with electric shavers I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the actual shave.  </li>
            <li> how long I allowed my facial hair to grow in order to properly test this razor.  </li>
            <li> how long I allowed my facial hair to grow in order to properly test this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt and say it isn&#x27;t designed for long hair only short lite stubble (like 1-3  days</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s one extra item to pack if you are traveling long enough to have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> My last braun shaver lasted about 6 years before I left it charging too long, and the battery got damaged.</li>
            <li> The first few times that I used the razor, it felt like the foil was wet, as if the cleaning solution hadn&#x27;t yet fully evaporated.  </li>
            <li> real magic, however, is when you put the shaver back in it&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> The ‚Äúcooling‚Äù bar is nice, and when you first turn it on and it starts to get frigid, it does make your face feel quite ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was in need of a new razor as my Panasonic&#x27;s display was a mess</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a soft \\&quot;beep\\&quot; sound that lets you know the razor is properly seated in the base.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a soft \\&quot;beep\\&quot; sound that lets you know the razor is properly seated in the base.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about shaving and your facial hair in general, I&#x27;d suggest a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Shaving every other day with only small amount of facial hair helps with the skin irritation; compared to the first experience where I had a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had an older model of the series 7-790 and it worked well but left my face feeling a bit raw.</li>
            <li> so it takes a very long time to trim coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;gap\\&quot; between the blades makes for wider shaver head and an odd sensation especially when shaving up near the ears or below the nose.  </li>
            <li> The base has a great liquid that when you recharge it self cleans the blades and dry&#x27;s them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though...I have very thick facial hair and have to shave every day and when it comes to time spent shaving I am looking for an electric shaver that not only produces a close shave but is quick and that I don&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times.</li>
            <li> The small side cutter worked very well though.</li>
            <li> like the cleaning system that comes with it, it makes it much easier than having to do everything by hand which I&#x27;ve seen some of my friends and relatives have had to do in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast so maybe i should have been shaving twice a day, but i thought that would be excessive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much closer the shave is compared to a non-cooling razor, but it feels nicer.</li>
            <li> At least I wasn&#x27;t until the first shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure that the cradle will be used much, just put the shaver in the charger/cleaner or the travel case and be done with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old shave took me on average about 10 minutes to shave, for</li>
            <li> I attend regular business meetings and some days are long, I can assure you I will be carrying the Braun CoolTec razor in it&#x27;s case (included with the kit) to work with me.</li>
            <li> I do have my doubts about how long the cleaning liquid will last, though.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long I try to go over the same area, it does not give me a close shave at all.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say they have definitely come a long way.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I did shave every day this would improve as my facial hair wouldn&#x27;t be as long.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time for me to shave all the hair which is the reason it only got the four stars</li>
            <li> Blades are suppose to last a long time (2 years I think?), 1 month in for me</li>
            <li> on to using the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually left for a long trip the day after I received it, so I have been using it from hotels on the road.</li>
            <li> I had been on a long hiatus from my last electric shaver for a handful of years and have been using a Gillette Fusion handle with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li> As long as I shave everyday, this razor seems to provide a pretty close shave in minimal time.  </li>
            <li> only thing I haven&#x27;t tried out is the long hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long been a daily disposable razor head guy -</li>
            <li> Furthermore, when I tried shaving on a some short stubble, there were minimal results because the hair was not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to negotiate the kind of shave</li>
            <li> I have a REALLY thick facial hair, so perhaps those without as genetically thick stubble, would find it better.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor I have found that cuts through a thick beard like I have.</li>
            <li> When I heard about then new cooling technology I was a little suspicious that it was \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; but decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately the little trimmer on the back of the razor worked to trim my beard down a little bit.</li>
            <li> I am happy enough with the overall experience that I cancelled my weekly delivery service for disposable razors, but if I had paid ~$200 for this system I would be a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first I was unsure if it had fully charged since it makes so much less noise than any electric shaver I have previously had.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec didn&#x27;t clog or bog down at all, and after the self cleaning cycle the blades were complete clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which even the most expensive new razors usual cause on my neck</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the size of the charging/cleaning station, which is too large for the counter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> it into the recharger station sometimes takes a little fiddling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a direct comparison to my current 7-series razor.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned it leaves the shave head with a subtle chemical smell, but it smells clean, so doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> is the coldness it gets down to a cool 44 degrees which prevented me from getting afterburn which I hate if I were to say anything bad its the fact that it really doesn&#x27;t work if your facial hair Is too long other than that its the best shave ive ever had</li>
            <li> While this is not a major problem, it has happened</li>
            <li> only gripe that I have, and this may be an issue with every other electric razor is that I have to go over the same spot multiple time because it does not cut every hair in one swipe.</li>
            <li> Difficult to describe, it really is different and better than any other shave you have given yourself.  </li>
            <li> The clean shave with the comfort cold strip makes this a no brainer if you are looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> The charge is very long - lasting.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a trimmer already (like I do), then the trimmer attachment is a VERY minor aspect of the overall razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> The pores would open up better with warmth instead of cold.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun CoolTec for about a week and a half so far</li>
            <li> My current razor is not and the razor does work well in the shower (although I prefer using the dry</li>
            <li> It takes several hours for the shaver to dry</li>
            <li> The shaver is dry by the next use.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to have to use any of the cream I&#x27;ve previously had to use for my overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not feel that the shaver itself pivoted very well, making it difficult to get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes around 15 to 30 seconds to get the cooling bar cold enough to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Weird buzzing sound when left docked&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and then just let it dry while it charges at the station until your next shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving dry and using Lectric Shave, and I still have the same problem.</li>
            <li> I figured that it would have been slightly colder than the shaver head, but WOW, it feels likeyou touched the inside of your freezer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it in a bathroom that is about 20 feet from my sleeping kids (5, 2 1/2 and less than a year old).  </li>
            <li> , I have another Braun shaver that is a few years old and they have come along way with aesthetic design, especially in the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using electric razors because they never cut my course beard hair close enough, so I spent a lot of time going back over areas that I had already shaved.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I found it on sale at a good price and bought it on impulse, fully expecting another gimmicky razor with a mediocre shave that would be returned shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li> I recommend if you want a shaver that you can use in a dry shave or wet scenario and take advantage of the cooltec that no other shaver has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cooling sensation is a neat feature, although its only on a limited surface area&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My experience with the Braun CoolTec shaver was both positive and negative.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have it getting hung up on anything or tugging on loose hairs, my only issue with the razor itself (and the reason I gave it four stars) was because it takes a while to get the longer hairs without using the long hair trimmer, and even the stubble may take two or three passes to completely get down.</li>
            <li> For the first few times I used it I could not get my entire neck done (a few wisps here and there)</li>
            <li> Also, the cleaning solution comes in a cartridge that is supposed to last quite a while - no more buying new cleaning solution every month</li>
            <li> only area for improvement is that it takes quite a long time for the cleaning solution to dry from the shaving head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how well the little cooling bar actively counteracts the burn.</li>
            <li> Now, admittedly I never really cleaned my previous electric shavers outside of holding it under some running water to clean out the hairs and have never really had a problem with that, so it seems the cleaning station was a bit excessive.</li>
            <li> it is still necessary to use the regular shaving cream and a sharp manual razor.</li>
            <li> and I just have to say that it is definitely way different than other electric shaver i have tried.....</li>
            <li> The only other problem with this razor is the plug on the back of the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> The base and the cleaning station make it slightly more useful but just slightly.</li>
            <li> Only drawback was the trimmer is a little harder to use than other models (doesn&#x27;t stick out as much).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, if you have anything more than a two-day old beard, this thing in general is going to be miserable unless you trim down your stubble first.</li>
            <li> far as looks, it is a little bulky</li>
            <li> one time when it felt a little sensitive, I stopped, took off the cartridge and just ran the cooling bar over my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive, and when they promoted their CoolTec system, i figured I would try it out.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m glad I got it for free, because if I would have spent my hard-earned cash on it I&#x27;d be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> By chance one day I came across the Braun CoolTec shaver in a local big-box store and was instantly intrigued by the active cooling technology.</li>
            <li> No more high priced razor blades.</li>
            <li> I also really like the hard shell carry case that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of shaves were a little irritating, but I find this to be the same with all electric shavers for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about razors is never the heat of the razor, its that i don&#x27;t really save any time or get any closer than a manual razor and shaving cream can offer.</li>
            <li> and the Cooltec provided a cold, refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> but I had been getting frustrated with the width of the blade but still liked the shave.</li>
            <li> The most important features to me were the cutting blades (shaver, trimmer), and unfortunately these was also the most disappointing features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> And I must say this was the most disappointing thing about this razor.  </li>
            <li> While this works great on my scalp, it is awful on my actual facial hair.</li>
            <li> Without fail, the light indicating it needs to be cleaned comes on midway through my shave.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical when Braun offered me the chance to review the CoolTec Men&#x27;s shaver for free, but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when i first tried the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The first time I had not-so-short facial hair, and it was not fun (to say the least).</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t much irritation, but it still left me feeling a tiny uncomfortable, only for a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning station works very well, it only leaves a tiny bit of hair behind.</li>
            <li> Also seemed to take a long time to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of the electric shaver because it has always irritated my skin and always took so long to get used to.</li>
            <li> inside the box was everything i expected such as the razor and the charging/automatic cleaning station..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time</li>
            <li> Even after 20 minutes of shaving I still had some long hairs that just didn&#x27;t want to be clipped no matter</li>
            <li> I thought this shaver might be just gimmicky, but, was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I removed the shaver for a sec then put it back on my face expecting the feeling this time and</li>
            <li> look forward to using this shaver for a long time and might purchase one for my brother at Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of the Braun shaving systems.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, and not cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> &gt; - Long battery life</li>
            <li> I wish it had a charged % indicator so that I knew how long I would have before I need to charge it.</li>
            <li> It is just a minor complication, and will not keep me from giving this razor a 5 out of 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> and I seem to always have to go over the same area several times to get those last few stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> The heads of the traditional Braun shavers have always been wide but narrower</li>
            <li> I just like the closeness of a razor, but going every 2-3 days the hair is too long to go at it with the Gillette first.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take longer than I expected to fully shave everything, sometimes requiring 4 or 5 passes where a razor would only take one or two.</li>
            <li> However, there was absolutely no burn whatsoever, and obviously not risk of getting cut.</li>
            <li> and I still have a long way to go</li>
            <li> Once all set-up, the razor did not take long to charge.</li>
            <li> I do like how I will save money in the long run from having to buy shaving cream and razors.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec System through a campaign run by Braun, so while price was not a consideration in the long run it will still be cheaper than continuing to use blade</li>
            <li> after a couple days, no stray long hairs.</li>
            <li> It does well with both, but too long</li>
            <li> I plan on using this for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> me 3x as long to achieve an inferior shave over the Norelco&lt;br</li>
            <li> After setting everything up it didn&#x27;t take long for it to charge at all.</li>
            <li> Of course this shaver has a the long hair trimmer you would expect as well as a travel case and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> and literally it took twice as long to shave my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the Braun CoolTec System is definitely Cooler than expected</li>
            <li> (we‚Äôll see how long the ‚Äúcooling‚Äù bar lasts).  </li>
            <li> I‚Äôve returned to my Panasonic LA93 as its much smoother and is a wet shaver for those long mornings when I am too lazy or just want to multitask in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But after that initial waiting period, the razor performed how I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> But overall the product worked the way I expected it to and</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get my hair to catch in the foil.</li>
            <li> I don‚Äôt know how long the charge itself lasts, but I‚Äôm set either way.  </li>
            <li> The cooling action was something that took a few minutes to get used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver in addition to razors for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and make it necessary to go over the same spots multiple times because it has trouble trimming all the hair.</li>
            <li> this Cool technology has got me sold, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck springing for those expensive blue cartridges again.</li>
            <li> I actually found it to be rather irritating at first as it almost felt like a stinging feeling.</li>
            <li> and I end up going back upstairs to hit a couple of trouble spots that apparently I missed.  </li>
            <li> I initially was very skeptical of a shaver that cools the skin, because my thinking was that heat would works better.</li>
            <li> One thing that might be good to know is that the cleaning and charging base takes up some counter</li>
            <li> I had grown a short beard as part of &amp;#34;No Shave November&amp;#34;, and the trimmer on the shaver had no problem shortening it before I used the regular shaver and its cooling sensation to take it down the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> yes, but the metal teeth that cut are not lined up close enough to together to get the all the way down... to be specific.</li>
            <li> The only down side compared to a traditional razor is that it must be trimmed hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the past year I have been dry shaving with the highly rated top-of-the line Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1080x</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired a few different brands in the past(Norelco I believe) but haven&#x27;t found any that work for me and had more or less sworn off ever using electric shavers again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired a few different brands in the past(Norelco I believe) but haven&#x27;t found any that work for me and had more or less sworn off ever using electric shavers again.  </li>
            <li> only real complaint, and it might just be because of my hair type, is that it takes longer to shave with the new CoolTec shaver than it did with my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a second try with much less facial hair.  </li>
            <li> and I found myself considering whether I should just use my previous shaver which got the hairs without going over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually after shaving with an electric my face is red and slightly irritated for a short time but with the CoolTec</li>
            <li> The Cool-Tec, is a larger shaver and comes with the cleaning system from Braun, which I am less a fan of after using  the Panasonic which I simply wash out under the sink.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with this system actually trimming all of my facial hair which is typically just stubble</li>
            <li> Quite possibly it was due to the fact that I have thick grained hair follicles though as I have not had much luck with foil shavers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System through a program run by Braun, however I have been using Braun products for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to buy new ones and waste what I had!</li>
            <li> I was stuck with safety razors, but the electric razor dream never died, it would reemerge every couple years as a slick new razor ad struck my fancy.</li>
            <li> I also found like a half inch whisker on my neck that I had apparently missed.  </li>
            <li> To test it further I waited to shave a couple days to see how it would handle my facial hair once it got a little long.  </li>
            <li> I tried different angles, I tried pulling my skin tight, I tried going opposite the grain.</li>
            <li> My other issue is I could never get the hairs from my upper lip shaved, so I would end up having to use a bladed razor to shave there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shaving, I felt like I was shaving for an extra 5-7 minutes over my other electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, I admittedly have a very small countertop, and if space weren&#x27;t an issue, I think that the self-cleaning nature of the system would be very convenient.</li>
            <li> The only other thing i don&#x27;t like is that when traveling you must bring a travel cradle to charge the shaver because the shaver doesn&#x27;t have a charging port to plug the wall outlet into.</li>
            <li> CoolTec, works a bit differently, just like other electric shavers</li>
            <li> I had to shave the area immediately under my jaw only twice as compared to a dozen times with my other shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a goatee and this razor makes it a little more difficult to get close to the goatee.</li>
            <li> Since there is little irritation, it&#x27;s often not a problem running over the same spot multiple times, but I eventually feel like I just have to give up and move on with my day.  </li>
            <li> (other electric razors make you do it); doesn&#x27;t keep you from switching back-and-forth between traditional blade shaving</li>
            <li> The information said that it helps with irritation; every electric razor I have used tends to irritate my face due to my beard hair going in different directions.</li>
            <li> a problem I&#x27;ve occasionally had with my other electric shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as other electric razors, but I still prefer my regular razor for closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other button is the power button, which also glows to indicate the battery level.</li>
            <li> I was caught off guard with how much little bits of facial hair is left behindin the hub and all I had to do was press a button.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s due to the hairs growing in different directions.</li>
            <li> we a little more difficult going.</li>
            <li> It actually works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> have very thick, fast growing facial hair that extends to my neck.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this razor gave me a close shave with much less irritation than my other electric razor or a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> My other razor was dry only.</li>
            <li> That being said I still think using a quality manual razor is faster and gives a slightly cleaner shave, although thecost of replacements can be steep and will eventually exceed the cost of this system if you require frequent shaving for your job or other reason.  </li>
            <li> only complaint with this shaver is that like other Braun shavers I have owned, this product does not give you nearly as close a shave as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> and I hope to use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of leaving my mouth open while shaving part of my face and got a very bitter taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Hot face + hot shaver &#x3D; bad shave and irritated</li>
            <li> I have still been unable to properly clean the razor like it&#x27;s supposed to work.</li>
            <li> There are few times when it fails to shave a hair or two on my neck no matter how many times I go over it from every direction.</li>
            <li> I was always wary of electric shavers being prickly and not providing that clean shave</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that I actually dry shaved</li>
            <li> I prefer to shave dry before showering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to shave dry before showering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe makes a difference if you dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was even smoother in the shower with a damp face than it was dry.</li>
            <li> If you do a dry shave, this should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> If you are doing some heavy \\&quot;hedging\\&quot; of facial hairs I would recommend taking a different product and then using this one.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on back to back days and also with a few days in between</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by the active cooling feature as my thick beard always requires 3-5 passes in different directions to get a close shave, which always results in a bit of razor burn, even when I use a pre-shave wet or dry lubricant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably switch back to regular razor in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The small brush is useful to get the small bits of hair out of the shaver mechanism.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I have thick facial hair, and it cut some, but nowhere near the close shave that I was hoping</li>
            <li> Flexible head and smaller base would be nice.</li>
            <li> One complaint, I keep accidentally turning it off because that button is right below the thumb rest when I&#x27;m shaving, and I must be used to holding the Norelco a little lower, so I keep turning it off.</li>
            <li> I think the Braun team should drill down and share the science behind the cool...</li>
            <li> It will wash, sterilize and dry it all in a single button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have not found a single electric razor that does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I doubt I&#x27;ll keep it on the limited counter space I have</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to conventional  shaving.</li>
            <li> If you have a limited section of your bathroom, you might want to store in another</li>
            <li> It seems to go on forever on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who typically doesn&#x27;t use an electric shaver as past experiences have caused me to cover what the razor missed with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> It is durable enough to trim tough hairs, but also sensitive enough to trim nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> CoolTec part of it was odd the first time to say the least.</li>
            <li> These razors have worked for me well over the last few years, but the costs of the blades has continued to go up along with shaving cream, they continually clog, and get dull to fast.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am new to electric shavers, but this thing seemed to have trouble knocking down my stubble.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this razor is the actual shave, it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as the previous model I&#x27;ve tried, the 7 series.</li>
            <li> If you have big hands, it is hard to hold such a tiny cleaning brush in your hands to scrape out the loose hairs.</li>
            <li> i have been weary to use electrical razors in the past since my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with electric shavers in the past since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It took me a bit longer to get a complete shave than usual.</li>
            <li> I shave on average about once a week, apparently my facial hair doesn&#x27;t want to keep up with the once a week haircuts that I need.</li>
            <li> If your facial hair is longer than the average five o&#x27;clock shadow, the razor pulls the hair quite a bit for a less-than-comfortable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> it appears like the long hair trimming head in the center has been minimized to make room for the cooling head.  </li>
            <li> It definitely was a good feeling and laid to rest the doubt I had about the electric razor actually cutting without irritating.</li>
            <li> The last thing you want is a wet shaver that might cause a short when you try to charge it before the charging part fully dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how long the cleaning solution lasts before I need to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I felt like this razor moves over my thick stubble around my chin much easier than other</li>
            <li> It seems that there is always a new marketing &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; when it comes to razors and I so was skeptical about Braun&#x27;s new CoolTec technology.  </li>
            <li> I just bought myself a new norelco a few months ago because I thought I broke my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving the shaving system I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect, and I was rather reluctant to try the cooling bar because I live in a cold climate where the last thing I want to do in the morning is get hit with the cold, but I have to say it definitely surprised me.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec system literally cools down your face by having a chilled bar in the middle of the shaving service.</li>
            <li> I must say once I got the routine down and added in the cooling bar effect, it was a solid shave.</li>
            <li> I did always get irritated on my face and especially neck, and this seems to cut down on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all that said, when it came down to the actual shaving, it just didn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> If someone could make a detail trimmer actually TRIM down to the skin</li>
            <li> You just press a button and the bottom part extends down for you to slide in the cleaning fluid container</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to someone else looking for a way to cut down on skin irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> This has limited my irritation, but does get expensive and also is time consuming - also add in the fact that my facial hair grows very fast and if I miss the barber  in a given week I look like a Yeti.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the holes in the foil of the CoolTec shaver seem to be a little smaller and arranged differently than my other shaver.</li>
            <li> but it typically took too long for it to activate and get cold before I was most of the way into my shave.  </li>
            <li> I think that the major negative is the total price.</li>
            <li> but this left me with little to no discomfort, the problem was how long it took me to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different ones in the past, but shaving without cream was causing a lot of dry irritation to my face.  </li>
            <li> This iteration is very similar to Norelco&#x27;s -- sleek, black with a single button.  </li>
            <li> Even against the grain, the shave was very uneven and patchy, to the point where I had to shave with my old razor when finished to even things out.</li>
            <li> I spent a VERY long time, once again trying shaving</li>
            <li> It can be used both dry and wet</li>
            <li> no matter what way I try to shave with, and always requires numerous passes which typically irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> every which way I could think of (within reason), including dry (recommended in the manual), wet, up-strokes, down-strokes, sideways-strokes, etc.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple Braun&#x27;s in the past, and the cleaning bases usually were the first thing to croak.</li>
            <li> I have used several different shaving systems in the past, and none have worked as well as the Cooltec.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to shave with a throwaway razor again then go back to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Previous razors that I had used always left splotches, redness and a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> That is another feature this shaver has, you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> tried it dry, wet, with electric shave (you&#x27;re not supposed to use any additional products with it</li>
            <li> I have MUCH less skin irritation, especially on my neck and</li>
            <li> The only think I would change would be to make the cleaning device slightly slimmer, and not so bulky so it can be easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying that I am, as of the past few years, a fan of the braun shaving systems as a whole.</li>
            <li> I like the versatility, the travel component/charger setup, and the fact that you can use it for a dry shave or a wet shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use the cleaning daily, as they are pretty expensive to change out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if this is necessary unless you are sharing the blade and want to know if it has been cleaned and sterilized since the last person has used it.  </li>
            <li> My first time shaving, the cold touch of the CoolTec metal cooling bar on my face really surprised me.</li>
            <li> The typical logic is a warm/hot surface as it helps loosen things up for the shave, so wouldn&#x27;t the cooling have the opposite effect?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll only typically shave when it&#x27;s a semi-special occasion.  </li>
            <li> It was a big improvement from my previous model.  </li>
            <li> I used the shaver for about a month and a half prior to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because my previous razor would give me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> One that is a lighter weight for half the price does the job just the same.</li>
            <li> Also in the past electric razors always left me with red bumps on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried both wet and dry shaving</li>
            <li> But this is actually just the same if not more time consuming since the shave is not close.</li>
            <li> It only took about 5 minutes, maybe less.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet, as I am paranoid of dropping it in the shower, however, this is a wet or dry</li>
            <li> a black male</li>
            <li> Manual vs Electric, Wet vs Dry, etc.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised as to</li>
            <li> I found I left less of a mess when using this then a traditional cartridge</li>
            <li> I do have one complaint for Braun, and that is to get the long hair trimmers on the side of the shavers of the future to actually cut all the hair they touch.  </li>
            <li> The cooling bar provides that relief DURING the shave with no extra mess, time, or effort.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints and would definitely recommend this one to at least try, if one is interested.t least try, if one is interested.</li>
            <li> nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is quite narrow but very efficient in trimming those long thick whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I was confused as to what it was at first, but realized that it was probably residualcleaning solution that had dried on the blades, only to be re-wet and shaken off when used with water.</li>
            <li> The only bad part was it not being easy to shave around my chin as I was use too.</li>
            <li> They were typical old-school folded paper instructions with multiple languages and minimal graphics.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to conventional razors or shaver again!</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t enough room to take advantage of the cooling bar in tight places.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I didn&#x27;t think I suffered from razor burn, but after using this shaver, I noticed that my skin is not as red as it is when using other shavers and it is noticeably less dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even bought a new head right away thinking maybe the head that came with it was just bad.</li>
            <li> this has left little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> The instructions for the razor took a little while to understand, but after figuring out each individual piece maneuvering the system is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is very solid and dependable but I do wish that it came with a way to hold the travel charger, it is a little hassle keeping them together while traveling.</li>
            <li> I have little or no irritation after shaving and you can actually feel it cooling your face as you shave.  </li>
            <li> The only downsides are it&#x27;s a little bulky in terms of the amount of space it takes up on your sink.</li>
            <li> I do wish the razor was a little smaller and that my finger did not rest on the CoolTec button.</li>
            <li> The directions left a little the be desired.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little assembly required and the fear of starting a fire loomed</li>
            <li> It comes with a carrying case and travel charger but, for me, it&#x27;s a little too big to travel with.</li>
            <li> My last shaver could handle hair a little longer, it had three rotating blades and the Braun has a foil.</li>
            <li> I usually put it off for a few days and have a decent amount of stubble.  </li>
            <li> I had low expectations of this as I expected it to be just a hook that delivered little bang.  </li>
            <li> I thought the CoolTec idea seemed a little gimmicky at first and having used electric razors in the past with no luck</li>
            <li> I typically have to shave every other day and currently use a Gillete Pro-Fusion razor while taking a shower</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, I typically shave every other day, but with this razor I noticed that I was needing to shave every day -</li>
            <li> I tried changing directions and moving it around, but overall it just seemed very average to subpar.</li>
            <li> With any electric razor, getting a straight razor close shave will always be impossible, however in comparison to other shavers in its price range, the shave doesn&#x27;t really match up.  </li>
            <li> would say if you want a reliable shaver, it isn&#x27;s bad, but for the money, t could be better.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get one of these bad boys from a promotion Braun was running.</li>
            <li> why I think I&#x27;m more frustrated with myself</li>
            <li> I like the LED battery indicating light and how it tells you when is dirty.</li>
            <li> A complaint I had about the old version is that the cleaning station leaked when moved around a lot.</li>
            <li> At first, I used it after not having shaved for a week, and found it difficult and long to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> If I let my beard grow for more than a few days the shaver pulls and irritates my skin no matter how cold the guard gets.</li>
            <li> You pretty much know you are done when you hear no more cutting.</li>
            <li> My shaving ritual usually includes a trim of facial hair before using a foil shaver because if the hair remains long, it yanks at my skin which hurts.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if the foil will last as long as it otherwise would.  </li>
            <li> It also has trouble getting getting more awkward areas and angles like your chin giving you a spotty shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning system as I am lazy and usually in a hurry</li>
            <li> I feel the cleaning station is a gimmick and not really needed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks to review this shaver to give it a chance but even so, I still often find places that were missed even after several passes.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later the CoolTec razor is cleaned from the inside out.</li>
            <li> Electric razors have always made the problem worse, so I have stuck to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as cooling as i expected</li>
            <li> but the difference is minimal, and for day to day shaves, the reduced irritation is preferred over the closeness difference.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different electric razors but would always get razor burn.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar separates the two screens, making the shaver unusually wide, and no as flexible when contouring to your face.  </li>
            <li> I never really asked myself why that was my go to option</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> I am not used to from wet shaving, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Although this razor averages between 120 to 150 from what I have seen it would be money well spent.</li>
            <li> a few times.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a cleaning station that left my CoolTec razor looking and smelling</li>
            <li> but it did go through without any further trouble.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a multi-blade razor with shaving cream, but faster and close enough for me to use it as my everyday razor from now on.</li>
            <li> I have not tried using it wet yet; I&#x27;ll have to test that and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Even though your face isn&#x27;t wet</li>
            <li> Can get it wet</li>
            <li> have used a few Philips brand electric shavers with the same style foil.  </li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system and was curious to see how it worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /Charging:&lt;br /&gt;Because the shaver can be used as a wet shaver (in the shower)</li>
            <li> wet shave.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to just be a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few seconds for me to realize this shaver lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I recieved a similar shaver a few years ago for Christmas</li>
            <li> For most of my adult life I have used an expensive 5 blade razor for the mere fact that I could shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> However, the Braun CoolTec is a solid choice for an everyday, no hassle electric razor.</li>
            <li> The Clean&amp;Charge station also did its job as expected; I haven&#x27;t been dissatisfied with it not cleaning well</li>
            <li> Even then, the closeness of the shave was not what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> Had I spent a $100</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been convinced of electric razors either.  </li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work as well or get as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s not a close enough shave or just being too harsh on the skin, there is almost always some part of the shave that comes up sub-par.</li>
            <li> After a few wks the cooling part of the razor was not working properly.  </li>
            <li> I felt it within 5 sec.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and feels like it&#x27;s going to last for years.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want a wet shave, I would go with a Series 7 well before buying the Cool-Tec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The irritation is minimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I would like to say that everything went as expected without a hitch</li>
            <li> but when I do this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> I never really got that tugging/</li>
            <li> I personally never really got razor burn with an electric shaver, so this was kinda....pointless for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it finally fell apart (after dropping it a few times over the seven years I had it).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried stretching my skin, pressing harder, made infinite passes, but it just couldn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> The shave has never been very close, and I found the rotary heads somewhat irritating.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this shaver to the everyday man who needs that wake up call in the morning.</li>
            <li> The cradle that is needed for the recharge when you are travelling is not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> have to start the cooling liquid application to the razor before I get in the shower as it takes a few minutes and it runs multiple cycles  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec is different in a few ways.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely did not know what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> Not something I would have spent money on.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning dock does the work that I often times found messy to do myself and ensures that I&#x27;m getting the closest shave possible with a</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec does not do well with facial hair that is longer than a few days of growth.  </li>
            <li> One this to be careful about if you do shave in the shower - the cleaning solution in the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station is comprised of alcohol and perfume.</li>
            <li> Since I have fairly sensitive skin, even though each razor performed well, all left varying degrees of skin irritation behind.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my skin is probably a big part of why this shaver works so terribly.  </li>
            <li> Again, nice idea, but I believe a bit unnecessary and over-the-top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s an extra item that I have to pack and keep track of while</li>
            <li> The base does do a nice job of cleaning though.</li>
            <li> The base does do a nice job of cleaning though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closeness of Shave:&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I normally do not use electric razors is because they rawly get a close enough shave for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed to see the newer one did not cut as close, fixed my old one and used the new one as back-up.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the shaver features 2 independently moving cutting elements that help reach every facial contour ‚Äì in other words, you&#x27;ll have a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> The other fault I would have to say is the cleaning/charging station there is no drying feature other than the shaver running to dry when it finishes its cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the precision trimmer on the back of the shaver several times now, and still consider it a failure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have thick or coarse facial hair, then you may want to research some other electric shavers as this one didn&#x27;t do well on my face.</li>
            <li> Low charge time or being stuck to the wall thanks to a 2.5 foot power cord, followed by serious irritation from a poorly engineered head have made me stick with disposable razors for the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It took a few times, due to my beard progress through No Shave November (I chose to keep the mustache only!!).  </li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed when I received my package was the bulkiness of the cleaning station (my bathroom is currently very small and I share it with my wife, enough said).  </li>
            <li> The razor actually gets pretty cold after only a few seconds of running it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I actually thought that perhaps I was giving a broken one with a dull blade or something at first as thats how spotty my shave was.</li>
            <li> The cooling element is (as you might expect) sandwiched directly in between the main cutting elements.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned previously, it is a pleasure to travel with, especially in comparison to razors I previously used.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is pretty large and take up a lot of counter/sink space.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s too far outside the norm of electric shavers, it&#x27;s not, but it does seem slightly worse than average on that front.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is by no means a tough shave for my old shaver that I got for less than $40</li>
            <li> I had been trying to use the last dull blade as long as I could</li>
            <li> My old shaver didn&#x27;t require me to push down hard while shaving, and doing so would result in my skin getting chafed.  </li>
            <li> Upon inspection of the cutting head, it is as clean as before i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over a month now, and I can tell you that I have had none of the dry skin razor burns that I used to get with my previous electric razors.  </li>
            <li> If you have more than a few days growth or longer hairs, it is very difficult to shave with the CoolTec.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I shave my face every single day.  </li>
            <li> While those Braun shavers worked well, they had weak points that kept failing ‚Äì the cleaning system broke several times, the foils would tear easily (I have thick beard hair), and then the plastic would deteriorate around the head of the shaver, eventually causing the entire shaver to fail.  </li>
            <li> The other issue was the price of the replacement blade.  </li>
            <li> I get when I&#x27;ve used other shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newer to electronic shavers as I usually use clippers to maintain my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The cooling feature is extremely &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the shave is extremely close.  </li>
            <li> I get an extremely close shave without the redness.  </li>
            <li> I felt that other electric razors get closer to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but when compared with other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past, I don&#x27;t feel that it shaved close enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Complete disappointed and will never purchase Braun any more.</li>
            <li> I have not been a big fan of electric shavers in the past, but I was given the opportunity to try the CoolTec as part of a program run by Braun</li>
            <li> I would shave every other day with a blade with out looking too scruffy.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to get quite as close as my other rotary shaver</li>
            <li> Extremely well made piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was skeptical at first that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use any gel or shaving cream with this razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheaper electric razor for the past year that requires a lot of lotion or aftershave after use and leaves me with red marks on my face and a lot of burning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue usually is for me that the shaver just leaves a lot of short stubble</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it actually does anything other than provide a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> It also does not perform as well as other brands in terms of a close shave.</li>
            <li> I Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is, but this razor reduced the number of ingrown hairs and irritation that I had following a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if this is necessary.</li>
            <li> I have used other shavers at the end</li>
            <li> The only issues I encountered were small 1 inch patches at the corner of my jaw that the shaver just couldn&#x27;t&#x27; pick up</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try the Braun CoolTec system, especially the cooling technology.  </li>
            <li> This could also have been due to</li>
            <li> This could also have been due to</li>
            <li> other thing about the CoolTec technology.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise there are a couple other improvements I would make.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical if the CoolTec feature is a gimic or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort for the CoolTec is paramount primarily due to the CoolTec sensation that is provided while shaving.</li>
            <li> but if you suffer with skin irritation like I do then you don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles like some of the other comparable electric razors on the market.</li>
            <li> If you share your bathroom with other family members and you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;his and hers&amp;#34; type sink, you will find yourself moving it again and again.  </li>
            <li> The cool-tec made a big difference, I usually used a multi-blade razor, this is faster and nicer.</li>
            <li> something I was not used to with my other razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort for the CoolTec is paramount primarily due to the CoolTec sensation that is provided while shaving.</li>
            <li> With the Series 7, there is harshness to your skin which creates bumps or bleeding, I would assume due to both the speed of the shaver and heat level of the skin.</li>
            <li> This removes an maintenance you may need to do (other than the 18 month blade change) because the shaver is cleaned and lubricated after each shave.</li>
            <li> Other than that it did not create any irritation or redness whatsoever</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and do not tug.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerless.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave with a regular razor and shaving cream</li>
            <li> an extremely close shave</li>
            <li> I have used and other electric razors but none even compare the results and features.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still look at one of Braun&#x27;s other shavers to avoid the blocky head of the CoolTec.</li>
            <li> an added bonus this razor is very, very quiet in comparison to the others I have used by Braun in the past.  </li>
            <li> One is the big cradle that houses the cleaning system and the other is small an sleek</li>
            <li> In other systems that I&#x27;ve used, there would always be hair still in the device</li>
            <li> I currently was using a small Gillette razor</li>
            <li> : It still pulls my hair sometimes like other electronic shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of cuts, I do have a couple of cuts, but that is just due to my negligence at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do not shave everyday, it takes quite a long time to get a close shave</li>
            <li> I recently received this shaver through a program run by Braun, and before even using the shaver, just from the quality feel of the product I knew that this wasn&#x27;t like the models I&#x27;ve purchased from other companies in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried using electric razors several times in the past and every time, I used it once or twice and then returned or re-gifted it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the Braun CoolTec shaver a 4-star rating because it&#x27;s yet another Braun shaver system to consider favorably against other options.</li>
            <li> You can only charge with the station or a small cradle thing that the charging cable plugs into.</li>
            <li> like I have with any other shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my other electric shaver to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric razors in the past and have had mixed results.</li>
            <li> I have used this electric shaver daily for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Fusion Razor for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> Other people here might need it, if so, it is cool (literally, cold).  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but I can assure that it does work well.  </li>
            <li> I close the bathroom door lest I wake up other people in the house in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer</li>
            <li> I consistently accidentally hit the button while shaving, turning it on needlessly.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is touchy, and the razor does not secure or snap in place, so any minor bump will knock it out of &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; mode.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since I have always had problems with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> It also keep the blade sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The CoolTec has a strait cut feature and not a circular rotation shave like my other shaver</li>
            <li> The cleaning station keeps the blade cleaner than other cleaning products that I‚Äôve used with other razors.  </li>
            <li> There are several things I like about the shaver and the items it is packaged with: holder/charger/cleaner unit, small brush, cleaning solution, cradle, travel</li>
            <li> When I shave with an electric, there are always spots of small stubble left.  </li>
            <li> The cooling sensation this gives you is soothing compared other shavers I have used and returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past, and haven&#x27;t been a big fan of them -</li>
            <li> and I always seemed to turn red with irritation in the past.</li>
            <li> shave on the other hand</li>
            <li> No more opening the suitcase only to find out the razor switched on accidentally ‚Äì</li>
            <li> But unfortunately I found in practice its pretty lack luster.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer feature is not as well designed as on some other electric razors.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer feature is not as well designed as on some other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> If you avoid other electric razors because they irritate your skin, then consider getting your hands on the Braun CoolTec.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this Braun is not like any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> When I used other razors they would make my neck brake out .</li>
            <li> At all other times, I&#x27;ll be using a blade.</li>
            <li> a few long hairs on my face, but not many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is for cleaning and the other is for portability.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other electrics and had all but given up on them because my face would break out from irritation.</li>
            <li> They usually fall short somewhere.</li>
            <li> Almost all razors I used in the past left me with some irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> The razors also gave a extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> The blades seem sharp and I haven&#x27;t experience any pulling or pinching</li>
            <li> I cannot get a smoother results by any other method.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that using the CoolTec feature does cut down on battery life, but if you recharge after frequently it&#x27;s really not an issue.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the razor was a bit rough, as I cut my face a little, which really never happens to me while shaving, regardless of whether I use an electric razor or a manual razor.</li>
            <li> The new cooling sensation leaves my skin without the irritation that other razors leave behind.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that was tough was getting the shave close in areas of your face where the hair grows in several directions.</li>
            <li> have a very, very, very rough beard</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair, and need to shave daily for work.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and very thick stubble.</li>
            <li> I could use the Norelco with little to no pulling but the Braun hurt like heck to shave with; it hurt so bad that I stopped using it, switched to the Norelco to get the hair short, then continued using the Braun to get a clean shave that the Norelco can&#x27;t give me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying a new shaver, you could do way worse than this one.</li>
            <li> The metal bar in the middle of the blades is very cold and makes your skin feel cool and not so rough and worn out.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li> I love this razor because after using the razor you just empty the stubbles from the cartridge and plug it into the base,  The razor is then cleaned and lubricated.</li>
            <li> Its harder to get all the hair compared to my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> The active cooling technology cooling bar on the shaver seems to do the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> The shaver seemed to adapt to my face contour really well, cutting thru different hair sizes well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of electric shavers as I unfortunately have sensitive skin that reacts adversely to them.  </li>
            <li> The CoolTec razor lags behind the Series 7 in this key area, as it takes a number of passes from different angles to get a close shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the shaver is located awkwardly on the back of the shaver and doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Although the chilling effect was \\&quot;cool\\&quot; the razor constantly misses hairs on my face making me have to follow my electric shave with a blade shave (completely defeating the purpose of me having an electric shaver).</li>
            <li> only thing I think is not perfect about this is I would have wished that the cooling strip was a slight bit wider, but overall still well above expectations</li>
            <li> The cleaning process itself took around 3 minutes, but it was suggested to let it dry for a few hours before using the shaver.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of electric shavers as I unfortunately have sensitive skin that reacts adversely to them.  </li>
            <li> When I took it on a trip with me, I had to take the travel base along with the charging cord and the charger where I have had many in the past that just requires a simple cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with my experience with the series 5 shaver, the CoolTec is on par with the 5 but prefer it over the 5 due to my sensitive skin and tough hair.</li>
            <li> I did not have any red razor burns on my face which is common with all other electric razors I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it did not trim my sideburns down at all (to keep them neat), and I had to go back to my old razor to finish them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trimming down my beard, I tried using the head of the razor again to trim my face.</li>
            <li> has a large shaving head and is difficult to use to maintain a well edged beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This make it a little harder to maneuver around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plug for the base charger for the razor does not actually firmly fit, it is extremely loose and falls out upon touching the cord or base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; definitely helps cut down on the irritation and definitely make shaving a less irritating experience.</li>
            <li> The cooltec comes with a clean and charge base and a smaller charging stand.</li>
            <li> I hated trying to clean the old electric razor.  </li>
            <li> And you can charge and clean it at the same time in the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> Since I only shave once every few weeks, razor burn and irritation are fairly common but with this razor the irritation is minimal compared to other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> Since I only shave once every few weeks, razor burn and irritation are fairly common but with this razor the irritation is minimal compared to other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> noticed this shaver missed some of the hairs that my other shaver would typically get.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, since there&#x27;s no way to plug a cable into the shaver, there&#x27;s less chance of any electrical accidents because you can use this shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> And the hard to reach spots traditionally like the neck and jawline?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about it at first, but it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to set up and only took an hour to charge.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to justify buying this personally.</li>
            <li> A little annoying, but worth the cooling action in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and I have to shave everyday and that can get a little rough on the skin and does cause it to get irritated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really my only complaint with</li>
            <li> have tried electric razors in the past, they all seemed heavy and irritated my skin, so this was a different experience to feel 1 that was lighter.</li>
            <li> the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with a lot of neat features, but unfortuently, the shave it produces is just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only problem or negative part of the shaver for my use was i didnt feel as if it shaved as close on my neck as my face.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers have now come a long way from what they were in the past.</li>
            <li> When you have the cooling bar turned on, the charge on the unit only lasts 15 minutes or so and after that you can&#x27;t use the cooling feature again until you charge it (but at least it charges quickly)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This did save some of the mess of time of other electric razors that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I already used the CoolTec and don&#x27;t really want bourbon with shavings.  </li>
            <li> I go a few days between shaves, this thing is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is persistant and gets shaved at least 3-4 times a week depending on my scheduled meetings.</li>
            <li> only thing I was not completely satisfied with was that I had trouble with stray hairs and patches.</li>
            <li> downside of the Braun shaver is that you are unable to plug the shaver straight to the charger/power cable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with time I&#x27;ll get a closer shave on just one pass, but the cooling feature makes this shaver worth a try for anyone that suffers from skin irritation after using electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have now tried it at the sink wet with shaving cream, in the shower with shaving cream, and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry was definitely not a good shave for me, and it left my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Final negative is that my razor&#x27;s cleaning indicator comes on after every use.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about the Braun CoolTec is with the integrated trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble using electric razors in the past, and the only electric razor that has worked for me is the Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the razor that it is attached to did not cut very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor is not nearly as powerful as my 8000 series razor.  </li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been a devout user of a manual razor ever since I started shaving in my late teenage years.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with the battery life however, and I like the cleaning base that it comes with as well.  </li>
            <li> You have a travel case to keep your razor safe, a charger base, and a charge/cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I think I have a really thick beard and the hair tends to grow in different directions.</li>
            <li> More specifically the power cord for that base.</li>
            <li> The shaver is on the heavy side which makes it rough on the wrists while holding it (assuming from the cooling mechanism).</li>
            <li> Navigating a Philips/Norelco or this CoolTec over my face is annoying and takes more effort to ensure that every part has been shaven</li>
            <li> I have never had one that actually cuts the thick hairs on my body.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how the coollness button worked, but once I did it was quite the revelation.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is fairly thick and I almost always get razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Again, not as good as a razor, but awfully convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous Braun it felt a little wider, and felt like I was pressing harder to make up for it.</li>
            <li> You can charge without the cleaning station, but you have to lay the shaver down on a charging base and it still takes more room than it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and too weak to compete against dedicated trimmers and does not complement the main shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aluminum cooling bar helps keep the irritation down and allows me to run over the hard to reach areas several times without the burning sensation that typically follows.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say that for the money it would cost to buy, I think you could purchase a better razor for less money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally the sideburn/beard trimmer is much narrower than previous models and I find it borderline useless for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It have recessed trimmer cuts the longer hairs down to where the shaver can handle them</li>
            <li> It is probably a user error, but that knocked it down one star for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, when I do get the stubble down</li>
            <li> I tried every which way I could think of to get the razor to cut my beard, but, I just could not get it to shave it down at all.</li>
            <li> This time, it worked, and it cut the hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break down the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s and let you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then all I have to do is when I put it down on the charger, push the button and it starts cleaning it.</li>
            <li> It helps to cut down on irritation.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the bar between the blades cools down and feels like ice on your skin while you shave.  </li>
            <li> So I nipped them down with my Fusion and</li>
            <li> However, the cleaning system is what knocked it down a star.</li>
            <li> Let me break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested I turn the Cooltech upside down when trimming.</li>
            <li> but man it has a way to shut down any disbelief.</li>
            <li> The electric razor I use now has a rounded corner triangular design with slots that the hair go down in to cut.  </li>
            <li> I tried up and down, backward and forward, with the whiskers and against the whiskers, shaving and re-shaving...</li>
            <li> Trimmed down with some clippers, and then gave the razor a try.  </li>
            <li> The cooling system cuts down on skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar helps keep shaving irritation on my neck down.  </li>
            <li> erm...cooled down before being used again.</li>
            <li> charging it MUST be sitting face down at an angle</li>
            <li> I have tried pulling my skin tighter, going with the grain, against the grain, sideways, upside down...</li>
            <li> This has been a massive problem for me in the past, but not with this shaver!</li>
            <li> the pros are endless!</li>
            <li> other reviewers have noted, it could just take my skin a little while to get used to the razor</li>
            <li> Maybe based on the fact of where it is located on the razor or due to my hand eye coordination in the mirror!</li>
            <li> negative point I have is that I am a little disappointed in the long hair trimmer feature on this electric razor as I have used other Braun electric razors previously and the long hair trimmer worked just fine for sideburns or if I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days and let my beard/mustache grow out.</li>
            <li> Certainly it is not worth the list price, but for less than an hundred it could be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I&#x27;ve heard for this razor is that it might be weaker than a few of the others on the market, but because my facial hair doesn&#x27;t set in as thick, I haven&#x27;t run into any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other electric razors</li>
            <li> Removing the shaver is a little clumsy because it&#x27;s so snug while inside but not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from typical razors to vibrating razors.</li>
            <li> If you hair grows at odd angles you will find yourself having to adjust your grip and angle of attack.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence and stuck comparing this unit to a slightly cheaper model, hit the &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34; button on the CoolTec...</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence and stuck comparing this unit to a slightly cheaper model, hit the &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34; button on the CoolTec...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Braun CoolTec System to anyone I know unless they don&#x27;t grow much facial hair or if they shave daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation during shaving.</li>
            <li> Think about it, you are generating mondo heat throughout the shaving process that typically has nowhere to go but into the air and into your brain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically get irritation from using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Less irritation &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a baby face and typically shave two times a week.</li>
            <li> It cools your skin so less</li>
            <li> can use it while I am half awake and not cut myself&lt;br</li>
            <li> it appears to take less time to do so.  </li>
            <li> When it was done, the shaver was slightly moist and smelled of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> because being in the military, an electric shave is much preferred to cutting yourself with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I have typically used a rotating head shaver for years and was a bit leary of trying a strip head razor.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I use a Gillette Fusion razor to shave, but I&#x27;ve since been converted to a believer in electric after using the Braun Cooltec shaver (provided to me via a program run by Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically subject to razor burn after shaving, but after using the Cooltec, I had none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously used the Braun 9595 shaver, which has both a battery and hygiene indicator.</li>
            <li> The shaver is also a bit heavier than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I typically always had some sort of stubble on my face...</li>
            <li> Typically when I did shave I always had those expenisive multi-blade razors, that always seemed to rust out or just start to pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li> ---I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity after shaving with it.</li>
            <li> When I was using the disposable razor, I would always use it before I showered because I would have less irritation that way.</li>
            <li> But at the end, my face did not have the typical burning feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously was using another brand of electric razor but downgraded to a trimmer and Mach-3 after my friend&#x27;s puppy chewed it up.</li>
            <li> I received my razor through a Braun program and was hoping my previous cleaning refills would be compatible - and they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic electric shaver previously</li>
            <li> I am done in half the time of shaving with a razor and with twice the comfort.  </li>
            <li> do have a dock this a star because I don&#x27;t feel that the shave is as close as my previous razor.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was the Braun FreeGlider that utilized a skin conditioner to keep the skin lubricated.  </li>
            <li> Then along comes the Braun CoolTec  shaver with active cooling technology!</li>
            <li> As promised I felt less skin irritation after using the cooltec shaver.</li>
            <li> left several uncut hair and perform just a well as a $20 electric razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> plus I didn&#x27;t have to bring along any shave cream - less hassle with the FAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is less irritated and my face feels smoother</li>
            <li> When I was using previous electric shavers (rotary type)</li>
            <li> What is so revolutionary about this product is that it is the world‚Äôs first shaver with active cooling technology (the revolutionary aluminum cooling bar gets down to a chilly 44¬∞ - the temperature of a typical refrigerator)!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is unfair, and maybe I&#x27;m setting my standards too high, but</li>
            <li> Another note about charging is that you don&#x27;t have to worry aboutrunning the power all the way down before recharging, a plus to me as bathroom outlets are usually a little</li>
            <li> This razor has little holes that the hair needs to go down in to cut.  </li>
            <li> The reverese side was helpful for me due to the fact I have very thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is partially my fault for not knowing how to properly shave with an electric razor, but still it was a little frustrating.  </li>
            <li> My only issue (if that&#x27;s what you want to call it) is the cleaning solution refills for the base are a little pricey, but I think they are worth it in comparison to not using it at all.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit chunkier, I like the fact that the two (2) independent cutting elements improves coverage and precision, cutting more hair in less time, giving me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to do because all the paperwork/receipt/warranty was thrown out in the Christmas mess.  </li>
            <li> Like I said before, the razor does an average job on the shaving side, but with the advantage of no irritation, I am switching to this razor for my everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not a fun time with my everyday shave.</li>
            <li> It feels awkward at first, but the cooling effect is now a must-have for me when it comes to electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of shavers in the past, and I always struggled with either razor burn or the feeling of a shave that was not very close.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess all over the sink and counter.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple in the past and never really thought that the shave was any comparison to my manual razor.</li>
            <li> The ice cold feeling you get during your shave is pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> The three stage cutting system was the first noticeable improvement in the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> It can get pretty cold.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not full proof.</li>
            <li> The shaver base on the other hand seems cheap.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shavers before and none of them got close and even worse left my face burning!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tough to get all the last stubble on the neck, but no better/worse than other models for that.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a good thing when you need a very high speed shaver to get the tough areas that even the Series 7 had challenges with.  </li>
            <li> The flip side of this is even with the hair a little longer, there is less pulling on the hair as it shaves than there was with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I will add here that I was coming off of a no shave November and had a little bit of half beard going.  </li>
            <li> Now, I will add here that I was coming off of a no shave November and had a little bit of half beard going.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tough to get in the tight places&lt;br /&gt;Expensive Cartidge Refills&lt;br /&gt;Base</li>
            <li> Odd curve to it and small shave head make it difficult to do a straight trim on sideburns</li>
            <li> Negatives:  the cooling bar requires the shaver heads to be further apart, to make room for the cooling bar, making shaving more difficult and uncomfortable, the shaver performance is poor when compared to the 790cc</li>
            <li> a small negative, the Braun CoolTec does not get as close of a shave as a traditional razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The automatic cleaner / charging base (home) is pretty big.  </li>
            <li> The automatic cleaner / charging base (home) is pretty big.  </li>
            <li> It is an easy system to use and has a base that automatically cleans the razor.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I can go either way with electric razors: I like the convenience but appreciate the close shave a traditional razor provides, with that said, I find this has given me the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor in a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually hate shaving, and especially with shaving machines, however, for the first time, it didn&#x27;t feel so bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little difficult around the base of the neck, but otherwise amazing!</li>
            <li> Was fairly skeptical as my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it can be charged in the big base or if you are limited on counter spaceit will charge in a small cradle and it charges fast and holds it charge for a few times use.  </li>
            <li> only other small complaint is that it seems that the razor doesn&#x27;t want to stay down on the charger but that could be me not placing it down in the base far enough.</li>
            <li> It feels like a little ice cube against the cheek.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving in the car one day on the way to work and some of the little hairs ended up on my shirt instead of inside the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Self</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of other things - in the past, electric razors don&#x27;t get it done for me.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and I have little to no</li>
            <li> I thought the razor would get cool but was shocked at how cold it really got.</li>
            <li> It ended up being a little to cumbersome for me</li>
            <li> had little luck getting all my hair to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little noisy when others in the house are sleeping, but part of that is the acoustics in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> it is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> A little pricey on the front end,</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been using this shaver for a little over a week now and not once have I come away with irritated or cut skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as a non-electric razor, but it shaves as close as any other electric razor I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> little to no skin irritation&lt;</li>
            <li> little bulky&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little longer than manual razors</li>
            <li> I have had the plug fall out a couple of times with little to no movement.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than a disposable razor but the shave is closer.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than I would like when I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning station is a little sleeker and modern-looking than my 8000 series station.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is a little bulky .&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got some dough and want to buy a unique razor, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed with the Cooltec.</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble getting a close shave without irritating my skin, but I was nicely surprised after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> While using the system, I have not experienced any clogging while getting the same close shave I did from my previous razor.</li>
            <li> major marketing point of this razor is the aluminum cooling bar, which I was slightly concerned about at first, fearing it would be uncomfortable like someone holding a cold hand to your face.</li>
            <li> However, I think it&#x27;s dumb that they force you to spend money every few months replacing the cleaning system fluid.</li>
            <li> The weight actually is a little heavy for a razor.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re typically a tough shave (especially on the neck-</li>
            <li> It definitely had its challenges getting the tough hairs on the bottom of my neck and just under my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> So the fact that I can just rinse it out, put it in the cleaning base and leave it until later is certainly nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How much difference could a cold little bar make?  </li>
            <li> , it occasionally emitted a very high pitched electrical whine while charging on the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> I get pretty bad razor burn on my neck from a conventional razor and after using the Braun on two consecutive days I havent had a problem.</li>
            <li> In addition, I always hated to clean my dry shave razor.</li>
            <li> The razor has a close shave, but unless you just like the cold feeling, I don&#x27;t really see the use of the cooling agent.</li>
            <li> They were not kidding about the cooling feature, it really does get cold and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated at all.</li>
            <li> The cold really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has a base unit that will clean and sanitize your shaver just as my previous electric shaver.</li>
            <li> base is huge.  </li>
            <li> When shaving, it seemed as though the razor wasn&#x27;t cutting very well.</li>
            <li> It kept the shave cold the entire time and left my face with no irritation.</li>
            <li> After a week of use this still feels awkward because when saving my lip and chin only one of the foil cutters can shave the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitate because I wonder how a electric razor with a straight cutting method would work around the adams apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very coarse facial hair and this shaver has no problem cutting through them.</li>
            <li> I have no earthly idea what makes it so cold, but it literally feels like someone took it straight out of the freezer when its turned on.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with areas on my face and neck that the shaver would not shave off.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cooltec in the mail a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor a few times, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It seemed like I was missing areas all over.</li>
            <li> so it took me a few weeks for my face to adjust to the electric</li>
            <li> After you switch on the shaver it takes a few seconds for the coldness to power up.  </li>
            <li> CoolTec System took a few shaves to get in the groove of it.</li>
            <li> It seems not to catch a lot of hair with a few passes.</li>
            <li> be messy -</li>
            <li> I used the Braun 7 series shaving system before I received  the Braun CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> And for once, Braun&#x27;s cleaning base doesn&#x27;t sound like</li>
            <li> And for once, Braun&#x27;s cleaning base doesn&#x27;t sound like</li>
            <li> If you have a few days of growth, forget it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging  system is a novelty gimmick and a waste of space.</li>
            <li> I like having a beard but get tired of constantly trimming my neck line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is narrow and efficient .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After being somewhat skeptical of the CoolTec system, I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The science behind this feature is that as you shave; your skin temperature goes up, thus causing irritation with further shaving.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried cool-tec you are missing out.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a razor junkie, owning the Braun Series 7, Activator, and also a few models from Norelco.</li>
            <li> The science behind this feature is that as you shave; your skin temperature goes up, thus causing irritation with further shaving.</li>
            <li> 11/18/2013:&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for a few weeks, I have noticed it does not work well on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> and I would end up with a few razor bumps here and there.  </li>
            <li> and I kept it for a few weeks to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> It has trouble grasping the hairs even though I stretch my skin areas as recommended.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Sometimes takes going over the skin a few times to get a close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe even space to fit the charging base as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was provided a Braun shaver to evaluate for a few weeks through a Braun company test program.</li>
            <li> The side burn shaver/ trimmer is not precise and it doesn&#x27;t allow me to outline my beard evenly.</li>
            <li> There are a few things I think could be upgraded like the size.</li>
            <li> With the CoolTec, this tired daily ritual is no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System everyday for a month now.  </li>
            <li> I shaved everyday as to mitigate the length of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it a few times but don&#x27;t even use the cooling part anymore.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the shaver on my my neck a few times</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Braun Cool-Tech electric shaver in rotation for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone that has to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I figured that I have probably spent at least $1000 dollars on razors in my lifetime</li>
            <li> The side burn shaver/ trimmer is not precise and it doesn&#x27;t allow me to outline my beard evenly.</li>
            <li> It allows me to shave without all the messy conditioners and creams.  </li>
            <li> Well after using this razor for a few weeks my skin is clearing up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been at it two months, and I have a few thoughts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is on the back side of the razor, and when deployed, it stays concealed behind the razor as you try to use it.  </li>
            <li> so you didn&#x27;t have to waste time cleaning it yourself.</li>
            <li> It does take a few seconds for it to reach maximum coldness</li>
            <li> cleaning system is a joke, a few use and its time to by another, I rinse the razor and use the system sparely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve used it a few times).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review in a few weeks after I have used it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Series 7 user for a few years now</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System through a program with Braun after having used the Panasonic ES-LA93 for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I had to go over my face a few times in order to remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Letting your beard grow for anymore then 3-4 days and your pushing it as it just has trouble handling it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver about 3 times a week for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> (it comes with a few thing).  </li>
            <li> few thing I noticed before while</li>
            <li> I dont like having to rub my face over and over and over to get those 3-4 rogue hairs that it seems to keep missing.</li>
            <li> biggest test for this shaving system was whether or not I would get razor burn in the few hours after I had shaved.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> At first the Cooling pad felt very weird as it made my face feel like to was freezing.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few electronic shavers</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not, the coolness performs as advertised, however, it does NOT provide anywhere near a close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of electric razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of packaging Braun packages this German-made shaver very well and includes Carrying Case, Cleaning Base, Fluid, and Shaver.</li>
            <li> Braun packages this German-made shaver very well and includes Carrying Case, Cleaning Base, Fluid, and Shaver.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but still.</li>
            <li> If your not a huge fan of electric razors you will still like it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system still malfunctions from time to time, but it&#x27;s not very difficult to remove the head and brush off the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun series 5 for the past year and was a bit skeptical of this new product upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get some long hairs without a trimmer (something the old shaver couldn&#x27;t do either).  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for the past six years (previously used razors).</li>
            <li> In the past I would always get the typical burn when using an electric razor, but with the CoolTec</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it just about every day for the past month or so and still haven&#x27;t had to charge it whereas my previous shaver required a charge every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a good dry shave razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least three other electric razors before and they end up so patchy that I end up shaving with a safety razor afterwards anyways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setup was really straightforward, connected the base station to the power cable, popped in the cartridge and charged the razor.</li>
            <li> Strongly do not recommend.</li>
            <li> so it feels like it will not easily break.</li>
            <li> This allows you you to place the razor in a base which will automatically clean and charge the razor.</li>
            <li> What this allows you to do is after each shave, you can place the razor in an accompanying base which will automatically clean and charge the razor.</li>
            <li> It begins to clean the razor with a cleaning solution, that you add into the base upon set up.  </li>
            <li> Once I set it in the cleaning base, it would activate like it was going to clean, and then it shut off.</li>
            <li> As a longtime blade user, he was initially very skeptical about switching to an electric since prior shavers didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> The charge and clean base station keeps the unit fully charged.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they actually last, and I am slightly cynically thinking this may be just a wayto</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little small</li>
            <li> The shave is serviceable (if uneven), which isn&#x27;t bad, but you&#x27;d expect more from this relatively expensive electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To top it all off, the base included in the kit doubles up as a charger and a built-in cleaning station which uses a bluish solution, similar to the ones used in salons to disinfect their cutting tools, and with one push of the button, it cleans and disinfects the razor head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with razors and shavers in the past..</li>
            <li> I think I may of used this feature 5 times or so in the past few years</li>
            <li> It looks really cool in its cleaning base, as well, sitting there looking like the sword in the stone when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
            <li> I had serious disappointment after my first shave with the Braun CoolTec System, which was provided by a program run by Braun.  </li>
            <li> The main reason was that in the past they pulled hairs rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> itself!&lt;br /&gt;- Less irritating than any other shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The previous Braun shaver I had, the shaver slid further down into the station and it was snug and lights automatically came on, even with an indicator of how dirty the shaver was</li>
            <li> It did not make raw hamburger out of my neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past but always had pretty bad results.</li>
            <li> it was bad enough that I felt I needed to go back and get my manual razor just to go over everything again.</li>
            <li> The only time I didn&#x27;t have this problem as bad was when I shave religiously every morning and never skipped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely a bad idea choosing the Frustrating Free Packaging.</li>
            <li> As someone in the military who needs to shave daily, this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I grow a thick beard and typically get gnarly razor burn</li>
            <li> The base is a little large and the cooling liquid could be a mess.</li>
            <li> Some say is was no good, other like it.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get some stubborn hairs under my chin and on my neck area.</li>
            <li> They usually make raw hamburger out of my neck skin.  </li>
            <li> I should insert here that in all of my other experiences with electric shavers I would experience &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; that would later turn into blisters(a lot like some cold sores).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who has thick facial hair, I had to do numerous passes to experience what I thought was a close shave, those pesky hairs by the neckline might as well be impossible to get with the electric razor.</li>
            <li> I should insert here that in all of my other experiences with electric shavers I would experience &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; that would later turn into blisters(a lot like some cold sores).  </li>
            <li> I hate cleaning out my other razors and this makes the process much easier</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;m not sure if my unit is typical, the plug just does not fit very snugly into the base.  </li>
            <li> The instructions provided with the unit were a little confusing and unclear.  </li>
            <li> When I was done shaving my face, I felt a very little irritation on the lower-right portion of my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very little knowledge about competitive brands and products</li>
            <li> The cooling bar is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it is all electric razors</li>
            <li> My razor bumps have become a thing of the past these days</li>
            <li> tried this razor a couple of times in the past 2 weeks and it has made me a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the razor out at first and didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the &amp;#34;cooltec&amp;#34; part of it and seemed disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the shaver for the first time, I was slightly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The Cooltec left some random hairs.</li>
            <li> It could not/ did not shave anything past a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> It is not a bulky razor and all you need for travel is the razor in its case and the small docking station for charging.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because it is difficult to get a close shave on the neck.</li>
            <li> No burns, no bumps, no more stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 3D Blades vs. Foil</li>
            <li> Probably it&#x27;s just the natural tightening of the skin that happens  when it gets cold.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun and I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using it for the past week.</li>
            <li> I had a electric razor in the past which made my skin irritated and didn&#x27;t shave we&#x27;ll whatsoever.</li>
            <li> you can usually tell i did so.</li>
            <li> Me personally, I don&#x27;t usually get irritated skin</li>
            <li> The edging tool hooked up to this razor is really slick.</li>
            <li> With this razor, I was shaving every morning and lost the smoothness of the shave before I left the office each day.&lt;br /&gt;- Weird angles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would give the razor 3-3.5 stars, but am not sure that it is 100% for me.</li>
            <li> It helped the usual burning sensation to drop drastically.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if that skewed my opinion or not.</li>
            <li> I had problems with it on the neck area, which is usually the quickest growing for me.</li>
            <li> After the shave, out of habit, I applied some aftershave lotion that usually burns after a shave.</li>
            <li> Skin irritation is a thing of the past when using this</li>
            <li> My only issue with the device is that the cleaning cartridges are somewhat expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have used Braun products in the past and found them always reliable.</li>
            <li> All of my past electrics, including the Braun&#x27;s I have had never did so well on neck hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike shavers of the past, all the hair I was shaving off seemed to be caught in the shaver.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to get past that breaking in period.</li>
            <li> However, once you get past stubble length, you&#x27;ll probably need to you another trimmer/shaver because the CoolTec won&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it bi-weekly for the past 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I guess because the head of it is so small.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it -</li>
            <li> This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun and I&#x27;m basing this review in comparison to a disposable razor and one electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving in general because of the time, and the razor burn I get from traditional blades.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use a razor</li>
            <li> I found that the razor performed poorly when cutting facial hair unless the hair was extremely short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past and gave up in frustration.</li>
            <li> No more razor burns.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get razor bumps afterwards ( I usually do)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun electric shavers for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I guess because the head of it is so small.</li>
            <li> My problem is, no matter what technique, razor, blade, cream, lotion, pre treatment, method, I have used in the past, if I shaved more than 2x per week I would get a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> If others fail you, then fall back on this one (after all it did do it&#x27;s job in the end, just not for the price).</li>
            <li> I usually charge the razor on Sunday nights</li>
            <li> Wow, I couldn&#x27;t believe how cold it got.  </li>
            <li> CoolTec technology make razor burn a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I usually use a disposable razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> how lazy I am this took too</li>
            <li> I usually use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power razor and it does well for me.  </li>
            <li> so I was not sure how I would like the CoolTec Shaver.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s usually against your face that irritate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was designed that way (maybe safety reasons) or if mine was a defect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just trim it on zero setting with a trimmer</li>
            <li> When you combine all this you have a product which initial cost can be expensive compared to a manual, but how does it stack up against a manual?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then every shaver I&#x27;ve had was not able to compete with a razor on quickness or smoothness of shave</li>
            <li> It has some advantages but they are unfortunately outweighed by the negatives, which have made me go back to my manual</li>
            <li> Unlike electric razors that I have tried in the past, it did not pinch my skin or pull my hair.</li>
            <li> The lack of power to the trimmer made it impossible to trim my sideburn (not thick at all).  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very uneven</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> The only issue with the shaver is it is a little awkward shaving the mustache.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives as close of a shave as all my other shavers, but does it without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics -</li>
            <li> and my first worry was that it would make my face very cold.</li>
            <li> I put it on the cleaning base to have it cleaned for the next shave, and it charges at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside is that I will eventually have to replace the cleaning fluid in the base, which is something you will need to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> Unlike past electric razors, you barely realize that it is cutting off your whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the active cooling technology works, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a game changer.  </li>
            <li> I shave, put the razor back in the base, press a button and it cleans and charges the razor at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It uses the same charger as the base unit so no extra wires/cords to keep up</li>
            <li> This cleaning base actually works and totally takes the job of cleaning away.  </li>
            <li> and I always have shaving it without either cutting myself or having major irritation.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it isn&#x27;t too expensive as that will determine if I use this shaver long</li>
            <li> I gave them up due to having fairly sensitive skin and did not want to deal with annoying skin irritation anymore.</li>
            <li> The different cutting technology in this razor allowed for it to cut all my facial hair without putting the razor at weird angles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who is interested in purchasing this razor needs to know that it comes with an alcohol cleaning solution that is installed into the base.</li>
            <li> When I got the Braun ¬∞CoolTec, I was skeptical about the cooling feature as being a silly gimmick, but I was sure wrong!  </li>
            <li> Not exactly sure how, but the metal element in between the shaving surfaces actually gets COLD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced redness or irritation with my previous Braun, I wouldn&#x27;t be inclined to recommend the Braun CoolTec system if it doesn&#x27;t solve an existing problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased a very expensive norelco from macys a few years back</li>
            <li> have 2 very small reasons why this unit doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars from me, and they are indeed small issues that probably shouldn&#x27;t sway ANYONES purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have 2 very small reasons why this unit doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars from me, and they are indeed small issues that probably shouldn&#x27;t sway ANYONES purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a metal bar that sits between the two cutting blades which really does get ice cold, and I found it helped cut down on irritation.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t get into the hard to reach contours in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Braun type razor head is just too bulky and hard to make defined movements while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly I had a hard time with some spots under my chin.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I had a dull blade?</li>
            <li> Hard to shave around things like mustaches</li>
            <li> Sometimes have to go over hard to maneuver spots</li>
            <li> After making a bunch of passes in a couple of spots with the foils, it hardly made a dent.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes the dull shaving routine and bumps it up a notch.</li>
            <li> I had patches of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; that I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get no matter how hard I tried to go over them.  </li>
            <li> The razor did have a hard time shaving my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can press as hard as you want, go against the grain, etc., but I can&#x27;t get a close shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the sensation...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to that feeling of scraping my face while shaving, but I hardly notice anything with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like and find it hard to believe I will.</li>
            <li> I had patches of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; that I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get no matter how hard I tried to go over them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the base station is smartly designed.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I got this because I had tried electric razors in the past and have never found one that offered a close shave and didn&#x27;t end up ripping my whiskers out after only a month of use because the blades were already dull and they were a hassle to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the negative side, I still can&#x27;t figure out how to shave the bottom of my neck and get it all.</li>
            <li> Confusing instructions.  </li>
            <li> Or at least they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced redness problems with shavers in the past, so I&#x27;m not sure if this feature reduces redness or not.</li>
            <li> To start, I&#x27;ve never written a negative review.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting the hair by coming in from different angles but that didn&#x27;t seem to work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor and my skin stayed ice cold the entire time I used it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your face and neck cold while shaving so that it provides instant</li>
            <li> My hope when I tested this Braun CooTec was to see if I could find an electric razor that I could incorporate into my shaving regimen as at least for those times I don&#x27;t have the time and/or energy to get all lathered up.</li>
            <li> However, if you like to have a cold shave, then you&#x27;ll obviously like this</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver for anyone with sensitive skin that deals with painful irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> This has two negative effects.  </li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t make my face feel cold at all.</li>
            <li> but I find myself being clumsy and making mistakes with it.</li>
            <li> It is actually cold to the touch and definitely reduce irritation..</li>
            <li> one complaint about this shaver is the charging mechanism.</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> It has this bar in the middle that gets cold while you shave.</li>
            <li> It is cold to the touch and definitely reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to spend the money, they last forever!</li>
            <li> I have rather thick hair</li>
            <li> Thick plastic and rubber all around.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard</li>
            <li> or you take your time and slowly repeat shaving the area over and over again(time consuming).</li>
            <li> I started about a month ago, I was in the thick of Movember and keeping my beard under control while unleashing my Mo&#x27; was priority number one.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Also the placement of the power socket on the main unit is awkward and makes it difficult to place the unit on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I mean literally.</li>
            <li> No better than a 20.00 dollar razor!</li>
            <li> I mean literally.</li>
            <li> have used it a few times over the last month or so and have to say that I&#x27;m generally disappointed with the shaving result.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a bit cautious about using it in water, because we have very hard water here, and I&#x27;m afraid that over time, it may dull or destroy the blades, foils and other parts of the shaver...</li>
            <li> The product is very clearly high quality and comes substantial accessories including a cleaning/charging base and a reinforced travel</li>
            <li> I mean seriously, when all said and done, this is a $20 razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the cooling feature, but disappointed by the shave.  </li>
            <li> had a very difficult time following the packaging directions just to put the kit together, but I charged the razor and used it.  </li>
            <li> the CoolTec and Series 7 have cleaning bases but the CoolTec base is a little bit bigger than Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The only problem I can think of is the cleaning solution leaks out of the base a little bit if it is tipped.  </li>
            <li> have very thick facial hair and this shaver has no problem cutting through.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out as I have had bad experiences with electric razors in the past, and again I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just think the aluminum strip that gets cold is too thin to really make the shave feel cold on the skin (not enough surface area gets cold).</li>
            <li> I did get occasional snag that was initially painful, common with foil shavers, but the cooling technology helped with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have used a Norelco system that has a base charging and cleaning station.</li>
            <li> All of us who travel for a living know its an awful mess when we are running late already to hop on a train, pull out our razor only to find out its as dead as a doornail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a hard case for travel which is tough</li>
            <li> I tried the Braun CoolTec electric shaver through a program run by Braun and I was a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li> + on it, I&#x27;d be a little angry.</li>
            <li> I was still a little skeptical, but,</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when Braun provided me the opportunity to try out this shaver through a program they were running.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> No more spending 10 minutes with a piddly little brush, trying to dislodge your hair from their cutting unit.  </li>
            <li> but I am always left with irritated skin and a bad shave.</li>
            <li> As someone with a tendency to get bad irritation this was a last hope type purchase.</li>
            <li> the Series 7 was the least irritating for</li>
            <li> (Not a good way to promote your product if it is...)</li>
            <li> The adaptable 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade provides a close shave with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> Ill preface my review with a few things 1)</li>
            <li> My old razor&#x27;s base station had a motor that dropped and raised the razor into the cleaning solution, which was loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll lose the benefits of the automatic cleaning that you have at home, but at least you won&#x27;t run out of juice (or have to lug the giant base with you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about the razor is the charging/cleaning base that it comes with.</li>
            <li> The first one was a Norelco and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec system seems to alleviate both of my common complaints!</li>
            <li> If you are determined to get the closeness of a manual razor, such as Mach 3 or Hydro 5, you will probably be disappointed in this shaver.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was overall disappointed with the quality of the shave this razor provided.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m cutting edge (pun intended), other times I&#x27;m a bit behind the curve.  </li>
            <li> I tried very hard to give this product a chance and used it continually for three weeks to see if I would get accustomed to it, but the performance did not meet my standards.</li>
            <li> I would say that it&#x27;s not cool, its actually cold</li>
            <li> The spacing of the blades makes it tough to shave under the nose.</li>
            <li> have a very thick beard and it did not shave close as needed.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is placed a little bit awkwardly.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it that cold, you can turn it off by pressing the little snowflake</li>
            <li> The cold does take a little while to get used to though.</li>
            <li> Clearer is hard to find though and expensive</li>
            <li> The CoolTec system is something that I have never experienced before in a shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a big base that includes cleaning solution and that aside from charging the shaver also cleans the head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall the Braun CoolTech system is a winner in my book despite the travel charging and cleaning base.</li>
            <li> The CoolTec is seemingly designed with simplicity in mind and the manual is really unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> The base used for charging only adds another item to be packed when I am on the road.  </li>
            <li> hope this helped you decide!ittle frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It annoyed my cats</li>
            <li> I guess it would work with men with thin hair, as my sideburn hairs seem thicker than the openings in the teeth on the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the cooling tech on the shaver and understand the thought behind it</li>
            <li> I also like the base where you put the cleaning fluid in and it cleans the unit.</li>
            <li> At this point I thought I would be leaving a poor review.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This razor comes close, but still leaves visible growth behind.</li>
            <li> The shaver does well around the cheek area, but leaves a lot behind under the chin and neck.</li>
            <li> I had tried others, but all others resulted in a rash or poor shaving.  </li>
            <li> I approximate it takes me 30% longer to shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is quite uneven and immensely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also, I have side burns and there is not really a great way to shave my side</li>
            <li> This razor is meant to alleviate the heat caused by all the friction and thus reduce some of the unnecessary skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way to turn it off is to put it in the base and engage the cleaning cycle with the included solution so give it a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> At this point I thought I would be leaving a poor review.  </li>
            <li> The bar did get cold, but feel it made very little difference in how the shave felt.</li>
            <li> It literally stays cold to not irritate my skin with the heat I had suffered from in the past.</li>
            <li> A small catch is that it doesn&#x27;t immediately start cold.</li>
            <li> As someone who really suffers from shaving irritation, I was a little skeptical about using the CoolTec.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately does not provide the closest shave and in fact is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Cutting to the chase though, it did a pretty poor job, and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving, I have crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s one tip: after cleaning the razor, remove it from the base so it can dry before use.</li>
            <li> and it was by far the worst my face has ever broken out after use.</li>
            <li> tried to use the slide-out hair trimmer on the back of this unit, and I&#x27;d have to rate that part as a miserable failure.</li>
            <li> The shave resulted in a little irritation on the side of the neck but was not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Expensive to maintain, not great for beards.</li>
            <li> I had very bad razor burn, using traditional blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other plus for the CoolTec is the self cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> However, there was just one thing about the kit that I was a little disappointed with and that was the charging/cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> The power cord plugs into the charging/cleaning base in an odd way.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results from the CoolTec.  </li>
            <li> #34;this is going to be a useless gimmick&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like it would fail to pick up those that lay flatter to the face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just would not cut my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or maybe Ill pass it off to someone who will use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> some random hairs -</li>
            <li> Oh My!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but decided to jump in.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak for that but do not see anything wrong with the build of this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this will make its way under the sink and is unlikely to reappear.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the review</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this goes off after each shave</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> and you merely insert the shaver into the station and press the button.  </li>
            <li> If all else fails, my brother has been asking for one of these</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day it is performance I want, and this razor was unfortunately lacking in it for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found when comparing to the time and closeness of a had razor, the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t meet the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate the length of time it takes me to shave everyday, so i try to skip a couple days a week.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;CoolTec\\&quot; feature is useless since the foils are unable to get some spots at all.  </li>
            <li> None of these techniques worked, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but it was a relief to find that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t have a incremented indication of battery discharged so it makes it difficult to guage the battery life.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the wrong time to introduce the shaver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have switched to this system and I am not going back to my boring disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the replacement solution wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this goes off after each shave</li>
            <li> Precision Trimmer is something that tends to be useless in my experience on all electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave close and the trimmer is almost useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry I did.</li>
            <li> So when I was received a Braun CoolTec razor through a program run by Braun, I was skeptical to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was not impressed with closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit skeptical when I received this shaver.</li>
            <li> The mediocre about the Cooltec would be the shave I would give a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; as in it has troubles along the jaw line and the pop up trimmer seems to do nothing?</li>
            <li> The blades just got to be annoyingly expensive, so I thought I&#x27;d give electric a try.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s silly and a way for the manufacturer to jack up the price.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cooling technology isn&#x27;t like putting an ice cube on your face</li>
            <li> Always battling razor burn and the cost of expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> so it misses those hairs that point in weird directions</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been around the block with razors, with everything from disposable to battery-powered expensive razors, to electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about having to replace the cleaning solution every month.  </li>
            <li> but in the end unfortunately does not work as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Braun delivers an all-in-one system with the ¬∞CoolTec, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t excel as a razor or a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> And I have some spots on my chin and neck where my beard is really difficult to cut.  </li>
            <li> And every time, without fail, I would be savagely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product will be useless for you.</li>
            <li> but it was a relief to find that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and I always seem to shy away from the electric after a while because of the skin irritation they cause.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still haven&#x27;t - but the Braun CoolTec comes close.</li>
            <li> However, I was not impressed with closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> : I found that the Braun CoolTec failed to deliver when it came to closeness of the shave and efficiency ‚Äì</li>
            <li> Now since I have it, I think that the cooling technology is useless.</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> People with a small shaving area (like me) will find this annoying.</li>
            <li> I have always found the process to be very uncomfortable and irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Braun CoolTec Shaver comes with the razor, the cleaning and charging base, one alcohol cleaning solution, a small travel charging base, a traveling case for the razor and a small brush for additional cleaning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small thing, but these razors with base stations can be tricky.</li>
            <li> This Braum system has a base station, but also a small travel charger, so I can bring it with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Other razors have caused me to have to hold it in awkward positions to get an even shave, but not this one!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was skeptical on how it would feel to shave with a cold metal element pressing against my face</li>
            <li> Since then, its performance has degraded into mediocrity and I&#x27;ve hated using it.  </li>
            <li> Cheers to Braun&#x27;s innovation in addressing the age-old problem of electric shavers with its cutting element generating heat whilst shaving.</li>
            <li> So this is a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s cold, it feels a bit like a cold piece of silverware...</li>
            <li> , It Really Is Cold</li>
            <li> they did it, is beyond me, but this shaver literally feels cold on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, cold.</li>
            <li> Could you imagine a barber trying to sell you a cold shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be afraid the charge would die before the end of the trip</li>
            <li> You experience this cold shave like rubbing an ice cube across your face.</li>
            <li> The blades like they were tugging and pulling on my hair rather than cutting.</li>
            <li> the cold aspect did help sooth after shaving and the alcohol in the cleaning aspect helps where you do not have to use aftershave.</li>
            <li> Based on the cutting and performance of the razor I would give this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun claims that the adaptable 3-stage cutting system provides a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> biggest disappointment however, is the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not used to rub a cold piece of metal over my face.  </li>
            <li> BTW, since the cooling bar is aluminum it&#x27;s still a bit cold even when turned off.  </li>
            <li> I knew it said it got cold</li>
            <li> This razor eliminates the burning sensation making it feel as though you are rubbing a cold can of soda over your face with each passing stroke.  </li>
            <li> Braun likens the feeling of using this shaver to putting a cold can of soda on your face.  </li>
            <li> but it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid that shaver is going to be put in storage.</li>
            <li> The shave does feel a bit awkward in my hand but this could be attributed to the fact that I&#x27;m not used to using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> this system, I let it run a minute to get cold and then shave every morning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not ice-cold, but it&#x27;s like rubbing a cold spoon on your face.</li>
            <li> did it get cold.</li>
            <li> I like the cooling system it has 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade, cleaning and charge station.</li>
            <li> cold water was on by face.</li>
            <li> Basically, an aluminum element situated between the cutting foils gradually becomes cooler as you shave.</li>
            <li> Since its an electric, you won&#x27;t be nicking or cutting your skin as you shave, either.</li>
            <li> This increases your shaving time to inconvenient lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After letting it run for 10 seconds, I touched the bar and it was surprisingly cold.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a disappointing experience.  </li>
            <li> I have had terrible luck using electric razors in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had terrible experiences with electric razors in the past, so if it hadn&#x27;t been for a promotional program from Braun</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about it at</li>
            <li> When I heard about the CoolTec CT5cc electric razor I was initially very skeptical of the benefits of a ‚Äúcooling‚Äù razor.</li>
            <li> Being a razor man, I was very skeptical about using this.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical about all the hype.</li>
            <li> Also, cleaning the razors was impossible.  </li>
            <li> (How hasn&#x27;t had an unpleasant pulling/burning sensation from a bad razor?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself</li>
            <li> The shaver feels too cold to the touch, and maybe I can&#x27;t figure out the correct way to use it, but it feels very awkward to use, and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> this thing is bad)</li>
            <li> The irritation was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wear a collared shirt for days</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Cool-Tec button is in a bad spot.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the bad part though.</li>
            <li> which wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as the cooling bar kept my skin from getting irritated</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to say this is a bad product.</li>
            <li> Also, I was shocked to feel no pulling or pinching</li>
            <li> I became disappointed after I started shaving.  </li>
            <li> (It gets really cold!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not shaving for 4-5 days, then using this razor, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quickly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Braun CoolTec really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I anticipated being just as disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate clutter on the bathroom counter and with this thing in place my side of the counter looks almost as bad as my wife&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li> But as for the closeness of the shave I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had both foil and rotary electric shavers, yet both types disappointed me and I kept returning to my safety razor.</li>
            <li> received this Braun CoolTec system through a promotion from Braun and I am great-full for the opportunity to try and use this however I am disappointed in what I received.  </li>
            <li> and I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> so this disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> However, it fails miserable in the area underneath the chin, and on the neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use the crap out of this during summer (too bad its November now).  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to buy this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The weight of the cord caused the power cord to keep falling out of the base.  </li>
            <li> cleaning/charging base is one of the coolest features of this product.  </li>
            <li> hate, HATE shaving.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a cleaning base that cleans and lubricates the razor.  </li>
            <li> I found that annoying</li>
            <li> I put the shaver on the base, pushed the button and let the cleaning system do its job.  </li>
            <li> the CoolTec has a cleaning base.</li>
            <li> You put the item in the charging base and press the button on the base.  </li>
            <li> After opening the box, like it was Christmas morning, I assembled the cleaning and charging base.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cleaning base station that makes cleaning the shaver a snap.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to base my review off of one use</li>
            <li> When I go on longer trips, I cannot use my razor as there is no way to charge it without bringing the base station, which I would never do.</li>
            <li> The shaver indicates when it needs to be cleaned so you just put it into the charging base and press the button.</li>
            <li> It was annoying to see hair still on my face where I had just shaved.  </li>
            <li> base, for me, is probably the coolest thing about the system.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about this model, the base might tip you over-</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included self cleaning base is genius.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning base keeps it</li>
            <li> thing that I hate to do when I shaved is to feel the heat on my face.</li>
            <li> and I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> Using the cleaning base is optional and does provide benefits.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t, I hate to say it</li>
            <li> The razor is accompanied by a base which serves as a charger and cleaning station.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d be very angry!</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Net-net, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the razor.</li>
            <li> If I purchased this razor for the price it goes for I would be very disappointed I think.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How ever I was very disappointed by the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that awful burning feeling</li>
            <li> long-hair trimmer may well be the worst aspect of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, I had always been a guy who was stubbly because I hated shaving, but now I am all in for my Braun electric razor!</li>
            <li> the and trying to shave my chin was an awful experience.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I hate shaving!  </li>
            <li> that was horrible...</li>

            <li> Cheers to Braun&#x27;s innovation in addressing the age-old problem of electric shavers with its cutting element generating heat whilst shaving. The \\&quot;Active Cooling\\&quot; feature instantly activates the cool strip in between the two (2) cutting elements, which actually provides a soothing, cool feeling on your skin during the shave. My older Braun 1775 shaver is still working after 9 years but decided to upgrade and try the new Braun CoolTec CT5cc model. Although it&#x27;s a bit chunkier, I like the fact that the two (2) independent cutting elements improves coverage and precision, cutting more hair in less time, giving me a closer shave. To top it all off, the base included in the kit doubles up as a charger and a built-in cleaning station which uses a bluish solution, similar to the ones used in salons to disinfect their cutting tools, and with one push of the button, it cleans and disinfects the razor head. That is definitely cool.</li>
            <li> Pound and wasn&#x27;t happy with the shave</li>
            <li> For the most part it gets a pretty close shave and the CoolTech system works great, but the actual shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to get every hair on your face. I had trouble with areas on my face and neck that the shaver would not shave off. I would go over the same spot multiple times in different directions and it still wold not get as close as the rest of my face or neck. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect but I expected it to work a little better than it did.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver for a week, and while the cooling part of the unit is a very interesting effect, the fact that the head does not pivot really limited my ability to get a close shave.  After a week, I was reaching for my old Braun instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that because it comes with the cleaning solution, you apparently cannot return this to Amazon.  Still working through the details with them on how to resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several Braun models over the years, including the series 7, which in my opinion is their best model.  This one is definitely a step backwards from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update - Amazon resolved the return process quickly and simply.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver and was not disappointed. I was blown away by how smooth the shave was and how cool my face stayed throughout the shave. I was not itchy or irritated during or after the shaving process (which is not always true with other razors). The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean&amp;Charge Station was really cool and something I have not seen before. I like knowing my shaver is clean before each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> Coming from a guy with sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t say enough about this CoolTec system. The cooling bar is unbelievable. I wondered to myself before I tried it what benefit this would bring to the table. It really is an enjoyable feel to have a cool shave, when activated. I say when activated because this system allows you to turn the cool bar on and off. In addition, I always hated to clean my dry shave razor. With the CoolTec system, you can clean and charge this shaver with the push of a button by putting the razor in the cleaning station. The CoolTec system also comes with a travel case and travel lock feature to prevent it from turning on in your luggage-how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shaver through a program with Braun and I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to any guy that&#x27;s looking for an easy to maintain razor that leaves you with a clean smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> I received this Braun&#x27;s ¬∞CoolTec electric shaver as part of a program Braun was doing. When I first received it I was highly impressed.  The idea of it was pretty \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, however after using for a week or so I am less than impressed.  I know this is an electric razor but it didn&#x27;t get into the hard to reach contours in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs.  It says that they only last about 3-4 weeks on the packaging.  I don&#x27;t want to have to remember to buy \\&quot;extras\\&quot; for this so I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend just based on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it was just an okay razor, but not the best out there.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver after  hearing that it reduces shaving irritation.  While I was in the Navy, I had to shave twice a day, if I had duty.  Having to shave every day, irritates my face to no end.  I was hoping that this would be the razor that fixed this problem.  I loved the razor itself and how easy it was to handle.  I became disappointed after I started shaving.  i had to go over my chin and neck several times, which irritated my skin.  I was hoping to shave once, get all the hair and no irritation.  No luck.  Braun&#x27;s sent the Braun CootTec Shaver to get my opinion of the shaver and I hate to say that for the money it would cost to buy, I think you could purchase a better razor for less money.  The other issue was the price of the replacement blade.  It was a little more costly than others.  I did find that the battery charge held.  I truly wanted to like this razor, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running. I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel that it is cool to the touch. I have always used a Gillette Mach 3 standard razor and this is way better. I get pretty bad razor burn on my neck from a conventional razor and after using the Braun on two consecutive days I havent had a problem. I even did my head (disclaimer...there wasn&#x27;t much hair left) and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super convenient to simply throw it on the charger after using it and just by pressing a button it cleans it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue with a spot just above my ear. It would touch the spot because of the contour of my head and the extending trimmer didn&#x27;t really work well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Ive had a chance to use the system for a while and I was less impressed over time.  Im not sure if it is all electric razors but the shave never got close to the skin and missed a lot on my face.  I felt like I had to go over the area multiple times in order for it to get razor close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my normal multiple blade razor the beginning of my work week and hitting the electric razor half way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still good at not irritating my skin and have even used it on my head a few times.  It actually seemed to work better on my head than it did on my face.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec electric razor on 11/12/13 which was provided via a program run by Braun.  I tried it out and I must say it is really a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tech product. The metal bar in the middle of the blades is very cold and makes your skin feel cool and not so rough and worn out.  It has 3 options to be cleaned which are 1. Manually with the included brush. 2. Take blade off and rinse it under the water or 3. You can just put the electric razor inside the self cleaning device and will clean,sterilize and lubricate it for the next time of use.  Also final feature is how quick it charges from the time it is put on the charger and charges under an hour.  I highly recommend this product and I am very satisfied with it.  I will never go back to any kind of razor blades again.</li>
            <li> I tried the Braun CoolTec electric shaver through a program run by Braun and I was a little skeptical.  How much difference could a cold little bar make?  Well I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised by the performance of the razor.  The razor does a very nice job and the CoolTec cooling bar did a very nice job soothing my skin.  I did not have any red razor burns on my face which is common with all other electric razors I have tried.  Additionally, the cleaning station was a really cool added bonus.  With the touch of a button, the charging/cleaning station takes care of all the messy cleaning and it will be ready to use, clean and charged, the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a small negative, the Braun CoolTec does not get as close of a shave as a traditional razor and shaving cream.  But I have not found a single electric razor that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really impressed with the Braun CoolTec electric razor.  Together with the charging/cleaning station and the soft case that will allow me to take this on the road with me, I think this is a great razor for a close shave without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Great shaver the cooling factor is something else it truly makes for a better shaving.  Braun offered this to me to try out and have to say it is the best electric shaver i have ever used.  Deffinatlly would recommend this to everyone its one nice shaver and works very very well</li>
            <li> I was able to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of shaving brands and products in my adult life, and this might be one of my new favorites.  The product itself comes with the shaver, traveling case, power cord, and charging/cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shaver a couple of days ago and it did a great job.  I had a full beard, so I used the built-in trimmer to bring my beard down to stubble.  I then used the CoolTec Shaver to make my face silky smooth.  The CoolTec Technology exceeded my expectations.  I didn&#x27;t have that awful burning feeling I get when I&#x27;ve used other shavers.  Once I was done I put it on the cleaning base to have it cleaned for the next shave, and it charges at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Shaver.  My only negative is that, like with many other shavers, it was very tricky getting some of those pesky hairs that refused to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, and for any guy looking for a new shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cooltec in the mail a few days ago. When i found out that Braun would be sending me one to try out i was super stoked. Right out of the package you can tell that this is not your typical electric razor. It comes with a a clean and charge station that not only recharges the razor in between uses but also cleans the blades and lubricates them to keep them in tip top shape. After a quick charge I had to give this razor a try. The first thing I noticed was the cooling feature, where an aluminum cooling bar is chilled to reduce irritation. I was a little skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised as to how well it cools. I have to say that it gave me one of the best shaves i have ever had using an electric razor. Absolutely no irritation and a very close shave. I actually had my wife feel the side of my face after shaving, suffice it say she approves. I would definitely recommend this razor to people that are looking for a great electric razor that gives a very close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newer to electronic shavers as I usually use clippers to maintain my facial hair. However, I was surprised by the performance of this product. I enjoyed the cooling function, that was pretty awesome. I also managed to get a pretty close shave as well. While I won&#x27;t be switching over completely to electric shavers due to the length I tend to keep my facial hair, I will definitely break this out when I need to get close.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Clearer is hard to find though and expensive</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, so I can&#x27;t say that I did a good job of stress testing the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I&#x27;d like to say that the razor does work well.  It&#x27;s a very comfortable shave and the cooling mechanism works noticeably well.  Granted, I can shave without it and experience no irritation, but it does feel better to have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the performance.  For my first shave, I let my beard grow as long as I normally do for about a week.  It doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  While it did cut most of the hairs, it did leave a few stubborn hairs that were laying down. I tried moving it around to try to pick up the hairs, but it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it couple more times and it worked better with the hairs pretty short.  It works fast, but it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs by the back of my jawline.  Everywhere else, it shaves very close.  For some reason, even when I stretch the skin, I still have some stubble left in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the performance, the equipment appears to be well constructed, including the carrying case.  I even tried the cleaning system and it looks like it worked well.  Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that if electric razors work well for you, this is a good razor to try.</li>
            <li> I recently received this razor as a test product through a program run by Braun. I used to use electric razors almost exclusively then switched back to manual ones (since I do most of my shaving the shower). I have used this razor a few times, I would recommend it. What sets this razor apart is its cooling bar, which soothes the skin by cooling it, helping to prevent skin irritation during shaving. (It gets really cold!) I used it after not shaving for several days and it didn&#x27;t pull the stubble at all. The only thing this razor has going against it is the price (retailing for about $200). I would not have purchased this razor on my own because of that (since there are cheaper models out there that likely work just as well).</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a program from Braun. Its a fairly decent shaver. It trims down alright, wasn&#x27;t like a clean shave though. The trimmer is under powered for the thicker beard, but might be a decent edging and shaping tool. The trimmer is placed a little bit awkwardly.The Cooltec shaver does offer a cooling feature that you can feel, though it didn&#x27;t seem to help with my extra sensitive skin. We have 3 men in the house and all tried it. It does decent work,but can&#x27;t exactly seem to get the neck beard cut that close. All around okay shaver. It offers a bunch of features that some don&#x27;t live up to the hype. The cleaning system is great and cleans it very well and leaves a clean smell to it. The cleaning solution is alcohol based. It works, but I personally think you could get a cheaper razor that does everything the same.</li>
            <li> The razor has a close shave, but unless you just like the cold feeling, I don&#x27;t really see the use of the cooling agent. The pores would open up better with warmth instead of cold. I guess its personal preference</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec shaver gives a great shave and the cooling bar feels great on the face. I have used Norelco shavers in the past and they leave my face with mild irritation, with the Cooltec the cooling bar leaves my face irritation free. It works great, gives me one of the closest shaves for an electric shaver and looks great on the counter. I received this product through a program run by Braun and I have been very pleased by how good this shaver is. I thought the cooling bar would be a gimmick, but it really has worked at keeping my face from getting irritated. It feels like a little ice cube against the cheek. The self cleaning station works very well, it only leaves a tiny bit of hair behind. The only issue with the shaver is it is a little awkward shaving the mustache. The spacing of the blades makes it tough to shave under the nose. Other than that this is a great shaver and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got this razor in a promotion for Braun. It was my second Shaver and i was very impressed!! The cooling feature was strange at first but i really enjoy it and it leaves my face feeling great and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! The base is a little large and the cooling liquid could be a mess. But i like that i can take just the cord to charge it on the road when i travel!! Overall i am very happy with this product and would recommend it to my friends that use power shavers!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaving system through a promotion program run by. Braun. I got to try out this shaver and I have to say it&#x27;s now my favorite one. I have tried everything from typical razors to vibrating razors. When razors heat up they irritate my skin but this one doesn&#x27;t. The coolness is soothing and let&#x27;s me shave longer and more continuously than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself has a good grip and is more weighty which I like because it gives me more accurate control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another Braun with a charging station before and I like that this one doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in. It saves the hassle of finding space on the bathroom counter and an outlet to plug it in. A complaint I had about the old version is that the cleaning station leaked when moved around a lot. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to try the cleaning station on this one yet to know if it&#x27;s better though, but I hope it is.</li>
            <li> I received the razor as part of program run by Braun. I&#x27;m a long time user of Norelco shavers and was pleased to receive this shaving system to review. I&#x27;ve used the razor about a dozen times now with various degrees of hair length and can say that I am mostly happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I shaved daily or every other day, this razor is perfect. It will give me a super close shave while keeping my face chilled (from the built in cooling system. I have noticed that when I started using this razor that the cooling system has kept the irritation of my face to a minimum; which is awesome because I have super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not shaving for 4-5 days, then using this razor, I was disappointed. I could use the Norelco with little to no pulling but the Braun hurt like heck to shave with; it hurt so bad that I stopped using it, switched to the Norelco to get the hair short, then continued using the Braun to get a clean shave that the Norelco can&#x27;t give me. That&#x27;s really my only complaint with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and charging couldn&#x27;t be any easier. Just plug in (although the plug could have a longer cord; but I solved that by stretching the included one out for it to work), drop in the CoolTec and flip to the right and it automatically cleans it. Cleaning refills are reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Let me say this up front, this razor was provided to me via a program run by Braun, but that has no bearing on my review.  I&#x27;ve used electric razor&#x27;s for quite a while now but never a Braun.  It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a very close shave for an electric razor.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the CoolTec feature or not but the more I used it the more I liked it.  That feature would be great for someone with sensitive skin or razor burn but it&#x27;s really for anyone.  There is a design flaw with the razor though.  The power cord plugs into the charging/cleaning base in an odd way.  I have mine sitting on the dresser and the cord hangs over the back and plugs into the wall.  The weight of the cord caused the power cord to keep falling out of the base.  I ended up having to tape it so it would stay.  Other than that, no complaints about the razor.  Here&#x27;s one tip: after cleaning the razor, remove it from the base so it can dry before use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product !!!  Get a really close shave and absolutely NO burn !!&lt;br /&gt;Additional bonus is the cleaning kit. Really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received this shaver as part of a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> Now that \\&quot;No Shave\\&quot; November is over, I was finally able to use my new Braun CoolTec Shaver. The CoolTec was provided to me as part of a program sponsored by Braun. As someone who really suffers from shaving irritation, I was a little skeptical about using the CoolTec. I am happy to say that the CoolTec does live up to hype with regards to skin irritation, but that&#x27;s about it. I found that it was not as close a shave as I normally get from a razor which meant shaving more often. Also the cleaning/charging system, while effective, takes up a lot of space on the bathroom counter. Overall I give it a 3 out of 5 and think I will just stick with my Schick Quattro</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec from a program run by Braun. I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 electric shavers in my 25 years of shaving. Of all the shavers I would place the Braun in the middle of the pack. I think Braun is a quality product, but the design needs help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 day beard shave - The shaver does the best job of any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used at handling 3+ days of growth. It have recessed trimmer cuts the longer hairs down to where the shaver can handle them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoolTec bar -  I&#x27;ve seen mixed reviews on the CoolTec bar. Some say is was no good, other like it. For me I could definitely tell a difference in my shave. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in irritation when using the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave - The shaver gives as close of a shave as all my other shavers, but does it without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics - It&#x27;s just a little better than holding a brick to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutter head design - While you can get a close shave it takes some work. The shaver is designed to be used in a back and forth pattern. If you hair grows at odd angles you will find yourself having to adjust your grip and angle of attack. Remington&#x27;s with their circular cutting head does a far superior job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging / Cleaning station - The cleaning station is pretty big. People with a small shaving area (like me) will find this annoying. You can charge without the cleaning station, but you have to lay the shaver down on a charging base and it still takes more room than it should. I also don&#x27;t like that there is no plug for the shaver itself. If you run out of battery during a shave your are going to have to switch to a razor or wait for the shaver to charge. I feel the cleaning station is a gimmick and not really needed. I will most likely put it in storage and just rinse out the shaver head like I do with all my other shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of electric razors.  My previous experiences haven&#x27;t been good.  Low charge time or being stuck to the wall thanks to a 2.5 foot power cord, followed by serious irritation from a poorly engineered head have made me stick with disposable razors for the last 20 years.  I was lucky enough to be selected by Braun to test this electric shaver. Majority of those previous opinions changed the first time I fired up my Braun CoolTec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything Braun claims the shaver does, it does and does it well.  The cooling feature is extremely &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d venture to say that its specifically responsible for my skin not being an irritated mess after I&#x27;m done shaving.  This has been a massive problem for me in the past, but not with this shaver! The unit has a pretty long charge life, and as such travels well.  All of us who travel for a living know its an awful mess when we are running late already to hop on a train, pull out our razor only to find out its as dead as a doornail.  In case you are going to be gone for a good while, the unit ships with a &amp;#34;mobile charger&amp;#34; that is compact and easy to haul along.  You&#x27;ll lose the benefits of the automatic cleaning that you have at home, but at least you won&#x27;t run out of juice (or have to lug the giant base with you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is extremely close.  My wife is quite impressed with how smooth my face is after I finish with this shaver.  I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a shave thats as close as what I&#x27;d get if I used my typical Mach 3 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning/charging base is one of the coolest features of this product.  Its so insanely easy to use, and requires very little effort to upkeep.  The reasonably priced &amp;#34;Clean and Renew&amp;#34; refill packages keep the shaver very clean and ultra sanitary.... No more spending 10 minutes with a piddly little brush, trying to dislodge your hair from their cutting unit.  Just pop it in, hit a button and walk away.  You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 very small reasons why this unit doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars from me, and they are indeed small issues that probably shouldn&#x27;t sway ANYONES purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The head of the unit is just too big for anyone who is attempting to upkeep any sort of &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve recently grown a &amp;#34;chinstrap beard&amp;#34;, and while I can maintain it with this unit, it requires far too much work to doso without taking out a chunk of a perfectly manicured line.  Men that have a goatee or a mustache will be just fine, but if you are doing anything around your jawline, you will experience much frustration in trying to use the main head of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The automatic cleaner / charging base (home) is pretty big.  If you have a small bathroom with a tiny vanity, plan on this baby taking up more real estate than you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is high quality and lives up to all of my expectations.  I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend without any hesitation.  If you are on the fence and stuck comparing this unit to a slightly cheaper model, hit the &amp;#34;Buy&amp;#34; button on the CoolTec... The extra features are worth the price of admission.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!You&#x27;ll come back to a clean, fully charged shaver, every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 very small reasons why this unit doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars from me, and they are indeed small issues that probably shouldn&#x27;t sway ANYONES purchasing decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The head of the unit is just too big for anyone who is attempting to upkeep any sort of &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34;.

            <li> Let me start by saying I was looking forward to this product the minute I heard about it. I received this product for free directly from Braun to try it out and give my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cooling head is an excellent idea. That being said let me get to my review. I have always wanted to use a nice electric razor for my shaving instead of always using shaving cream and a multiblade razor thinking that this will be quicker, more convenient and give me a nice close shave without slight razor burn or possible nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my razor I quickly plugged it in so I could use it the next morning. I had just shaved the morning before. I am rather hairy and my facial hair grows quickly and rather thick. I had avoided electrics in the past because I could never get a good shave. I always chalked it up to buying a cheap razor. After using this razor the first time I had 2 main issues. It seemed like no matter how I positioned the razor I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave on my neck. It seemed like I was missing areas all over. I tried different angles, I tried pulling my skin tight, I tried going opposite the grain. Nothing seemed to work. I don&#x27;t know if the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough or give a close enough shave or if my skin and hair is too soft for an electric razor. My other issue is I could never get the hairs from my upper lip shaved, so I would end up having to use a bladed razor to shave there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I had heard a long time ago that not everybodies faces work well with electric razors and that some faces after time get adapted and the shave gets better. I don&#x27;t know if this is true or not. I&#x27;m obviously continuing to shave with the razor to test that theory out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar is an awesome feature. Without this my face would definitely have been all irritated by all of my attempts to get all of the hair cut. I have never once felt the razor get hot or my face get warm. That in itself is a great feature. The cleaning station is also a great feature. It&#x27;s very nice to just place the shaver in the cleaner and it&#x27;s clean very shortly and gets a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor to anybody who has had a previous model or is looking to upgrade or try out using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a Braun promotion and am so happy I did! I have very sensitive skin on my face and shaving often leads to razor bumps. I have been avoiding shaving until I have to, until the Braun CoolTec came along! The cooling sensation soothes the burn I normally feel on my sensitive skin. It fits easily into my hands and holds the charge for a more than ample amount of time. My razor bumps have become a thing of the past these days and I recommend this shaving system to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for several weeks now. I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun to review it.  I have been using Braun shavers most of my adult life.  My last Braun was a pulsonic which I was very happy with and used it until it practically fell apart.  I was not impressed with the results from the CoolTec.  It is more of a daily maintenance shaver.  If you have more than a few days growth or longer hairs, it is very difficult to shave with the CoolTec.  The head does not  pivot and to me it appears like the long hair trimming head in the center has been minimized to make room for the cooling head.  I did feel the cooling effect but it typically took too long for it to activate and get cold before I was most of the way into my shave.  It did seem like I had to press harder than other Brauns to be able to feel the cool bar also.  I wanted to wait a few weeks to review this shaver to give it a chance but even so, I still often find places that were missed even after several passes.  The cleaning light comes on everyday even if I rinse it off completely...  I will continue to use to see if it is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Note: This shaver was provided via a program run by Braun, but the comments below are mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver for those people who are looking for an electric shaver. The CoolTec system is something that I have never experienced before in a shaver and it is worth the price of the razor. Instead of getting irritated by the blades and having your face feel like it is on fire, Braun has come up with a better way. The CoolTec system literally cools down your face by having a chilled bar in the middle of the shaving service. It is an incredible feel on the face (I have turned it off to see the difference and I cannot imagine why anyone would want to turn it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a triple or quad blade razor for many years so it took me a few weeks for my face to adjust to the electric but once it did, it provides a great shave. It has two foils which help catch whatever you miss on the first pass. The feel of the shaver itself is very comfortable and ergonomic. It can be used both dry and wet (I have used it in the shower with great results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a wonderful self-cleaning system. Just put the razor into the charger, hit the button, and walk away. A few minutes later the CoolTec razor is cleaned from the inside out. You can also just rinse it off and/or use a brush on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this razor, I told my brother (who is an electric guy through and through) that once I was done trying it out I would give it to him. Now, I am having second thoughts on it. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to lather up and (inevitably) cut myself each time I shave. I can shave anywhere with this and it provides a good shave, so I am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I still can&#x27;t figure out how to shave the bottom of my neck and get it all. It is probably a user error, but that knocked it down one star for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for an electric razor, I don&#x27;t think you could do better than the CoolTec Shaving System from Braun.</li>
            <li> My shaver was provided via a program run by Braun.The cooling feature works well but the shave is lacking. I am used to shaving with 5-blade manual so this is my first electric shaver and i was excited to get it and it is definitely a cool piece of tech but it is not something i couldn&#x27;t live without. The base and the cleaning station make it slightly more useful but just slightly. all in all not something I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received my shaver as a program from Braun.  It had been almost 15 years since the last time I had tried an electric razor.  Most of the ones I had tried before felt more like it pulled the hair out versus cutting it.  My shaves were never close and my skin was always irritated afterward.  It was for these reasons I moved to disposable razors.  When I had the chance to try the Braun CoolTec System, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to see if the product lived up to the hype.  I have used it 3 times so far and it has been a very pleasant experience.  My shave is close (I would almost say even closer than shaving with a razor), and the aluminum cooling bar has kept irritation at bay.  I have used the cleaning station once, and can&#x27;t comment on if it helps the longevity of the product, but I can say that it&#x27;s very simple to use and makes keeping my shaver charged at all times a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing I could complain about the product are it does not do as decent of a job on my neck area.  I still have to follow up with my razor to keep my neck completely clean.  I also found that areas like my sideburns and goatee also require some touch up with the razor as well.  These two issues are the only reason I could not give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who likes electric razors, you will love the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try the Shaving System during a participation in a Braun promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate, HATE shaving.  I have always found the process to be very uncomfortable and irritating to my skin.  Electric razors have always made the problem worse, so I have stuck to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this razor a couple of times in the past 2 weeks and it has made me a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Performance and comfort are VERY good.  It is a close shave and no irritation.  The battery life is great after a short charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a hard case for travel which is tough and I had no fear of damage while on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleaning system which brings me to my only gripe.  The indicator is telling me to clean after each use.  Seems a little bit much, and maybe it will get less sensitive over time.</li>
            <li> So pleased to try this product out from bzzagent. this has left little to no irritation. so simple to install and use. the cooling sensation makes my skim feel clean and refreshed. i have been weary to use electrical razors in the past since my skin is so sensitive. this product has really changed my mind about electric razors. this will be the razor that i will continue to use instead of spending the hundreds of dollars to replace the disposable blades to my current razor. Thanks again bzzagent and way to go Braun for creating a fa-nominal product.</li>
            <li> At first touch I had my reservations when the Braun CoolTec razor was provided to me through a program run by Braun. But within seconds I was amazed as I felt this cooling sensation as I experienced my first shave with this razor. They were not kidding about the cooling feature, it really does get cold and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated at all. After using the razor for a week now I have to say I am pleased, it makes shaving with a electric an option again. My only complaint about this razor is the actual shave, it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as the previous model I&#x27;ve tried, the 7 series. I feel it struggles a bit on getting at the stubble and I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave. I think the razor will be a great quick shave tool, especially since it causes zero irritation. But I will have to stick to a straight razor when I want a truly clean mug.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving, I have crazy sensitive skin. For the most part I let my facial hair grow all week and go to a barber to get a professional shave weekly. This has limited my irritation, but does get expensive and also is time consuming - also add in the fact that my facial hair grows very fast and if I miss the barber  in a given week I look like a Yeti. I had the opportunity to try the  Braun CoolTec via a program that was run by Braun so I figured why not - from the first time I used this shaver I knew it was different - it seriously was cool to the skin the entire shave (which was kind of odd, but not in a bad way) - I completely shaved and no irritation. For the first few times I used it I could not get my entire neck done (a few wisps here and there) but I think that was just my skin adjusting to using an electric, because now it works wonderfully and still with 0 irritation. I have been using this for a month now and I love it</li>
            <li> I got to try the Braun CoolTec shaver as part of a program run by Braun. I have had it for nearly a month and I absolutely love it. It charges quickly, feels great on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It has excellent craftsmanship - extremely easy to hold. The holder and carrying pouch are convenient as well. Aside from the high price tag, I definitely think its an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from BzzAgent. I tried the razor out at first and didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the &amp;#34;cooltec&amp;#34; part of it and seemed disappointed. Later that week, I used my Norelco and realized there was a huge difference between this one and the Braun and how much the cooltec part was working. I didn&#x27;t have any burns. The only downfall to this product is the size of the shaver charging station. It is too bulky to carry in an overnight bag, so if you want to bring on vacation what are you supposed to do? Other then that, its been a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec shaving system through an offer from Braun.  I have not used an electric razor in over 15 years.  It was always to much hassle to clean the razor and always left my skin irritated.  After using the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System I will be using it for a long time.  The new cooling sensation leaves my skin without the irritation that other razors leave behind.  I get an extremely close shave without the redness.  It also comes with a cleaning base that cleans and lubricates the razor.  I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Typically, I shave my face every single day.  I&#x27;ve grown up using electric shavers, so I was excited to give this shaver a chance!  After all, this was the first shaver that I had with the cooling technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shaver for the first time, I was slightly disappointed.  This shaver just didn&#x27;t &#x27;feel right&#x27; to me and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  It seemed to take much longer for a typical shave, but was this because this was just a new shaver that I wasn&#x27;t used to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck with this shaver and kept shaving with it four a month.  Unfortunately, things did not get better.  I eventually reverted back to my old shaver and I&#x27;m sticking with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The cooling technology is fairly nice.  My skin was not irritated during the entire month I used this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I never felt like I had a close shave.  I felt that other electric razors get closer to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I was shaving, I felt like I was shaving for an extra 5-7 minutes over my other electric shaver.  This just took too long.&lt;br /&gt;I could only get in 5-6 shaves in before I had to recharge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I feel like there are other shavers out there that are better performing, that you could actually get for cheaper.</li>
            <li> My electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun so I was able to test this shaver.  While the razor is great and also gives a great clean and close shave, I do not feel that the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; aspect is needed.  I really would like the razor to be warm as to open and relax my hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - very close shave, cleaning of the blades between shave, the cleaner provides a great smell after you shave.  The hold of the razor is nice as well.  It hasn&#x27;t slipped out of my hand at all during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - takes up a lot of counter space with the cleaning station and accessories, cleaning process is really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was happy I was able to test the shaver and would give it as a gift to other members of my family.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for the holidays! He loved it. I would recommend it for all your electric shaver users. Great product.</li>
            <li> This one works so good and cleans so easy, no face burn or discomfort great item a must have. I recommend it to everyone who prev didn&#x27;t like this type of razor</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a program from Braun and boy am I glad I did!  This razor is spectacular.  It gives me a great COMFORTABLE close shave.  I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of electric razors since I have a thick, coarse beard.  This razor is great.  It&#x27;s comfortable to use and the self cleaning is great.  The travel charge kit is also very nice since I travel a lot for work and like to keep my neck properly groomed.  Buy this razor.  You won&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this razor because after using the razor you just empty the stubbles from the cartridge and plug it into the base,  The razor is then cleaned and lubricated. The docking station lets you know when it is charged and that it is in the cleaning process.  The refills for the cleaning feature come three to a pack and are easy to switch out with the old cartridge.  I was very happy with the non-irritating close shave and the even shave that this razor delivered.  I love the case and the ease of use.  This razor would make a great gift for someone else or for yourself. This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun in which I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li> This product has some &#x27;cool&#x27; hi-tech features providing a comfortable shave.  The cooling bar in the middle made my face feel extra nice but when compared with other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past, I don&#x27;t feel that it shaved close enough.  Also seemed to take a long time to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a wonderful shaving experience as the cooling gel helped mitigate some of the razor burn that is often associated with electric razors. My only critique would be that it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great if you have already trimmed your beard down to a \\&quot;1\\&quot; or lower. If you are doing some heavy \\&quot;hedging\\&quot; of facial hairs I would recommend taking a different product and then using this one. Overall it is great for what it is, but I would love to have something that can really cut some long hairs AND give me a smooth shave in one.</li>
            <li> Can I tell it broke THREE times for the SAME problem! ! !&lt;br /&gt;I used it according to the manual. But after a while the switch on/off button will malfunction. Red light was blinking instead of the normal green light. And the machine will not stop while pressing the button. Which means that the machine keep working and giving noisy until the battery run out!&lt;br /&gt;Although P&amp;G provide a change service, it takes 1-2 weeks before they give me a new (I doubt) body.&lt;br /&gt;Complete disappointed and will never purchase Braun any more.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who typically doesn&#x27;t use an electric shaver as past experiences have caused me to cover what the razor missed with my straight razor. This shaving system broke the mold and also left my face feeling cool after the shave which I really liked. The small charging station is also great and it was ready within an hour of opening the package. The cleaning dock is a bit bulky so I doubt I&#x27;ll keep it on the limited counter space I have but it works great. I would recommend this product and am now a believe in electric shaving systems!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son who has been using his father&#x27;s for years and was so excited to finally have his own.  The thing doesn&#x27;t work!  It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do because all the paperwork/receipt/warranty was thrown out in the Christmas mess.  Is there any way I could send this one back and get a new one?  My son loves the way his father&#x27;s works.  Q: this one was designed for sensitive skin where my husbands is not.  Could that be why it&#x27;s not shaving close or really at all?</li>
            <li> Despite good reviews, the shave isn&#x27;t clean. Philips shavers give a closer shave. So this is a disappointment for me. I will go back to Philips.</li>
            <li> Love the cool tech thing how ever the shave could be better.  Its harder to get all the hair compared to my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Christmas for my husband.  He asked for it, and loves it.</li>
            <li> Just received the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program Braun was running.  I&#x27;ve shaved with it for a week now and for the most part I like it, with a few quibbles over the function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to mention is the &amp;#34;cooling bar&amp;#34;.  When I first heard about it I thought &amp;#34;this is going to be a useless gimmick&amp;#34;...but it&#x27;s actually a nice (unique) feature.  After you switch on the shaver it takes a few seconds for the coldness to power up.  Once it&#x27;s cold, it feels a bit like a cold piece of silverware...throw a butter knife in the fridge overnight and then rub the handle on your face...I think that&#x27;s exactly the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, the coldness does affect your shave.  It numbs the face a tiny bit and seems to improve the overall &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; of the shaver over the &amp;#34;easy parts&amp;#34; of your face.  Cheeks, the broad strokes of your neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an electric guy...and it takes your face a week or more to get used to an electric razor...but after that breaking in period the results are almost as close as a blade.  You&#x27;ll never get entirely as close....but the trade off is convenience in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the cooling strip is novel and pretty cool (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues with this razor are about the shave over the trickier parts of my face.  upper lip, the jawline, etc.  I just can&#x27;t seem to get as good coverage with this razor as I have been able to with other products (most recently a Philipps/Norelco Senso Touch).  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shave is still good-- just not AS good, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this ends up being a 4 star product for me.  I like it....I think the cooling bar is not just a gimmick...it actually works.  The question is whether I will continue using it...and deal with a slightly more difficult shave.... because of the cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after a month and let you know.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a couple of days now and overall am pleased with the way it performs. This electric shaver was provided to me at no cost via a program run by Braun. Here are some of the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology is amazing in this thing as far as the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; element. It really does stay cool. Such a different experience and I&#x27;m sure my skin is thanking me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docking station is great. I love keeping the unit clean, and the alcohol does a better job at killing the bacteria which is a plus as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price, it gives a good shave. I would recommend it to those who do not have to suffer with thicker hairs that lay flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this shaver missed some of the hairs that my other shaver would typically get. It&#x27;s almost like it would fail to pick up those that lay flatter to the face.</li>
            <li> I received my shaver through a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;This is without a doubt, the most awesome shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I got the closest shave ever and my skin was calm and not irritated afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The clean and charge station was phenomenal! It charges fast and to know that my shaver is cleaner than it would be with a regular water rinse,well it is hygienically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect gift holiday season if you want to really impress someone.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it will be appreciated and NOT returned or re-gifted!&lt;br /&gt;Braun has outdone itself with this shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;If I could have give it 100 stars, I would do so with hesitation.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the cool tech idea would work, but it makes the shave very comfortable.It does feel cool, and eliminates the need for shaving cream.  I am able to achieve a close shave without irritating  myself.  It also feels good in my hand, ergonomically speaking. The charge is very long - lasting. I left it off the charger for 2 days and it still worked. For those of you who enjoy shaving in the shower, it is nice to have that feature. Certainly saves some time. I thank Bzz agent and Braun for giving me a chance to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;Angelo</li>
            <li> Shaving is a hassle and I have never met anyone that enjoys it. I own a Braun 9595 electric shaver and I love it. I have had it for many years and it has been great. When Braun asked me to participate in a trial of a new razor, I was excited because of the experience I have had with my previous razor. They told me I was receiving a CoolTec razor that kept my face cool during shaving. I didn&#x27;t know that my face was hot and the feeling of an electric shaver was better than trying not to cut my face with traditional razors.&lt;br /&gt;I received my CoolTec razor and read about it. I let the cooling bar cool off before I started to shave. I was amazed by how if felt on my face. It originally felt like the razor was wet and water was dripping on my face keeping it cool. I wiped my face with my hand and no water was there. I kept shaving and my face stayed cool. It was awesome. Like I said in my title, I didn&#x27;t know that I needed this until after I tried it and now I love it. I tried my old razor the next day just to see the difference and I could really tell how hot my face got during shaving. What a great idea. I even shaved with my CoolTec on my days off and I don&#x27;t think I have ever done that.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have about the razor is that with the cooling bar in the middle, the 2 blades are pretty far apart and the head is quite larger than my 9595. When I was shaving my upper lip, I was only using the top blade which took a little longer than with my previous razor. I like the fact that it is a quieter razor than my 9595, I only wish the head was smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Great invention Braun, you kept me as a customer.</li>
            <li> i got the Braun Cool Tec from a program being ran by Braun, and I have to say it is amazing.  I was totally against electric shavers until now.  I always used just a razor and shaving cream until I was able to try this.  Because of the technology of the blades, it cuts from different directions at one time and this eleminates the feeling of my facial hair being pulled.  Also, due to the coolig head that is ceramic it gives you a nice cool feeling while you are shaving and this prevents skin irritation, and trust me I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all!  Another nice feature is you do not have to use the cooling technology if you chose not to. It has its own cleaning station which makes me feel more comfortable about the sanitation of this shaver. This is a major plus in my book.  Another plus is that it can be charged in the big base or if you are limited on counter spaceit will charge in a small cradle and it charges fast and holds it charge for a few times use.  Because of this system I am a believer again in electric shaving.  It does have attachments that allows you to trim sideburns and I used it on my mustache also.  It comes with everything you need and it also comes with a nice HARD case for if you are traveling with it to keep it sage or just to store it in.  I would definately recommend this to anyone who is in the market to purchase a new shaver!  I am a believer again!!!</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of the electric shaver because it has always irritated my skin and always took so long to get used to. However, I received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun, and it has been absolutely amazing. The first shave was wonderful, it shaved close and smooth the first time without any irritation at all. The cooling mechanism is amazing, what a brilliant idea to cool the skin during the shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean and charge station is great! Just stash it away to charge, press the button to clean and it&#x27;s ready to go for you the next day. Cleaning works wonderful and is much easier than manually cleaning it. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;set it and forget it&amp;#34; concept. Absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only area for improvement is that it takes quite a long time for the cleaning solution to dry from the shaving head. Which isn&#x27;t really a big deal since I only shave once a day. But for those that frequently shave, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use the self cleaning station often.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun CoolTec for about a week and a half so far and it is certainly the most &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; electric I have tried. I have not been a big fan of electric shavers in the past, but I was given the opportunity to try the CoolTec as part of a program run by Braun, so I jumped at the chance to give it a shot. That being said, there definitely some clear pros and cons that I&#x27;ll outline for you below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very easy to use.  Easy setup.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Comfortable shave - I have used other electric brands in the past that have caused significant skin irritation (breakouts) and I am not exepriencing any discomfort with the CoolTec&lt;br /&gt;3.  I LOVE the cooling bar.  It&#x27;s an instant burst of coolness that feels so great against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great for use in the shower.  I like to shave at the end of my shower giving my beard time to steam and soften.  The fact that the CoolTec is water resistant is great.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Easy to clean.  I love that the blade/foil unit pops right off the top making it super easy to clean.  And can be rinsed under a stream of hot water.  Also - the cleaning basin is great and easy to operate while the unit is in it&#x27;s charging station.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Great travel case.  Took on a weekend trip to vegas and the power lasted 3 days with no problem and the case was perfect to just throw in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Confusing instructions.  The instructions provided with the unit were a little confusing and unclear.  It referenced parts that weren&#x27;t included in my particular model which made me initially think that there was something missing.  Once I had it all set up; however, it was pretty clear and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Not as close as a blade.  I would say I have a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; level of beard growth.  I would shave every other day with a blade with out looking too scruffy.  Using the CoolTec, I really have to shave every day as if I wait a day or two inbetween, the shaver has some difficulty getting a really close shave.  If you are daily habitual shaver, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you.  I did go 4 days once without shaving, and this unit couldn&#x27;t handle the growth and I had to revert back to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec as it provided a very comfortable shave which is the number 1 priority for me when it comes to electric units.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about razors is never the heat of the razor, its that i don&#x27;t really save any time or get any closer than a manual razor and shaving cream can offer. The cooling bar felt nice, minimized burn etc. When i received this shaver from braun through a special program i wasn&#x27;t expecting much. It may be to early to tell if this will change my habits, but I am going to give it another 3-4 weeks and see how it goes. If you like electric shavers give it a try, its better than rotary blades that&#x27;s for sure...</li>
            <li> After using the Braun Cooltec for almost a month now, i and thoroughly enjoying this product. This was given to me through a program that was run by Braun as a trial to test and review personally. inside the box was everything i expected such as the razor and the charging/automatic cleaning station.. With this new shaver, i don&#x27;t have the problem of razor burn or the feeling of hairs being pulled out of my face at all. It felt as though i was putting in little to no effort for a nice quick and painless even shave. The cooling bar is an awesome feature on the shaver. It wasn&#x27;t as cooling as i expected but if for sure was noticeable. Everything about this shaver is great. the cooling bar, the handle itself is easy to hold and maneuver around your face. the automatic cleaner works wonders and always keeps the blades nice and clear from hair and skin. i would highly recommend giving this a try for anyone looking to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I am definitely happy with the Braun CoolTec System, I received it in a program run by Braun.  I was quite interested in how the system would work when I first heard about it and was excited to start using it.  The cooling bar cools almost instantly, no need to wait, and absolutely reduced the irritation.  My neck has always been a problem no matter what way I try to shave with, and always requires numerous passes which typically irritates my skin.  The CoolTec system definitely helped to reduce that irritation, considerably!  It does not seem to get quite as close as my other rotary shaver but the difference is minimal, and for day to day shaves, the reduced irritation is preferred over the closeness difference.  I plan to enjoy the new CoolTec razer for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun electric shaver kit through a program that Braun was running.  I was very excited when I saw the new &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34; technology offered with this shaver.  I&#x27;m a long time Braun shaver owner and enjoy their products and the features that are offered, but this by far was the most exciting.  I&#x27;m one of those guys that like electric shavers but even with Braun the shaver head gets warm and sometimes a little hot and causes some skin redness and sensitivity.  When I finally received my shaver I plugged it right up to charge and put everything together.  I thought that the little travel shaver stand was a neat idea along with the very sturdy case for your shaver.  Once I began using the shaver I was immediately thrilled about the CoolTec system that keeps the head of the shaver very cool for the entire shave, keeping my skin cool and un-irritated.  I have used my shaver several times now, and am excited every time I need to shave now.  However, there was just one thing about the kit that I was a little disappointed with and that was the charging/cleaning station.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to just slide in and fit snugly in the station, it seems as though you need to manipulate it a bit to make sure that the prongs on the back of the shaver are touching the connectors on the station and then you can push the cleaning button, I also noticed that bumping the counter also causes the shaver to be jarred off the connectors, stopping the cleaning process then you have to reconnect and start again.  The previous Braun shaver I had, the shaver slid further down into the station and it was snug and lights automatically came on, even with an indicator of how dirty the shaver was so it knew the intensity to clean at.  The new CoolTec shaver does offer a small light on the shaver that indicates when it needs cleaning.  All in all I really do like the new Braun CoolTec shaving system, with having lots of experience with electric shavers w/stations I can work aroundminor things, but I thoroughly enjoy the cooling affect of the shaver during shaving and will definitely enjoy using this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try my new Braun CoolTec electric shaver which was provided via a program run by Braun, and was not disappointed. It was very smooth and kept my face cool with the CoolTec system throughout the shave. I was not itchy or irritated during or after the shaving process. The razor is solid, but flexible at the same time to give a smooth shave that gets every aspect of the face. It did a much better job of close shaving if used every day but did have a tough time (as expected) with dealing with a weeks worth of scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like knowing my shaver is clean before each use so the Clean&amp;Charge Station was something I was really impressed with and I have not seen before.</li>
            <li> I had serious disappointment after my first shave with the Braun CoolTec System, which was provided by a program run by Braun.  My facial hair grows quickly and I got pulling from the razor and did not get a close shave at all, even after trying multiple angles and doing a pre-trim.  I decided to give it a second try with much less facial hair.  While there were no pulls from the razor this time, I still didn&#x27;t get the close shave I was hoping for with the CoolTec System.  I do love the aluminum cooling bar and the sensation it provides.  My skin showed no irritation after the shave and had a very smooth feeling, even with some pesky stubble remaining.  Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Braun CoolTec System to anyone I know unless they don&#x27;t grow much facial hair or if they shave daily.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my sexy mustache for movember but I had to shaved it off because of a wedding I will be attending this weekend. I decided to play it safe and try out the electric shaver that I got from Braun yesterday. I normally just use a razor but that I wanted to try something different. Anyway, the shaver was easy to use and gave a clean quick shave. I have been always told that the best time to shave is after a hot shower because that&#x27;s when the pores are opened; considering that, I was somewhat fearful of how my face will react to the cooltec system. Yes, the cool metal felt refreshing on my face during shaving but still I&#x27;m not sure if my sensitive skin would react positively to it. I guess time will tell. It&#x27;s the first day after the shave and so far so good. No irritations. Hopefully, it stays that way.</li>
            <li> The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System took a few shaves to get in the groove of it. I&#x27;ve used a triple head Phillips electric razor for many years so thr Braun setup was new to me. I must say once I got the routine down and added in the cooling bar effect, it was a solid shave. Best ever maybe. Extremely well made piece of equipment. Feels perfect in your hand as you shave. Great close shave that really hits the mark.&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the cake is the cooling bar. At the touch of a button you can activate the cooling feature. And it really works. I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation during shaving. It really just helps to make the whole shaving experience more satisfying. Think about it, you are generating mondo heat throughout the shaving process that typically has nowhere to go but into the air and into your brain. Instead through conduction you get an easier more efficient way to remove the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Your face will love you for it.</li>
            <li> When I first received this Braun cooltec electric razor via a program run by Braun, I was sporting a good mountain man sized beard. Upon receiving the shaving system I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect, and I was rather reluctant to try the cooling bar because I live in a cold climate where the last thing I want to do in the morning is get hit with the cold, but I have to say it definitely surprised me. The bar is cool to the skin, but not enough to make it feel unpleasant, it cools the skin as it shaves it and gives it a nice relaxing feeling to wake you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself glides across the skin rather well, I didn&#x27;t have it getting hung up on anything or tugging on loose hairs, my only issue with the razor itself (and the reason I gave it four stars) was because it takes a while to get the longer hairs without using the long hair trimmer, and even the stubble may take two or three passes to completely get down. That being said, when I do get the stubble down it&#x27;s incredibly smooth, even better than a manual razor. The instructions for the razor took a little while to understand, but after figuring out each individual piece maneuvering the system is simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to cleaning though, this razer makes it a breeze, there&#x27;s a simple way to clean the top, by running water on it, a deeper clean by simply pulling off the top and cleaning inside, or the third which is the easiest. Simply put the razor into the cleaning/charging station and it automatically cleans it with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from a program run by Braun. I was super excited about it and really wanted to love it. In the end it just doesn&#x27;t give a good enough cut to be a daily shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cooling sensation is a neat feature, although its only on a limited surface area&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is amazing, really does make it like a new shaver&lt;br /&gt;Quality feel of the entire system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Not a close cut. Takes many passes to get a patch done, many more to make it smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 star review is based on the cut. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a quality shaver with a neat cooling action and closeness of cut isn&#x27;t critical then I can&#x27;t think of something better.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cooltec shaver through a program run by Braun. It came nicely packaged with the instructions right on top. However, the many pieces and lack of instructions took way too long to decipher. Eventually, I was able to get the cleaning station setup and I think it correct. The shaver cuts very nice and closer than my older rotating electric shaver. The cool bar in the Braun gives a nice cold sensation which seems to help reduce irritation. Its a nice change in design which gives me another option while shaving. Its easy to turn the cool bar on and off with no problems. Overall, I am very satisfied with the Cooltec shaver and will be continuing to use it as my new primary electric shaver. Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different electric razors but would always get razor burn. When I first tried this razor I was amazed how fast it became cool. The razor also keeps a good charge. I know I will be using this razor more then straight blade because I belie that it will be cheaper in the long run. I would recommend this one if you are looking to get a electric razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program Braun was running.  But I would definitely buy it on my own.  I have an older Braun 7000 series and I tested both on one side of my face.  The cold really made a difference.  The 7000 side was all red and the CoolTec was a cool pink and no redness at all.  I also love the cleaning solution.  It make such a difference.  I have travelled with the CoolTec and miss the fact that I don&#x27;t have a fresh razor in the morning.  I love it.  I only gave it a 4 because I thought the foil on the 7000 series cut a little better on my skin.  The Cooltec left some random hairs.</li>
            <li> When I got the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System in the mail I was very excited to see how great it was going to work. I was quickly disappointed. It could not/ did not shave anything past a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow. The small side cutter worked very well though. For the price it cost, I still would still to the generic razors who can give me a close shave regardless of how much growth I have had.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System from a program run by Braun. For a razor, the Braun CoolTec is quite fun to play with, when you consider all of its features. As far as being an actual shaver goes, though, it was incredibly disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was easy to setup, as the instructions explained the process reasonably well. The cooling bar feels nice against your face, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much by way of keeping my face from being irritated. I had a light beard at the time of shaving, which should be easily taken care of by a razor such as this one. Unfortunately, it just would not cut my hair at all. I tried every which way I could think of to get the razor to cut my beard, but, I just could not get it to shave it down at all. Fortunately the little trimmer on the back of the razor worked to trim my beard down a little bit. Sadly, it did not trim my sideburns down at all (to keep them neat), and I had to go back to my old razor to finish them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trimming down my beard, I tried using the head of the razor again to trim my face. This time, it worked, and it cut the hair down. Cutting to the chase though, it did a pretty poor job, and I was very disappointed. I spent a VERY long time, once again trying shaving every which way I could think of (within reason), including dry (recommended in the manual), wet, up-strokes, down-strokes, sideways-strokes, etc., but I just could not get a good, even shave. I also noticed that the razor was a bit rough, as I cut my face a little, which really never happens to me while shaving, regardless of whether I use an electric razor or a manual razor. As I stated before, the cooling feature was neat, but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me other than feel good in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station was interesting, and I trust that it cleaned the head of the razor well since it uses an alcohol based solution for three minutes of cleansing. I was disappointed that the trimmer part could not also be cleaned, as that was the part of the razor that I probably got the most use out of, and was therefore the &amp;#34;dirtiest,&amp;#34; but there is no actual physical way for the cleaning station to clean the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the manual, it mentions shaving every day when it talks about replacing parts. I would probably say that this razor best suits somebody who shaves every single day, as it seemed to struggle to do anything to even a light beard, and could not evenly trim very short hair. This razor should be, first and foremost, a device for shaving and, though the technology built into it (and around it, if you consider the cleaning station) is nice, it does not and cannot make up for its lack of a good shave for me personally.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as part of a Braun marketing program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in what I would call superior packaging and build quality. The charging station was better than expected and everything about this product screams &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the cool feature I will say that it worked well and kept my skin free from irritation - a problem I&#x27;ve had on many shavers before this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was perfect, except how close it could get. At times this shaver struggled at shaving even longer hairs. Overall, it&#x27;s just ok but might be good for someone with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Let me begin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues with every electric razor I ever owned(irritation,razor burn,ineffectiveness). Whether, if I purchased it myself or if it was a gift. I told myself I would never buy one again.However, through a promotion by Braun, I had the opportunity to try the CoolTec out. This razor did not disappoint. First, its cooling effect is simply incredible, feels great and refreshing on the skin.Second,no irritation or razor burn.Third,nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, not only did this razor surpass my every expectation, it looks and feels great as well. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shave via a promotional program run by Braun.  I was very excited to receive this shaver and my Bruan 7526 Syncro was about 8 years old and in need of replacement.  As I&#x27;d had that shaver so long I have been a big fan of Braun and had high expectations.  Sadly I have been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the cooling feature is nice - really better than the gimmicky feature it sounds like - I just don&#x27;t get a very close shave. The cooling bar separates the two screens, making the shaver unusually wide, and no as flexible when contouring to your face.  This is especially problematic on my neck, always requiring a pass with a Gillette blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the sideburn/beard trimmer is much narrower than previous models and I find it borderline useless for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the cooling feature, but disappointed by the shave.  I would try another Braun shaver, but would not recommend this one.  Frankly, I&#x27;m thinking about pulling the old model out of the drawer...</li>
            <li> I purchased a very expensive norelco from macys a few years back and it was by far the worst my face has ever broken out after use. I received the cool tec razor a few weeks back from a program run by braun and I just have to say this is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased. My skin is very sensetive and the cool technology really works!</li>
            <li> I got this from Shaver to try from a place that Braun set up. I was very excited to try it because this is my first electric shaver and I always get razor burn when I shave so the cooling bar was right up my alley. When I tried it the first time the cooling bar worked well but blades kept pulling my hair out. So I cleaned it and tried again a couple days later it still pulled the hair out. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $200.00 on it or I&#x27;d be very angry!</li>
            <li> I got the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System for free from a program run by Braun. I was very excited to try this and intrigued by the cool technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good. I do like the cooling feeling. It certainly isn&#x27;t necessary but it is nice. I did always get irritated on my face and especially neck, and this seems to cut down on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decent: the long hair trimmer leaves something to be desired. It&#x27;s not as powerful as my other razor and I find the need to use that to get those stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really enjoy this razor and am glad I have had the chance to use it!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest electric razor I have ever used! It provides a close shave without the razor burn and leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed! It is easy to clean, simple to use, and the zipper case, makes traveling easier as well. It is not a bulky razor and all you need for travel is the razor in its case and the small docking station for charging. The price can&#x27;t be beat for a razor system this wonderful!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This razor I was given from Braun is a great idea. The CoolTec technology on the razor feels great on my face and neck. It helps with the sensitive skin that I have. I have a beard and don&#x27;t shave that often. The cooling sensation on my face makes up for the lack of shaving cream. The cleaning station is also wonderful. It makes cleaning the razor a snap. Though I&#x27;m not a fan of having to buy replacement cleaner. The small trimmer on the back of the unit is also a great feature, it helps when I need a quick trim. Now what I don&#x27;t really care for out weighs all the good I just described. First, the shaving performance itself is not that great. I don&#x27;t have that much to shave since I grow a beard, so I would expect it not to take that long to shave my face. It seems not to catch a lot of hair with a few passes. I need to keep going over the same spot for quite a while. The longer hairs also don&#x27;t get cut well. I end up having to break out the ol&#x27; classic to get the rest. Then there is the cleaning light. The first time I used the razor I shaved a small amount of hair and the clean light went off. This made me a bit upset. Either this is a flaw in some or it doesn&#x27;t actually have anything to tell when it needs to be cleaned. It just beeps and blinks after every shave. All in all I would recommend this to someone who shaves on a regular basis with skin sensitivity. It seems to work much better when the hair is shorter and better maintained. Sometimes I go weeks without shaving. For myself and my beard, it will most likely end up under the sink like the rest of them. Or maybe Ill pass it off to someone who will use it. If they can handle the fact that I used it. Though that is where the cleaning feature will really come in handy.</li>
            <li> First off, I need to mention I was provided this electric CoolTec shaver as part of a program run by Braun and I&#x27;m not typically an electric shaver type of person.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;ve tried them in the past, and I love the mobility of them but for some reason I usually drift back towards a normal razor.  I&#x27;m also a fan of Braun and most of their products so I was very eager to try this unit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I had mixed results from this shaver.  I really wanted this to work which is why I think I&#x27;m more frustrated with myself then this product.  I tried using it on back to back days and also with a few days in between but it really made no difference.  While the cool technology is a nice gimick, it isn&#x27;t enough to make up for some of the other drawbacks of this shaver.  I&#x27;ll break down the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s and let you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean -&lt;br /&gt;Nice charging system&lt;br /&gt;Ability to shave on the go&lt;br /&gt;Auto self cleaning system - Nice an easy to use with the push of a button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Took long time to get a true close shave - had to go over some areas 15-20 times just to try to get a smooth shave (mostly on the neckline&lt;br /&gt;Left some random hairs - Even after 20 minutes of shaving I still had some long hairs that just didn&#x27;t want to be clipped no matter how many times I went back and forth over them&lt;br /&gt;Some irritation - because I had to go over areas multiple times it made my neck red in some areas after shaving&lt;br /&gt;Can be messy - I tried shaving in the car one day on the way to work and some of the little hairs ended up on my shirt instead of inside the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Self-Cleaner is loud - You don&#x27;t have to use it too often so not that big a deal but worth mentioning nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall the product does serve it&#x27;s purpose but I honestly think their might be better options out there available.</li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;ve always just used a manual razor. I never really asked myself why that was my go to option but I guess it was just always the cheapest and easiest solution. I have tried electric razors in the past but to be honest I never saw a big enough difference to convert to an electric. So when I had the opportunity to try out the CoolTec I figured I would give it one more go and see if an electric razor would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give a little more background, my skin is pretty sensitive so with the manual I always suffered from those bumps due to irritation from the shave (especially when its been a while since I&#x27;ve changed the blade). However when I gave the CoolTec a try I started to realize that the bumps weren&#x27;t just a necessary byproduct of a clean shave. The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; definitely helps cut down on the irritation and definitely make shaving a less irritating experience. I would give the product 5 stars but part of me is still beholden to the ease and portability of the manual but I can honestly say this electric shaver is more than just a gimic.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec electric shaver through a program run by Braun. I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really love the idea of electric shavers but have NEVER found one that actually gives me a quality shave. I don&#x27;t know if it is the shape of my face and neck or what but I am always left with irritated skin and a bad shave. I thought I would give this Braun CoolTec a try because of the cooling system but unfortunately, I am left with the same opinion of electric shavers as I had before. It just doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave at all. I will say that the cooling system does work and my neck was not irritated like had been with our electric shavers so there is that but I certainly would not be happy paying well over $100 for a shaver that doesn&#x27;t execute its job. Back to the drawing board for Braun in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get one of these bad boys from a promotion Braun was running. Right out of the box this thing looks sleek, I have another Braun shaver that is a few years old and they have come along way with aesthetic design, especially in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was skeptical on how it would feel to shave with a cold metal element pressing against my face I was pleasantly surprised. It feels pretty darn great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the shave just doesnt match up to the nice cool feeling. The cold element might have created a space too wide between the shaver heads to get a good shave. Even after numerous passes there were still hairs all over the place. The side burn trimmer is also of the small and not very powerful variety which I see often in newer razors, however, my older Braun model has a great powerful one, would love to see that incorporated here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the technology is definitely something to investigate but I think the execution needs some tweaks.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, I have been looking for a great electric razor.  (I have been through several) Very glad to have the opportunity to try this great razor.  Its the best one I have tried yet.  My skin is not irritated and the razor does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I got this because I had tried electric razors in the past and have never found one that offered a close shave and didn&#x27;t end up ripping my whiskers out after only a month of use because the blades were already dull and they were a hassle to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the CoolTec System through a program Braun was running and it blew me away.  I got a close comfortable shave and the cooling strip really works and feels great.  It&#x27;s nice because its cordless, so you can use it in the shower, it&#x27;s rechargeable, so you don&#x27;t need batteries and the best part is the self cleaning base.  You don&#x27;t have to clean it with a brush. I have only been using it for a couple of months so i don&#x27;t know how long the blades last, but so far its working as good as its first shave.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I used the Braun 7 series shaving system before I received  the Braun CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use I think the Braun CoolTec is a nice feel with the cooling but takes a little longer to get the job done because the Series 7 has a faster motor than the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;Both the CoolTec and Series 7 have cleaning bases but the CoolTec base is a little bit bigger than Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;and The CoolTec Shaving unit design looks plastic and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;This  CoolTec is a O.K unit but I&#x27;m not sure it is a good replacement for my older Braun 7 series.&lt;br /&gt;The price component is a big differentiation for many, with almost a $100 difference between the two razors but I prefer the Braun 7 series than the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have gotten with an electric razor. I was left with no skin irritation. Razor charges very fast. The cooling technology is amazing.</li>
            <li> Buying electric shavers is a lot like buying car tires. Some give you great traction, some give you great fuel mileage, hardly any will give you both. I have been using Braun&#x27;s top shaver&#x27;s from the Activator to the Series 7. My Series 7 gives me the closest shave, is light, feels good in my hand, and is highly maneuverable. However for someone with Rosacea I will gladly trade off the heat and irritation that come with the Series 7&#x27;s close shave for the CoolTec&#x27;s cool bar shave. Prior to the CoolTec the Series 7 was the least irritating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the CoolTec for a week now. Somehow I am able to shave quicker and that cooling bar feels as good on my face as when a barber puts hot shaving cream on my neck. If you have rosacea you will understand the need to keep your face cool. Yes the CoolTec is bulkier and heavier but for me this is the best shaver. I am a tech gadget geek. The technology geek snob in me wants the top of the line series 7 shaver. But overall I benefit so much from the cooling of the CoolTec that this is my new everyday shaver. The CoolTec keeps my face cool and calm. I turn on the shaver and wait like 3-5 seconds for it to get cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 years ago my face became so sensitive I had to stop using a razor and shave gel so for me I am not trying to get a baby&#x27;s butt smooth shave on my face to replace my razor. I can only use electric shavers. Ideally Braun will figure out a way to get this CoolTec technology into their top Series 7 shaver as an optional model.  Like tires for a car you just have to find the one that works for you. One guy will think tires are too bumpy while another praises the same model for ride comfort.</li>
            <li> I thought this shaver might be just gimmicky, but, was pleasantly surprised. It took a little longer than my Braun seven series shaver and in the end seemed to have a little closer shave and a much more pleasant experience during the actual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two draw backs were this was a refurbished item, not indicated . The second was to charge it without the cleaning station you must use a &amp;#34;charging clip&amp;#34; which is one more thing to bring along when traveling. The Seven series can plug right into it&#x27;s cord. I will be saving it for traveling. That said, I think this was the best shave I&#x27;ve received from an electric right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was skeptical at first that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use any gel or shaving cream with this razor. I have now used it three times and I&#x27;m amazed by this product. I don&#x27;t fully understand how it works, but the cooling effect is extremely effective. I have been using a cheaper electric razor for the past year that requires a lot of lotion or aftershave after use and leaves me with red marks on my face and a lot of burning. The Braun Cool Tec feels great to use and leaves my face feeling cool and comfortable after each use. Also, I&#x27;m very impressed by how close the shave is for an electric razor because it&#x27;s almost as close as an actual razor! I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a quality electric razor that&#x27;s easy to use, extremely effective, and effortless to clean.</li>
            <li> I recently started using electric shavers and this is the second one I have used. The first one was a Norelco and it was horrible. Caused a lot of irritation. I hated it. Stopped using it after 2 tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been exactly opposite. The shave is smooth and close. The shaver is easy to use. The Cool Tec feature is good. I have used it on a couple of occasions. The shaver does feel super cool once the feature is turned on. The like the ability of turning the feature off if you do not need it. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because it is difficult to get a close shave on the neck. It is possible but requires additional time compared the time it takes to shave the facial hair. All in all it gives a close shave with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting one.</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me and I&#x27;m a glutton for new-tech...  We&#x27;ll start there.. The two blades contour nicely to my face without much effort, the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice if you&#x27;re in a hot shower, and the handle fits easily in my hand and has enough weight to feel a little luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I thought going electric would save me time, however considering the amount of time I have to put into shaving my neck, I don&#x27;t think I gained anything in the speed department. In addition, while I can shave in the shower (which may help save time), I would have to install a non-fog mirror to assist me at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works well, and leaves a scent of alcohol on the razor.. I kind of like that so no complaints. Just smells very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: I&#x27;d give this 4 Stars. It&#x27;s close, my girlfriend believes it&#x27;s actually closer than my manual razor (I&#x27;m not totally sold on that, but I look clean shaven afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not setting any new speed records, I gave this product 4 stars.  I wasn&#x27;t very fast when I first started using a manual razor, so I&#x27;m going to give this one the benefit of the doubt that I will get more efficient in how I manage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product! Deliver fast.</li>
            <li> I had the series 7 before and it was much better. The cooltec does not get as close of a shave, the trimmer is in a odd position, and the while it does cool I do not feel it&#x27;s worth it. Just a cool gimmick trying to make a sell. I&#x27;m sending back under the 60 day money back guarantee and will be ordering a new Series 7.</li>
            <li> Last year I got a [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250X SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System]] and really love it. I had my doubts that this Cool Tec could dethrone Norelco&#x27;s nifty 3D blades, but the Braun&#x27;s Cool Technology piqued my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, It Really Is Cold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How they did it, is beyond me, but this shaver literally feels cold on my face. Yes, cold. I guess Braun thought the solution to razor burn, was its literal antithesis. And I have to say, I&#x27;m quite impressed. Could you imagine a barber trying to sell you a cold shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Lotions, Potions, or Creams -- Oh My!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but decided to jump in. My sensitive skin definitely deeds something on it while shaving with any other method. Yet somehow, this Cool Tec directly on my face glided across my skin with ease. No burns, no bumps, no more stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 3D Blades vs. Foil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades definitely don&#x27;t hug every contour of my face like Norelco&#x27;s blades do. Yet, it takes far more passes around my face to get the same shave as with Cool Tec. Something about the cooling technology just works better, plain and simple. Probably it&#x27;s just the natural tightening of the skin that happens  when it gets cold. Whatever the case, it works. And I&#x27;m happy to omit any shaving aids, since they often just irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my knowledge, Braun was the first to innovate this gimmick. I&#x27;ve had a couple Braun&#x27;s in the past, and the cleaning bases usually were the first thing to croak. This iteration is very similar to Norelco&#x27;s -- sleek, black with a single button.  But I prefer Norelco&#x27;s cleaning solution; it&#x27;s cheaper and seems to be more readily available locally. Not keen on getting roped into Braun&#x27;s world again, in that department, but this Cool technology has got me sold, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck springing for those expensive blue cartridges again. Good thing we got Prime now, since I know I&#x27;ll never find them locally. The base does do a nice job of cleaning though. And for once, Braun&#x27;s cleaning base doesn&#x27;t sound like a Lear Jet is taking off in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it closer than Norelco&#x27;s? No, not really. But it seems to get the job done faster, and with fewer passes. Oh, and it does it with a comfy chill instead of whirring blades that get hotter with each stroke. So I&#x27;d say that all adds up to an edge in Braun&#x27;s favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - I found my new fave shaver ...again. My Norelco still works great, and certainly cost enough. But Braun&#x27;s unique cool technology has me hooked. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for this one over my  Norelco 3D. Just wish I wasn&#x27;t stuck with these blue cleaning cartridges again; especially after swearing them off the last time, for a second time. But the Cool Tec is just ...well ...cool. Happy! ;oDw I&#x27;ll never find them locally. The base does do a nice job of cleaning though. And for once, Braun&#x27;s cleaning base doesn&#x27;t sound like a Lear Jet is taking off in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it closer than Norelco&#x27;s?

            <li> So seriously, this razor is kind of amazing. I just received the razor through a customer review program with Braun and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I&#x27;ve been an electric razor guy forever. I&#x27;ve done the rotary. I&#x27;ve done the foil. I&#x27;ve done the wet/dry. I&#x27;ve pretty much done it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other things - in the past, electric razors don&#x27;t get it done for me. Or at least they haven&#x27;t. I shave with one every morning. Every morning. And then every morning, I shave with a disposable razor after that. The electric doesn&#x27;t get close enough. And it irritates my skin (likely because I need to shave so much). And then came the CoolTec. It&#x27;s different. Really different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the shave was really close. For the first time in years, I haven&#x27;t had to give it a once over with the disposable razor. And really, isn&#x27;t that what we all want anyways - the close shave? Where I&#x27;d go over my face over and over with my Panasonic ES8103S Shaver just to get halfway clean shaven, the CoolTec was probably 1/2 the passes. And the hard to reach spots traditionally like the neck and jawline? The CoolTec seemed to handle that w/ no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the Cool bar thing was really sweet. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it was honestly a very comfortable shave. It felt great and seemed like it was heck of a lot less irritating. The contrast of the hot shower and the nice cold bar made shaving a pleasure. I love the innovation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in need of a new razor as my Panasonic&#x27;s display was a mess and I&#x27;m pretty sure my beard beat the blades into submission. I can say that the CoolTec is an excellent replacement. I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaving system through a program by Braun, and after using the Cooltec, I am extremely glad I was chosen. I have used several different shaving systems in the past, and none have worked as well as the Cooltec. I have very sensitive skin, and cooling bar works better than any other shaver I have used on minimizing the irritation. The cleaning system is easy to use and works very well, I actually let the hair on my head grow out a few days to see if the Cooltec could handle it and to see how well the cleaning system works. The Cooltec shaved my head, no problem at all, and, to my disbelief, the cleaning system cleaned the head spotlessly. I would highly recommend the Cooltec to anyone, especially to men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec is a pretty cool shaver, no pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a big base that includes cleaning solution and that aside from charging the shaver also cleans the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to put together and you&#x27;re quickly ready to start.&lt;br /&gt;The cooling sensation of the shave takes a moment to get used to but once you&#x27;re used to it feels very good, especially because it helped my skin feel less irritated after shaving, which has always been an issue for me with electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue usually is for me that the shaver just leaves a lot of short stubble I am not used to from wet shaving, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Braun shaver.My wife even commented on how nice and soft my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I did receive the shaver through a program by Braun, I will definitely buy it once this one reaches the end of it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun Cooltec Electric shaver as a promo run by Braun and quickly unwrapped it.  I had been waiting for about 5 days from my previous shave; my facial hair was asking for a good shaving.  It took awhile to get all my facial hair in comparison to using a razor.  The Braun Cooltec didn&#x27;t pick up all the facial hair, especially under my lower lip area and neck area under the chin.  I really had to push the shaver into my skin.  That&#x27;s where the cooling bar really helped.  It was really cool and kept my face from feeling the heat of the electric blades.  Felt like an ice cube going along my face.  Shaving every other day with only small amount of facial hair helps with the skin irritation; compared to the first experience where I had a lot of facial hair. The adaptable 3 -stage cutting system and sensoBlade seems to be giving a nice comfortable shave, but doesn&#x27;t pick up all the facial hair in one run.  Have to look a few time and even feel in the area after shaving to see if it is smooth. What was really awesome about this shaver is it comes with a Clean &amp; Charge station.  After use, you can either clean it with warm running water or you can stick it in the cleaning station.  Push the power bottom and it starts cleaning.  Before you use it, you have to open a cartridge that contains or what seems to smell like rubbing alcohol and insert it in.  Really easy.  The cartridge does need to be replaced and there is an indicating light that tells you when it does.  Overall, it is a convenient shaver that does the job, but not as good as a good shave with a razor.  I really like it because of the convenience and you will too.</li>
            <li> I received this razor  via a program run by Braun. Shaving at a cooler temperature makes a big difference. I had never heard of this until I had the opportunity to try the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s shaving system. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to conventional  shaving. Very close shave, no irritation. Nice battery life and travel case. Overall, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> After getting the Braun cooltec razor from a program by Braun, I tried it for the first time and I love it. I have always had irritation from electric razors from the cheap to the very expensive; however, this razor is the first one to not leave my face burning and red. The razor does an pretty good job in producing a close shave, but the biggest plus is the ice cool feeling from the center of the razor that seems to cool the face and stop the red irritation that normally occurs. Like I said before, the razor does an average job on the shaving side, but with the advantage of no irritation, I am switching to this razor for my everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> I appreciate all of the effort that went in to this Braun Cooltec electric shaver, but in the end it still doesn&#x27;t match the close shave of a regular non-electric razor.  This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun, and I appreciate the chance to try it out.  That being said, all of the electric shavers I have tried this is probably one of the best.  I really like the cool sensation when shaving, and the auto-cleaner device is pretty cool to use.  In the end though, after I&#x27;ve used this I look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow just a hour after I shaved.  The regular non-electric razor still wins in the close shave department, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick to non-electric.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun a week ago and it quickly came a part of my daily morning regimen. The cooling bar did scare me as the possibility of a gimmick, but in reality it really is pretty cool. The cooling bar cools off in seconds and feels like a can of soda between the foils, just as advertised. I am a younger guy (in my 20&#x27;s) and do have fairly sensitive skin so the cooling bar definitely got my attention. The main thing that I notice is less itching and redness immediately following my shave. My previous shaver left my skin feeling much more irritated. I do still use after Dove after shave balm every time I shave, haven&#x27;t worked up the courage yet to trust just the cooling bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the shaver itself is above par. I get a nice close shave on my face, but i struggle with getting a good close shave on my jawline and neck area. The shaver works best held at a good 90 degree angle and that took some getting used to. The first thing that I noticed about the shaver is its grip, it has a very ergonomic solid feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system comes with a travel charger and a travel case. The case is very solid and dependable but I do wish that it came with a way to hold the travel charger, it is a little hassle keeping them together while traveling. The battery does not have a very large capacity so if traveling for more than a couple of shaves worth the charger will be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system also comes with a clean and charge station that is recommended to use after every shave. When finished shaving the shaver shows a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; symbol to remind you that the shaver needs to be cleaned. All you have to do is place the shaver in the clean and charge station and push the power button, it runs through a 3-minute self clean cycle. After the cycle the station automatically switches to charge. I have read reviews that stats that the station is not as high of quality as the series 7 Braun clean and charge station. I cannot speak for that but do not see anything wrong with the build of this station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I would definitely recommend this shaving system. The shaver could provide a closer shave, but it does close enough for what I need and the cooling bar is worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> After trying out the new CoolTec shaver, I have to say that it didn&#x27;t let me down. The cool feeling while shaving is wonderful, and the shave is as good as to be expected from a Braun shaver. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like compared to my last Braun shaver is that the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t show a status of the battery or the hygiene. This is pretty minor though since the overall shave feels better with the CoolTec technology, and any irritation I had in the past is gone.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cooltec electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun and I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using it for the past week. I previously used a Panasonic electric razor that worked fairly well, but I have needed to replace the blade too often in order to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell but the shave I&#x27;ve gotten from the Braun razor has been a very close shave with little to no irritation. The cooltec technology does seem somewhat gimicky. I&#x27;m not sure it actually does anything other than provide a cooling sensation. Does it reduce irritation? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t typically get irritation from using an electric razor. For those that do, this may work; I just cannot comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is wet/dry certified. My current razor is not and the razor does work well in the shower (although I prefer using the dry method).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed is that the battery seems to run out sooner than my current Panasonic razor. I wonder if it has to do with the cooltec technology? Also, now that I think about it, I do not believe I can plug a cable directly into the razor in order to charge it. It needs to be put in the charging cradle in order to charge. If that is the case that&#x27;s a huge disadvantage, as I do travel fairly frequently for a week at a time and I&#x27;d be afraid the charge would die before the end of the trip (need to confirm this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good electric razor. I am happy with it and I&#x27;ve already retired my old razor for this new one!</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic when I got my shipping confirmation from UPS indicating the razor, which i was getting through a program run by Braun, had arrived and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to plug it in and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get started with first impression. When I opened up the box the first thing I noticed about the razor was its heft. It feels heavy (in a good way) in your hand. It is made from solid materials too so it feels like it will not easily break. The next thing I noticed was the case. It comes with a nice form fitting case. Great for gym bag or something like that. Again, nice materials. The only drawback to the case is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the charger if you needed to take it. It also came with two charging stations which I will expand on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first charging station is a small station/dock. It is kind of awkward for charging. The better station is the charge and clean station. Although it is rather big which could be a drawback for those without space. But it has a nice build to it. The only drawback is the plug to the outlet easily falls out of the charger. The one thing I did love was the cleaning mechanism and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving it about 30 mins to charge I gave it a go. Before turning it on I would say I was about 80% sure I wouldn&#x27;t like it. I had a electric razor in the past which made my skin irritated and didn&#x27;t shave we&#x27;ll whatsoever. This razor is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looooooved the cooling aspect immediately. It definitely was a good feeling and laid to rest the doubt I had about the electric razor actually cutting without irritating. The actual shave to was super close and smooth. Although this razor averages between 120 to 150 from what I have seen it would be money well spent. I was very much anti electric before trying this razor. I have literally been shaving my face daily, which is something unusual for me because of the ease and close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I feel good knowing the razor has a self cleaning option. Knowing it is cleaning and sanitizing the razor keeps me confident that I am treating my face well.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Braun Cool Tec shaver via a program run by Braun.  The shaver has a nice ergonomic fit for your hand, but it is heavier than most others.  I usually suffer from razor burn, so the Cool Tech is a big plus in my book.  It instantly calms and soothes irritated skin.  The charger makes the razor cumbersome for a traveler, but convenient for keeping it ready to shave.  The charger also contains alcohol based fluid to keep it clean which other razors can not say that.  I feel you get more for the price with this razor.  I would definitely reccomend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> In the end of the day shavers are meant to do one very important thing, shave your hair. The Braun Cooltec system with do that with an awesome cool feeling, but it just makes it a little too difficult to do the job I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and have experience candy bar head razors (like Braun) vs. the Tri-head circular razors. I have to say that the Braun type razor head is just too bulky and hard to make defined movements while shaving. It also does not perform as well as other brands in terms of a close shave. This was going against a 3 day mustache and neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this razor does have a cool (but bulky) base, a nice cool bar in the middle (which seems more of a gimmick than actually a benefit), and a  solid weight. The weight actually is a little heavy for a razor. On a side note the long hair trimmer was not as powerful as older razors I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to my old razor for now.</li>
            <li> For shaving? This CoolTec shaver system, provided to me via a program fun by Braun to try out, does a very good job. It gives a clean shave, retains its charge well, and recharges fast when needed. The cooling bar feels exactly like that ... cool. I have not experienced redness problems with shavers in the past, so I&#x27;m not sure if this feature reduces redness or not. As for the cleaning system provided, I must admit that it ends up taking up more counter space than I would like to give to my electric shaver. When not in use, I like it to be out of sight. However, I admittedly have a very small countertop, and if space weren&#x27;t an issue, I think that the self-cleaning nature of the system would be very convenient. Overall, it is a good product, with a good shave.</li>
            <li> What a COOOOOL concept. I have been a loyal customer of the \\&quot;3 floating heads \\&quot; for years easy to use but always got the red blotches on my neck. I figured that these was the way it was. I had tried everything that I could the pre shave lotion ,the after shave lotion, before shower shave, after shower shave still red blotches. Then I saw the Braun CoolTec on Amazon and read the reviews. Sounded like a new idea so I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system is one coooool customer! I just received the CoolTec razor through a program with Braun and I feel like the coolest guy on my block! I had been using an old Braun model I got when I started college years ago and now I have graduated to a whole new level of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off with my shaving experience. The CoolTec razor provided a real nice clean close shave. It seems to glide over my face with ease and comfort. In the past I felt like I was doing a lot of stubble clean up after the first go around, and now with my new CoolTec razor I find myself only going over my face the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s move onto the Cool Bar feature, which is awesome. My first impressions of the Cool Bar was that it felt like a mini air conditioner for my face. It makes the shaving experience so much more pleasant! It provides an awesome cool sensation for your skin and helps cut down on irritation. The only down side has been with the position of the cool bar on/off switch, I have pushed it by mistake a few times while shaving. While this is not a major problem, it has happened a few times.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a cleaning station that left my CoolTec razor looking and smelling like I just took it out of the box. The Clean Station is a little bulky and takes up counter space, but I feel it&#x27;s worth the space!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the travel charger yet, but it will definitely be coming with me and my Braun CooTec razor on my next trip!&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, you should definitely try the Braun CoolTec razor. It will leave your face smooth and clean! I would highly recommend this razor to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The shaving system that i received from Braun&#x27;s try-out program is awesome. The cooling sensation works great while shaving with the CoolTec on. it provides a feeling that im shaving with some type of lotion being dispensed but its only the CoolTec working in-between the blades. The electric razor it self feels good in the hand and feels like its made high quality materials. The shaver base on the other hand seems cheap. It is not the same plastic that the shaver uses and the putting the cleaning solution in the base can be a pain because the solution container has large openings at the top so it tens to spill easy while taking the old out and putting the new in. The only other thing i don&#x27;t like is that when traveling you must bring a travel cradle to charge the shaver because the shaver doesn&#x27;t have a charging port to plug the wall outlet into. Only the cradle has a plug for the wall outlet. Overall the Braun CoolTech system is a winner in my book despite the travel charging and cleaning base. The Shaver it self is where it counts and thats why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The electric shaver was provided free from Braun, but it does not affect my review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave wasn&#x27;t the closest and the cooling feature didn&#x27;t seem like it worked in regards to its gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you want a reliable shaver, it isn&#x27;s bad, but for the money, t could be better.</li>
            <li> That first instant of cooling on your face was different...but in a good way. I had to remove the shaver initially when I first felt it because the sensation was not what I expected. I removed the shaver for a sec then put it back on my face expecting the feeling this time and this time I kept it on. The cooling sensation felt like a cool breeze on your face and gave a sense of freshness to it. It was a good feeling and made your skin feel rejuvenated after the you got used to the initial exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said the shaving itself is a bit of an annoyance. I found myself going over the same spot multiple times and having to really stretch my skin to get some hairs. I found that annoying and I found myself considering whether I should just use my previous shaver which got the hairs without going over the same spot multiple times. The trimmer though is better and provides a nice close shave so I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as looks, it is a little bulky but I find it sheik and esthetically pleasing so I don&#x27;t mind it. Bar the annoyance of multiple pass throughs over the same area it is decent and the cooling technology is new and pleasant. I was provided the shaver via a program with Braun and overall it is decent with so</li>
            <li> Finally a shaver that really has it all. I&#x27;m always a bit sceptical when buying a razor. They irritate my skin and/or a pain to clean. Well, my friends, this is the shaver you have been waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is truly an innovative product you will need to try firsthand. Before you shave there is a little cooling button you press and in a matter of seconds you can feel the cool and refreshing experience as you shave. No gimmick, it really is a cooling sensation. After the shave, there was no irritation and my face felt cool rather than on fire as with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real magic, however, is when you put the shaver back in it&#x27;s base. With the simple click of a button, the shaver will self clean itself. This is a little weird at first as it goes through several cleaning cycles, but the result is absolutely amazing. The shaver is completely clean without any mess. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for several weeks now and it is still as amazing as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I will eventually have to replace the cleaning fluid in the base, which is something you will need to purchase separately. Hopefully it isn&#x27;t too expensive as that will determine if I use this shaver long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best shaver I have ever experienced and I hope to use it for a very long time. I just hope the cleaning fluid is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great razor!!! Helps with razor bumps and irritation. First electric that I can use more than twice a week without bumps of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Can now shave more than twice a week&lt;br /&gt;Easy to manually clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;having issues with auto cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> As the title suggest, I have tried many electric razors and have not found one to be satisfactory. Well that is, until now. Braun recently sent a CoolTec 5 razor system to me to try and review through a program run by the company. I Was skeptical at first but since I knew it was coming and was on vacation, decided to let my facial hair be wild for a week or so. When the kit arrived, it took only moments to assemble and get ready for it&#x27;s first run.  First thing I noticed was the cooling bar, at first it made me jump a little but got used to it pretty quick and after time, it felt really good and helped to keep irritation at bay. I have sensitive skin and no matter my choice of shaving you can usually tell i did so. Not this time. I really like how close of a shave I can get with this system as well, it&#x27;s as close as a blade shave as long as you maintain, if you allow a few days growth it takes some more effort, as with any razor. Finally the clean and charge station is one of the greatest features. How simple is that? you drop it in, hit a button and walk away, next time you are ready for a shave, your razor is there waiting for you, nice and clean and all charged up. I attend regular business meetings and some days are long, I can assure you I will be carrying the Braun CoolTec razor in it&#x27;s case (included with the kit) to work with me. I can use it throughout the day as needed and simply drop into the Clean&amp;Charge station when I get home and it will be ready for the next day. Get this for yourself or the man in your life, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by the active cooling feature as my thick beard always requires 3-5 passes in different directions to get a close shave, which always results in a bit of razor burn, even when I use a pre-shave wet or dry lubricant. I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how well the little cooling bar actively counteracts the burn. I&#x27;ve had the razor for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t needed to use any sort of pre- or post-shave products. So just the savings there will make up for the investment in the razor. The other thing that really surprised me was how quiet the thing is. My last razor was like an alarm clock for my wife. Now I can shave right next to the bed without her waking up!</li>
            <li> To start, I&#x27;ve never written a negative review. I wish this wasn&#x27;t going to be my first. I&#x27;ve always been a skeptic on electric razors.  I haven&#x27;t owned one in 20 years. I was excited to try out the new shaver. The packing was cool. The directions weren&#x27;t super easy or esthetically appealing. Jumping to the point, the shaver doesn&#x27;t work good. If you have a few days of growth, forget it. I spent so much time trying to contort my face to work the razor into all the areas. Around the nose and neck area will require a traditional razor for touch up. I found the razor works a hare better if you wet your skin. The cleaning/charging  system is a novelty gimmick and a waste of space. The only positive I can truly come up with is the cooling feature is cool and does calm the skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net-net, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the razor. I wanted it to be awesome and had such high hopes. Unfortunately, this will make its way under the sink and is unlikely to reappear. Sorry for the review but I&#x27;m being as honest as I can.</li>
            <li> So I got the Braun CoolTec System from a program run by Braun and have been using it for over a week now and I have to say its pretty good shaver. I used to have electric shaver from Remington but switched back to razors since that Remington I had never shaved as close or quick as a razor in addition it didn&#x27;t perform nearly as good as when I first got it. The Braun CoolTec System so far has worked really well. It gives a nice quick and close shave and has a neat cooling bar feature that will cool your skin while shaving. The cooling bar is a nice and unique feature, you basically activate it while shaving and the little bar in between the blades will give your skin a nice cool little blast. Me personally, I don&#x27;t usually get irritated skin so it wasn&#x27;t much of a factor for me. The things I liked that I felt was different from my previous electric shaver is that it gave a quick and close shave. I didn&#x27;t have to go over areas multiple times. In addition, the shaver was very easy to clean. Just flip of the top and run it through water. The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair into the unit like my previous shaver. Also, it has a base unit that will clean and sanitize your shaver just as my previous electric shaver. All in all, it&#x27;s a definite huge upgrade from my previous electric shaver and will make me ditch my razors.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before for an extended period of time. The main reason was that in the past they pulled hairs rather than cutting them. So when I was offered a Braun CoolTech razor to review, I went in with somewhat of a bias, but the razor sounded cool and I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test the razor, I decided to use it exclusively for a two week period. What happened next was somewhat unexpected, but also mixed a slew of positive and negative factors for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The cooling bar. Never thought that I&#x27;d enjoy a cooling sensation while shaving. It is quite pleasant and took only a few minutes to get used to. It also cools much quicker than they note in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;- The shave. Unlike past electric razors, you barely realize that it is cutting off your whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;- The edger. The edging tool hooked up to this razor is really slick. It is durable enough to trim tough hairs, but also sensitive enough to trim nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;- The self-cleaning station. My son loves this the most as it makes all kinds of cool noises. It also has that barber shop smell to it while shaving that reminds you of the old guy who used to cut your hair growing up or the guy that lines you up at the barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;- Less irritation &amp; ingrown hairs. I am not sure what it is, but this razor reduced the number of ingrown hairs and irritation that I had following a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately that the good also comes with some negatives. Some of these are universal, but others are probably for me or a sub sect of the population:&lt;br /&gt;- The shave. I am a baby face and typically shave two times a week. With this razor, I was shaving every morning and lost the smoothness of the shave before I left the office each day.&lt;br /&gt;- Weird angles. When shaving with the CoolTech I found myself stretching skin like you would shaving with a straight blade. This isn&#x27;t awful, but really extended the shaving session and mitigated theconvenience of shaving without a sink full of water.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean light. The razor has a water drop icon that turns on when the razor needs to be run through the self-cleaning system. Unfortunately this goes off after each shave and I am not sure if this is necessary. I have somewhat of an OCD thing and had to run the cycle every time I saw it. The most I went was two days, but did mostly because it was a nuisance to see. I cleaned the blades after each shave so seemed overkill  unless you were shaving multiple people.&lt;br /&gt;- Sink space. Now the razor is great, but takes up a lot of counter space. If you have a limited section of your bathroom, you might want to store in another area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would give the razor 3-3.5 stars, but am not sure that it is 100% for me. I like having a close shave last for a day plus, but do love that I have experienced less irritation than with the multi-blade traditional razor. Space isn&#x27;t a giant issue for me and I think that I&#x27;ll probably wind up mixing up between the electric and manual razors.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec,(provided free to try from Braun)I used the shaver for the first time this morning and usually use a pre-shave lotion/splash for electric shavers. I didn&#x27;t have to use anything at all! You experience this cold shave like rubbing an ice cube across your face. I didn&#x27;t have to use the pre-shave splash. My facial hair grows in different directions and normally I would experience hair pulling with my other shaver, but not with CoolTec! I was able to repeat each area of my face multiple times and didn&#x27;t experience any shave bumps at all. I love this shaver! It comes with a great shaver case for travel purposes! I highly recommend this shaver to everyone!</li>
            <li> When I first heard about the Braun CoolTec Shaving System, I was very excited to try it.  I was provided this electric shaver via a program run by Braun.  First and foremost, what a generous thing for them to do!  After a month of no shaving during Movember, I was ready to clean up a bit.  I like having a beard but get tired of constantly trimming my neck line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged up the shaver, it seems to have good battery life, although that is decreased when using the cooling system.  It&#x27;s amazing that you don&#x27;t need shaving gel or anything to have a comfortable, smooth and close shaving experience.  Holding the unit a a 90 degree angle seems to help it cut better and get closer to the skin.  Afterwards, I placed it in the container and it was surprisingly cleaned up many tiny hairs.  Another pain with shaving is constantly having to clean your shaver.  The Braun CoolTec system takes care of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this shaver for a long time and might purchase one for my brother at Christmas.  I think this would be a great gift!</li>
            <li> Here is my husbands review of the Braun CoolTec Razor.&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic to receive a Braun CoolTec razor as part of a program run by Braun. I have really sensitive skin and I have to shave daily.  My facial hair is very think and coarse and combine that with my sensitive skin and that&#x27;s not a fun time with my everyday shave. When this razor fist arrived I was super happy and excited to try it out. After a nice long charge, I had my first shave. I was not impressed at all. The razor trims my hair but does not give a closer shave at all. The blades like they were tugging and pulling on my hair rather than cutting. I still needed to use a regular razor after. The cool touch feature is really nice. It cools your skin so less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;After 5 shaves with this razor I have come to the conclusion that it is a good razor to use in combination with my regular razor. The both together give a smooth, irritation free razor and my skin has felt amazing.</li>
            <li> I received this shaving system through a free promotion from Braun and first thing I will say is the design wasn&#x27;t overly bulky in my hand. I received the feeling thati would be able to give myself a salon quality shave at home.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried electric razors in the past, they all seemed heavy and irritated my skin, so this was a different experience to feel 1 that was lighter. The coolness of the blades did feel very good on the skin and the blades did give me a close shave  but my skin was to sensitive to continue use.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System from Braun as a trial product.  I have not used an electric razor in 20 years because my skin always gets irritated from them.&lt;br /&gt;I had a very difficult time following the packaging directions just to put the kit together, but I charged the razor and used it.  I did not experience any irritation at all, and I especially liked the cooling technology.  The shave was close and my skin felt comfortable.  However, there were spots on my face and neck that it just couldn&#x27;t shave, from any angle I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to giving it another try tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of the Braun shaving systems.  I currently have been using the Braun series 7 shaver before giving this new Cooltec a try after receiving it through a free program from Braun.  The idea of having a cool feeling razor on your skin as your shaving is a great idea and feels pretty good, but I think I will be sticking to my series 7 shaver.  I like the way that my series 7 shaver&#x27;s head moves with the curvature of my face where as this razor has a fixed head and does not move.  The cleaning system is nice but just like the series 7 cleaning system, they can get a expense and need replaced about once a month depending on usage. As a cheaper version to the series 7, this is not a bad razor at all and is a very great entry level shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband is in nursing home and I am trying to learn how to use it correctly&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;not having success yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for the past six years (previously used razors). The Braun Cool Tec electric shaver is by far the best shaver I have used ever since switching over to electric shavers (I have purchased five different electric shavers before purchasing the Braun Cool Tec shaver) and is well-worth the money. The Braun Cool Tec shaver has provided a quality shave, comparable to when I used razors.  I&#x27;m happy to say that this is the first electric shaver that I have felt like my money was well-spent!</li>
            <li> The electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun. The shaver is amazing, by far the best shaver i have had the pleasure to use. The cold feeling it provides against my face is one of a kind amazing. The self cleaning feature is convenient and easy to use, it even has a reminder on the shaver to clean it. Then all I have to do is when I put it down on the charger, push the button and it starts cleaning it. that&#x27;s great for me because i don&#x27;t have time in the mornings to clean my shaver. A+ on closeness and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not like about the shaver was that one spot on my neck that it could not reach. I had to keep working at all different angles to get that one spot on my neck. And the first time i used it, a red mark and irritation occurred on my neck</li>
            <li> The Braun Cool Tec Shaving system is fabulous , the best shaver I have EVER owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does a nice close shave, the cooling system is a great sensation .&lt;br /&gt; It feels good on skin with no irritation. The trimmer is narrow and efficient .&lt;br /&gt;I love the self cleaning station , sterile and quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as part of braun product trial.  I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different shavers and blades and normally end up with an irritated spot on my neck.  So far this is the best way to shave my neck with no red marks.&lt;br /&gt;Thee are definitely pros and cons though&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;I can use it while I am half awake and not cut myself&lt;br /&gt;The cooltec gel feels very refreshing and clean&lt;br /&gt;It does an amazing job shaving without skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;It has a great ergonomic shape and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or easily breakable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The base is huge.  I found myself using the travel stand for normal charging.&lt;br /&gt;The cooltec gel is awesome, but refills are not cheap.  Then again neither is high end shaving gel.  Pick your poison.&lt;br /&gt;It has a large shaving head and is difficult to use to maintain a well edged beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the shaver to buy if you suffer from razor burn and want a high end shaver.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver system through program run by Braun.  I was excited to try this product as I‚Äôve been on the hunt for the best shaving solution for years.  I have used many razors and electric shavers over the years.  I‚Äôve used Gillette and Shick razors as well as electric shavers from Norelco, Remington, Panasonic, and Braun.  My best experiences with shaving were with Braun electrics.  I had a Braun Flex Integral in the 90‚Äôs and most recently the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Braun fan, I was intrigued by the CoolTec.  The advertised cooling sensation that promised a more comfortable and irritation-free shave seemed to be too good to be true.  Having sensitive skin, I was more than willing to try the CoolTec and give my Series 7 a rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the CoolTec was the packaging.  It was securely packaged but didn‚Äôt require the jaws of life to open as many things do these days.  The package contained the razor, the charger and cradle, the Charge and Clean station, cleaning solution, a cleaning brush, travel case, and user‚Äôs manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user‚Äôs manual was clearly written and concise.  The CoolTec is seemingly designed with simplicity in mind and the manual is really unnecessary.  There are two buttons on the shaver itself: a power button and a button that controls the cooling feature.  The charge and clean station has only a power connection and a single button that activates the cleaning function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part: the shaving experience.  I first noticed the build quality of the CoolTec.  It is what I would expect from Braun.  It‚Äôs well made and has the right amount of ‚Äúheft.‚Äù  Not heavy, and not cheap feeling.  I can honestly admit that this was the most comfortable shave I‚Äôve had.  The cooling sensation works as described and irritation is non-existent.  It seems to glide across my face better than any other electric I‚Äôve had and the coolness almost feels as though it‚Äôswet, but it‚Äôs not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness goes, I find the shave to be a close as any electric I‚Äôve tried‚Äîeven my beloved Series 7‚Äîand it appears to take less time to do so.  One thing I note is that the shaver head (the foil side) is wider than I‚Äôm used to and I had to alter my technique a bit.  The head doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúflex‚Äù as I‚Äôm used to with Brauns so you have to pay a little more attention to the angle of the shaver but I don‚Äôt find this to be an issue.  The side trimmer is effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually after shaving with an electric my face is red and slightly irritated for a short time but with the CoolTec my face is comfortable afterwards with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the CoolTec is extremely simple with the Charge and Clean station.  The razor has a light that illuminates if the razor needs a cleaning and you merely insert the shaver into the station and press the button.  The cleaning takes three minutes and the shaver charges while in the station.  It takes several hours for the shaver to dry but since the station is meant to store the shaver when not in use, this is no trouble.  The shaver is dry by the next use.  Automatic cleaning in the Charge and Clean station is very effective and doesn‚Äôt require much manual cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also clean the CoolTec under running water.  I have not yet tried this, but this is an excellent feature especially when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is stated as 15 minutes when using the cooling feature.  Since I have been using the clean and charge station daily, which charges the shaver, I can‚Äôt confirm how long the battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I‚Äôm very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec system.  I find it to meet its claims of ‚Äúputting irritation on ice‚Äù as well as providing a close shave from a well built product.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver, as it reduces irritation. It feels awkward at first, but the cooling effect is now a must-have for me when it comes to electric shavers. The product is very clearly high quality and comes substantial accessories including a cleaning/charging base and a reinforced travel carrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this shaver is that like other Braun shavers I have owned, this product does not give you nearly as close a shave as a traditional razor. As someone in the military who needs to shave daily, this is disappointing. But overall, my feelings are positive and I would recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my shaver for free, courtesy of Braun.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors of various types thru the years.  I always got the best shave from one of the foil type shavers, however, it came with the cost of razor burn.  The Norelco shavers did not irritate my skin, but they also didn&#x27;t give shave as close as the foil shavers like a Braun or Remington.  After being somewhat skeptical of the CoolTec system, I have been pleasantly surprised.  I get a foil shaver that gives me a very close shave, without the razor burn/skin irritation.  After using it for a month now, I have not had to clean it as the cleaning station does an excellent job.  If you have a tough beard and like a great close shave, then give this one a try.  You will not be disappointed!  Disclosure: Razor was provided via program by Braun.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun electric shavers in the past with mostly good results and was excited to try this one out as it was provided via a program by Braun. It was quick and easy to remove from the box. Once out, I had it up and running in about 4 minutes. I turned on the cool bar on and began shaving. The cool bar felt incredible. I liked the cool soothing sensation and received a very close shave without irratation, even in the hard to shave neck area. I also used the precision trimmer with excellent results. When I was finished, I placed the shaver in the slick cleaning station, which did a very nice job for my next use. Awesome sleek look of the shaver while seated in the base. Overall, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver through a program run by Braun to test it out. I found that the shaver works really well if your hair is already trimmed or short. It didn&#x27;t leave any razor burn, which was great! I really like the cooling bar that it has and the docking/cleaning station is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this shaver if your hair hasn&#x27;t been trimmed. It&#x27;s best if you trim it first, then use this shaver after, to clean it up a little and create the look you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to men who want to shave frequently and have sensitive skin issues. You&#x27;ll love the cooling bar and you&#x27;ll notice a significant decrease in skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a promotion with Braun. I have been using it for a couple weeks now. My face is very sensitive and I have to take great care not to make it worse when I shave. The cooling bar has helped tremendously. It helped the usual burning sensation to drop drastically. I no longer have redness after shaving. I love how the trimmer is right on the razor so I don&#x27;t have tons of gadgets laying around. I would have to say that my favorite part of this system would be the cleaning station. It gives me peace of mind that after I am done that my razor will be clean and disinfected. Overall I give this system two thumbs up! If you have sensitive skin and have to shave often this is a must!</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did! It is awesome! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an electric shaver!  Effortless and comfortable.  Easy to use and gentle on your skin. Excellent battery life. The cleaner works great. the pros are endless!</li>
            <li> I recently recieved the Braun CoolTec through a program run by Braun.  After only a few uses, I have to say that this might be the best electric razor I have every used.  It really provides a close shave and the cooling feeling while shaving seems to reduce the irritation I am used to experiencing from other electric razors.  With sensitive skin that usually dries out with shaving, the cooltec system allows me to get a close, comfortable shave without the irritation.  I like the cleaning system that is provided with this system.  It is nice to use a razor that is clean and smells fresh for every use.  The travel case is durable and provides good protection for the razor.  The only thing that would make the Braun CoolTec better in my opinion would be the ability to plug a charger in directly to the razor when traveling without the cleaning station.  The base used for charging only adds another item to be packed when I am on the road.  I would say this has to be the best razor ever.  I challange anybody to find one that provides the comfort level provided by the Braun CoolTec cooling system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I am just using my girlfriends account with amazon because I don&#x27;t have one. I was able to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free from a program run by Braun, but honestly, the hype just isn&#x27;t as good as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand that comes with the razor is pretty cool in the fact that it cleans to razor for you with alcohol at the push of a button and also charges the razor between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling technology works pretty well also, during the first couple of minutes of a shave you don&#x27;t notice it as well but then it really starts to kick in. This effectively keeps your skin from getting irritated during shaving and keeps your skin feeling refreshing all throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with a lot of neat features, but unfortuently, the shave it produces is just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather course facial hair and this razor would not cut it very well and it was definitely a close shave. I went over the same area two or three times and there was still hair left on my face. I tried cutting the hair by coming in from different angles but that didn&#x27;t seem to work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a very sleek design, the cooling bar is awesome and the housing kit is perfect but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> My name is Jayson and I got this electric shaver, and was provided via a program run by Braun. The first time I used the machine, I dint use the cool tech to see how much of the difference was. It was a comfortable feeling, and smoothing to the face at the same time.  I have used other shavers at the end my face feels irritated. After shaving with the Braun, my face was a smooth and not irritated. I like the LED battery indicating light and how it tells you when is dirty. The cleaning machine was super easy, just set it and forget it. The only thing I do not like is the side burn or the trimmer feature. I didn&#x27;t think it did a very good job. Over all i used it all the time and the shaver is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System through a program run by Braun, however I have been using Braun products for the past 5 years. I have been using a Braun series 5 for the past year and was a bit skeptical of this new product upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the new CoolTec shaver for the past three weeks to get thru the initial stage, as most shavers requires some time to adjust to your specific skin and hair type. I can say that the CoolTec technology is instantly felt and not just another gimmick. The skin truly feels cool to the touch and provides an invigorating feel. This is extremely important with guys with sensitive skin as the irritation is significantly reduced. I happen to have sensitive skin, and this shave made a difference even from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic cleaning systems also provides a fresh clean feel, and easily cleans and maintains the shaver in top shape. As with my experience with the series 5 shaver, the CoolTec is on par with the 5 but prefer it over the 5 due to my sensitive skin and tough hair. Overall a great product, would give it a 5 star however I have I have some difficulty with consistency of shaving my neck, but this is usually my own skin type problem as this is a consistent problem with most shavers.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver to try for free as part of a program run by Braun. Which is a good thing since, in the end, i find this product to be overpriced for what it is. While i did find the cooling feature innovative and refreshing, it&#x27;s not exactly necessary. I have pretty low expectations for shaving - i don&#x27;t shave daily and don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m perfectly clean shaven, but to give a fair review, this shaver didn&#x27;t give that closer of a shave. Certainly is no closer than an older Panasonic shaver i have. And like i said, while the cooling feature does work, for what this model sells for, I&#x27;d expect much better performance on the shaving end. As for the cleaning station, i do like it better than using just water but again, i am low maintenance and am perfectly happy just rinsing &amp; tapping. What i don&#x27;t like is another &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; cluttering up my bathroom - my Panasonic fits in my drawer and only comes out when i use it. In summary, if you don&#x27;t already own an electric razor, and think you really need or would enjoy the cooling feature, this razor could work for you but if you already own a razor that works for you, i doubt this is worth switching to.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this razor to replace a Braun I have had for 12-15 years.  This unit is much quieter than the older unit I had and more compact.  Works extermely well and the CoolTec feature is cool...pun intended.  This package deal did not come with cover for razor head but had the travel case which I love.  I also love the locking feature for the razor as I have had my older unit come on while in plane storage which resulted in the unit beind dead when I arrived at my destination.  Instructions are a bit confusing for an old guy like me but are adequate.</li>
            <li> Short Version:&lt;br /&gt;*Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - No irritation and water proof&lt;br /&gt; - Self Cleaning&lt;br /&gt; - Close Shave&lt;br /&gt; - Trimmer attachment&lt;br /&gt; - Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Misses Hair&lt;br /&gt; - Cooling element could be bigger&lt;br /&gt; - Clunky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was provided the shaver via a program run by Braun, the instructions for use were clean and easy to understand.  The shaver itself is easy to break down, clean and put back together.  The first trial run was on my face (2 days of growth) and cleaned up all, except the small patches near my jaw, with ease and only took about 5-6 min.  I put the shaver on the base, pushed the button and let the cleaning system do its job.  It only took about 5 Min. When it was done, the shaver was slightly moist and smelled of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I also had my father in-law use the shaver (hes about 57).  He had about a days worth of porcupine like growth.  The shaver had no problems at all cleaning up his face.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment had no problems cleaning up my sideburns and neckline.  Over all the shaver is a great investment. and the cooling element helped to reduce the skin irritation by 95%.  The only issues I encountered were small 1 inch patches at the corner of my jaw that the shaver just couldn&#x27;t&#x27; pick up but the easy to use trimmer attachment picked up the stubborn hair; and also the cooking element could be bigger.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy after all the great things I heard. It doesn&#x27;t come close to my crummy old ones, it&#x27;s very uneven and you go over and over the same place forever.</li>
            <li> This Braun CoolTec really disappointed me. I just think the aluminum strip that gets cold is too thin to really make the shave feel cold on the skin (not enough surface area gets cold). I actually found it to be rather irritating at first as it almost felt like a stinging feeling. After using it for about 2 weeks I noticed i started to get used to it but it never felt like a nice cool refreshing shave. Also, since the head of the shaver (aka the cassette) needs more room to house the coolTec bar I noticed it is much wider than the series 5. The actual foil shavers are spaced very far apart in comparison to series 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the coolTec on or off, the shave itself was very close and effortless. The shaver and the cleaning system were just as good as other braun models (i have also used the series 5). I still ended up returning it through the \\&quot;braun 60 day satisfaction guarantee.\\&quot; Hopefully that process goes smoothly. It&#x27;s also unfortunate because when i finally went for it and made this purchase there was the Braun Series 7 (760cc) on sale for only $10 more. I regret not getting the series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** it took about 8 weeks for the manufacturers return to be processed but it did go through without any further trouble. They send a visa prepaid deal as the refund which is acceptable. Also, I picked up the series 7 (black version) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with that purchase!</li>
            <li> I own this razor and it does a great job. I have used it wet with shave lotion, and it does awesome. I have used it wet with no shave lotion, and it does as good as can be expected. I have used it dry with the cool mode on and it actually does a very good job. I have sensitive skin, and no razor burn. The more you use it the better shave you get, but I think this is true for most electric shavers. I still use a manual razor to trim up sideburns, it has a trimmer built in the side, but for me it is quicker and easier to do it the old way. The cleaning does a great job, only drawback is that it is a little noisy, but I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li> First off, I received the CoolTec through a Braun promotion and figured I&#x27;d use if for a few weeks and see how it went. At this point, I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;ll stick with it. The first few times I used it took getting used to and I&#x27;m not sure if that skewed my opinion or not. But the shave was pretty close, just not as close as I expected. The Cooling feature was neat and extremely refreshing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was really needed. I had problems with it on the neck area, which is usually the quickest growing for me. Lots of blotches and some bleeding, even after a few weeks, lead me to think that this product just isn&#x27;t right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the shaver very easy to use and the dock/cleaning system was pretty straightforward. I found I left less of a mess when using this then a traditional cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, it could just take my skin a little while to get used to the razor so I&#x27;ll keep at it for a few more weeks. If all else fails, my brother has been asking for one of these so I could hand it off to him.</li>
            <li> I received this shaving system as part of a program run by Braun.  I was anxious to try the Braun CoolTec system, especially the cooling technology.  The shave was of average quality, and the cooling system was not as impressive as I had hoped.  I have been satisfied with the battery life however, and I like the cleaning base that it comes with as well.  Overall the Braun CoolTec is a decent shaver system, but I probably would not buy it for the price it currently being sold for.</li>
            <li> My husband loves braun, and keeps them til they officially hit the obituaries. He works on them and drop kicks them into functioning one last time for about a year and then gives in to a new purchase. I was time! And he did and I am ok with it!</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a nice, close shave and I thought the cooling sensation reduced irritation to my sensitive skin.  It is an easy system to use and has a base that automatically cleans the razor.  I have sensitive skin, and this razor gave me a close shave with much less irritation than my other electric razor or a manual razor.  I liked that it&#x27;s waterproof and easy to travel with.  The only problem I can think of is the cleaning solution leaks out of the base a little bit if it is tipped.  I think the price is fair on this razor.  I received this razor to try out through a program run by Braun.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a higher end electric razor for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Braun CoolTec System and have to say that the icy coolness was amazing. My face stayed cool during my entire shave and I felt less itchiness and redness when I was finished. The reason I can&#x27;t give this product a higher rating is because I found I had to go over my lower neck a number of times for the hair there to finally be fully removed. I thought this may have happened because my hair was too long the first time I tried the shaver out, but each time I&#x27;ve used it since I&#x27;ve encountered the same problem. I received the CoolTec System from a program run by Braun and am happy, as it&#x27;s a bit pricey in my opinion. This is an innovative product and has great potential, it just didn&#x27;t give me as clean a shave as other products have.</li>
            <li> First to lead off I am a lifetime disposable razor user my entire life. I was skeptical when i first tried the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System but was pleasantly surprised. first off the opening of the box and seeing all the parts was a little bit intimidating, but after glancing at the instructions putting it together and had it working properly in under 5 minutes. everything i ever heard about electric shavers is that they don&#x27;t get a close shave and it irritates the skin. I was surprised at how close the shave actually got.  must admit the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because a regular shave was still a bit smoother than the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System but this was pretty darn close. The CoolTec System is pretty awesome. It cools and soothes the skin while shaving giving it a soothing feel. it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li> Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞CoolTec electric shaver was provided to me by a program run by Braun.  I have used the product for the last three days and I have to say that it WAY outperforms my old razor.  The cooling feature really prevents the after-burn that my old razor was giving me every time I used it.  Also I feel like the razor is so much more sanitary with the awesome cleaning system it uses.  I do have my doubts about how long the cleaning liquid will last, though.  My biggest complaint really has nothing to do with this awesome razor: I don&#x27;t know why Braun didn&#x27;t have a cap for the razor included‚ÄîI checked the box three times thinking I must have missed it.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of my razor lying around uncapped whether in the pouch or on my counter.  I also wish that the cord plugged right into the razor (allowing me to shave while it is plugged in) instead of plugging into the charging station.  All in all though, this is a fantastic razor and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric razor and was provided to me through a program run by Braun. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, as of right now I&#x27;m very satisfied but not quite sure if I&#x27;m ready to through away my old manual razor just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To properly test this razor I let my facial hair grow in for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how well the cooling element works. It feels great on my face especially in the hot shower. It feels like your rubbing an ice cube on your face as you shave. It&#x27;s defiantly a different experience but the tech alone makes it worth purchasing. According to Braun they say the cooling element is to prevent razor burn and it does, very well. After trimming my facial hair there was no sign of razor burn anywhere, and I did not use any pre shave lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive of the Cooltec over a traditional razor is how close it gets and how smooth it leaves your skin. I actually had a closer shave with the Braun I ever had from my razor, and it left the skin very smooth. After the shave, out of habit, I applied some aftershave lotion that usually burns after a shave. With the Braun I didn&#x27;t fell a thing, meaning that it did not break the skin in any way shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for comfort and overall feel this is 5 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there are a couple negative aspects to this razor, but from what I hear they are an issue with most electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It defiantly won&#x27;t win any speed records; I found it much slower then my safety razor. I think with time and practice I may speed up the process a bit. Even though it is slower the convenience being able to shave without water or shave lotion almost anywhere makes the loss of speed almost worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I had a hard time with some spots under my chin. It took multiple passes to get some of those spots. I feel like it is partially my fault for not knowing how to properly shave with an electric razor, but still it was a little frustrating.  This could also have been due to how long I allowed my facial hair to grow in order to properly test this razor.  After  a month or so ill update post  a new review and see if I have been able to iron out these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality of shave 3 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smooth shave with zero razor burn, but can be slow at times. I would defiantly recommend to someone who already has an electric razor because it is a heck of an upgrade in the comfort department. I would also recommend this to a traditional razor user who wants to be free of the soaps and aftershave and the ability to shave anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped you decide!ittle frustrating.

            <li> Braun did it again‚Ä¶ Through a program run by Braun I was fortunate to receive the cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System.  This shaver takes revolutionary to a whole new level.  The CoolTec Shaver System is especially great for those who experience some skin irritation.  The shaver has a built-in cooling element that actually &#x27;cools&#x27; the skin while you shave, in order to help to minimize shaving irritation... without the need for any gels or lotions.  Additionally, the shaver features 2 independently moving cutting elements that help reach every facial contour ‚Äì in other words, you&#x27;ll have a really close shave.  Finally, not only is the shaver waterproof, but it is even designed to be safe to use in the shower.  How many other brands can boast all of these features??  Once you try the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System you&#x27;ll become a customer for life.</li>
            <li> was so excited when i first received Braun CoolTec razor System from Braun #GotItFree I normally don&#x27;t use an electric shaver. My neck is very sensitive has gotten irritated with other electric razors. The razor did fine in a few spots on my neck but would still leave hair in some areas and I that would have to use a normal razor to shave. I could tell the razor would get cool but never felt 44 degrees. one note the razor didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but  didn&#x27;t perform well while shaving my neck. also after every use the razor needed to be cleaned.#gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received this via a program run by Braun recently and I must say the cooling bar rocks!  Skin irritation is a thing of the past when using this and it gives a nice close shave too.  I used to be a Norelco guy but I think I might change to being a Braun kind of guy.  I do have a couple of nitpicks.  The trimmer is a little small and I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to buy the cleaning fluid for it.  Overall though it&#x27;s a quality product!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I thought I would add some more insight on CoolTec CT5cc shaving system, which was provided via a program run by Braun. The shave that the CT5cc gave me was more than adequate, and the popup trimmer was excellent on my goatee. It ran great for two weeks on a single charge (YMMV), and it is completely sealed so you can use it in the shower, another plus. The CoolTec technology is immediately noticeable, cooling as the foils glide across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor complaints are that the shaver will still miss finer hairs, so you will have to go over those areas multiple times. I counted a dozen strokes before it finally caught the hairs. The cleaning station/charger is pretty big for a shaver this size also but understandable since it cleans your shaver as well. Only problem with that is the cost of the cleaning cartridges kinda sting. I did get occasional snag that was initially painful, common with foil shavers, but the cooling technology helped with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing about the CoolTec technology. While it is amazing, the bar will actually HEAT UP if you use it for more than about 20 minutes. I found this out by growing out some decent facial hair to really test this shaver out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have no problem recommending the CT5cc.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun for sending this to me to review and evaluate.  I have been using cartridge refill type blades for some time now, not being too impressed with my old Norelco electic shaver.  When I got the Braun ¬∞CoolTec, I was skeptical about the cooling feature as being a silly gimmick, but I was sure wrong!  This Braun gives me a great close shave, and the cooling sensation is great and really helps the hairs stand straight so they can be shaved evenly and after only one pass.  The ability to clean is also great.  I would recommend this to my friends.  My only issue with the device is that the cleaning cartridges are somewhat expensive.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this device!</li>
            <li> I got my Braun Cooltec through a promotion with Braun, and I tried it out as soon as I got it. and I thought it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s Good?&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just another shaving gadget. It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cools your face as you shave, creating a really pleasant experience when you groom. The CoolTec technology means you&#x27;re not having to reach for three different soothing balms after you shave (you should always be regularly moisturising, however).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing battery on the CoolTec means you only have to charge it for less than an hour once a week in a funky little charging stand that comes with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also waterproof so you can have a shave in the shower or just take it apart when you&#x27;re done shaving and stick it under the tap to clean it. Finally, it&#x27;s still light and easy to hold despite the added gadgetry within, making shaving easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s Bad?&lt;br /&gt;Braun sells an excellent cleaning stand for its foil shavers, but even on a premium product like the CoolTec, it&#x27;ll cost you extra. The CoolTec is already an awesome product, but it&#x27;d be better as the complete Braun gadget package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue that might turn you off the CoolTec is the fact that the cooling element seems to overheat after about 15-20 minutes of use. You&#x27;ll have to leave it to (ironically) cool down after that before you can get the cooling benefit back. Thankfully, it still works like a normal shaver during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a foil shaver. Albeit a very good one, it still misses finer hairs where face meets neck. Nothing a quick stroke with a disposable can&#x27;t fix, however.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System for free to try out from a program run by Braun.  I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and I really like it.  I normally alternate shaving each day between my regular razor and an electric razor.  Since I received the Braun CoolTek Shaving System I have not used my regular razor at all.  It gives my a close shave and because of the CoolTek technology, my face feels really good.  The bar going across the middle of the shaver that keeps my face cool is very nice.  It helps to cut down on irritation.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Braun CoolTek Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> Provided by a program run by Braun, I received this CoolTec electric shaver to test.  I&#x27;m a 40 year old with sensitive skin, shaving isn&#x27;t fun at times.  With the new CoolTec technology, I can finally get a close shave without my skin feeling like it&#x27;s on fire.  Yes, the bar between the blades cools down and feels like ice on your skin while you shave.  It fits perfectly in my hands, holds a charge and is very easy to clean.  If I had to complain, it would be the cleaning system is a bit noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is quiet&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in the shower (which helps with skin irritation)&lt;br /&gt;Charges quick and is long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Nice travel charger + case which isn&#x27;t the cheap stuff you can get with some razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system can be a bit noisy&lt;br /&gt;Replacement cooling packs lasting 4 weeks.  Would like to see them last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:  I would recommend this razor to family and friends.  The close shave for me along with the cooling bar put it over the top.</li>
            <li> I recently received a new Braun CoolTec Shaver as part of a program run by Braun.  It has a cooling element that keeps your skin cool as you shave thus reducing the irritation and redness that my past shavers have caused. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and so far it does a good job.  The shave is close and I have little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cleaning unit that looks really cool, but appears to be very impractical.  First off it is huge and takes up a big space on my bathroom counter.  It cleans the shaver well enough, but I think I can get as good of a clean if I just did it myself.  It&#x27;s kind of like those automated car washes. It does a pretty good job but is it worth the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise there are a couple other improvements I would make.  I wish it had a charged % indicator so that I knew how long I would have before I need to charge it. I travel a lot for work and the charging station (yes it&#x27;s a station) is bulky and I&#x27;d rather not have to pack it along if I didn&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carry case it has to pack on trips for the razor is really well designed and sleek. My only issue is the charging station/cradle size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a good product overall and I am enjoying telling others about my &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; new technology.</li>
            <li> My husband said this was the best shaver he has ever used. I love the no mess cleaning. My husband said the cooling feature was amazing on his face. Best bday present I have gotten him.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my dad for his birthday and he LOVES it! He says it is a the best shaver he has ever used, and gives him the best shave!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Braun to test...I wanted to like it, I really did.  The cooling technology sounded great, and works very well.  The cleaning system is good, although it seems to me that it is a bit pricey to use this system rather than just cleaning it out myself.  Still, an interesting idea.  Packaging materials, the feel of the razor in the hand, time of charging all were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was with the shaving performance.  Now I&#x27;ll admit that I have never used a foil type razor before...I have shaved with electric for 20+ years but always with rotary blades.  This shaver was OK on the easy parts of my face but absolutely could not get the hard hairs.  I went over it again and again, tried on several different days, and every time ended up having to pull out my trust Norelco to finish the job that this razor could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I wanted to like it.  I like the bells and whistles.  But at the end of the day it is performance I want, and this razor was unfortunately lacking in it for me.</li>
            <li> Received a Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program by Braun and am glad to have received it.  I am a newbie to elctric shavers but this is a great electric shaver, that provides a non-irritating shave. For anyone with sensitive skin, one of the main issues with electric shavers is that they generate heat, followed by redness and irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun CoolTec, works a bit differently, just like other electric shavers it gets you a shave but  Braun has added a cooling aluminum bar on the tip of the razor, set so that it glides against the skin and cools it off with proprietary Thermo Electric Cooling (TEC) technology.  Thus, it chills your skin/face and reduces irritation. You just have to press the ‚Äúcooling‚Äù button to activate the cooling and keep the razor at 90 degrees when shaving. Cooling is On/Off and it come with one cutting/trimming speed. That‚Äôs fine with me as I got a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other accessories include a trimmer that&#x27;s great for trimming sideburns, beards, and mustaches and a self-cleaning and charging dock. The shaver stays charged for an hoursa and can get enough power from five minutes of charging for one clean shave.  They have also provided a travel case and it also has a travel lock feature to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It‚Äôs a pretty simple, effective, precise and for sure less irritating shaver.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to participate in a program ran by Braun, I have used the electric razor for a some time now and would like to provide some thoughts to help guide your electric razor decision. At first I was skeptical if the CoolTec feature is a gimic or not. I used to operate electric razors for many years until this past year. I gave them up due to having fairly sensitive skin and did not want to deal with annoying skin irritation anymore. After shave or lotions helped a bit, however the reason I like this razor is the skin irritation from this electric razor has been drastically reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to the Gillette and Schick disposable razors. This razor delivers a great day to day shave if you shave every day. My facial hair grows rather quickly and if I shave every day it provides a great shave. But if I miss a day or two then the thicker hairs do not get cut as easily and I usually have to shave with a throwaway razor again then go back to my daily routine. Having a higher speed for this specific purpose would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort for the CoolTec is paramount primarily due to the CoolTec sensation that is provided while shaving. The science behind this feature is that as you shave; your skin temperature goes up, thus causing irritation with further shaving. Keep your skin cool helps reduce this occurrence, therefore no need for aftershave/lotions! The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the gripping points on the razor. It‚Äôs very comfortable to hold and you know exactly where to place your pointer finger and thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of convenience  the CoolTec has a cleaning base. This allows you you to place the razor in a base which will automatically clean and charge the razor. This removes any andall maintenance you may need to do because the shaver is cleaned and lubricated after each shave. Keep in mind these cleaning cartridges do run about $4-5/month, so it is an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the best razor on the market but if you suffer with skin irritation like I do then you don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles like some of the other comparable electric razors on the market. Just keep in mind this razor is at its best when you use it on a daily basis. If you shave every 2-3 days then you may want to consider more powerful options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of packaging Braun packages this German-made shaver very well and includes Carrying Case, Cleaning Base, Fluid, and Shaver. Braun does offer a 60-day return period, but I doubt you will need it!</li>
            <li> With my participation in a Braun promotion, I have used the electric razor for several weeks now and would like to weigh in on whether it is a great shaver, or the greatest shaver! I am a shaving snob ‚Äì having used straight razors, electric shavers, and every three, four, five, twelve bladed razor out there. I have never been able find a shaver that has done a great job QUICKLY without irritation for those days that I‚Äôm running late and need to go out the door or when I‚Äôve got dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In those instances, when a normal shaver/razor would leave my skin in a ball of itchy mess I found that the Braun CoolTec shaver was FANTASTIC. The cold bar really did reduce irritation and felt great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this won‚Äôt replace my straight razor as my main implement I think it is a great shaver for on those cold, windy, razor-burn prone days and when I don‚Äôt have enough time to really do it right.</li>
            <li> When I received Braun‚Äôs CoolTec electric shaver, I really didn&#x27;t know much about it.  The last Braun electric shaver I used was an ultra inexpensive razor I purchased at the PX Store at Fort Lee (Army) more than 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My have things changed! The new CoolTec shaver is a recharging nearly self cleaning gadget with a cooling plate above and below the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  From my experience, the cooling plates reduce the skin irritation of electric shaving.  It also feels rather nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is quite narrow but very efficient in trimming those long thick whiskers.  The shaving itself was pretty good.  I had to shave the area immediately under my jaw only twice as compared to a dozen times with my other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is very large for a bathroom where there isn&#x27;t a lot of space.  If you share your bathroom with other family members and you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;his and hers&amp;#34; type sink, you will find yourself moving it again and again.  The cleaning solution is isopropyl alcohol based for sterilizing the razor &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; allowing for quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a very good razor and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec System electric shaver provided by a program run by Braun - I mean, a great company wants me to try their product - how can I turn that down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this is the coolest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It is so easy to use, my fact isn&#x27;t red, its COMFORTABLE (for the first time in many years) - its awesome!  If there was one criticism I could come up with - they need to create a ladies version of this.  My wife is very jealous that there is a razor system out there that does what this does, but she says it looks a bit too manly for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great - LOVE LOVE this system!</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me my a program ran by Braun, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The cool-tec made a big difference, I usually used a multi-blade razor, this is faster and nicer. I would recommend this product to my friends. Not as close as a multi-blade razor with shaving cream, but faster and close enough for me to use it as my everyday razor from now on. The cool-tec keeps my skin happy for whole day, something I was not used to with my other razors. If you haven&#x27;t tried cool-tec you are missing out.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver for free from Braun for a program it is running. This was my first electric razor and I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar felt good on my face, when using and prevented irritation. Had a nice close shave and my face felt nice and smooth after using.  I also like that it came with a cleaning system, I feel it will prolong the product and make the unit work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am not crazy about having to buy replacement cooling packs. I don&#x27;t want to have to keep buying additional items again and again for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I received this device from Braun test program about a month ago. I love the cleaning system that comes with it, one of the things a hate is having to clean my shaver and it does a great job with that. I however was not as impressed with the closeness of the shave, i had to use a disposable razor to clean up several areas that it would not get a close enough shave. I did enjoy the CoolTec system it kept sensitive areas from becoming irritated which I always have issues with when shaving. I would suggest this item to anyone who is not as worried about a clean shave but do get irritated areas when shaving.</li>
            <li> I got the try the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System when it was given to me via a program run by Braun. I thought the razor would get cool but was shocked at how cold it really got. It was exactly like taking a soda can out of the refrigerator and putting it on my skin. It gave me a cool comfortable close shave. My irritation issues were resolved after trying ht CoolTec System. Great buy and it even includes a nice cleaning station. Would highly recommend the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an electric shaver that not only cuts close but quickly.  I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTech has many benefits and features I do like...&lt;br /&gt;- First the obvious one, the cooling bar. It works..I would say that it&#x27;s not cool, its actually cold and it does its job cooling your face as you are shaving.  It does a great job of counteracting the shaver heating up as find with most shavers.&lt;br /&gt;- The Cutting..running back and forth over your skin you will find it very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- The self-cleaning dock and travel charger - I have used the shaver for two weeks now and using the self cleaning dock work great.  Went on a trip this past weekend and the small case and dock fit nicely in to my luggage and didn&#x27;t take much room on the counter when charging.&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly I like the overall feel  of the shaver when holding it.  Feel soft yet solid when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though...I have very thick facial hair and have to shave every day and when it comes to time spent shaving I am looking for an electric shaver that not only produces a close shave but is quick and that I don&#x27;t have to go over the same areas multiple times. Unfortunately I found when comparing to the time and closeness of a had razor, the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t meet the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun CoolTec Shaver is for someone who has sensitive skin, not thick facial hair or has more time patience to shave and would like to save the money spent on disposable expensive blades.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this razor from a program through Braun. It&#x27;s a great razor, works great! I love how smooth it makes my skin and no burning after shaving thanks to the cooling bar. The cleaning system works great! I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it this far. Also the hair trimmer works great for my sideburns and keeping my mustache and goatee trimmed nicely for my wife. She thinks my facial hair is better groomed with the cooltec by Braun.</li>
            <li> I am a participant in a Braun promotion for the CoolTec Shaving system. I have used Braun products in the past and found them always reliable. The same is true for the CoolTec razor. The cooling mechanism is a great feature. In the past I would always get the typical burn when using an electric razor, but with the CoolTec the cooling feature soothes the skin leave my skin feeling refreshed. The accessories are nice too. You have a travel case to keep your razor safe, a charger base, and a charge/cleaning station. The cleaning station is great because it save you time from doing the standard breakdown cleaning. This would be great gift for the special guy, brother, dad, or grandad in your life. It is a great value here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver!!!  Provides a very close shave.  Shaver also leaves your skin feeling very refreshed and feeling very cool.  The product also includes a docking station that cleans and charges your shaver having it ready to go for the next time you need to shave.  Easy to use and even easier to maintain.  A great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> With my participation in a Braun promotion, I have used the electric razor for a some time now and would like to provide some thoughts to help guide your electric razor decision. I am a bit of a razor junkie, owning the Braun Series 7, Activator, and also a few models from Norelco. Since I have fairly sensitive skin, even though each razor performed well, all left varying degrees of skin irritation behind. I usually mitigated this by using after shave or lotions, but what this razor has done is very innovative and honestly has saved me a lot of money in aftershave and skin lotions. For the purposes of this review, I will compare to the Braun Series 7 because it is similar in design and branding, as well as a traditional Gillette razor because many will be coming from this setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver performs at a high level and with some time you will get results comparable to a Gillette razor. Compared to a Series 7 the results are similar, but because the Series 7 has a faster motor, less passes are required, although this benefit also comes at the expense of higher prices. Each shaver has Braun Optifoil screen which is essential a set of oblong shapes on the foil to catch more hairs. I can attest that compared to many of Braun&#x27;s older shavers, this feature does work very well. Battery life is very similar to the Series 7, giving about 50 minutes of shaving even is the CoolTec is activated. To give a good perspective, I have ranked them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance - Series 7/CoolTec/Gillette&lt;br /&gt;Results - Gillette/Series 7/CoolTec&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort for the CoolTec is paramount primarily due to the CoolTec sensation that is provided while shaving. The science behind this feature is that as you shave; your skin temperature goes up, thus causing irritation with further shaving. Keep your skin cool helps reduce this occurrence, therefore no need for aftershave/lotions! The cooling feature takes ten seconds or so to kick in, but it makes for very comfortable results.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Series 7 and Gillette razors, comfort is night and day for those with sensitive skin. With the Series 7, there is harshness to your skin which creates bumps or bleeding, I would assume due to both the speed of the shaver and heat level of the skin. The CoolTec shaves at a slower clip and cools the skin down, which means it will take longer to shave, but you will be very comfortable with that shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of convenience, both the CoolTec and Series 7 have cleaning bases. What this allows you to do is after each shave, you can place the razor in an accompanying base which will automatically clean and charge the razor. This removes an maintenance you may need to do (other than the 18 month blade change) because the shaver is cleaned and lubricated after each shave. It should be noted that these cleaning cartridges do run about $1 USD each week, so it is an investment. In lieu of this, you can clean the shave under running water and invest in a bottle of Shaver Saver to get the same results but with more manual intervention. Overall the shave base is nice in that my sink real estate is saved a bit by sprawling cords and shaver parts drying all over the place, and I feel the investment is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price component is a big differentiator for many, with nearly a $100 USD difference between the two razors.&lt;br /&gt;What you will find is that the Series 7 is the Lexus of the group, with very fast performance, extra bells and whistles (three modes of shaving), and nicer aesthetics. This razor is excellent and honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong selecting this on a deal.&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec shaver is very much a specialty razor. Essentially you will get the same results as a Series 7 because the foil is very similar. The difference will be in shaving time because of the slower motor on the CoolTec. What you gain is the ability to cool your face downand greatly increase comfort during the shaving process. This makes for one of the only electric shavers today tailor made for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, Braun has a real winner here and a very big product differentiator from competitors. Being that the CoolTec is essentially a Series 3 with a cooling module, I can see them putting this feature on all Series models in future iterations because it works so well. Braun packages this German-made shaver very well and includes Carrying Case, Cleaning Base, Fluid, and Shaver. Of the 15+ shavers I have used in my lifetime (and some manual shaving too), this razor is by far the best because instead of making the motors bigger and faster, Braun decided to focus on comfort as well. Not having to spend countless dollars on aftershave/lotion alone makes this razor a great return on investment. Should you not like the razor, Braun does offer a 60-day return period, but I doubt you will need it!</li>
            <li> Works Great and is the best shaver i have ever used. It feels great on your face and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain. I received the razor as part or a program run by Braun and I am really happy i have it. I recommend everyone to get one.</li>
            <li> I generally have problems with electric shavers, both due to my sensitive skin and the difficulties in truly keeping them clean, so I wouldn&#x27;t usually purchase one but for this was provided via a program run by Braun. The CoolTec system seems to alleviate both of my common complaints! I had grown a short beard as part of &amp;#34;No Shave November&amp;#34;, and the trimmer on the shaver had no problem shortening it before I used the regular shaver and its cooling sensation to take it down the rest of the way. After trying both the regular setting as well as the cool setting, I have to say that both were pretty nice and smooth! I was pleasantly surprised with the smooth shave from an electric razor. Since taking the beard off, I have cleaned the shaver and noted how easy the process was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set up was super easy - the instructions were easy to understand. My only complaint would be the size of the charging/cleaning station, which is too large for the counter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This system really does leave the skin feeling closely shaven and cool.  Not like other electric shavers that leave the skin feeling hot.  However, the Charging/Cleaning station is huge.  This is not for a NYC apartment.  I could not keep it on the sink and as a result had to find another place to put it.  Just needed to mention, this electric shaver was provided by a program run by Braun to review the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/18/2013:&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for a few weeks, I have noticed it does not work well on my neck area.  It definitely is not as close as a shave as I get on my face (cheeks, chin, upper lip).  After shaving, I also get discomfort on the neck area.  The skin at first does feel cool from the \\&quot;Cooltec system\\&quot; but then becomes hot after a minute or two.  I received this shaver from a program run by Braun to review the product.</li>
            <li> I havent found many electric shavers which I like too much. There was many aspects to this shaver. The reverese side was helpful for me due to the fact I have very thick facial hair. So normally i have to use a trimmer than shave after. With the trimmer built in it is definately more convenient. The actaul shaver did leave my skin very smooth and the cold aspect did help sooth after shaving and the alcohol in the cleaning aspect helps where you do not have to use aftershave. The only problem or negative part of the shaver for my use was i didnt feel as if it shaved as close on my neck as my face. Wasn&#x27;t noticeable to sight, but was by feel to me. Other than that it did not create any irritation or redness whatsoever which even the most expensive new razors usual cause on my neck (my neck seems to always be irritated after shaving). So overall i would highly recommend it, and one of my favorite parts is how easy they made it to clean. The charging station is convenient and also the fact its waterproof, running the electric razor under water like a regular razor does help clean away the shaved hair. The biggest use I will get out of it will be the fact I can use it in the shower. I hate the length of time it takes me to shave everyday, so i try to skip a couple days a week. With this, I&#x27;ll keep it in the shower and use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I received this Braun CoolTec System though a program run by Braun.  I have had Braun shavers in the past and have loved the clean and renew system.  That is why I chose to try this Braun CoolTec System out.  I figured they have made great products in the past, so what else could they do for my sensitive hair growing face?  Well they did a lot.  The fact is that my facial hair is course, grows fast, and the skin below all of this is very sensitive to razor burn and ingrown hairs.  But enough about me.  The active cooling technology cooling bar on the shaver seems to do the trick for me.  I have used this shaver going on 3 days now, and there is no irritation, and when I am done shaving I have a baby butt smooth face.  Which is good , since I usually only get that close of a shave with my Gillette Fusion blades.  The first day I tried it, I had 3 days growth, and I gave the shaver a work out.  It did a top notch job on my lip, cheeks, and chin.  However the neck didn&#x27;t get that short.  I had a few stragglers, but that is true when using any electric shaver.  So I nipped them down with my Fusion and off I went.  Now the cooling bar on this thing is surprisingly cool.  I know it probably is good for maintaining the blades, blah, blah, but it felt good on my face.  I think that the cooling bar was actually what kept my face from getting irritated.  So since day one, day 2 and 3 have been the same with one exception.  The neck hair actually gets cut when I shave within 24 hours of my last shave.  That amazes me.  All of my past electrics, including the Braun&#x27;s I have had never did so well on neck hair.  This one does great.  I do have one complaint for Braun, and that is to get the long hair trimmers on the side of the shavers of the future to actually cut all the hair they touch.  The clipper side just isn&#x27;t that great.  It is just a minor complication, and will not keep me from giving this razor a 5 out of 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I got this electric shaver a few days ago through a program run by Braun and it works great. I am a bald guy and always looking for a quicker shave for my head. I figured it does such a good job with my face I would try it on my head. Worked great!!! Any doubts in buying this for a close comfortable shave don&#x27;t. It is a great product. The cleaning station works great also quick and leaves the shaver spotless. The only issue I had was the battery life. When you are shaving with out the CoolTec feature activated the battery life is 45 minutes which is great. When the CoolTec feature is activated the battery life is only about 15 minutes when shaving your face this is fine but when doing your head and face it cuts it kind of close. Other than that the product works great the foil blades clean easily if rinsed under warm water and if that doesn&#x27;t work the clean station cleans it in about 3 minutes which is very quick. This shaver is a great product and leaves your face less irritated, I would have not used it on my dome if it didn&#x27;t work so well on my face.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system from a program ran by Braun. I will say this is the best electric shaver I have every used. The first time I used it I noticed no skin irritation, no drag on the skin and over all a fairly close shave. Previous razors that I had used always left splotches, redness and a burning sensation.  I will say that I get a closer shave with a traditional razor but I am considering using this day to day. The best benefit for me was being able to come off after work and get a quick shave in before going out that evening. You can get rid of the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow and not be left with any redness or burn marks. I would highly recommend the razor to anyone needing a good quick shave. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that fact that I get a closer shave with a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> Best Braun System I have ever used.  I have used Braun quite a bit in my days because being in the military, an electric shave is much preferred to cutting yourself with a razor.  And This new CoolTec system is by far the best.  First of all, it has been the easiest to hold and use.  It just fits perfectly in your grip.  Second, the cleaning system and extra charging station are perfect, especially if you are the person that shaves in the shower.  No wires and no way to ruin the razor., Third, it is a clean shave every time because of the cleaning system that keeps it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this razor every day if I needed to stay fresh and clean and presentable.  By the way, it also has the short hair trimmer to get those pesky places  that you don&#x27;t want to shave but just trim.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big electric razor fan until i got the Braun CoolTec System shaving system. The cooling action start pretty quick after pressing the cooling button and leaves the skin feeling clean close shaved and refreshed. When you are done shaving just insert the shaver into the charging station and press the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; button and it is ready to go the next day all clean and charged. This is a great shaving system for anyone skeptic on electric razors to try.</li>

            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun.  The shaver fits nicely in my hand in the shower, but it is heavier than what I am used to holding. The CoolTec feels WONDERFUL on my face after the shave and leaves it feeling less irritated.  I also like the alcohol based fluid that helps to clean the razor.  It does need the charger, so if you travel, you will need to take it with you which can be somewhat of a hassle when you are trying to travel light.</li>
            <li> I think I have a really thick beard and the hair tends to grow in different directions. So when I was offered to try the Braun CoolTech shaver CT5cc thru a program run by Braun, my natural first reaction was...\\&quot;Its a lost cause on my face\\&quot;. Out of the box, Braun Cooltech shaver felt like it was build solid with no loose parts, ergonomic to hold, the main beard blade was on the top with two moving parts and the straight blade for trimming was on the back and located clearly out of the way. The shaver also came with a charge and clean system. Setup was easy and everything was provided to get you started right away. I let the system fully charge before I used it. I turned the shaver &#x27;on&#x27; and the &#x27;active cool&#x27;....I first started on the right chin, the shave felt totally different from what I thought it would feel like....the shaver felt cool and light on my skin and it was really giving me a shave....a close shaver for that matter. I slowly worked the shaver all over the right side and incredibly it was picking up those beard hairs of mine that grow in various directions with ease. The shaver seemed to adapt to my face contour really well, cutting thru different hair sizes well. Unlike shavers of the past, all the hair I was shaving off seemed to be caught in the shaver. I thought this was really cool and made things a lot less messy. This was just the right side, so now I had to see if it would hold the same performance for the left side and front neck area on the same charge. The shaver effortlessly performed the same way through out my whole face and neck, shaving off all my beard hair and giving me a close enough shave. The cool tech feature really does cool the shaving area and really did seem to keep off any skin irritations. I relate the significant reduction of irritation clearly to how cool the shaver really gets when you press the &#x27;Active cooling&#x27; button. Once I was done shaving I placed the shaver on the &#x27;Clean and Charge&#x27; station and the station started to clean my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this shaver a five rating, as it did pick up all my beard hair, gave me a close enough shave and did not cause any skin irritation. Electric shavers have now come a long way from what they were in the past. I personally think its high time we all had a good look at them again as an essential part of our everyday routine.....simply because they seem to have made my everyday life much easier, less messy, more hygienic, cleaner and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Clean and close shave, Gets even those stubborn hairs easily, Significantly lesser skin irritation, Fast charge, 4+ shaves per charge, Easy clean &amp; charge, Trimmer included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cos: No attachments for keeping and maintaining a beard if you have one. \\&quot;clean and Renew\\&quot; system refills every three months.</li>
            <li> I recently starting using the Braun Cool Tec electric shaver (as I recently received it through a program with Braun) and I have been pretty impressed with the overally shave and how close to the skin the razor gets.  I very much have enjoyed having the cooling aluminium running across the lenght of the razor head and I also thinking having a charging / cleaning station is excellent as I like that there is a cleaning solution (alchol base) that really gives the shaver head a deep clean, so it works as well as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommnend this product to any friends or family that is looking for a great shave with the added benefit that the electric razor is water proof and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any irritation on my face or neck from the razor.  This razor delivers a superior shave and the product seems to have the appreacance in the shape and size as a very high end product.</li>
            <li> I have never spent a lot of money on shavers.  Over the years, Ive always bought a lower priced shaver and just replaced when it quit on me.  My whole thought process on buying shavers has changed forever after getting the Braun Cool Tec shaver through a program run by Braun.  WOW.  Let me start with one of the most remarkable features for me...the cooling technology.  I had low expectations of this as I expected it to be just a hook that delivered little bang.  I was wrong.  The cooling bar feels so great during the shave.  It feels like a bar of ice running along your face as you shave!  Next, the shave itself is remarkable.  The closeness is something Im not used to!  It clears the hair with ease and without irritation!  Next, Ive never been one to be on top of cleaning my shaver.  I would run it through water once a week or so....the Braun Cool Tec shaver system has a built in cleaner and lubricator.  You just place the shaver in the unit after shaving and it does all the work, with precision!  This is the complete package!  I&#x27;m so thankful I got this shaver and you will be too!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Solo through a special program run by Braun.  After using the shaver for about two full weeks, I am still satisfied with the overall use and results from the shaver.  I immediately noticed the effects of the aluminum cooling bar on my face and neck.  Just a simple click of a button, and the cooling bar is activated, cooling down to a 44 degree mark, and provides a very soothing effect during my shaving activities.  I have always shaved a &amp;#34;dry run,&amp;#34; and my skin reacts to additional products such as the lotions and gels that can be used with many electric razors.  With the Braun CoolTec Solo, there is no need for additional product.  The cooling bar provides that relief DURING the shave with no extra mess, time, or effort.  My skin not only typically reacts to the use of additional products, but it is also very sensitive to the rub and warmth of the electric shaver.  No matter how careful I may be, my neck most especially becomes very irritated, red, and blotchy.  With the use of the Braun CoolTec Solo, that redness and irritation is gone.  My face feels good during the shave and right after.  No &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; period needed between in order to feel comfortable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the cooling comfort, the adaptable three stage cutting system with the Sensoblade provides and excellent, very close shave.  Not quite the absolute baby smooth fine feeling (across the grain, so to speak), but very close and very adequate for a day&#x27;s work.  The trimmer accessory is also one of the best I have had the opportunity to use.  The charge stays good for days, even in using the cooling technology with every shave, every day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the Braun CoolTec Solo and would highly recommend one for purchase.  This was the first foil topped shaver I have used in my adult life; I have always used a three headed spiral type shaver before.  I have no complaints and would definitely recommend this one to at least try, if one is interested.t least try, if one is interested.</li>
            <li> Ireceived this shaver through a program ran by Braun.  This is a good shaver. I love being able to use it in the shower. Saves a lot of time in the mornings for me before I go into work. It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it&#x27;s better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past. The weight on the handheld is perfect. Not too heavy, but not too light. You can actually tell there&#x27;s something in your hand and it&#x27;s easy to grip.The blades are sharp and do not tug. This causes little irritation and results in a comfortable shave experience. CoolTec is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning. The cover pops off easily for easy maintenance and care. Top of the line. G</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Braun shaver customer, so I was very excited when Braun sent me a new CoolTec electric razor to try. I loved my previous Braun shaver but one of my biggest complaints was how hot it would get; and how my face would burn when finished shaving. This new CoolTec shaver is amazing. The razor and my skin stayed ice cold the entire time I used it. Braun makes a solid product and this new unit feels just a rugged. And I really like that it has a rubberized texture to it. It feels good in your hand and will not slip even if wet. That is another feature this shaver has, you can use it wet or dry. My other razor was dry only. I have not tried using it wet yet; I&#x27;ll have to test that and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint, and it might just be because of my hair type, is that it takes longer to shave with the new CoolTec shaver than it did with my old Braun. I have rather thick hair and I noticed that the holes in the foil of the CoolTec shaver seem to be a little smaller and arranged differently than my other shaver. This causes me to have to go over areas multiple times and really pull the skin to get it to trim the hair. I think this is just a minor inconvenience to deal with seeing how cool the razor stays and how I don&#x27;t get the irritation like I did from my other shaver. I think the CoolTec is a great product and other than the extra couple minutes I have to spend shaving, I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor for the past 11 years and loved it! I feel Braun has the best shavers out there. So when Braun asked me to try out their Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver, I was definitely interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple weeks so I am still getting used to it as all electric shavers are different and need a work in time with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a nice clean shave same as my Series 7. A+&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec part of it was odd the first time to say the least. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. It feels like an ice cube on your face as you shave. Even though your face isn&#x27;t wet it actually feels like it was. The real surprise was that it did in fact reduce skin irritation. A&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge system is similar to my 7 Series and uses the SAME cleaning cartridges so I didn&#x27;t have to buy new ones and waste what I had! That being said, the cleaning process is a lot quicker than my last one so I don&#x27;t know if it gets as clean and sterilized as the 7. I will monitor this. Still gets an A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer extension is a little smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as my last one. It still does the work just takes a little more time. B&lt;br /&gt;I have a goatee and this razor makes it a little more difficult to get close to the goatee. Therefore shaving time is increased by trying to get in close. B-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I am still in the trial stage, but to this point I would recommend this razor. The CoolTec part of this razor is a feature that surprised me the most. I really didn&#x27;t think I would be able to skip using lotion to cool my skin afterwards. After the third use my skin didn&#x27;t have that after shave hot feeling!&lt;br /&gt;Important note: If you have never used an electric razor before, it may take up to a month for your skin and beard to adjust to it. I honestly will never go back to a blade!</li>
            <li> I got this as an upgrade to my old Braun Activator 8600 when its trimmer broke.  The old foils still work, but I need a trimmer to really hit some of the trouble spots.    The CoolTec shaver definitely delivers on its promise of getting you a cool shave.  There is a bar that sits in the middle between the foil elements that draws heat away from the foil and is very refreshing.  I have had no irritation at all when using this shaver.    Unfortunately, the shave that it provides is only decent at best, especially compared to my old shaver.  It takes many passes to even get short hairs and it feels like the cool bar detracts from the shave quality by spacing out two of the foil elements.  Since there is little irritation, it&#x27;s often not a problem running over the same spot multiple times, but I eventually feel like I just have to give up and move on with my day.  It&#x27;s impossible to get some long hairs without a trimmer (something the old shaver couldn&#x27;t do either).  All in all, not a bad shave and the CoolTec has a very nice feel, but I expected more for the price.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  UPDATED - August 12, 2014    I&#x27;ve been meaning to write an update but haven&#x27;t gotten around to it.  I originally gave this product 3 stars because I did not feel it was worth the money but wanted to give it more time to see if I would get used to it.  Since then, its performance has degraded into mediocrity and I&#x27;ve hated using it.  The \\&quot;CoolTec\\&quot; feature is useless since the foils are unable to get some spots at all.  Its only redeeming quality is it&#x27;s barely functional trimmer (you can buy better ones for cheaper).  The shave is inferior to my almost 10 year old Activator 8600.  New foils might make this shaver marginally better, but I have no desire to waste any more money on this product.  Strongly do not recommend.</li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES it!  The cooling strip is awesome!  He also loves the fact that he can &amp;#34;multitask&amp;#34; while he is shaving....</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun 790CC since 2008 and have always really liked that model.  About a month ago I was shopping for the replacement head for the 790CC when I came across the new Cooltec.  The trimmer on my 790CC was broke and I was also having problems with the cleaning unit so I decided to give the Cooltec shaver a try.  The cooling feature is really nice and it really does keep your skin cool.  The shave was alright, but it seemed to take forever and I would end up with a few razor bumps here and there.  I know this can happen as your neck adjusts to a different shaver so I kept at it for a month.  Well, after a month it did not get any better and the shave was just not as close as the 790CC.  I really wanted to keep it because the cool feature felt really good, but the shave was just not close enough and I was always left with the razor bumps.  So after a month I returned it and purchased the new 790CC.  I am really happy with the new 790CC...now if they could only add the Cooltec feature to the 790CC I think they would have the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my skin is probably a big part of why this shaver works so terribly.  However, it&#x27;s marketed as a way to minimize irritation and it did no such thing for me.  The cool bar does feel good, but the shaver simply did not cut my hair, so I needed to go over my face countless times to get a half-decent shave.  Because of that, my face needed a pint of aloe afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it dry, wet, with electric shave (you&#x27;re not supposed to use any additional products with it but it was NOT working otherwise so I gave it a try) and I kept it for a few weeks to give it a chance.  No dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with cleaning liquid, apparently making the whole package ineligible for return.  If I can&#x27;t return it, it&#x27;s going on craigslist or in the trash so it can&#x27;t hurt me any more. The cleaning system is also loud and it sounds like a trash compactor, so it&#x27;s one more reason for a poor rating.  I&#x27;m sure this would work on some people&#x27;s faces, but if you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;re typically a tough shave (especially on the neck-this thing is bad) I would recommend against this shaver.  Back to a light-handed disposable razor for me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  apparently the rechargeable battery is the reason it cannot be returned, but Amazon&#x27;s customer service contacted me about a resolution.  We buy a lot from Amazon and never had a problem, and the way they handled this issue was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have had the chance to use the CoolTec razor for a few weeks now as part of a promotion from Braun and have to say that it is just okay.  I have typically used a rotating head shaver for years and was a bit leary of trying a strip head razor.  The idea of the cool bar integrated on it is a innovative and fantastic idea.  To me, this is probably the best part of this razor and I really do like the way it feels on my skin.  However, since I&#x27;ve been trying this razor out, I have had continual issues with getting a very close shave.  It does pretty well on my face and chin area but I&#x27;ve struggled with getting a close shave on my neck.  It has trouble grasping the hairs even though I stretch my skin areas as recommended.  I often find stray hairs that have been missed and get longer.  Even though I try shaving in multiple directions, before a shower, or after a shower, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before with my rotating head shaver and will probably go back to using that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of the cleaning system is a good idea, but takes up room that I just don&#x27;t have and I don&#x27;t like the idea of needing to purchase the cleaning solution on a continual basis.  I have always just rinsed my shavers under the sink after each use and this has work just fine for years.  Again, nice idea, but I believe a bit unnecessary and over-the-top.  If I purchased this razor for the price it goes for I would be very disappointed I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this 3 stars for being just &#x27;Okay&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System as a part of a program run by Braun.  I was extremely excited to get this item as I was growing tired of my old electric razor.  I was impressed by the features of this razor.  First of all, I have never thought about shaving with the razor being &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;, and I was interested in how this was going to work.  I was also interested in seeing how the cleaning/charging system would work.  After unpacking the box and setting the system up, I was ready to shave for the first time.  I have to say, that the cool bar, piece of metal, that gets really cold, is refreshing and cool.  The razor does a great job of shaving my face.  It took a few times, due to my beard progress through No Shave November (I chose to keep the mustache only!!).  It also was great to have a long hair trimmer attached to the back, which allowed me to trim up my mustache.  After finishing my first shave, it was time to put the razor back on the charger and give it a clean.  You put the item in the charging base and press the button on the base.  It begins to clean the razor with a cleaning solution, that you add into the base upon set up.  After cleaning, the razor was nice and fresh and smelled clinical, which I do not mind.  My old razor could only be rinsed off, which I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am very grateful that Braun gave me this razor to enjoy.  I enjoy using it and like the feel that the CoolTec system provides.</li>
            <li> I was provided this shaver via a program run by Braun and what can I say?  This product is simply amazing and amazing in its simplicity.  To start with the obvious advantage.  The cooling element works amazingly.  I have VERY sensitive skin and after three weeks of using this product 3 times a week I have yet to have to use any of the cream I&#x27;ve previously had to use for my overly sensitive skin.  For my needs the closeness of the shave is on par but I can see how it my not cut it for people who wear thicker facial hair than I do.  It even works great for me shaving my head since I wear my hair so low.</li>
            <li> I recently received a Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system via a program run by Braun, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail. I was checking several times a day to receive the new state-of-the-art product. After I finally received the product I ripped the box open as I would any present on Christmas day. There were several pieces in the box that made no sense to me. I had to use the manual to help decipher what certain pieces provided were for (keep in mind this is my first shaving system). I&#x27;ve always been a traditional shaving cream, and straight razor kind of guy. The manual was not organized very well, and not much help. I let it charge up overnight so I could use it when I woke up. I had about 3 days of scruff growing on my face. I turned it on first thing when I woke up, and it worked like a beauty. It cut right through all my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling. My traditional razor would always pull on my face after a couple days of facial growth. After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean. The different cutting technology in this razor allowed for it to cut all my facial hair without putting the razor at weird angles. The cooling system works great in reducing the amount of friction or shaving irritation with this razor. I have had no irritation every time I&#x27;ve shaved with the cooling system on. Based on the cutting and performance of the razor I would give this product I would give this 5 stars. However, the cleaning system is what knocked it down a star. The cleaning system is sub-par, and doesn&#x27;t properly clean the razor. Once I set it in the cleaning base, it would activate like it was going to clean, and then it shut off. I have still been unable to properly clean the razor like it&#x27;s supposed to work. This is a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into a shaving system.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System via a program run by Braun. At first, I used it after not having shaved for a week, and found it difficult and long to get a close shave. However, the aluminum cooling bar ACTUALLY WORKS!! I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving. Once I shaved my face (which took a while) I have found this razor to be excellent for everyday shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Cooling Bar Eliminates Irritation&lt;br /&gt;*Sleek Design, easy to hold and love the charging base&lt;br /&gt;* Easy, quick to shave as long as you don&#x27;t wait too many days!&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Sometimes takes going over the skin a few times to get a close shave&lt;br /&gt;*Not good when you haven&#x27;t shaved for a longer amount of time (But most electric razors aren&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> I was provided this Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun. My first thoughts after receiving this shaver was all of the items that was included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Braun CoolTec Shaver&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Clean &amp; Charge Station&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Cleaning Solution Cartridge&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Charging Cradle&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Travel Pouch&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ SmartPlug&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Cleaning Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was simple to put together and I was really impressed by the Clean &amp; Charge Station that actively cleans your shaver after use while also recharging it. No need to manually clean it and oil it after every use like your traditional shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Easy setup with charging station, shaver, and additional charger.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Close clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Keeps your face and neck cold while shaving so that it provides instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Easy to clean, just set the shaver in the Clean &amp; Charge station and press power.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Additional charging cradle for use on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ The first couple of shaves were a little irritating, but I find this to be the same with all electric shavers for the first few uses. After about 2 shaves, it was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Cost of additional clean and renew solution cartridges. I found them on Amazon.com for about $5 a piece, but having never paid for a solution for my shaver, this is a new cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed the quality, comfort, and ease of the Braun CoolTec Shaver. I would definitely recommend this to other men who haven‚Äôt had much success with other electric shavers. This is definitely the best overall shaver that I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system through a program offer by Braun and was presently surprised on how easily it was to set up and use. I have not used an electric  razor for many years and was impressed with how the CoolTec left little irritation. How ever I was very disappointed by the closeness of the shave. It way work well on some but just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I definitely prefer the closeness of using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec razor via a program run by Braun. I am always in search of the best when it comes to shaving, as it is a part of my daily routine. I have very thick facial hair, and need to shave daily for work. When the razor arrived, I quickly opened the package, set it up, and waited for the charging to be complete. When shaving, it seemed as though the razor wasn&#x27;t cutting very well. The shave was not close by any means. I tried going over the same areas multiple times. I tried holding my skin tighter, and shaving in different directions. None of these techniques worked, unfortunately. I thought perhaps I had a dull blade? Or wasn&#x27;t following the directions correctly? But this does not appear to be the case. The cooling feature is nice, and is probably my favorite aspect of the device. I only wish the razor worked as I had hoped. The product looks sleek, the packaging was nice, the directions were easy to follow, and the charging station is the perfect size - not too bulky. I just wish I could get a better shave out of this.</li>
            <li> I actually got this shaver from Braun to test it out. I&#x27;ve tried a few other electric razors but I always seem to go back to a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; multi-blade manual razor full time. My hope when I tested this Braun CooTec was to see if I could find an electric razor that I could incorporate into my shaving regimen as at least for those times I don&#x27;t have the time and/or energy to get all lathered up. And to my pleasant surprise, I think I&#x27;ve accomplished that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- CoolTec actually works&lt;br /&gt;- No need to use shaving gel or aftershave lotion&lt;br /&gt;- No need to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; your skin to get used to using the razor (other electric razors make you do it); doesn&#x27;t keep you from switching back-and-forth between traditional blade shaving&lt;br /&gt;- Pretty close and comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;- Quick charging&lt;br /&gt;- Kind of nice to have a push-button cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;- Can get it wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to shave around things like mustaches (some of the testing was done during Movember)&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes have to go over hard to maneuver spots multiple times&lt;br /&gt;- Additional long-term cost of cleaning solution if you want to utilize the cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;- Have to be mindful not to try and use it on longer facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a better than expected experience and the CoolTec feature delivers.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver via a program run by Braun.  It came at the perfect time, as I was about ready to replace my more than 10 year old Braun Synchro 7505.  My experience with the Braun CoolTec shaver was both positive and negative.  Let me break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT&#x27;S GOOD?&lt;br /&gt;The main selling point of the CoolTech is that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;World&#x27;s 1st shaver with active cooling technology\\&quot;.  This feature is designed to cool your skin and reduce irritation.  I found that this feature worked great.  When you turn on the cooling feature, an electro-ceramic cooling element cools the skin as you shave.  It cools quickly, works remarkably well and delivers the benefit it advertises.  Every time I used the shaver my skin was left irritation free and it gave me a more comfortable shave than other shavers I have tried.  This cooling feature does come with a tradeoff, which I&#x27;ll get to later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun claims that the adaptable 3-stage cutting system provides a closer shave.  They&#x27;re spot on.  When comparing the shave I got from the CoolTech to the shave I have been getting from my Synchro - there&#x27;s no contest.  The CoolTech shaves closer and smoother.  Certainly that&#x27;s a feature that you&#x27;re looking for in an electric shaver and this shaver has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s another positive: all the hair stays inside the head of the shaver!  I mention this because so many electric shavers \\&quot;leak\\&quot; shavings all over your sink and counter (my Synchro does).  The Braun CoolTech traps all shavings in the head until you&#x27;re ready to dump them.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT&#x27;S NOT SO GOOD?&lt;br /&gt;While the active cooling technology is great and it does its job well, it comes at a cost.  The cooling element is (as you might expect) sandwiched directly in between the main cutting elements.  This \\&quot;gap\\&quot; between the blades makes for wider shaver head and an odd sensation especially when shaving up near the ears or below the nose.  It feels that the shave would be more efficient if the two blades were together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was never quite sure how to hold the shaver.  I must have rotated it twenty times while shaving just to see 1) the most comfortable way to hold it and 2) the way to hold it that gets me the best shave.  I have still not yet determined the answer to this conundrum but I will say this:  It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long-hair trimmer may well be the worst aspect of the shaver.  It&#x27;s pretty much useless.  The lack of power to the trimmer made it impossible to trim my sideburn (not thick at all).  To test the trimmer (and to make sure it was actually getting power), I touched it to a piece of cardboard.  It made almost no mark.  You simply cannot use this trimmer at all.  That means you&#x27;ll need a second sculpting razor handy.  That&#x27;s a big negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTech package comes with a cleaning station similar to those that Braun has been using for several years.  This was my first experience with the cleaning station and I found it to be very good.  It cleaned the razor in about 3 minutes and allowed for a great place to charge the unit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Having used the Synchro for over 10 years, it will take some getting used to using the CoolTech, but I&#x27;m planning on making that happen.  I have had excellent results with Braun products and I have no reason to believe that, if properly taken care of, this CoolTech shaver will last me many years.  It&#x27;s hard for me to say that this is an excellent product due to the drawbacks I&#x27;ve mentioned above but the unique cooling technology is a great feature.  If Braun were to change just a couple other things about this shaver, it would have a superior product on its hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/17/13&lt;br /&gt;Having used this shaver for several weeks now, I have upped my rating to 4/5 stars.  The shaver really does deliver all it says it will.  It keeps the skin cool and provided a close, smooth shave.  I have gotten used to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).  The cleaning system works perfectly - cleaning the shaver back to out-of-the-box condition.  The long-hair trimmer is still the weakest part of this shaver.  It&#x27;s pretty powerless.  The CoolTech is nice, quality shaving system and is definitely worth a look should you be on the market for a new shaver.d to the weight of the shaver (heavier than many) and the split shaving head (split by the cooling ceramic).

            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.  I have had a number of electric shavers that claim you can clean them and the second i do that and follow the instructions they no longer work.  With the Cool Tec shaver, which i received free from a promotion from Braun, all i have to do is press a button and the shaver cleans itself.  It is great.  The shave i better thsan my old electric shavers and since I do not have time to use a regular blade razor, this is my only option and it is great.  I get a close shave, the cool tec option really helps with getting the hair close and it sooths the skin while shaving.  All around I love this shaver.  the only issue i would have is the price, i am not sure i would spen that kind of money on a shaver, but i do see the value in it.</li>
            <li> I was invited to participate in a promotion, to use and review this razor by Braun.  I have been using this Shaving System for more than a month now, and I will say, it has provided me with a much more pleasant electric shaving experience.  I have never really found an electric razor that performs adequately on my skin.  I have extremely coarse facial hair that grows in all different directions, and they tend to pull my hairs, and nick my face.  Not so for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few Philips brand electric shavers with the same style foil.  This razor managed to cut almost all of the hairs in one pass, whereas the Philips would take several, leading to an increase in irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of irritation, WOW.  This cooltec system has greatly reduced the amount of redness, and soreness over my previous electric.  The little strip of cooling surface feels great against my face, and it also seems to reduce the irritation.  It really does cool your face a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is water resistant up to a few meters, like most, so you could use it to shave in the shower.  I tried this, but of course the hot water negated most of the cooling effect.  It has a very small cooling surface, so in my case, it wasn&#x27;t able to keep up with the heat put out by my water.  It still provided an impressive improvement in the amount of times I had to go back over an area of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed using this razor, and may not go back to shaving exclusively with a DE Safety razor.  The price seems very fair for what this razor provides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less irritation&lt;br /&gt;Quicker shave times&lt;br /&gt;And I almost forgot to mention, IT CLEANS ITSELF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been electrics around for a while that do this, so that isn&#x27;t by itself that impressive, but it is VERY quiet compared to others that I have used (when cleaning).  One issue that I had with this though, it occasionally emitted a very high pitched electrical whine while charging on the cleaning base.  It annoyed my cats greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this razor.  If you are looking to try something new, have sensitive skin, or hair that grows in a lot of different directions, this one is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried an electric shaver since I was in high school, when I discovered that my facial hair was very course. The electric shaver worked poorly, especially on my neck, so I stopped using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this new shaver &amp; of course decided to try it out. Overall I found the shave better than expected, but still not as close on the neck as I need. I don&#x27;t blame the shaver; I just have course hair that grows downward not upward. The cooling features are pretty cool (no pun intended) and aren&#x27;t as gimmicky as I imagined they&#x27;d be. For men with finer facial hair this would be a great buy. I&#x27;m going to give this to our 14-year old son, who is starting to shave regularly himself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy with this shaver, very solid non-slip grip, battery last a long time with out charging, charger and cleaner all in one space saving, the ice cold feature just a press of a button and activate almost instantly, it does get really cold, love the feature that it have and combine together really well, but one thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t work very if the beard gets a little longer, and it still left over little bit of hair that it didn&#x27;t catch which i have to use my old fashion shaver to finish the job (no big deal, it still catches 99% of it), but over all great shaver! love the cooling feature and quick and easy to use! will recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this shaving system via a program run by Braun. I want to start out and say that I have been a rotary electric shaver for the last 10 years or so. This was the first foil shaver I have used in a long time and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The comfort of the styling grip was great, and the cooling sensation of the aluminum bar is even better. I normally don&#x27;t have issues with skin irritation with electric razors but this is just more comfortable. The closeness of the shave was great on the face and around the chin. However, the neck area is where this razor lacks and hence why only 4 stars. After making several passes and different directions, I still needed to use a disposable razor to clean up what this electric missed. The recharging/cleaning station is great and makes re-use that much easier. Overall I would say this is a great razor geared for those with sensitive skin and I would recommend others give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun electric shaver for several years now, so when offered the opportunity to participate in a trial program for some new technology I was more than happy to jump in. Right out of the box you will notice a difference with this system. The razor handle itself has been slimmed down from previous models making it comfortable to hold and manipulate around the curves your face. The cooling bar (which sticks up between the two foil screens) kicks in immediately, doing an amazing job at keeping down the irritation that normally comes with using an electric razor, especially in the area under the jaw bone. As expected the head comes off for easy cleaning and also comes with a cleaning solution helping the razor feel like new for every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box is everything you see here including a cleaning brush and charging cord. The only complaint I have about the razor is the charging/cleaning base that it comes with. More specifically the power cord for that base. Its located on the back of the unit and is angled upwards, meaning that if its against your wall or mirror, its easy to bump causing the power cord to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from needing to be thoughtful as to the placement of the base, its a great system and highly recommended. If you do not currently have an irritation-reducing shaving system and are considering one, Braun CoolTec has the solution for you.</li>
            <li> Love it. Could be better. I got this for free from Bzzagent, and tried it immediately. I am a five blade razor kind of guy, so I was a little apprehensive to try a shaver like this. I like the cooling effects, which is one of the reasons I have stayed away from shavers in the past - I know they get hot during use. Otherwise, I will have to say that my face needs to get used to this razor. I guess I have to get past that breaking in period. I have always used disposable razors, but am glad I gave this one a try. I would definitely stick with it though - your face has to get adjusted!</li>
            <li> I received Braun CoolTec shaving system for free from Braun as part of a trial program, and I was ecstatic to be receiving a $200 shaver from a well-respected company.  I&#x27;ve had a Phillips-Norelco rotary shaver for years, and I&#x27;ve been meaning to replace it for some time.  Suffice to say, it was nice to be able to try out this product for free.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks, and I&#x27;m generally satisfied with it although it isn&#x27;t perfect.  What follows is a point-by-point review of this shaver, and for reference, I&#x27;ll be comparing it to my old rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build: My old rotary shaver is very light and made mostly of rubber and plastic, so it was a bit of a surprise to hold the CoolTec, which has quite a bit of heft to it.  That&#x27;s no a bad thing though because the added weight doesn&#x27;t make it cumbersome to hold.  On the contrary, the shaver feels well-built and is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving: This is obviously the most important aspect of a shaver, and this is where the results are a bit mixed.  The best thing about this shaver is that it doesn&#x27;t chafe your skin no matter how hard you press it against your skin, but in order to get the closest shave possible, you will have to apply a good amount of pressure.  There was definitely an adjustment period for me when it came to switching from my old rotary shaver to this new one.  My old shaver didn&#x27;t require me to push down hard while shaving, and doing so would result in my skin getting chafed.  Once I made the adjustment, I started to get better results from the new shaver.  Another issue for me was the fact that it seems easier to maneuver my old rotary shaver.  I keep a mustache and a goatee, but there are certain spots that need to be shaved around both areas that were a little more difficult using the new shaver.  Another difference is that the CoolTec shaver won&#x27;t cut longer hairs.  This can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  It allows you to do maintenance on your facial hair without worrying about messing up your look.  However, once you get past stubble length, you&#x27;ll probably need to you another trimmer/shaver because the CoolTec won&#x27;t cut it.  In the end, if you keep facial hair, this shaver will take some getting used it.  However, if you like to keep a completely clean look, then I imagine the shaver would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery - Honestly, the battery life on this product is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve used it just about every day for the past month or so and still haven&#x27;t had to charge it whereas my previous shaver required a charge every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling system - This really isn&#x27;t that big a deal in my opinion because the shaver stays cool whether you activate the cooling system or not.  However, if you like to have a cold shave, then you&#x27;ll obviously like this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - I have used the included Clean &amp; Renew system yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been an issue given the fact that this shaver is really best for trimming stubble.  There isn&#x27;t much hair that going to build up under the blades, and it&#x27;s easy enough to remove the top of the trimmer and rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - Overall, I&#x27;m glad I was able to get a new shaver even if it isn&#x27;t a complete replacement for my old one.  I&#x27;m able to get a smooth, clean shave in areas that are easy to get to and have to make some adjustments in other areas.  Still, for a product that I got for free, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a Braun program.  I usually shave with a regular razor and shaving cream but I figured I would give this electric a shot.  It actually gives you a pretty close shave without the pulling I&#x27;ve gotten from other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.  I really liked the cooling effect it really keeps my face from getting irritated.  I really like the cleaning station that comes with it makes sure your razor is clean and ready to go.  Overall I think it&#x27;s a solid electric razor.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used my new shaver that I received through a program run by Braun for a few weeks now and while it provides some unique qualities it certainly missed the mark on others. This was my first electric razor and the cooling effect is pretty nice. It is also nice to have something that I can travel with and also use in the car on my way to work for those days when life just pushes you to the brink. However, one of the things that I felt this razor fell short on was the fact that head doesn&#x27;t tilt or move. Therefore I feel as though I have to go over the same spot several times in order to remove all of the hair. The cooling part keeps me from becoming irritated for sure, which would make the experience significantly worse, but having to cover the same spots multiple times makes for a long shave. It can take me 3-4 times as long to get all the hair removed as opposed to just using my straight razor. I also wish that you could begin cooling down the razor without actually having to turn the whole thing on. That might be a bit picky, but would certainly be helpful as well in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleaning system that comes with it, it makes it much easier than having to do everything by hand which I&#x27;ve seen some of my friends and relatives have had to do in the past. So the fact that I can just rinse it out, put it in the cleaning base and leave it until later is certainly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long hair shaver/groomer on the back works just fine, it helps for straightening sideburns and around my neck line. It is also nice for around my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case that this shaver comes with is pretty nice as well, although it would be nice if it could fit the cord and plug as well. I don&#x27;t think this would take too much additional space and would be nice to keep both together. Maybe even space to fit the charging base as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall pluses would be: easy to clean and cleaning station works well, cooling effect is soothing on skin and keeps from getting irritated, nice travel case and the razor itself makes shaving in the car much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall minuses would be: non rotating/tilting head makes shaving more difficult and takes more time due to having to go over certain spots over and over again, razor doesn&#x27;t begin to cool down without having to turn the whole thing on which in the car makes things more difficult and the case doesn&#x27;t allow room for charger cord and base.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun, and really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The product is thoughtfully designed and the built-in cleaner / charger combo is a smart idea. The cooling sensation was pleasant and would really help minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disappointment however, is the pop up trimmer. The angle of the trimmer does not allow for trimming a beard at all. I have a shaver from another well-known brand and the angle is perfect for beard control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although if you are using this to keep your face neat and clean - this is perfect - just not for me!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver from Braun to try out and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.  I was in the market for a new electric shaver as my old Philips Norelco was on its last legs, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to buy another one.  I have been using the CoolTec for the past 45 days and have been very pleased with the results so far.  As with any shaver, there are good things and not so great things about the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver charges is no time at all. My Philips Norelco would sometimes take a whole day to charge fully, whereas the CoolTec seems to charge in a matter of a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;- The shave is very clean and is closer than my old electric shaver could get.&lt;br /&gt;- I love the CoolTec cooling strip.  I&#x27;ve always had somewhat sensitive skin that can get easily irritated by both electric shavers and straight razors.  Typically with a new electric razor, it takes several weeks or months for my skin to not turn red and irritated.  I never had any irritation problems from Day 1 with the CoolTec.  The cooling sensation it leaves on your skin when you shave is awesome and feels good.  I was amazed that I never had any irritation and it is because of the cooling bar.&lt;br /&gt; - It is easy to use and easy to store in your travel bag&lt;br /&gt; - It is also very easy to clean in the cleaning system that is provided and I like knowing that my shaver is getting a full cleaning and being sanitized without any effort on my part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- When you have the cooling bar turned on, the charge on the unit only lasts 15 minutes or so and after that you can&#x27;t use the cooling feature again until you charge it (but at least it charges quickly)&lt;br /&gt; - The indicator on the shaver that tells you when it needs to be cleaned seems to be a bit too sensitive and a bit of a scam to get you to clean it more and buy more cleaning cartridges.  The cleaning light literally seems to come on after every single shave even if I have just cleaned it.  The instructions say you should clean it about once a week and I typically wait 1-2 weeks between cleanings so that I do not use up too much of the cleaning solution.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey and I can&#x27;t see myself buying it too often.  If I cleaned it every time the light came on, I would go through a cartridge that is supposed to last a couple of months in just a week or two.&lt;br /&gt; - The shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job on my neck hairs.  Most electric shavers I have owned in the past never did a great job on my neck hairs and I seem to always have to go over the same area several times to get those last few stray hairs.  The CoolTec is no different in that regard and I seem to have to spend a lot of time on my neck to get it completely shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while it is a little bit more money than some of the Philips Norelco electric shavers and a few other brands, I do think it is a much better value with the CoolTec included, particularly if you have sensitive skin and electric shavers tend to irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the CoolTec over the Philips Norelco and I will continue to use it well into the future.</li>
            <li> This was a very good razor, but I have to admit that I use it mainly for in between standard razor shaves. The thing that I really did like was the active cooling technology that the razor offers. This really does prevent razor burn. I did not feel that the shaver itself pivoted very well, making it difficult to get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other nice aspect of Braun is the self cleaner. This did save some of the mess of time of other electric razors that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station worked well and the charge lasted a long time before the shaver needed a full charge. The entire unit is a nice size, and does not take up too much space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec technology was a very nice feature and I would like it to be available on other shavers of its type. For me, who at times has sensitive skin, it really was a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor through a program run by Braun, that allows people to try the product in order to give their honest opinion. I am happy to have the shaving system. I think that the major negative is the total price. I would never pay as much as the MSRP suggests- near $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Braun CoolTec Shaving system will not completely replace other methods of shaving for me, but it certainly does enhance the experience.</li>
            <li> It looks high-tech and the features are great.  The cleaning system is convenient.  With a push of a button it is easy to clean . The charging dock station is easy to use.  The traveling case is portable and easy to bring along on trips.  The cooling blade tops them all.  I haven&#x27;t had any irritation while shaving.  I have been using it bi-weekly for the past 8 weeks.  There is a precision blade for closer and more precise shaving.  I find lots of use in this for giving shape to side burns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the shaver could be better.  It takes a while to shave off a 6 o&#x27;clock shower.  It takes 15-20 mins.--I don&#x27;t mind but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I received this electric shaver via a program run by Braun.  With that said, this shaver is great.  It gives a close shave while providing a nice cool sensation on the skin that takes the sting out of shaving. The shaver recharges quickly and has a good, comfortable-to-hold shape.  This shaver is very easy to use compared to ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  This is the ideal &amp;#34;running late for work but I need a quick, close shave&amp;#34; shaver.  The CoolTec System will likely be copied by other companies, but I doubt it will duplicate the amazing experience that the CoolTec System provides.</li>
            <li> Typically, I use a Gillette Fusion razor to shave, but I&#x27;ve since been converted to a believer in electric after using the Braun Cooltec shaver (provided to me via a program run by Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling technology really does make a difference both in the act of shaving and in the aftermath. The sensation is surprising at first, but ultimately provides a cool, fresh-feeling shave. I&#x27;m typically subject to razor burn after shaving, but after using the Cooltec, I had none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning after using was a cinch -- just pop off the top and dust it off with an included brush. Then pop the top back on and you&#x27;re ready to go again. After a few uses, you&#x27;re instructed to clean via an included cleaning kit. I haven&#x27;t yet tried this, but the instructions are clear and should be easily executable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was that the shave was not as close as I would have liked. Since I frequently use safety razors, I&#x27;m used to getting right down close to the skin. The Braun Cooltec left me a little more stubbly than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, though, I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who uses electric razors regularly or is looking to try one out.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The blades made my whole face feel awesome even after I was done shaving :)  I received the product through a program run by Braun and could not be more pleased! the package and the instuctions were easy to follow as well. I store some of the extra parts in the travel case when not in use. I use this product daily and have tried other Braun products in the past, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was asked to take part in a Braun product trial.  I currently have a Braun shaver that is over ten yrs old and is still going.  I received the Braun CoolTec system and was curious to see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is very well put together. It has a charging/cleaning station to ensure a clean shave.  After it charged up I tried it out.  I turned on the shaver and pressed the cooling option. I was very surprised at how cool the shaver got.  It did a great job and left my skin very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to anyone who wants a cool clean shave</li>
            <li> I just experienced the best shave of my life. Braun was running a program that afforded me the opportunity to try out the Braun Cooltec system.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference but it was a relief to find that I was wrong. It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.  The CoolTec System is pretty awesome. It cools and soothes the skin while shaving giving it a soothing feel. it is convenient I could shave in the car if i wanted to no mess or clean up needed and the self cleaning system is pretty neat and effective as well.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this shaver via a program run by Braun.  I was pretty nervous to try out an electric razor again, but it was recommended to me and I&#x27;m a glutton for new-tech... We&#x27;ll start there.. The two blades contour nicely to my face without much effort, the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice if you&#x27;re in a hot shower, and the handle fits easily in my hand and has enough weight to feel a little luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping by going electric, I would save time. After the first time using the shaver I realized that this was the case.  In addition, it was great to be able to shave in the shower, which saved even more time in the moring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works well, and leaves a scent of alcohol on the razor. This makes the shaver smell very clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: I&#x27;d give this 5 Stars. It&#x27;s close, my wife believes it&#x27;s actually closer than my manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday I use this shaver I feel like I&#x27;m setting new speed records.  The more proficient I get with the shaver it seems like the faster I can get a shave in the morning in the shower, and that&#x27;s why I gave this product 5 stars. There&#x27;s no question that this shaver is more efficient and faster then a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a new user to electric shavers, I was excited to learn that I was chosen to participate in a program run by Braun. I received my Braun Cooltec shaver and my first impression was, damn, this is a really cool looking shaver, and it comes with al lthe necessary accessories, PLUS a cleaning station! Who wouldn&#x27;t want to use this sleek looking shaver. I put the shaver to use and was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the cooltec tecnology actually worked. It kept the shave cold the entire time and left my face with no irritation. It also gave me a pretty close shave and left my skin feeling smooth. Cleaning the shaver was extremely easy, and have the cleaning cradle was awesome as well. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, so this shaver was great for me, and it did the job it said it would! I would recommend this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really wish it would provide a closer shave, as I really do enjoy the cool tec technology on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I enjoy sing my cooltec shaver, the cooling blade allows for a soothing shave. No need for preshave lotion or aftershave either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when my Braun Cooltec in the mail thanks to a program run by Braun. I had been anticipating this new type of electric razor from Braun for quite a while. When I opened the package I knew that this was a high quality piece of manliness. After opening the box, like it was Christmas morning, I assembled the cleaning and charging base. One thing that might be good to know is that the cleaning and charging base takes up some counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Shaver comes with the razor, the cleaning and charging base, one alcohol cleaning solution, a small travel charging base, a traveling case for the razor and a small brush for additional cleaning assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is interested in purchasing this razor needs to know that it comes with an alcohol cleaning solution that is installed into the base. You can purchase replacements from many places; I found them for 2 for about $10. Also it recommends replacing the foil and cutter every 18 months, I have found the replacement cost around $40. So if the price of the razor is a concern it will be good to note that there will be additional future fees to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out the Cooltec technology. The information said that it helps with irritation; every electric razor I have used tends to irritate my face due to my beard hair going in different directions. I was happily surprised that there was no irritation or hair pulling and the Cooltec provided a cold, refreshing feeling. I was able to get a close shave with minimal effort. It also has a built in trimmer to help clean up your beard, goatee etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning option is great and it only takes a couple minutes to have a fully clean and lubricated razor ready to go. The Razor is supposed to tell you when it needs cleaning, so far the icon has turned on after every use. I feel like this might be a bit unnecessary since I am currently growing a beard and am using this razor to clean up the stubble onmy neck and checks. I am not sure how quickly the cleaning station will go through the solution, but it will cost to replace and I enjoy using an electric razor so that I don&#x27;t spend as much on disposable razors. This comes off a bit like a tactic to get more of my money. Personally, I won&#x27;t use the cleaning solution after every use but this is the only real downside to this wonderful razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other small complaint is that it seems that the razor doesn&#x27;t want to stay down on the charger but that could be me not placing it down in the base far enough. The times I have used it the charge hasn&#x27;t been an issue so it might be built it to turn off the charging when completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have been incredibly impressed with the Braun CoolTec. It definitely makes me feel manlier and my wife is a fan too. After trying this wonderful shaver, I would recommend it to anyone who was in the market for a new electric razor. I can definitely say that looking hot has never felt so cool!</li>
            <li> The cooling bar actually works. Virtually no iritattion, but I usually put coconut oil/teatreeoil blend on as aftershave most days. The product is designed well and functions great. I&#x27;ll probably switch back to regular razor in a few weeks. I got the razor as part of a program with Braun.</li>
            <li> When I received the Braun Cooltec through a promotional program by Braun, I was right in the middle of growing out my beard for Movember. It had been about 2 weeks worth of growth. I couldn&#x27;t really stand the beard anymore, so I thought it would be a good time and pull out my new Cooltec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently this shaver is not designed to deal with longer hair, with the exception of the trimmer on the back, but I was not going to use that on my whole face. After making a bunch of passes in a couple of spots with the foils, it hardly made a dent. I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt and say it isn&#x27;t designed for long hair only short lite stubble (like 1-3  days worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with my normal razor, I came back in a couple of days to try the Cooltec again, this time with only minimal stubble. This attempt was more successful although still had it&#x27;s share of issues. I found it very difficult to get into the curvier areas of my face and neck and feel like I had to make multiple passes in multiple directions to get any kind of good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem that I had though was getting into the intricate areas, like my sideburns. I found it very difficult to negotiate the kind of shave I was looking for. One last thing, it didn&#x27;t seem to be any quicker than my normal shaving routine. I figured since I didn&#x27;t have to lather my face and rinse so often it would be quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique feature of the cold bar in between the two foils was somewhat interesting, but fairly lackluster. The bar did get cold, but feel it made very little difference in how the shave felt. Although I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, never really having used an electric shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did provide a good shave, but there were a few areas that I needed to go back and touch up.</li>
            <li> I received this equipment in a Braun campaign. I haven&#x27;t used Electric Razors since my teen years, when my beard was weaker and technologies not so well developed. The new Braun CoolTech delivers a perfect shave and finally comparable to manual razors. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference compared to what I was no traditional razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the low temperature feature to really facilitate shaving. Not only is a nice feeling on your face as I think it cools the skin for an optimal shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharging dock is really easy to use and the cleaning fluid guarantees a more thorough cleansing of your equipment. The hard case is a great addition for some who travels frequently like myself. Taken together, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the Braun CoolTech to anyone who is used to Electric Razors and for those interest in switching.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec CT5cc System via a program run by Braun. This shaver features a Braun&#x27;s new CoolTec aluminum cooling bar which causes a cooling sensation when shaving. It feels great on the face and I do not feel any irritation after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that the shaver could be improved. I previously used the Braun 9595 shaver, which has both a battery and hygiene indicator. I wish the CoolTec shaver also had these features. Also, because of the cool bar, the shaver head is quite large, which makes it difficult to shave between my nose and top lip. The shaver is also a bit heavier than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec razor as a part of a program run by Braun.  I have had terrible luck using electric razors in the past.  They usually make raw hamburger out of my neck skin.  I would not say I normally have overly sensitive skin either.  After receiving &amp; charging up the Braun CoolTec, I took it for a test drive.  I have not been able to do the full beard yet, because I am waiting for Movember to be over.  I did trim up my neck &amp; checks &amp; it worked great.  It did not make raw hamburger out of my neck so I definitely think it is a five star compared to all electric razors I have ever used.  When it comes ot an extremely close shave it is lacking, so I gave it 4 stars. The cool tec is awesome because it keeps your skin from getting too hot/warm and more irritated.</li>
            <li> I have never been a guy who liked to use a razor period.  I typically always had some sort of stubble on my face... that is until I got to try out this Braun electric razor.  Typically when I did shave I always had those expenisive multi-blade razors, that always seemed to rust out or just start to pull the hair out.  I had never used an electric razor, but i am now a convert.  I recieved my kit and was taken back by just how much Braun provided in the package.  They gave the razor, a very nice travel case, and small travel sized travel charger as well as an amazing charge and clean station.  Everything was very intuitive for set up and use.&lt;br /&gt;On my first shave I was taken aback.  I have had some sort of facial har for the last ten years, so I didn&#x27;t completely clean shave, but this razor is the perfect match.  The long hair trimmer is perfect for that hard to maintain and trim mustache and upper lip hair.  This is the first trimmer that I have used that was useful, without giving me the nose-need-to-sneeze-tickle that all the others seem to do.  Also the trimmer is easily utilzed and easier to get into the tight little lip crevaces that larger razor and trimmers have issues with.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the non-goatee areas this razor left my skin with an incredibly close shave, with little effort.  As I said before, I had always been a guy who was stubbly because I hated shaving, but now I am all in for my Braun electric razor!</li>
            <li> I received the new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by the Braun company. I&#x27;ve had trouble with razors and shavers in the past.. They either didn&#x27;t work the way they should, didn&#x27;t cut close enough, left ingrowns beyond, etc. I&#x27;ve never found a shaver I&#x27;d use for life.. until now. The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is flat out amazing. The cooling technology feels absolutely amazing on my skin. It cuts closely and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and smooth. The Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is also self cleaning which makes cleaning an absolute breeze. I LOVE that feature! My hair all over the sink was something my wife used to always complain about.. and thats no longer an issue. I have zero problems with this Braun ¬∞CoolTec shaver and I intend to use this one for LIFE! I&#x27;m hooked!! Try it and experience it today.. Your skin will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> I converted from blade razors to this Braun Shaver. Best shave I have had. Love the cooling feature, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently got this CoolTec CT5cc as a test program from Braun and I couldn&#x27;t be any more surprised or happier with the amazing results I have gotten. The charge life is great, the fact you can use it wet/dry is another huge plus as I usually shave in the shower, and the CoolTec technology is like nothing I have ever experienced. I have used and other electric razors but none even compare the results and features. I highly recommend this razor for anyone who likes a smooth, clean shave!</li>
            <li> I was provided a Braun shaver to evaluate for a few weeks through a Braun company test program. I have used the shaver for 3 weeks now and will give you the pros and cons of the shaver system. Good things first. The cooling mechanism the starts cooling as the shaver is turned on is a nice feature. For someone like myself by that has sensitive neck skin this cooling feature felt great while shaving and reduce irritation. The shaver has a sideburn/trimmer as part of the shaver which is convenient, not requiring an additional piece of hardware. This shaver does a decently close shave for an electric razor. The cleaning system is very good and does a thorough cleaning job while charging the shaver. Now for the cons. The shaver is on the heavy side which makes it rough on the wrists while holding it (assuming from the cooling mechanism). The trimmer is at an ackward angle so it makes trimming a bit of a challenge. The shaver doesn&#x27;t have a incremented indication of battery discharged so it makes it difficult to guage the battery life. Overall I like the shaver system and cleaning system. Despite my negative comments it does a good clean shave for an electric shaver. The weight of the shaver and awkwardness of the trimmer are almost unnoticeable after a couple of weeks of use. I recommend this shaver for anyone with sensitive skin that deals with painful irritation from shaving. The cooling feature is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years (decades) on a daily basis to shave my coarse facial hair. Currently swear by the Braun 8985 shaver (with the old \\&quot;skinny bladed\\&quot; cutter block refills) whose life expectancy is long overdue.  I&#x27;m excited to have the privilege to test the Braun CoolTec CT5cc shaver that was given to me for evaluation and review by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s being advertised heavily and it&#x27;ll be the first thing you&#x27;ll notice right away on your face, the cooling factor.  The cooling bar between the two shaver heads does work quite well and made my face shiver.  It&#x27;s winter and I&#x27;m not used to rub a cold piece of metal over my face.  For me this feature hasn&#x27;t improved the comport level of the shave and I actually used the shaver more often with the cooling bar turned off.  BTW, since the cooling bar is aluminum it&#x27;s still a bit cold even when turned off.  I&#x27;m curious though how this shaver feels once hot in the summer.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the wrong time to introduce the shaver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power/Charging:&lt;br /&gt;Because the shaver can be used as a wet shaver (in the shower) there is no plug for the power cable on it.  Instead it has two contacts that rest either on the cleaning station or the charging cradle.  This has two negative effects.  You can&#x27;t shave while the shaver is plugged in and you need the charging cradle while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;Another travel disadvantage is the head design which doesn&#x27;t allow the cutter block to be brushed out.  The cutter blocks are attached permanently in the head assembly and can&#x27;t be separated from the foil.  The old Braun 8985 allows me to do this and this was the sole reason I didn&#x27;t take the CoolTec shaver with me on a recent trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;In general the shave is comparable to the Braun 8985 with the main difference being that the head is large and spread out due to the cooling bar in the middle.  In my opinion the shavers feel is much like the Philips/Norelco shavers which I don&#x27;t prefer because of the large head area that touches my face.  The heads of the traditional Braun shavers have always been wide but narrower so I could easier shave below my nose and follow the contour of my neck.  Navigating a Philips/Norelco or this CoolTec over my face is annoying and takes more effort to ensure that every part has been shaven well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I haven&#x27;t done:&lt;br /&gt;A wet shave.  Rinsed/cleaned the shaver with water (no cleaning station).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Uses:&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar works really great and I bet it&#x27;s great to chill your drink (and shake it) with the shaver.  No need to dilute good drinks like a bourbon with ice cubes.  Unfortunately, I already used the CoolTec and don&#x27;t really want bourbon with shavings.  If I get another one I&#x27;ll explore this option more. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t prefer the shaver it&#x27;s not shockingly bad.  I&#x27;d still look at one of Braun&#x27;s other shavers to avoid the blocky head of the CoolTec.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s shaving system through a program run by Braun. I am a razor guy and I cannot believe this shaver changed my ways! I have always had problems with electric shavers in the past since I have sensitive skin. This shaver is not your normal shaver. It literally stays cold to not irritate my skin with the heat I had suffered from in the past. I love how close it shaves and use it all the time. Forget the shaving cream guys! Make it quick with this great shaver. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the flip side to the razor. The side burn shaver/ trimmer is not precise and it doesn&#x27;t allow me to outline my beard evenly. I guess because the head of it is so small. All in all thought its the best product out there. It even cleans itself after you use it and its charging! What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, I received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver in the mail from Braun, free of charge, under the guise that I would speak about my experience.  This does not impact my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a bit about the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver.  What is so revolutionary about this product is that it is the world‚Äôs first shaver with active cooling technology (the revolutionary aluminum cooling bar gets down to a chilly 44¬∞ - the temperature of a typical refrigerator)! By keeping your skin cool during shaving, the ¬∞CoolTec shaver minimizes redness, burning and itching sensations and leaves skin cool and refreshed.  I&#x27;m excited to see if this is true as its one of my main issues with electric razors.  Also, apparently, this shaver is the only shaver accredited by the Skin Health Alliance (whatever that is)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my receipt of this product happens to coincide with Movember - a time where I am not shaving to support men&#x27;s health.  Due to this, I have not being able to experience all that this product has to offer yet.  However, I was so eager to see what this was about, I decided to &amp;#34;trim up&amp;#34; just to see what this cooling felt like.  So, with full beard, I used the &amp;#34;powerful long hair trimmer&amp;#34; on the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver to trim up.  I must be honest, it didn&#x27;t work amazingly.  I have some pretty long, tough beard hair and the long hair trimmer didn&#x27;t seem big enough, nor powerful enough to make any headway.  I had to pull out another trimmer that I use regularly to really get rid of the heavy stuff.  But then...I was able to experience the ¬∞CoolTec Shaving system as I used it to clean up my neck.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it - at first I&#x27;m taken aback by the different sensation, but it feels nice.  I think I&#x27;ll like this when I give a full face shave.  Shave could be a bit closer, but overall it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at this point, the initial judgement is still &amp;#34;wait and see&amp;#34;.  This haspotential, but without using it on my entire face, I just can&#x27;t give a perfect opinion.  No-Shave November ends this Saturday at which point I expect to do a full-shave and fully experience this product at which point I&#x27;ll produce Part II of this review.</li>
            <li> I recieved a CoolTec Shaving system from Braun and it has been one of my best shaves yet. The cooling technology at first is very surprising and then it feels great to shave with especially early in the morning to wake you up &#x3D;D. Also, who doesnt like a razor that cleans itself? It does a great job and fits very well in my hand for being a larger guy. I recemend you purchase this razor a significant other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 year user of a Norelco circular blade shavor, and I was excited to be a part of a program that allowed me to try out something new.  I never would have changed on my own simply because I dealt with what was familiar.  I really didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  This program came at the right time. Taking part in Movember, and have to keep the right trim going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you about my normal shaving routine. I shave every 2-3 days, and when I do, I shaved with my regular Norelco shaver, then go over everything again with my Gillette ProGlide.  I do this for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I just like the closeness of a razor, but going every 2-3 days the hair is too long to go at it with the Gillette first.&lt;br /&gt;2) The electric razor alone doesn&#x27;t do a good job around my neck, and I always get razor burn. (This is a big pain point of mine, the Norelco leaves my neck completely red and itchy, and it still doesn&#x27;t get the hair very well because the grain on the right side of my neck goes a different direction and is really hard to get without the ProGlide.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to Movember.  This razor did a great job on my neck, and gave me a real close shave.  No, it&#x27;s not as close as the ProGlide, but close enough that I skipped the ProGlide a number of times.  Best part, no razor burn! That alone is enough to not go back to my Norelco.  Plus, I love occasionally skipping shaving with the strait blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cooling system in the Braun CoolTec system.  I expected it to just be a gimmick.  To my surprise, I really like it.  It feel great on my skin! It&#x27;s a great sensation, and I really love using it.  Is it contributing to no skin irritation on my neck ... I really don&#x27;t know, but I do know I like it.  One complaint, I keep accidentally turning it off because that button is right below the thumb rest when I&#x27;m shaving, and I must be used to holding the Norelco a little lower, so I keep turning it off. Don&#x27;t let this stop you though, this isn&#x27;tthe reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5. Another pro is the trimmer on the back. It works much better than my Norelco, so I&#x27;m happy with that feature, though I don&#x27;t expect much from it.  If it does the job, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the one thing I thought the Norelco circular blades did better was handle the shave when hair got a little longer (i.e. 4 days + without shaving.)  It just won&#x27;t cut the hair very well, and I keep flipping between the trimmer in the back and the front blades to try to get it. The flip side of this is even with the hair a little longer, there is less pulling on the hair as it shaves than there was with the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, yes, I like this razor, and I would recommend it and have recommended it to friends. I still think it beats the pants off of of my Norelco (though to be fair, it&#x27;s a little older model.) I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the circular vs. strait blades, the CoolTec or a newer model, but what I do know is I have MUCH less skin irritation, especially on my neck and for me that is a VERY big deal.  And I love the feel of the cooling bar.  I still like to go over it with a my Gillette ProGlide razor every once in awhile, but it&#x27;s nice to not feel like I have to.</li>
            <li> It only took a few seconds for me to realize this shaver lived up to my expectations. It is extremely comfortably shave and the CoolTec System works noticeably well. I was able to feel the cooling bar and my first worry was that it would make my face very cold. It actually didn&#x27;t make my face feel cold at all. I had no skin irritation at all which definitely makes this the best electric shaver. The only bad part was it not being easy to shave around my chin as I was use too. However, the SensoBlade still gave me a close and comfortable shave. The Clean &amp; Charge system worked perfectly and I was quite amazed to see how well it worked. This is one electric shaver I would recommend to anyone who wants an electric Shaver that delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Cooltec as part of a promotion from Braun, and I have thus far highly enjoyed this experience. The Braun Cooltec is a nice addition to my grooming routine and has replaced my older and less reliable electric razor. The cooling experience is great for reducing razor burn and irritation from the normal electric or non-electric shaver.  I must say I am impressed with the cleaning features and the nice smooth shave I receive, especially post- Movember trimming.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes the dull shaving routine and bumps it up a notch. This system keeps your skin feeling smooth and cool and it has helped reduce skin irritation when I shave. I think its awesome that it cleans its self and is ready for the next time you need a quick shave. When my brother and dad saw this high teck, sleek looking device they both wanted it. It lives up to its looks. The only think I would change would be to make the cleaning device slightly slimmer, and not so bulky so it can be easier to travel with. The razor in the back is really handy as well for keeping your side burns clean, and my girlfriend even uses it to clean up the back of my head hair line which makes my hair cut last a lot longer. Awesome technology and shaver over all. I was provided this Braun CoolTec system by a program run by Braun. These are my honest opinions. There are a few things I think could be upgraded like the size. However I would highly recomend this to a friend. I have switched to this system and I am not going back to my boring disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec shaving system as part of a promotional program by Braun and after about 3 weeks of using it, I can honestly say it meets up to my expectations. Here are my thoughts about the product and its performance:&lt;br /&gt;- If you are determined to get the closeness of a manual razor, such as Mach 3 or Hydro 5, you will probably be disappointed in this shaver. However, if you have realistic expectations, such as comparing it to other electric shavers, none of which will shave as close as the best manual razors, then the Braun CoolTec may be a great choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;- I have used many types of manual and electric shavers. I shave every day and while I like the closest shave I can get from a manual razor I am willing to sacrifice some closeness for a still-great shave while avoiding irritation and speeding up the process. The Braun CoolTec definitely delivers when compared to my Norelco Speed XL (rotary) and Remington dual foil shaver. I experienced a shave as close as those other shavers, but the comfort of the Braun CoolTec surpasses them, since the cooling bar actually works and doesn&#x27;t let the shaver irritate my skin from heat generated by the blades... a problem I&#x27;ve occasionally had with my other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that it came with a two different charging stations -- one for cleaning/charging (also a nice feature) and the cradle for just charging. I wish the shaver could operate with the power cord, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal since it charges so quickly. I don&#x27;t use the self-cleaning dock more than once a week because I&#x27;m so used to popping the head off and tapping/brushing the shavings out. However, it does clean really well in the cleaning station, so this is a great feature for me to periodically renew the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver feels really nice in my hand -- it&#x27;s solid, a comfortable weight and has nice grips.&lt;br /&gt;- The foils do pivot side-to-side which is adequate for the contours of my face.  Noneed for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;- The cooling bar is great, but regular charging (every 2-3 shaves) is necessary for it to work. The shaver will continue to operate, but it will automatically shut off the cooling feature if its charge becomes to low. The cooling bar does take extra space in the unit&#x27;s head, so the foils are noticeably further apart than my other foil shaver, which is fine on the face and neck, but not as great above the lip.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a great system when compared to other electric shavers.I give the Braun CoolTec two thumbs up for quality, comfort and innovation. It is definitely my new favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> The cooling bar works wonderfully! I had very bad razor burn, using traditional blades. Within a week of using the CoolTec, my chronic razor burn was gone, and it shaves just about as closely as a blade.</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying that I am, as of the past few years, a fan of the braun shaving systems as a whole. I recieved a similar shaver a few years ago for Christmas and it was one of the best money saving gifts I have recieved to date. I will also go on to say that this shaver compares very well to the one I had revieved as a gift in the past.&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to start on a good note, it is waterproof! This is an amazing feature. I am not a stickler on where I  preform my grooming routines, but to have the ability to shave in the shower and not get stubble all over the bathroom is, in a word, genius! For most of my adult life I have used an expensive 5 blade razor for the mere fact that I could shave in the shower. With this shaver I get the luxury of doing just this. No mess no fuss. Another plus, it cleans itself. The razor I have used for the past few years came with the comodity as well, but to have become acustomed to the cleaning system I&#x27;m glad that the Braun CoolTec shaver does as well. Yet another plus is the life of the battery. It seems to go on forever on a single charge. I shave close about 3 times a week and I&#x27;ll say that I probably charge my shaver about once every 4-8 weeks. This is a huge plus on my end, and the fact that it has a battery guage telling you how much life you have left in the shaver is great too. As far as the CoolTec technology goes, I could take it or leave it. Since I have been using a Braun electric shaving product for some time I have learned the ways of their products. Maybe if I were a new comer to the worl of Braun electric shavers I would appreciate the new feature much more.&lt;br /&gt;  Now on to the negatives. I have found with both Braun shavers that I have used now that I still have to shave with no guard on a beard trimmer to get a &amp;#34;no pull shave&amp;#34;. If I let my beard grow for more than a few days the shaver pulls and irritates my skin no matter how cold the guard gets. It has become a routine. Shave with a beard trimmer with no guard and then finish with the Braun electric razor. It is what it is and still saves me hundreds on disposeable razors, so it is a reality I have become acustomed to. On the note of a beard trimmer with no guard, the precision trimmer is an OK feature but not my favorite. I think I may of used this feature 5 times or so in the past few years but I find myself being clumsy and making mistakes with it. Maybe based on the fact of where it is located on the razor or due to my hand eye coordination in the mirror! Either way It wouldn&#x27;t hurt my feeling if it were not included on the next razor I purchase. The other thing that I&#x27;m not keen on is how long the cleaning solution lasts, how much it costs and how it is refilled. First off the solution gives you a good 5-10 cleanings depending on how often you clean it. It IS a great feature because it does enhance the performance of the razor as a whole. The cleaner does however seem to run out much faster than it seems it would. This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the replacement solution wasn&#x27;t as expensive as it is. The instruction manual says that water is ok to use to clean it out but that the solution is recommended because it does lubricate the shaver and clean it the best. I wish that they sold the solution in a smaller package so you could keep the original solution chamber. A small bottle to refill it i feel would be both environmentally and economically suited.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all I feel Braun is a solid brand and the Braun CoolTec shaving system is an all around good product. I would recommend Braun products to anybody that is looking for a quality product that will last them for years. The pros definitely outweight the cons. Purchase this razor for yourself or a loved one and it will preform to expectations.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System has been a very good shaver.  I was provided with the shaver to try via a program run by Braun. I have used a variety of shavers in the past, and I always struggled with either razor burn or the feeling of a shave that was not very close.  Braun CoolTec seems to have resolved both of these issues giving me a shave as close as a bladed razor and the cooling sensation seems to help razor burn.  I like the versatility, the travel component/charger setup, and the fact that you can use it for a dry shave or a wet shave in the shower.  Overall it is a very good electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of items that could be improved in my opinion are that the sideburn shaver does not cut a clear defined line, which makes my sideburns look a little ragged; the cooling mechanism works, but I would really like it produce a much colder sensation; and the cleaning solution/catridges seem to be used up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I received the razor from Bzzagent to test and review. I am typically a normal razor kind of guy. I need to shave on a daily basis for my job and was exciting to give this razor a try. It works out, but definitely not if you have a face full of hair. When I just need to go over my face quickly in the morning before work, then it works fine. If the weekend passes and I haven&#x27;t shaved, forget about it. I do have very sensitive skin and the cool factor is a nice touch---I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity after shaving with it. Overall, I would recommend for someone who has sensitivity, but not a face full of hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this razor. First off, this is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a smooth face and doesn&#x27;t leave any redness behind, all thanks to the active cooling technology. I was skeptical when I read it, but after I used it once, I knew I would never again use any other kind of electric razor. Also, I was shocked to feel no pulling or pinching like I feel with my old electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel 5 days out of the week and was happy to find that I didn&#x27;t have to bring the whole docking station with. Although I could have charged it in my room, the battery lasted all 5 days, which most of you guys know is amazing. After i used it all week, i went home and put it in the docking station and when I pulled it out it looked all new and shiny again. It really does clean well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great razor that gives you an all around great shave and leaves your face smooth and feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System was provided to me via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> It seems that there is always a new marketing &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; when it comes to razors and I so was skeptical about Braun&#x27;s new CoolTec technology.  However, as a participate in trial program run by Braun, I tried the razor and was very impressed.  The cooling technology really works!  While it took a couple of shaves to get used to, I&#x27;m impressed at how soft and refreshed my skin feels after shaving.  The redness and tenderness I used to get after shaving is completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The close shave that Braun CoolTec provides is amazing.  I used to have to pull my skin tight to get a close shave and also perform a light shave with a disposable razor to ensure all the whiskers were gone.  Not only did this take more time, it increased skim irritation.  With the CoolTec, this tired daily ritual is no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many razors, both electric and manual and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  I would put the shave from CoolTec on par with shaves I&#x27;ve had from  professional barbers with a straight edge razor but without the high price and time investment!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I do not typically use electric shavers but I was able to get this product through a program that Braun is running and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try as I have always wanted to try an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times over the last month or so and have to say that I&#x27;m generally disappointed with the shaving result.  While the shaver itself looks great and the cleaning unit works well, the actual shave it delivers is below par.  No matter how long I try to go over the same area, it does not give me a close shave at all.  Not only does my shaving routine take longer with the Braun CoolTec, it also does not deliver the desired outcome.  It was almost like the blades weren&#x27;t able to reach the hair, no matter what I did to stretch out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one nice thing about this shaver is the CoolTec technology.  It really does get nice and cold, yet not uncomfortable, and provides a shave that does not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I got this electric shaver via a program run by Braun.  I have a beard but still need to do some trimming around my face and on my neck.  I was very excited about the idea of using an electric shaver rather than a manual one in which I often get cut.  I thought the scent was nice and it has been very easy to clean.  As far as the closeness of the shave, I still think my 5 blade manual razor does a better job.  For the price point, I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money for this razor even though it&#x27;s really nice to get as a gift!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver for free from a program run by Braun to review.  I have used Braun products exclusively for over 15 years because they have always given me the best shave.  I have had a razor with the cleaning technology for years so I am used to it.  When I heard about then new cooling technology I was a little suspicious that it was \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; but decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cooling technology actually works and it works well.  I have little or no irritation after shaving and you can actually feel it cooling your face as you shave.  It&#x27;s pretty cool, pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works great as I am used to with my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus this razor is very, very quiet in comparison to the others I have used by Braun in the past.  If fact, this is the quietest razor I have ever heard and this is almost as impressive a new feature as the cooling system itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that it comes with two caring cradles.  One is the big cradle that houses the cleaning system and the other is small an sleek so I can clear my counter and not have the bulky cleaning system taking up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case that comes with the system is a great improvement over others in the past.  It is stylish and sleek and zippers up rather than being a bulky plastic case that I am used to travelling with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two potential negatives that I have with this product that could affect some people.&lt;br /&gt;- First, there is a large gap between the two foil cutters where the cooling element is located. After a week of use this still feels awkward because when saving my lip and chin only one of the foil cutters can shave the upper lip.  Kind of hard to explain but I still do get a close shave, with some maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;- Second, my shaver didn&#x27;t come with a brush to clean it.  I have brushed from old razors but this would be a bigger deal if I didn&#x27;t because I am one of those that like to keep my things very clean, especially are razor that I rub all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is used to electric shavers and especially to anyone looking to get one for the first time..  The cooling element really works and it would easy the transition from a real razor to electric.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System. The cooling technology is what I really love about this shaver. I&#x27;ve been using a disposable ravor before I started using the Braun CoolTec. When I was using the disposable razor, I would always use it before I showered because I would have less irritation that way. After using the Braun CoolTec, I havent experienced any irritation. The cooling effect is soothing to my face that sometime I don&#x27;t even want to stop shaving. I even tried going back to my disposable razor and couldn&#x27;t handle the irritation anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also really like about this is the cleaning system. I&#x27;ve owned other electric razors with cleaning systems and this one seems to be the best. Other systems would clean, but not as good as the Braun CoolTec. In other systems that I&#x27;ve used, there would always be hair still in the device and sometimes I would run it twice and it wouldn&#x27;t get all the hair out. The Braun CoolTec system leaves the razor spotless. Believe me, I check the razor everytime to see if hair was left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe that I have, and this may be an issue with every other electric razor is that I have to go over the same spot multiple time because it does not cut every hair in one swipe. When you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is definitely an issue. This is the only reason I would prefer a disposable razor over an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this razor. This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun and I&#x27;m basing this review in comparison to a disposable razor and one electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s a great razor, and if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually feels good on your skin, you should really check this out.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec was provided to me free to try by Braun, but I didn&#x27;t let that bias my review in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this feels like a great expensive razor, from the weight to the quality of the materials. I like the textured rubber coating. When you get all the cool accessories in the box, it really feels like the product is worth the money spent. I also like the cleaning system and the travel case. When using the razor the cooling effect was really strange, but in a good way.  The cold was good against razor burn, but I always thought warm was the way to go when it comes to getting the closest shave. This shaver is definitely better than all of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  However, even with the CoolTec&#x27;s cooling technology, it is still just a twin foil shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as other electric razors, but I still prefer my regular razor for closeness of shave. Even with stretching and pulling my face I was unable to get a shave as close as a blade. I tended to start out with the electric, and clean at the end with my blade.  I have a REALLY thick facial hair, so perhaps those without as genetically thick stubble, would find it better.  Also, its good if you&#x27;re on the run, travelling or need a good daily shave.  For extra close shaves on special occassions, I would suggest finishing off with a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use electric razors and need a new one, this one (Braun CoolTec) is worth the $200, you still get a good shave but with the cooling effect that reduces irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really love is that this shaver was very easy to clean. Just flip of the top and run it through water. The design doesn&#x27;t have many crevices that will trap hair.  This is my first wet/dry shaver, and I love that I can rinse it off in water.  However, I am a bit cautious about using it in water, because we have very hard water here, and I&#x27;m afraid that over time, it may dull or destroy the blades, foils and other parts of the shaver...BUT since we have the cleaning system to fall back on every once in a while, I don&#x27;t worry as much.  I feel like the lubricants undo the harm my hard water does to the razor as long as I run it though a full rinse cycle every couple of weeks or so.  I wouldn&#x27;t use the cleaning daily, as they are pretty expensive to change out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the annoying things is the Clean light. The razor has a oil drop icon that turns on when the razor needs to be lubricated or cleaned. Unfortunately this goes off after each shave and I am not sure if this is necessary unless you are sharing the blade and want to know if it has been cleaned and sterilized since the last person has used it.  I think its more meant to get you to use cleaner regularly so you will buy replacement cartridges.  Its a nice light, and the bells and whistles are really impressive.  I love the color scheme, and the LED lights that are super bright and futuristic.  The charging is super quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision Trimmer is something that tends to be useless in my experience on all electric shavers.  I have never had one that actually cuts the thick hairs on my body.  I guess it would work with men with thin hair, as my sideburn hairs seem thicker than the openings in the teeth on the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the shaver.  I hate shaving in general because of the time, and the razor burn I get from traditional blades.  When I use the Braun CoolTec, I can get a quick shave and run off to whatever I need to do.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it when I want an extra close shave, because I feel only a blade, shaving against the grain can get my face baby smooth.  Overall, I say that if you want an elective razor, you should go with this one.  If you&#x27;re gonna spend money on a shaver, why not spend a little more and get a really good one?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking to upgrade my electric razor for a while now. I don&#x27;t use an electric too often, but my old Norelco just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it any longer for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what turned out to be perfect timing, I was able to get my hands on a new CoolTec shaver via a Braun promotional program. Out went the Norelco, and the Braun is now making its home near my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels good in my hand, is balanced well, and easy to use. I do find that its a little too easy to turn off the cooling feature with the location of the button on the handle. Speaking of the cooling feature - it&#x27;s definitely a uniqe experience. I find that it does help soothe any irritation to have the cool bar cross over my face as I shave and really like how it feels. My 2 year old also thinks its fun to watch daddy shave with his new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ease of the charging/cleaning station and how it makes it easy to care for the unit. The cleaning fluid also smells nice and you get a slight whiff of it once you start shaving the next time. I&#x27;ve not had to replace a cartridge yet, so I can&#x27;t tell you how that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i could change anything, it would be to adjust the location of the button for the cooling button, and perhaps adjust the size of the openings in the foil to fit a thicker whisker like mine. I find I sometime have to go over the same spots again to get everything, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun, and man am I glad I did! It is awesome! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an electric shaver! Effortless and comfortable. Easy to use and gentle on your skin. Excellent battery life. The cleaner works great.  The cool bar in the shaver really helps.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a first time shaver buyer in look for a great and painless shaver.</li>
            <li> When I got asked to participate in a Braun promotion I had high hopes. I currently was using a small Gillette razor but I had been getting frustrated with the width of the blade but still liked the shave. I was exited to try out the new CoolTec system because I thought it would speed up my shaving process. My first time shaving, the cold touch of the CoolTec metal cooling bar on my face really surprised me. I knew it said it got cold but I guess I just didn&#x27;t expect for it to feel almost like rubbing a piece of ice on my face. It ended up being a little to cumbersome for me the and trying to shave my chin was an awful experience. Determined to keep an optimistic outlook I decided to use it several more times. It felt amazing shaving my cheeks but when I would shaving my jawline and chin it would just snag hairs and burn my skin. I don&#x27;t think this is the right razor for me but it does have some really cool features. That cooling bar is really nice and the cleaning system is awesome. It comes with a really nice case for it and smaller charging cradle. I would definitely love to see the cooling system in more razors but until then I think i&#x27;m sticking with my Gillette ProGlide Styler.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought an electric razor in over 5 years and had switched to buying blade cartridges, which can be a hassle and can start to cost a decent amount after a while. I was in full beard mode when I got my CoolTec through a program run by Braun. That gave me a chance to test the mettle of the pop-up trimmer in the back which was sturdy and took beard to stubble quite quickly. From there the main razor did the rest, getting my face smooth with no effort. It took me a few tries to figure out how the coollness button worked, but once I did it was quite the revelation. A cool feeling on your face instead of a burning sensation is awesome. The only issue I ran into was shaving on my neck (which I&#x27;ve always had issues with). The cleaning system seems to work pretty well and the carrying case is nice and sturdy. I&#x27;ve taken it on three trips so far and haven&#x27;t been concerned with it breaking. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying a new shaver, you could do way worse than this one. Clean, cool shave, great trimmer with some neck negligence.</li>
            <li> I took place in a program by Braun that allowed me to test out this razor.  I have to be honest I thought the CoolTec idea seemed a little gimmicky at first and having used electric razors in the past with no luck I anticipated being just as disappointed.  Boy was I wrong.  This razor literally gave me the closest shave I have had since I was a teenager.  My facial hair is fairly thick and I almost always get razor burn on my neck.  This razor eliminates the burning sensation making it feel as though you are rubbing a cold can of soda over your face with each passing stroke.  The cleaning station that comes with it is great and really does keep the razor blades feeling new.  My only issue (if that&#x27;s what you want to call it) is the cleaning solution refills for the base are a little pricey, but I think they are worth it in comparison to not using it at all.  All in all I am very impressed and highly recommend you giving this product a shot.  I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got to try the CoolTec system thanks to a program by Braun.  The technology and built into these shavers was impressive: lithium ion battery that charges fast, waterproof and washable, LED display and self cleaning.  I liked the Braun shaver because it was easy to use, except for refilling the alcohol cleaning solution.  Everything else was great, I could shave and just rinse the shaver under the sink and put it back in the stand.  It was nice to have it simple.  The alcohol refill is the part which should be optional because it&#x27;s just a hassle this shaving system doesn&#x27;t need.  The long hair trimmer works great, but it&#x27;s nothing innovative; other electric razors have this feature.  My facial hair is moderate to light, so I mainly groom instead of shaving everything and the Braun CoolTec can cut close enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the active cooling technology works, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a game changer.  A regular razor and the right shaving cream could probably duplicate the effect.  However, the Braun CoolTec is a solid choice for an everyday, no hassle electric razor.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System via a program run by Braun. First off, the packaging seems a bit intimidating, however after putting it together, I was shaving in under 5 minutes. The best part is that the aluminum cooling bar ACTUALLY WORKS!! I usually get a lot of irritation on my chin and neck from using electric, but pressing the cooling button and waiting a few seconds truly works, and it feels like a smooth cool metal bar touching your skin as you are shaving. This is an excellent razor for everyday shaving. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System everyday for a month now.  I have very fast growing, thick facial hair.  The most important features to me were the cutting blades (shaver, trimmer), and unfortunately these was also the most disappointing features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can use it in the shower.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess all over the sink and counter.  Didn&#x27;t seem to make the shave any better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  Just pop the top off and tap it in the sink or trash then just take the brush and do a few swipes on the unit and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the CoolTec cooling band, it seems to cool your face right away, feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had little luck getting all my hair to my satisfaction.  I tried every type of pressure (light-hard), every direction (360), varying speeds (slow-fast), still wasn&#x27;t able to get all my hair.  Most of the hair that I wasn&#x27;t able to get was along my neck and my side burn areas.  I shaved everyday as to mitigate the length of the hair.  My hair grows fast so maybe i should have been shaving twice a day, but i thought that would be excessive.  I have to go back over my face with a Gillette razor after to get all the missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power plug when plugged into the main unit easily pulls out, even without moving the unit.  Also the placement of the power socket on the main unit is awkward and makes it difficult to place the unit on the counter.  This should be moved and also hold tighter since the power cord is not very long and any pull of the cord, pulls the cord out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer smaller and doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous Braun models, i have an old one from about 5 years ago and love the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have the main unit with the cleaning solution in, you can&#x27;t move it around without spilling the cleaning solution.  This should be sealed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about moving the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the trimmer the CoolTec band should automatically shutoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was overall disappointed with the quality of the shave this razor provided.  The razor and trimmer just didn&#x27;t work well enough to be the only razor in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I first got the Braun CoolTec Shaving System via a program with Braun for free and I was quite surprised with all that came with it. This was my first real electric shaver so I had no idea what to expect. Having a separate charging dock that takes the exact same cord was nice and convenient. The Clean&amp;Charge station also did its job as expected; I haven&#x27;t been dissatisfied with it not cleaning well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, when it came down to the actual shaving, it just didn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended). When I think electric razor I think quick and easy, but this was far from what happened. I had to go over the same areas over and over to get all the stubble gone. Even then, it wasn&#x27;t as close as a shave as I&#x27;m used to with a straight razor. The CoolTec part of this all was nice; I didn&#x27;t notice any razor burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor. If you are serious about shaving and your facial hair in general, I&#x27;d suggest a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an electric shaver before I got involved with a program run by Braun to use this.  At the time I was shaving my face with a razor.  However when I finally got the Braun shaver i&#x27;d started growing a beard and had cut all my hair off to donate.  So having already committed to the shaver, I started shaving my head with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp seems to like the electric shaver much more than a razor.  Comfort-wise it&#x27;s very nice for the skin and is easy to hold and maneuver.  I like the idea of the cooling tech on the shaver and understand the thought behind it but I didn&#x27;t feel it was that beneficial to me.  I tried using it a few times but don&#x27;t even use the cooling part anymore.  I don&#x27;t feel soothed by it, just makes me cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since kept the beard but tried to keep my neck line clean.  I tried using the shaver on my my neck a few times and it didn&#x27;t even touch the stubble that I had.  Ended up using the razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I could mention is that the plug the fits into the wall sticks straight out and doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the wall like other plugs might.  And in my bathroom it feel kind of aggressive having it stick out like that, so I unplug it when it&#x27;s done charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad shaver overall, just a few things to improve on I guess.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to use this when the cleaning solution needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec shaver almost seemed too gimicky when I first heard of it.  Cooling mechanism on the face?  The typical logic is a warm/hot surface as it helps loosen things up for the shave, so wouldn&#x27;t the cooling have the opposite effect?&lt;br /&gt;That may in fact be the case.  The shave is less than stellar.  However, the cooling tech does in fact do one thing right, and that is prevent/reduce the razer burn you&#x27;d normally have.  The cooling bar was suprising at first, but quickly felt very good against what would otherwise be irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t tend to shave often, and mostly just trim it down when I do anything.  I&#x27;ll only typically shave when it&#x27;s a semi-special occasion.  When I received this razer from Braun as part of a promotion, there wasn&#x27;t really any special events occurring for me, so I just went with it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave, again, wasn&#x27;t really all that effective.  It took multiple passes to get some areas smooth, and with some areas that are more problematic with other shavers, this one too had issues getting those clean.  Eventually I stopped shaving, as I couldn&#x27;t keep going anymore.  But at the end, my face did not have the typical burning feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger bases(two, one for travel, the other with the cleansing solution) was a nice touch.  The cleansing solution is more antiseptic than &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34;, so if that&#x27;s important, then the base will benefit you.  You could easily forgo the cleansing solution once it runs out if you are not worried about that(or use on occasion rather than every time?).  Also, the razer itself is probably one of the better setups for waterproof/cleaning that I&#x27;ve seen.  Very obvious rubber protecting the internal portion from the hair/water that might get in there.  Very easy to clean out without little pockets of hair being perpetually stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this shaver sits in a niche market, those who don&#x27;t need to shave often, or can&#x27;t due to sensitive skin,and don&#x27;t need a perfect shave when they do.  If that fits your profile, this may be the equipment for you.  If you need to shave daily, or like completely smooth skin, then you may wish to pass on this.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting and using this razor. I was very disappointed. It does not shave close and the trimmer is almost useless. My old Braun was great which is why I bought this one.  Sorry I did.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, well-made shaver.  The shaver itself works well and is made with high quality materials.  It comes with a cleaning base station that makes cleaning the shaver a snap.  Overall a great shaver that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver for the last 8 years and really like the brand. I was intereseted to try a new model and see if the technology had improved. I thought the Braun Cool Tec shaver worked well.  I was particularly impressed by how cool the shaver felt.  It was a big improvement from my previous model.  Design of the shaver is nice. Shaver also does well getting pesky hairs that grow in opposite direction as others.  Only drawback was the trimmer is a little harder to use than other models (doesn&#x27;t stick out as much).  Overall, i was very pleased with the shaver and enjoy the cool feeling when i go to shave.  I would reccomend getting one, particulary if you get shaver burn.</li>
            <li> As a guy who has used electric shavers most of his life, I was very excited when I received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System via a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that this razor is very cool - literally!  (Everything from the packaging to the design of the shaver itself is cool and ergonomic).  Braun likens the feeling of using this shaver to putting a cold can of soda on your face.  While that doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like a very satisfying sensation, I&#x27;ll take a cool &amp; comfortable face over the burning and irritation I have experienced with other electric razors.  No bumps, no itching at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the long-hair trimmer which is great for keeping my sideburns neat and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars was because the shave still didn&#x27;t rival that of a manual razor.  Yes, it is a foil razor and as such comes pretty close to a clean shave, but there was still a little bit of stubble left despite the direction or number of times I shaved parts of the neckline.  But then again, maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a cool, ergonomic shaver that rivals any rotary on the market!</li>
            <li> I am not usually one for electric razors but I received this razor as part of a program from Braun. I have tried a couple in the past and never really thought that the shave was any comparison to my manual razor. But I have to say they have definitely come a long way. This is the first electric razor that I would actually recommend to friends. I don&#x27;t think I will completely give up my manual razor but this absolutely gives it a run for it&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> I received the electric shaver which was provided via a program run by Braun and I definitely love the packaging and the travel case that you put the razor in. The design and feel of the razor is good and fits in your hands with ease which i think is very important when shaving due to the constant movements. The cooling technology feels great on your face however the razor is not so close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very thick beard and it did not shave close as needed. I actually had to to do some finishing touches with a manual razor afterwards to get the close shave i needed. Overall product is okay and works better for somebody whom has lighter facial hair but the packaging and cleaning kit is great to have and thats one thing i love about Braun they always keep their products modernized and with this Cool Technology, they are taking a big leap in whats to come in the innovative and fresh world of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally the type to shave completely clean, I mainly use a beard trimmer to keep a stubble look. But every now and then I do have to go clean shaven, and I really dislike razors so when I had a chance to try this through a program run by Braun I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take longer than I expected to fully shave everything, sometimes requiring 4 or 5 passes where a razor would only take one or two. This could just be me not used to using this style of razor, but it did take longer to shave. However, there was absolutely no burn whatsoever, and obviously not risk of getting cut. I definitely felt a cooling sensation, and had no irritation after the fact. I thought that the CoolTec was just going to be marketing filler, but it really did feel cool while shaving. The base is nice as well, an easy way to keep it clean. Overall I&#x27;d probably give 3.5 stars instead of 4 just for how long it took me to shave, but this product does exactly what it states it&#x27;s going to do and worked very well. I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
            <li> I received this electric razor through a program run by Braun. Overall, this is a good electrice razor. I&#x27;ve used a handful over the years and they always seem to come up short. However, I&#x27;m impressed with this system. Pros: The razor does a respectible job with a close shave. The cool-tec feature is really nice &amp; soothing. The ability to shave in the shower is great as that is where I like to shave. The cleaning system is great to have and not to have to worry about upkeep. Reduces the cost of disposable razors &amp; shaving cream. Nice option to have for traveling. Easily packs in my carryon luggage. Cons: Takes longer than the traditional shave. Takes multiple passes over the same area for hair that grows in different directions. Overall - Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Pro: Good for razor burns with the cooling effect. I have a very heavy beard and I usually use a razor but this worked good for me. Not as good as a razor but its good for a quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time.&lt;br /&gt;Con: It still pulls my hair sometimes like other electronic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;*the product was provided to me to review</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I received the Braun CoolTec Shaving System for free as part of a promotion from Braun. That said, what follows are my honest thoughts on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of this product was less than inspiring. It was at the beginning of December, my first shave after the month of MoVember. (Mustache-growing to raise awareness for men&#x27;s health issues during November... I go one step further and just stop shaving altogether.) I used electric trimmers to trim off the longer beard hair, then followed up with the CoolTech shaver. Admittedly, I am new to electric shavers, but this thing seemed to have trouble knocking down my stubble. Multiple passes were required along my chin, and especially on my neck. Even then, the closeness of the shave was not what I&#x27;d expected. I noticed that there were patches that the shaver missed, even after covering the area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t really notice the CoolTech feature. After a couple passes, the cool sensation did feel soothing on my skin. That sensation lasted well after I completed shaving. A good thing too, considering I had to go over my face so many more times than I would have with a traditional razor. I experienced the same sensation after other uses of this shaver as well, and that is something I really like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the shaver seemed to clog up pretty quick when clearing heavy stubble. This problem was not so noticeable on subsequent shaves when my beard-growth was not as advanced. At any rate, the cleaning station seems to do a pretty good job clearing the head of cut hair. My feeling is that as the head ages though, its efficiency will only diminish. Seeing as how it already requires multiple passes to get a good shave, I don&#x27;t see this being my first choice on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use the slide-out hair trimmer on the back of this unit, and I&#x27;d have to rate that part as a miserable failure. It did absolutely nothing. Perhaps I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly. Maybe mine is defective. (Not a good way to promote your product if it is...) Or maybe the slide-out trimmer needs further evaluation by the brains at Braun. Whatever the case may be, I ended up using a traditional razor for fine trimming around my sideburns because this product just wasn&#x27;t accurate enough for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product, but not a great one. It feels sturdy in your hands, and it mostly does a good job. For the price that this thing retails for? I expected a lot more. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to look at what a replacement cleaning cartridge for the cleaning station goes for either, and they recommend replacement about every eight weeks with regular usage. Seems like a lot of money to me... but I am kind of cheap anyway. I will wrap up by saying this: Had I not gotten this shaver for free, I wouldn&#x27;t have it. Had I spent a $100+ on it, I&#x27;d be a little angry. Will I continue to use it? Probably just to change up my shaving routine. I think I prefer the old reliable razor and shaving gel over this high tech gizmo though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Braun Cool-Tech electric shaver in rotation for a few weeks now. I have to say that on a day to day basis, this thing works very nicely. It keeps the stubble down, and it leaves my skin feeling cool and soothed afterward. I still have to make repeated passes over certain portions of my face, mostly around my mouth and on my neck. There are some spots I even have to break out my regular traditional razor for because this thing just won&#x27;t cut the hair close enough. I&#x27;ve tried the precision trimmer on the back of the shaver several times now, and still consider it a failure. It is very weak, and doesn&#x27;t do a good job for precision cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go a few days between shaves, this thing is pretty much useless. If my stubble gets longer than 1/16th of an inch, it feels more like the shaver is pulling the hairs rather thancutting them. The shaver heads clog quickly too, and more than once, I&#x27;ve had to stop shaving to run the device through its cleaning cycle before finishing my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of the cleaning/charging station: Its huge. It takes up so much space on my counter, and the cord sticks so far out from the wall that I am considering the product&#x27;s removal from my bathroom. I hate clutter on the bathroom counter and with this thing in place my side of the counter looks almost as bad as my wife&#x27;s side. The cleaning process runs through quickly and it seems to do a good job. I still haven&#x27;t looked into replacement cleaning cartridges, so I can&#x27;t speak to how much those are. To be honest though, I don&#x27;t know that I will continue using this shaver long enough to need a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thought on this product: I&#x27;m glad I got it for free, because if I would have spent my hard-earned cash on it I&#x27;d be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun CoolTec shaving system as part of a program run by Braun. I previously was using another brand of electric razor but downgraded to a trimmer and Mach-3 after my friend&#x27;s puppy chewed it up. Needless to say, I can go either way with electric razors: I like the convenience but appreciate the close shave a traditional razor provides, with that said, I find this has given me the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor in a long time. My girlfriend actually commented on how smooth my shave was.  I also like that the razor comes with an attached trimmer for doing side burns and keeping me beard neat if I grow it. In honesty, I haven&#x27;t even used the cooling technology once, as I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need it. Hence, I give the product 3 stars because its a good razor but I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether or not its worth the extra money for cooling technology that I don&#x27;t actually need.  If you have really sensitive skin then it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> When I first received my Braun CoolTec shaving system through a program that Braun is running, I was a little pessimistic as to whether or not it would be any different than any other electric razor. I was also questioning whether or not it would be able to provide me with an irritation free shave. After three weeks of using it, I can honestly say that I am extremely pleased with the results. Normally, I tend to get some cuts and almost always have some razor burn and/or bumps with ingrown hairs. With the Braun CoolTec those problems have been either eliminated or minimized. For example, I have not had any incident of razor burn as the cooling bar on the CoolTec razor seems to provide my skin with the protection it needs. Also, the bumps and ingrown hairs have not been occurring at all. In terms of cuts, I do have a couple of cuts, but that is just due to my negligence at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to admit that the Braun CoolTec has surpassed my expectations, and I&#x27;m looking forward to its continued benefits</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product as it was provided via a program run by Braun. I was skeptical of it at first, I&#x27;ve always used hot water for shaving.  I&#x27;ve never really been convinced of electric razors either.  This product made me a believer!  The cooling technology reduced my shave bumps and redness.  My skin felt cool and smooth after each shave.  I can not go on enough about the auto cleaning either.  Such a time saver!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program run by Braun to try it out.  I currently have a series 7 Braun razor that I normally use but have put that aside to test this new razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like the CoolTec technology to reduce razor burn and irritation&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning seems to work better than my 7-series self cleaner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It just does not appear to shave as well as my 7-series&lt;br /&gt;Getting it into the recharger station sometimes takes a little fiddling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a direct comparison to my current 7-series razor.  I does appear that this razor does not run as high of an RPM as my 7-series.  There is a noticeable difference in the sounds when they are turned on.  This razor does its job on my face but my neck can be a pain to shave sometimes and I end up going back upstairs to hit a couple of trouble spots that apparently I missed.  For longer hair, I find it always better to use a trimmer to shave down as much as possible before using this razor for finer hair shaving.  If I shave every day, it does the job nicely because it keeps hair growth to a minimum, but if you like to skip a few days at a time between shaves, it can take a while to get that smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec is a neat feature, though.  I like having the coolness run along my skin as electric razors tend to heat up while running for a while and I don&#x27;t like a warm razor when trying to shave.  The cooling bar removes that effect so shaving with it is quite comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this cooling bar was matched with my 7-series, I think it would be a great match, but as it is, I will probably go back to using my 7-series most of the time and save this one for maybe vacations when I don&#x27;t want to bring my more expensive shaver on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3/5 stars because it&#x27;s a good razor, but not something I would be bragging about to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program by Braun. I have been using the Braun Series 5 electric razor for years and it has always provided a close shave, however my skin would always get irritated, especially around my neck. So the prospect of a Braun razor that would provide a clean, close shave and minimize skin irritation was something I was truly excited about.  I have been using the Cooltec razor for several weeks and I have mixed feelings about its performance.  The cooling strip is an excellent idea and really did reduce the skin irritation that I typically had to endure after shaving. The cooling bar feels great against your skin while shaving. My issues with this razor are with its shaving performance. I found that the razor performed poorly when cutting facial hair unless the hair was extremely short. If you do not shave everyday, it takes quite a long time to get a close shave and sometimes you actually have to use the clipper on the back of the razor to trim the hair to get it short enough for the razor to cut it.  My old Braun razor gave me a clean, close shave even if I skipped a few days of shaving; with the CoolTec I have to shave everyday or it becomes a real hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Braun could improve the cutting performance of the CoolTec razor, this would be an excellent product.  I would recommend this razor to anyone that has to shave everyday. It does provide a clean, close shave without skin irritation provided that you remember to shave everyday and do not let your facial hair get too long.</li>
            <li> The new CoolTec system is unlike any other shaver I have seen. Upon contact with the skin, there is an immediate cooling feeling on the skin. This cooling of the skin seems to have kept my skin from becoming irritated when using the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback was that it seems the product did not have super sharp blades. Quite possibly it was due to the fact that I have thick grained hair follicles though as I have not had much luck with foil shavers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that this shaver had a cleaning system as I am always worried about how to properly care for electric razors. It also had a nice travel pouch to carry the shaver with me outside of the house. The only drawback to the travel system is it did not have room for the travel charger. When I took it on a trip with me, I had to take the travel base along with the charging cord and the charger where I have had many in the past that just requires a simple cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while it was often slow to cut, I found the cooling effect was still well worth the new technology and was glad to get the opportunity to try the shaver through a trial program with Braun.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new electric razor and I was really excited to try the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System.I was able to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaver via a program run by Braun. I thought it was a really cool idea for the active cooling technology, the aluminum cooling bar that keeps your skin cool during shaving. I think this is a neat feature. However, I am not sold on just this feature. While using the Braun CoolTec I did not experience  irritation.  I was hoping that the electric razor would give me a close clean shave. I felt it did an adequate job, but I did have to shave the next day, unlike if I used a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the product.  It is very easy to use and the charging station is the right size. It states that All Braun premium shavers are built to perform for up to 7 years.  Overall, I feel that this razor does meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was offered a Braun CoolTec shaver for free as part of a Braun promotion in which I was supposed to try the product and give a review of my thoughts on the shaving system. I used the shaver for about a month and a half prior to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shaver almost daily and it seemed to work fairly well. I was used to using a manual shaver prior to receiving this razor. The CoolTec shaver does not give you as close of a shave as a manual razor, so if you are using a manual razor that will take some getting used to. However if you shave on a daily basis this isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. The shaver gets a close enough shave that it feels smooth going with the grain, but you can feel a little stubble going against the grain of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I like about the CoolTec shaver over a traditional cartridge shaver is it seems to be a bit quicker. There is no need for shaving cream or water. It allows me to shave while doing another task if I am in a big hurry getting ready for work. The CoolTec system also feels great on your face, although I must admit it is a bit of a gimmick. The CoolTec system isn&#x27;t anything that would make or break my decision to purchase this shaver. It feels nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the shave, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is a great shaver as far as electric shavers are concerned but as you would expect, it will not give you the close shave that you get from a wet shave. Would I recommend this shaver, yes. Is it the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, No. You have to decide for yourself what is more important, a baby smooth shave, or the convenience of an electric shave with the Braun CoolTec system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past and gave up in frustration. I decided to give this a shot and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how well it works. There are few times when it fails to shave a hair or two on my neck no matter how many times I go over it from every direction. I end up grabbing a razor and shaving it off. But overall, this is a very nice shaver and I really like the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feeling. I also like the base where you put the cleaning fluid in and it cleans the unit.</li>
            <li> I got an opportunity to try this shaver via a program run by Braun - and here is what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you will immediately notice- as I did- is the cooling bar. Yes, that thing is neat. When you use it, it gives your skin a nice, cool sensation. (How hasn&#x27;t had an unpleasant pulling/burning sensation from a bad razor?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is good - no tugging on my skin and it gave me a nice clean, smooth shave. I also like the set-up / holder- which I put right on my bathroom sink. I just pop it in there to charge and it keeps it clean, ready to go and out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now- the reason this didn&#x27;t get my fifth star - my experience using it to shave under my chin and around my neck left something to be desired. It just didn&#x27;t work as well or get as close as I expected. However, still no tugging, just not as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, My face and I are very happy with this set and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver person for the last ten years. I was looking for a new, more advanced machine so I got really excited when I got the Braun cool Tec Shaving System. While it was good, the price premium did not justify the added cooling and cleaning benefits. Also the item is very bulky, so be sure to have enough space in your bathroom counter top before you purchase it. It feels over-engineered to deliver benefits that more simple shavers can deliver, but, hey, if you want to of the line this is your product.</li>
            <li> I got a tester unit from a program run by Braun, and man am I glad that I was able to snag one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, and possibly most importantly, the CoolTec provides an excellent shave. I am surprised at how much I like the cooling feature too. It honestly sounded gimmicky to me at first, but after using it, I like it. I&#x27;m not sure how much closer the shave is compared to a non-cooling razor, but it feels nicer. The shaver feels well made and of quality materials... Not the cheap flimsy plastic I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the bundle was the clean/charge dock. It made it effortless to charge the unit and I liked the cleaning feature as well... The included travel case/charging adapter were very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to friends or family.</li>
            <li> This razor was provided through a program with Braun.  This is a solid razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face because of the cooling sensation.  The cleaning base also does a great job of keeping it clean.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because my previous razor would give me a closer shave.  I think the cooling sensation and lack of facial irritation is worth the trade, though.</li>
            <li> I must first say I was trying this shaver as part of a program for Braun. I love the ease of use for the Braun Cool Tec Mens Shaving System. I felt it left my face feeling fresh and clean after. My facial hair is persistant and gets shaved at least 3-4 times a week depending on my scheduled meetings. I found it to be easy to use right out of the box and feel like it will be a shaver that will last with me for a good long while. It can be a little noisy when others in the house are sleeping, but part of that is the acoustics in my bathroom. Personally I enjoy the acoustics when I am gettting my vocals warmed up in the shower. :-) I plan on traveling with work soon and hope that I enjoy it on the road as much as I have at home. It does leave a cool feeling on the face. Normally in the past I have had shavers that leave my face feeling hot or almost burned so i have avoided most electric shavers. I thinnk this is a great shaver for the man with a medium facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to receive a free razor from Braun ¬∞CoolTec System for a trail.  This electric razor has two blades that contour nicely to my and the cooling feature is actually refreshing.  It is not too heavy and the handle fits easily in my hand. The docking station is a bit bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower and on occasion have to shave areas multiple times to get all the hairs.  On most of my face the shave is nice and close, but on  on my chin under my lip I find that I can not get a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt say that I shave any faster then when I used the manual. But over all it is a good razor. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> For starters, let me just tell you that when it comes to shaving I have tried nearly every type of razor to ever be conceived, and very few have ever passed the test of a great shave. Whether it&#x27;s not a close enough shave or just being too harsh on the skin, there is almost always some part of the shave that comes up sub-par. So when I was received a Braun CoolTec razor through a program run by Braun, I was skeptical to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression when I received my CoolTec shaver in the mail were that aesthetics were simple, yet sleek. Also I liked the fact that the shaver was waterproof, had a cleaning station, and had a cooling bar to combat razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first use I immediately fell in love with the cooling bar. It was very soothing to the my skin and definitely helped with razor burn. I also enjoyed the capability of being able to just bring it into the shower and get two things done at once. But as for the closeness of the shave I was quite disappointed. For one, it took me much longer than usual to complete a full shave, and secondly, it just wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like it to be (this probably wont be problem for most people seeing as I have to shave twice a day just to keep a clean face, but for me it&#x27;s crucial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to base my review off of one use so I made sure to use the CoolTec for at least a full month before writing a review. After the month I found it easier to use the shaver to shave the main majority of my facial hair and then switch a disposable razor or a straight razor to finish up the hard shave areas. All in all the razor was pretty good, it didn&#x27;t get the closest of shaves, but it did help with the razor burn which to me is a big plus, and therefore I would recommend it to a person that has the same problem with razor burn or just doesn&#x27;t have to shave as frequently as I.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of electric shavers as I unfortunately have sensitive skin that reacts adversely to them.  I&#x27;ve tired a few different brands in the past(Norelco I believe) but haven&#x27;t found any that work for me and had more or less sworn off ever using electric shavers again.  However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot(it was free, what did I have to lose, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box I was quite impressed.  Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  I read through the instruction manual(yeah, I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  Now, I will add here that I was coming off of a no shave November and had a little bit of half beard going.  So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  However, I was not impressed with closeness of the shave.  I had patches of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; that I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get no matter how hard I tried to go over them.  As a result, I pulled out my shaving blade and took care of the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days I gave it another shot and once again amazed by the cooling affect.  I should insert here that in all of my other experiences with electric shavers I would experience &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; that would later turn into blisters(a lot like some cold sores).  With the Braun CoolTec system this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  But.........again a problem with getting all of the stubble around my jawline and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At this point I thought I would be leaving a poor review.  Thankfully I persevered and continued to use my Braun.  Maybe it was because I had been used to the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; of the three rounded variety and I wasn&#x27;t used to this system, but after about a week I had figured the Braun out and it was shaving like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the system now:  It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  It also comes with a self cleaning unit that does the trick and keeps it sparkling and sanitary. The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  I have not had to replace any of the cleaning packs yet and haven&#x27;t researched the cost, but I&#x27;ll jump that hurdle when I get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li> The cooling helps a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and almost always just a razor, however with the CoolTec I can use an electric shaver a lot more often without the irritation.  With the easing cleaning station and proper lotions I had as little irritation as I have with a regular razor which I normally resort to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself was not as superior however.  With any electric razor, getting a straight razor close shave will always be impossible, however in comparison to other shavers in its price range, the shave doesn&#x27;t really match up.  Especially when compared to a Panasonic.  The shave is still pretty close and nice, however it is a noticeable difference compared to the best in the price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty good, in comparison with other wireless systems in the price range.  Charging, cleaning and most other maintenance is very quick and easy.  Overall it is a great shaver, especially if irritation is high on your priorities.  However, if you are mainly after a close shave, there are better options in the price range without the cooling mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is right for you, then it is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This shaver was provided to me by a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver via a program run by Braun. The shaver came with the clean&amp;charge station. I was very excited to try out this new shaver as I have been wanting to ditch the disposal razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick facial hair and this shaver has no problem cutting through. The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is  cool. It is actually cold to the touch and definitely reduce irritation..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for over a month now, I will say that I do have to go over the same area a few more times to get a clean shave but the shave is still very close and worth it. The  clean&amp;charge station works well keeps the blades clean and sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool. I mean literally. I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Tossed it that day and went and bought the new Braun series 7! Now that&#x27;s a great razor</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve only had it for a month now, hopefully I&#x27;ll learn it&#x27;s secrets. or give up, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> After a few wks the cooling part of the razor was not working properly.  I purchased another Braun razor, because I really like them, a different model and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor so getting used to it and the cool sensation was a little weird at first but I quickly got used to the feeling and preferred it to my straight edge razor. I really like that it is water proof and cleans easily plus the cooltec works great. I felt it within 5 sec. The only thing that was tough was getting the shave close in areas of your face where the hair grows in several directions. It was tough to get it smooth but the cooltec kept me from getting irritated which meant I could use it every morning without issue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have time but have a nice day wherever you reside in the United States of America-have to go now</li>
            <li> Please note - this is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;ve used it once so far. I was always wary of electric shavers being prickly and not providing that clean shave you get from a Gilette razor. After using Braun Cooltec i found that it gives you a very close shave (almost as good as the Razor) and it is very comfortable to use. The Cooltec feature is cool but honestly i like my skin to be warm as it opens the pores in the skin and makes it an easier shave. It is also more time consuming as you have to pay attention to some parts that are missed and you have to shave them again - I was shaving after a week so i had a pretty good beard. I expected this new product to better right above the Adam&#x27;s apple region but it was disappointing. Overall - if you shave every other day then this product would probably be good but i had to use my razor at the end of the shave to make sure i covered those missed parts and the region above my Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> Was given this as a early birthday gift. I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past but always had pretty bad results. So far though I&#x27;m enjoying the Cooltech. Here&#x27;s my perspective..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS GOOD AND FAST: It does a good job on the bigger surfaces. My regular razor does too, but I&#x27;m spending probably $15-20 on disposables each week to keep that \\&quot;new blade\\&quot; look, and it adds up fast. This shaver let&#x27;s me hit the big areas fast and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to go over and over to get close. I remember the last electric I tried I had to go over 10 times to get it done. I returned that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROCK SOLID: This shaver is built like a rock. It&#x27;s heavy and feels like it&#x27;s going to last for years. I don&#x27;t want or need poorly made tools and was thrilled upon opening this gift to find a well built machine. I&#x27;m looking forward to saving $20/week x 52/year not having to buy disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE COOLING ELEMENT: You wouldn&#x27;t think they could come up with a gadget that can make shaving any better, but they did. Not exactly sure how, but the metal element in between the shaving surfaces actually gets COLD. Maybe it makes the hairs stand up so the cut is cleaner? Either way, it seems to make for a better shave. I think the infrared photo on the product review is real because it actually does get pretty cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EXTENDABLE DETAIL TRIMMER: This is the only thing I wish was somewhat better. If someone could make a detail trimmer actually TRIM down to the skin I&#x27;d be a super well groomed and happy camper. It works yes, but the metal teeth that cut are not lined up close enough to together to get the all the way down... to be specific. For now, I have to take the disposable and touch up here and there. Not a huge deal but still. A friend of mine suggested I turn the Cooltech upside down when trimming. Will try that and update this review soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: The solid build, fast and close overall shave and ease of cleaning make it a great product. For myself it was one of the only gifts I was truly happy to get this year.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Braun CoolTec for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s great.  No more razor burns. I have a light beard which this razor is great on.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase the cool tec shaver, as I was hoping it would be the \\&quot;magic bullet\\&quot; in my desire to get a clean, close shave with minimal irritation.  I should start however, by saying that I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for the better part of 30 years.  I&#x27;ve stuck closely to foil shavers as rotary just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have got a quick growing dark beard with a lot of grey.  I have used many Braun&#x27;s including the Series 7, which I feel is still the best Braun available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using a Panasonic ES-LA 63, which in my opinion, may be the best shaver out there for the price / performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review of the Cool-Tec.  Firstly, this is a series 5 shaver as noted on the box.  That&#x27;s not a good thing when you need a very high speed shaver to get the tough areas that even the Series 7 had challenges with.  The Cool-Tec, is a larger shaver and comes with the cleaning system from Braun, which I am less a fan of after using  the Panasonic which I simply wash out under the sink.  As for actual shaver performance, for me it is a middle of the pack shaver.  It definitely had its challenges getting the tough hairs on the bottom of my neck and just under my jaw line.  Although you feel the cooling action of the aluminum bar, its still no replacement for a  good pre shave lotion like Lectric Shave or an actual shave gel or foam which I currently use with my ES-LA63 with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hoping for no irritation - that is not the case with this shaver.  As with any shaver it takes a few weeks to get through the irritation period, however as I have purchased many electric shavers over the years, I know within 1-2 shaves what the shaver will be like in this regard. Braun suggests not using any lotion or pre-shave and that just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I had massive red blotches on my lower neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ok by my chin and upper lip area  however that was tempered by the fact that it took quite a few more passes to get it to that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, comparing to my Panasonic, it was no match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Returning the Cool - Tec&lt;br /&gt;2  Sticking with the Panasonic brand as its 13,000 RPM motors work a lot better for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want a wet shave, I would go with a Series 7 well before buying the Cool-Tec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would highly recommend Kiehl&#x27;s shave lotion as it does a tremendous job coupled with the Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00E1HI7J4 Kiehl&#x27;s Since 1851 &#x27;Close-Shavers Squadron&#x27; Brushless Shave Cream]]</li>
            <li> No better than a 20.00 dollar razor!</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent at shaving and very precise and quick without missing some hairs not cut . My previous shaver was Braun Activator which worked for me about 9 years and was the top at the time I bought it, I believe that this CT2CC is better shaver than Braun Activator . The cooling works good and makes difference but not WOW as you expect . I recommend this shaver as it&#x27;s not irritating to skin and gives you soft shaving even when the cooling is switched off .</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my husband. As a longtime blade user, he was initially very skeptical about switching to an electric since prior shavers didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave. He has however continued to use this razor for 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This has reduced razor burn on his neck, compared to a regular blade&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job for an electric shaver on his thick facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The cooltec aspect is pretty gimmicky - it doesn&#x27;t really add to the experience, other than feeling nice when it&#x27;s hot out&lt;br /&gt;- You have to keep buying the cleaning cartridges from Braun</li>
            <li> I recently received a Braun CoolTec CT5cc electric razor through a program run by Braun. Before I received this product I really did not feel that the CoolTec technology would really effect the feel of shaving very much. After my first time using this razor I can say that it actually does make shaving feel much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gets a full charge after only an hour of charging, and lasts much longer than I need for a shave. If you happened to forget to charge it after your last use it only takes a few minutes to charge if you only need it for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after turning the razor on you can definitely feel the cooling sensation on your face. The cold feeling the razor gives off is actually quite intense, and much more noticeable than I thought it would be. It definitely made shaving feel more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has been using a regular disposable razor to shave for a while, I can say that there was a less irritation than I normally feel using the CoolTec razor. Afterwards, I felt that I got a really close shave, and was very satisfied with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was not completely satisfied with was that I had trouble with stray hairs and patches. A couple of places took more than a couple of passes to get to. I did not feel that this razor did an amazing job shaving hair that was growing in every direction. It did take me a little longer to shave than normal, but the end result did not feel any different. It was a close, clean, and cool shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the clean and charge station that came with the set, it is easy to keep the razor clean, and even easier to keep it charged.  Without this cleaning system I would only be using water, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel that it was as clean afterwards. The razor is waterproof so you do not have to worry much about giving it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor if you you have want a comfortable shave, and enjoy using electric razors.</li>
            <li> I recieve this product through a promotion from Braun and I was stoked to try the new &amp;#34;cool tec&amp;#34; feature. Sad to say it didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would in the shower, it didn&#x27;t get as close as I would have liked it to. I tried again as a dry shave and it worked great. The cooling sensation felt GREAT on my face and I didn&#x27;t get razor bumps afterwards ( I usually do) so that made it much better since my skin is so sensitive. When it&#x27;s all said and done I like the product just wish it would be a smoother shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I just received this new CoolTec electric shaver thanks to a program by Braun and so far it&#x27;s pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed right away was the cooling system on my face. I was a little skeptical about it at first, but it&#x27;s legit. It&#x27;s almost like rubbing an ice cube on your cheeks, if that ice cube also gave you a close shave. Now, my skin doesn&#x27;t normally get incredibly irritated when I shave, but it also doesn&#x27;t normally feel GOOD after a shave like it does with the CoolTec. And no creams or gels necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave itself, I have no complaints. As with most electric shavers, you&#x27;re never going to get as close a shave as you would with a traditional blade, but this comes pretty close. I usually only use electric shavers and I have to sometimes go over certain hairs several times to get them. But this shaver is pretty good at getting most of them the first time. And if you do need to go over the same spot a couple times, the cooling thing keeps your skin from getting irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I&#x27;ve only had this for a week but weirdly it seems to be getting BETTER each time I use it. Not sure if the blades are breaking in or my skin and the razor are becoming friends, but I&#x27;m noticing a better shave the first time around which is saving me time AND my face is staying smoother longer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there&#x27;s the cleaning station. Now, admittedly I never really cleaned my previous electric shavers outside of holding it under some running water to clean out the hairs and have never really had a problem with that, so it seems the cleaning station was a bit excessive. But it does keep the razor clean which is a nice bonus. The only downsides are it&#x27;s a little bulky in terms of the amount of space it takes up on your sink. And the cleaning process itself, while quick, is a little loud. But those trivial issues pale in comparison to the clean, close, COOL shave this thing gives. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband received this through a program run by Braun and he LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;He normally complains of irritation and razor burn when he gets a new razor.  With this one, nothing but praise!&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and his skin is smooth, even in the afternoon (which is quite a feat for his whiskers!)&lt;br /&gt;A seriously great product and worth trying!</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m not a fan of electric shavers. At least I wasn&#x27;t until the first shave with this razor. I recently received this shaver through a program run by Braun, and before even using the shaver, just from the quality feel of the product I knew that this wasn&#x27;t like the models I&#x27;ve purchased from other companies in the past. I&#x27;ve had both foil and rotary electric shavers, yet both types disappointed me and I kept returning to my safety razor. This razor however, has taken me back into using an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major marketing point of this razor is the aluminum cooling bar, which I was slightly concerned about at first, fearing it would be uncomfortable like someone holding a cold hand to your face. Upon the first use, however, I realized my fears were not founded at all. The cooling bar feels great on the skin, and there is no skin irritation whatsoever when using this shaver. The shave is extremely smooth and very close, even without using a preshave lotion. I absolutely love the Clean &amp; Charge station, it&#x27;s a very modern looking station yet would fit in well in any bathroom.  I&#x27;ve found that popping it back into the station is far more convenient than plugging the razor in and leaving it on the counter,plus the automatic cleaning makes it feel like a brand new shaver every day I pick it up and shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, the Braun CoolTec would definitely be my suggestion.</li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it.  I used a manual do not think i&#x27;ll be going back.  Braun CoolTec razor shaves so close without irritation.</li>
            <li> The Braun CoolTec adds yet another feature onto Braun growing list - a cooling function.  Is it worth it?  If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to razor burn, I would say yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec system itself works very well, and feels very cooling and soothing on my skin.  As I use the cooling function intermittently, I can&#x27;t speak to how much it runs down the charge compared to not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with some previous Braun models, this include the built-in cleaning system, and is very convenient to clean your razor at the push of a button.  I received my razor through a Braun program and was hoping my previous cleaning refills would be compatible - and they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is easy and decent, but I wish the shaving head itself did not feel quite so wide.  Compared to my previous Braun it felt a little wider, and felt like I was pressing harder to make up for it.</li>
            <li> I usually hate shaving, and especially with shaving machines, however, for the first time, it didn&#x27;t feel so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all - Braun&#x27;s CoolTec (provided to me by a program run by Braun) looks good and of high quality. You can def see this is German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is solid and the cleaning functionality is really cool and actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaving part - I tried it twice. The first time I had not-so-short facial hair, and it was not fun (to say the least). I realized that no matter what, shaving machines are not meant to tackle lengthy facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried it - I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days, which was reasonable for using a machine. Indeed it was better than any other shaving machine I used (although last time was about 5 years ago). The shaving experience went fairly smooth, and the cooling element actually helps not feeling the &#x27;plucking&#x27; action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that is used to use a classic shaving  machine - this is surely a good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried using electric razors several times in the past and every time, I used it once or twice and then returned or re-gifted it. The irritation was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wear a collared shirt for days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the promotion that Braun was running to try out the new CoolTec, I did some research. It seemed that the new aluminum cooling bar may be the answer to my previous problem. I figured that I have probably spent at least $1000 dollars on razors in my lifetime and I still have a long way to go so if this new system causes me less irritation than it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 30 days now and I am very pleased. The irritation is minimal. The aluminum cooling bar creates a cooling sensation that tames the irritation. The adaptable 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade provides a close shave with minimal passes. The Clean &amp; Charge station keeps the unit clean. I like this new system so much that I recommended it to my best friend of 20+ years.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun customer for many, many years. My current Braun doesn&#x27;t have a fancy cooling bar, but it does a great job with my morning shave, so I was interested to see how well the new Braun CoolTec system worked in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Braun CoolTec system was provided to me via a program run by Braun, so my financial investment wasn&#x27;t a consideration, as it would be for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I would recommend the Braun CoolTec to a family member or friend if they have a little more to invest in their shaver system - short term and long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short-term, the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t necessarily warrant an upgrade if you already had a great Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-term, the Clean&amp;Charge station, while providing some healthy conditioning of the shaver, is a long-term expense, too. I&#x27;ve gotten used to brushing my Braun with the provided brush, keeping it neat and clean. That&#x27;s one of the fantastic things about any Braun shaver - the parts are very easy to clean. I used to have a Remington shaver, and cleaning was more tedious due to the way the motor assembly attached to the shaver head, and it really tore up my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve never experienced redness or irritation with my previous Braun, I wouldn&#x27;t be inclined to recommend the Braun CoolTec system if it doesn&#x27;t solve an existing problem. If I did experience redness or irritation, I can see how the really &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooling bar might help, and the 3-stage cutting system might be a more comfortable shave. However, the end result - a smooth, clean shave - is achievable with most Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, before buying a Braun CoolTec system, consider whether the great new cooling bar technology will solve an issue you might have with redness and irritation. Also, consider your budget and the great many other Braun models available at a lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the Braun CoolTec shaver a 4-star rating because it&#x27;s yet another Braun shaver system to consider favorably against other options.</li>
            <li> Update to original review -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver 2-3 times a week for the last 3 weeks I have formed a new opinion. I still like everything about the unit except it&#x27;s ability to provide a decently smooth shave. The Cooltec is still pretty neat, and I appreciate the chill as I scrape the lightening fast razors across my face, It&#x27;s just that the shave isn&#x27;t really that close. I change my facial hair fairly regularly, going from full beard to clean cut, and all points in between. When I want an area of my face to be hair free, it has to be hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is a nice package, and having it provided through a program run by Braun was great! Overall I&#x27;d say for the quality of shave (it is a shaver, right?) it is a little overpriced. I think $89.00 is a closer ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Braun Cooltec if you do a full face shave on a regular basis and don&#x27;t like the burn of your existing equipment. And by all means reread my original review as most of it still applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------ Original ------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get very excited to try new technology, and because of a program run by Braun I was provided with a CoolTec electric shaver to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression is that the thing is cool, cool as in really neat. The packaging is pretty and gadgety. You will want to open it right away. When you do open the box you will see more parts than expected. Fumble through it all and you realize there&#x27;s nothing to worry about. Everything you want and nothing you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself has a great feel, very weighty and grippy. The same can be said of all the components. Thick plastic and rubber all around. And I have to mention that the included cleaning brush, very short and stubby, is actually useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver didn&#x27;t have any charge on it but that&#x27;s fine because you get a full shave&#x27;s worth of juice in 5 minutes, just as the instructions suggest. Another note about charging is that you don&#x27;t have to worry aboutrunning the power all the way down before recharging, a plus to me as bathroom outlets are usually a little crowded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver provides the same above average closeness as many high-end systems but, there was literally zero irritation. No bumps, redness, burn, anything. It honestly feels like a treat when using. And afterwards was the biggest surprise. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve just ran razors all up and about your face. These things don&#x27;t provide a totally bald shave but that microscopic hair that is left is feathery soft. Not like others I&#x27;ve tried which left stubble. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clean&amp;Charge station, even after shaving just once, to get a feel for how it works. I&#x27;ve never had an electric with this feature before but was pretty happy with the operation. Removing the shaver is a little clumsy because it&#x27;s so snug while inside but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the Braun CoolTec system. I recommend confidently.</li>
            <li> The cool feature is great and thus works great  for a good quick shave.  Flexible head and smaller base would be nice. U will definitely use this in between razor cuts.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec for free from a program Braun runs. I havent used an electric shaver in a while and i really liked it. The cooling feature is nice especially with sensitive skin. I got a close shave with it and was enough for me. The cleaning station work pretty well. Overall im pleased with the Braun CoolTec.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun CoolTec from a program they are running. It‚Äôs a hefty machine that gives a close shave. The cooling effect does work which is nice but I have a full beard and I feel like it isn‚Äôt able to get right up to the edge of my beard, even with the trimmer. It doesn‚Äôt stick out long enough for it to be effective for me.  Another drawback is that it takes up a lot of counter space and the self-cleaning is very loud. Pros: it can be used in the shower and gives a close shave. Cons: Expensive to maintain, not great for beards.</li>
            <li> The main attraction of this shaver is the CoolTec System which really works. The cooling bar in between the shaver blades does a good job cooling the skin to circumvent shaver burns and other skin irritations. A small catch is that it doesn&#x27;t immediately start cold. It takes around 15 to 30 seconds to get the cooling bar cold enough to work it&#x27;s magic. Once it&#x27;s cool though, the cooling sensation is a very nice feeling while I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic electric shaver previously and I&#x27;m afraid that shaver is going to be put in storage. The Braun shaver is as good as the Panasonic and shaves as close as most electric shavers can.&lt;br /&gt;The system also has a clean and charge station with a replaceable cleaning fluid that installs super easily at the bottom of the station. You just press a button and the bottom part extends down for you to slide in the cleaning fluid container and then you just press it back up and into the station. There&#x27;s only one button on the top to start the cleaning cycle. Keeping it simple is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;One downside of the Braun shaver is that you are unable to plug the shaver straight to the charger/power cable. You can only charge with the station or a small cradle thing that the charging cable plugs into. So that&#x27;s one extra item to pack if you are traveling long enough to have to recharge it. On the other hand, since there&#x27;s no way to plug a cable into the shaver, there&#x27;s less chance of any electrical accidents because you can use this shaver in the shower. The last thing you want is a wet shaver that might cause a short when you try to charge it before the charging part fully dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the trimmer on the side as I do not keep or maintain a sideburn or mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the shaver also comes with a little brush and a sturdy shaver-shaped travel case which is handy in avoiding getting hair &#x27;crumbs&#x27; on other toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver was provided to me via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System free from a program run by Braun. Overall I liked the razor, but it was not strong enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features that are good about the razor: self-cleaning works well and is easy, cooling feature is very nice, charge lasts a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Features that are not as good about the razor: when hair is long it pulls on the hair, my hair is thick and it pulled slightly even when short, did not do well shaving the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked the razor but would not purchase it at this price range. The Cooltech feature is a great idea and helps with razor burn, but does not outweigh the poor performance of the razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotional program from Braun. Right out of the box, I realized that I needed to make more room on my bathroom counter. The razor itself is big and so is the charging / cleaning station. Once all set-up, the razor did not take long to charge. I immediately tested it out and was pleasantly surprised. Gone are the days of having to soak my face in advance to prevent nicks and burns. This razor is very efficient as long as you take your time to hit all areas of your face multiple times. You pretty much know you are done when you hear no more cutting. I do wish the razor was a little smaller and that my finger did not rest on the CoolTec button. Speaking of CoolTec, this is a great feature, that while you may think is gimmicky, actually feels very nice on my skin. I am curious to see how long the cleaning solution lasts before I need to purchase it. I do like how I will save money in the long run from having to buy shaving cream and razors.</li>
            <li> I looked forward to the arrival of my new razor that I was selected to receive through a promotion from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the design and the CoolTec system in this particular razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first morning I used the razor, I was surprised at how much pressure I needed to use to move it along my face.  Since it is a much heavier weight, I assume that was the cause.  I was impressed with how well of a shave I got from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting this, I have alternated between using my old Norelco for daily touch ups, as it is much lighter and quicker to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, since I need to shave and go quickly, I would stick with a different razor. One that is a lighter weight for half the price does the job just the same. If you have the time and the money, go for it.</li>
            <li> First off I received this shaver for free as part of a marketing program. I was more than excited to try it out as I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past and had been looking for a new model that would be a good option for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system not only comes with a cooling option that leaves your skin flawless, it also has a cleaning kit for helping to clean the inside without any hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would like to say that everything went as expected without a hitch I just can&#x27;t say so. The Razer didn&#x27;t clean very well within the charger station and when I shaved with it it would regularly leave behind longer hairs. I tried changing directions and moving it around, but overall it just seemed very average to subpar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit skeptical when I received this shaver. I have never thought of myself as someone who experienced razor burn, so the CoolTec feature seemed like it would just be a gimmick. I have also always preferred a rotary shaver because I did not get a good shave with the last foil shaver I tried. So my expectations were not very high for this shaver, but I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec feature is a very nice sensation. The aluminum cooling bar is not cold, just cool. As I said, I didn&#x27;t think I suffered from razor burn, but after using this shaver, I noticed that my skin is not as red as it is when using other shavers and it is noticeably less dry. Braun has solved a problem that I didn&#x27;t even know I had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is a good size, looks very sleek, and provides a nice, close shave. I have to make a couple passes over some areas to get all the hairs, but I have always had to do that with any shaver I have used, so I think it is less an issue with the shaver and more a problem with the thickness of my facial hair. The Clean and Charge station makes it very simple to keep the shaver clean and ready for use the next morning. To conserve the cleaning solution, I have only been running the cleaning cycle every three days and have had no problems so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint about this shaver is the charging mechanism. When I am at home, I can just drop the shaver into the Clean and Charge station and it will charge automatically. When I&#x27;m traveling, however, I can&#x27;t just plug the shaver into the wall like I have with any other shaver I have owned. Instead, you have to bring along a charging &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; that the power cord attaches to and then sit the shaver in the shell to charge. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s an extra item that I have to pack and keep track of while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the minor annoyance with the travel charging, I am extremely pleased with this shaving system. Now that I have experienced the CoolTec feature, I don&#x27;t want to give it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this shaver via a program run by Braun.**</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun electric shavers for the past 10 years.  This is my 3 one, and by far my favorite.  I was given the electric shaver was via a program run by Braun was very excited to try it out.  After shaving with it for 2 weeks, I put my older Braun shaver up for good.  The cooling sensation that you get during the shave took a while to get used to, but I have not had any skin irritations during this time.  The ice cold feeling you get during your shave is pretty neat.  The only thing I did not like about it was the size of the head.  It is a little bit larger than my older Braun and it was tougher to get to the areas under my nose.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I Received my Braun CoolTec Shaver free from a program run by Braun. Great kit! It shaved all of my facial hair smoothly with no snags or pulling...NONE That was the biggest surprise. The CoolTec strip would chill my skin as the razor made each pass making a very very comfortable shave. The chilling effect really is great idea and it works well. If you don&#x27;t like it that cold, you can turn it off by pressing the little snowflake button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 minutes of shaving, my face was completely clean and smooth. The side burn shaver/ trimmer is not precise and it doesn&#x27;t allow me to outline my beard evenly. I guess because the head of it is so small. The clean shave with the comfort cold strip makes this a no brainer if you are looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I recently received this razor as a promotional product from Braun.  As a 30 something male that absolutely hates shaving, I have found the Braun CoolTec System to be a great razor.  It allows me to shave without all the messy conditioners and creams.  I love that it cools my face and I don&#x27;t feel a burn after like I do with most razors.  I like that you can use it wet or dry and truly enjoy the fact that it cools as it shaves.  This has changed my opinion on electric razors forever.</li>
            <li> I Received this Razor from a promotion Braun was doing. I was very skeptical about it at but man it has a way to shut down any disbelief. It really works well dry or wet. The only down side compared to a traditional razor is that it must be trimmed hair. But gets a close shave irritation free and most of all razor bumps free!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun&#x27;s self cleaning razors since the Syncro line, currently using the Pulsonic 790cc-4.  While I think the 790cc-4 is the best razor ever made, like a moth to the flame I had to try the CoolTec razor.    Positives:  the cooling bar really works and the razor gives a reasonably close shave    Negatives:  the cooling bar requires the shaver heads to be further apart, to make room for the cooling bar, making shaving more difficult and uncomfortable, the shaver performance is poor when compared to the 790cc meaning that it takes a lot longer to shave, as a result the shaver head would otherwise heat up if you didn&#x27;t have the cooling bar.    Since you can shave closer, faster, and more comfortably with the 790cc-4 I&#x27;m sticking with that, but would be happy to buy a new top of the line razor with shave performance similar to the 790cc which includes the cooling tech, however, there is some work to be done by Braun.  The cooling technology should be built into the razor head system to keep the shaver head cool, it doesn&#x27;t actually need to touch the skin (unless that&#x27;s the only way it works).  This way the shaver head can remain more compact without warming up while shaving.  If the cooling tech does need to touch the skin then maybe they can make the center cutter the cooling bar (i.e. cool the center cutter) to keep the shaver head as compact as possible.    My two cents, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor, as I received it as part of a program run by Braun, and it came through on some and fell short on others. The cooling strip is nice and really does seem to help reduce the irritation. The self cleaning function is handy and the charging dock is nice and compact for when I travel. I don&#x27;t shave every day but when I do this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as I expected. Perhaps if I did shave every day this would improve as my facial hair wouldn&#x27;t be as long.The shave does feel a bit awkward in my hand but this could be attributed to the fact that I&#x27;m not used to using an electric razor. Overall is a decent razor and cleaner than using a manual razor. I&#x27;m actually thinking of getting one for my brother for Christmas.</li>
            <li> for everyday up keep its good but if you have longer facial hair it doesn&#x27;t do the job to great but my hair is also coarse so that might have something to do with it.. I the like cleaning feature that is nice but overall it isn&#x27;t that bad the cooling is also pretty neat its worth giving it a shot for sure</li>
            <li> I got the Braun CoolTec razor as part of a promotion for no charge from Braun.  It is what I&#x27;d call a middle of the line electric that does a decent job with a nice feature to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; your face while shaving.  The cooling sensation is more is less the same sensation you&#x27;d get by pulling a can of Coke out of your fridge and rubbing it on your face.  Not freezing, but also not sure it is really doing too much to make my skin feel any better.  The built in charger and cleaning system does a great job of taking the hassle out of shaving.  It will wash, sterilize and dry it all in a single button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am a big fan of Braun electric razors (have used the 360 Complete 8985 for about 5 years and the 790cc for the past 3 or so), but those razors just shave so much closer than this model.  It really struggles to get neck hairs on only 24 hours of not shaving.  I found myself doing many more passes than I did with the 790cc and actually caused more irritation.  If you can afford the higher end model, I would definitely say you should skip this one and move up to the 790cc.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec razor through a testing program offered through Braun.  After opening the package, setting it up in my bathroom and letting it charge, I was stoked to think I had a new awesome electric razor.  The first time I used it was in a rush.  I had to shave quickly and this razor did not come close to quickly.  I did feel the cooling sensation coming from the razor which did feel good, but it was not cutting the facial hairs off like I expected it to.  I tried all sort of techniques like going in a circular formation, straight up and down, etc.  I ended up using my other electric shaver to finish the job.  So I thought maybe my facial hair was oily, since it was in the middle of the afternoon when I shaved instead of right after a shower like I usually do.  No.  The next morning after my shower I tried it again, with the same results.  I also have trouble with it shaving right under my nose.  The electric razor I use now has a rounded corner triangular design with slots that the hair go down in to cut.  This razor has little holes that the hair needs to go down in to cut.  But I did give it several days to try it out, but it&#x27;s not working for me.  My wife ended up taking it over to use on her legs.  She also wasnt that impressed with it.  Also after using this razor I noticed my &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; was appearing sooner than normal (by maybe an hour or two).  So I think the razor is not cutting as deep as my regular razor is.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaving system through a program from Braun to try out. After using it for a while I really like it. I&#x27;ve used other electric razors in the past and have had mixed results. Most do not get nearly close enough to give me that smooth feeling and almost all irritate my face. This razor definitely cut better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried. My face is super smooth after a shave and stays that way for almost an entire day. The charging/cleaning station is awesome. Keeps my razor clean without me having to do anything. I still have some irritation but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. Irritation just comes as part of the package with my hair and skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling function however isn&#x27;t that great. The razor definitely feels cool against the face while shaving but not very cool. Just cool enough that you can feel that its colder than the surrounding air. I doubt that the cooling has any use other than sounding like a nice addition. I would not recommend purchasing this item just for the cooling sensation. Its a great razor in its own right.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.  I was given this razor to try as part of a Braun program.  Having never been a fan of electric razors I was weary of the idea that the razor would be any good but it surpassed most of my expectations.  The cool tec feature is awesome.  My face felt great when I was done shaving.  I have a thick beard so it takes a long time for me to shave all the hair which is the reason it only got the four stars but above a 3 because of how much better it did over previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  The cleaning feature is great as well as the precision shaver on the side.  The directions left a little the be desired.  Wasn&#x27;t fond of have to go to a different guide to look at the illustrations to match up with the paperwork.  Overall if you love electric razors this will be worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  If your not a huge fan of electric razors you will still like it.</li>
            <li> I received the shaving system for free from a program through Braun.  I am posting this under my girlfriends account because I don&#x27;t have an amazon account.  I have always bought disposable razors, I just believed they did better than electric razors.  After I tried the Braun CoolTec Shaving system, I will never go back!!!  My face has been getting red for awhile with skin irritations, and I thought it was the water.  Well after using this razor for a few weeks my skin is clearing up.  I never thought it could be my old razor doing this!  The cool temperature feels so good on my face!  I like how the razor cleans itself, and the travel case will come in handy this Christmas!  I am so thankful to have been able to try this razor!!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver free directly from Braun to test out and review.  I have used this electric shaver daily for the past 3 weeks and I am pleased to say that I really like it. Prior to receiving the Braun CoolTec Shaver, I was using a Philips Norelco electric shaver.  I like the Braun CoolTec in that it fits comfortably in my hands and easy to use without worry that I would nick myself.  The mornings are the most hectic in our household and often times, I have to shave with one hand while the other hand is helping with my kids get ready.  The Braun provides a close clean shave and does not make too much noise.  The chamber is easy to clean and the battery life is very good.  I do not keep it charged in the cradle constantly but rather charge it every 3 to 4 days.  The are a couple of negatives in my opinion and one of them is that the cord for the battery charger is very short.  I wished it were longer so that I could place the cradle further away from the socket to charge as right now, it has to be directly next to it or else it will not reach.  I also wished they would make the handle of the cleaning brush a bit longer.  If you have big hands, it is hard to hold such a tiny cleaning brush in your hands to scrape out the loose hairs.</li>
            <li> Since I was in college, in the early 1990&#x27;s, I have used blade razors.  I used the Gillette Fusion Razor for the past several years.  I was given the Braun CoolTec system to try.  I have stopped using blade razors and have never been happier.  I stopped using electric razors because they never cut my course beard hair close enough, so I spent a lot of time going back over areas that I had already shaved.  Often this lead to in-grown hairs and razor bumps that hurt.  Also, cleaning the razors was impossible.  It chopped the hair so that whenever I opened the shaving head I would spray whisker dust everywhere.  Once I switched to blade razors I got a very close shave in fewer strokes and fewer in-grown hairs.  However the expense of using blade razors is becoming quite cost prohibitive.  I received my Braun CoolTec System through a campaign run by Braun, so while price was not a consideration in the long run it will still be cheaper than continuing to use blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;What do I love about the Braun CoolTec system.  First, is the closeness of the shave.  It does as well as the blade razor, but it does something the blade razor could never do it cools the skin on my face.  The CoolTec bar actually cools as I shave.  It feels great.  The cool feeling as I shave is so refreshing.  I am done in half the time of shaving with a razor and with twice the comfort.  The cooling effect comes in very handy when I go on a shaving holiday. (When I choose to not shave for a couple of days.)  The Razor does tend to pull the longer hairs out, but no worse than shaving with a blade.  The benefit is the CoolTec bar.  It cools the skin between each shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about Braun system is the cleaning and charging station.  I no longer have to take the heads off to clean the razor blades.  I shave, put the razor back in the base, press a button and it cleans and charges the razor at the same time.  If I am traveling, I can just rinse the blades under water.  It is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I may never go back to using blades again.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun ¬∞CoolTec Solo from a program that was run by Braun.  I like the style of the razor. The CoolTec feature did help with skin irritation. It did a pretty good job shaving my face. The razor did have a hard time shaving my neck. Over all a good razor.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say this is the frustration free packaging advertised is very nice. I have have to use a Swiss army knife to open anything up and this kit was easy to open. This is only the second electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and it blows my old one out of the water. I was happy to get the opportunity to try this through a program run by Braun. The \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; aspect of this shaver was extraordinary. I&#x27;ve never shaved with anything before and gotten the cool, soothing sensation that this gives. It almost feels like I&#x27;m rubbing ice on my face and not a razor. There&#x27;s no irritation or redness, just a cool clean feeling that I really enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a dock this a star because I don&#x27;t feel that the shave is as close as my previous razor. When I grew my beard out some, this didn&#x27;t trip as close as I would have liked. I&#x27;ll attribute this to the cooling element getting in the way I suppose. However, on general day to day shaving, it gets the job done and feels great doing it. If you have the money to spend, I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Shave 5 star - may not be as close as other systems, but my need is to be able to shave daily at all.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon disclosures re: product - 0 stars - Can&#x27;t return it because cleaning solution flammable.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service - 5 stars - took care of my problem and made what I was sure was going to be a frustrating ordeal into a pleasant experience. Good job Amit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand not being able to return the \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts I would be able to use this because I haven&#x27;t been able to frequently use any shaving system, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, but mine came with a nick in the cooling bar so I figured I would exchange it through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE. can&#x27;t select the product to return with a note about it containing hazardous materials. I guess I will pursue it over the phone or through Braun, but this a real F-you to not  disclose that when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, went through help to find a chat window and customer service rep made everything ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor. I can understand how those who can use any razor would say it&#x27;s not the best shave. I still feel a barely noticeable stubble. My problem is, no matter what technique, razor, blade, cream, lotion, pre treatment, method, I have used in the past, if I shaved more than 2x per week I would get a horrible rash. If I have a special event on a saturday, I literally would not shave for at least 4 days and then just before I put on my shirt and headed out the door I would shave and hope I didn&#x27;t break out. Many times sunday morning I would have a slight rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this system, I let it run a minute to get cold and then shave every morning. one time when it felt a little sensitive, I stopped, took off the cartridge and just ran the cooling bar over my face. no breakout, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to have a shaving option now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it, I noticed what others commented about re: not cutting a lot of barely too long hairs. I used some of that feedback to trim each of those with the clipper and then shave them. after a couple days, no stray long hairs.</li>
            <li> Well, after finally deciding to get a new Braun shaver I ended up settling with the Cooltec. SO on to my thoughts the thing that sold me was the cooling feature which I do like. The mediocre about the Cooltec would be the shave I would give a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; as in it has troubles along the jaw line and the pop up trimmer seems to do nothing? I still have and works my 8 year old Braun 7526 which kills this model. The other fault I would have to say is the cleaning/charging station there is no drying feature other than the shaver running to dry when it finishes its cleaning cycle. I have found that after just three cleanings it leaves hair residue under the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to close I guess I&#x27;m going and should have purchased the 9595 like I wanted in the first place. The good is my nephew will be getting his first Braun shaver for free....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shavers after nearly 30 years of shaving with various Gillette blades.  The blades just got to be annoyingly expensive, so I thought I&#x27;d give electric a try.  I&#x27;ve been at it two months, and I have a few thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The cooltec feature works well.  I haven&#x27;t had a hint of razor burn.  It actually feels nice to shave.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with that feature.  My skin seems healthier.  I can&#x27;t really quantify that, but it seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as a razor.  Nor is it faster.  It&#x27;s slower and not as good of a shave.  I have never had 5 o-clock shadow, but I have it now.  I also found like a half inch whisker on my neck that I had apparently missed.  No amount of angling would shave it, so I had to break out the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a comfortable, less-expensive (in the long run), slower, not quite as close shave.  Meh... it&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;ll keep at it, though.</li>
            <li> I was provided this shaver by Braun to test in early November and have been using now for 2 months.  I really like the performance of the shaver and the resulting smooth skin. Not a fault of the shaver but more due to my skin/hair I shaved twice a day (morning and evening) to keep from needing to &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; with a regular razor. Comparatively this razor shaved to a much smoother level than other shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charge lasted nearly 7 days using the CoolTec functionality for all the shaves.  If travelling for extended time without ability to charge you could eek out a few more days if you turned off the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel charger worked pretty good, but the kit I received only had 1 power cable that had to be shared between the travel  charging sled and the cleaning/charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning /charging base did an excellent job of cleaning, far superior to rinsing with water alone.  There is a slight oddity in that Braun has designed this with the shaver at an angle when cleaning/charging (I believe to allow for the cleaning solution to drain from the shaver more efficiently) that does mean you may have to occasionally reposition the shaver to get the shaver charging.  This is not a big deal, just something you have to be conscience of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this shaver and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> What a great shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool technology is great and helps with the irritation that shaving always brings.  I love the ability to clean the shaver at the push of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is great and I use it a lot as I often stay overnight at my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system to try out as part of a Bzz Campaign.  I love Braun and I was so excited to be able to test this razor.  After using it for almost a month, I must say I have very mixed feelings about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positives...the razor looks cool and is totally comfortable to hold an maneuver while shaving.  While I was skeptical of the CoolTec aluminum cooling bar, it is one of my favorite features.  This bar, placed between the foil blades, instantly cools to around 40 degrees, giving a cooling sensation to the skin as you shave.  It is really a unique feeling and seems to significantly cut down or eliminate the power razor skin irritation/burn.  I also love the cleaning and recharging station.  When you are finished shaving, you set the razor in the station, push a button, and in 3 minutes the razor is clean, lubricated, charged and ready for the next shave.  For these reasons alone (cooling bar and cleaning station) I gave it 4 stars.  However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives...this razor sounds like a lawnmower.  It is so loud that I won&#x27;t use it early in the morning for fear that I will wake up my wife.  Also, I found that the trimmer was almost unusable.  It is on the back side of the razor, and when deployed, it stays concealed behind the razor as you try to use it.  I wish the placement had been different as I found I was switching to a different razor to trim my moustache, sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest thing to me is:  How did is shave?  And I must say this was the most disappointing thing about this razor.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong...it shaves.  But it does not give a close shave.  If you like that still rough/stubbly feeling...this is your razor.  If you like that clean smooth feeling...this is not for you.  I tried up and down, backward and forward, with the whiskers and against the whiskers, shaving and re-shaving...but I was never able to get a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave this razor 3 stars.  But because its a Braun, and it does have some cool features (pun intended), I like it....i just don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric razors in the past (including older Braun models) so when I received the CoolTec as part of a marketing campaign from Braun I was a bit skeptical.  I have Very coarse beard hair and sensitive skin so I usually end up going back to clippers pretty quick after trying a razor, and just forgetting about a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened my CoolTec at the end of Movember so I had a pretty dense forest of hair on my face.  Trimmed down with some clippers, and then gave the razor a try.  I was able to shave my entire face in a quarter of the time it took with my old Braun razor (less passes), and even after not shaving in over a month my skin wasn&#x27;t really irritated.  I could actually feel the cooling bar on my neck so I know it wasn&#x27;t just a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plus for the CoolTec is the self cleaning base.  With my thicker beard hair I&#x27;ve become accustomed to having to clear the blades of manual razors after every stroke.  The CoolTec didn&#x27;t clog or bog down at all, and after the self cleaning cycle the blades were complete clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve seen to the CoolTec is that it doesn&#x27;t handle hair with any amount of length.  I can&#x27;t really hold this against it though since no other razor I&#x27;ve seen can handle longer hair (1/8th - 1/4 inch) with any competency.  So if you let your hair go more than a few days/week I would suggest going over it with some clippers first.  After than the CoolTech will give you one of the smoothest shaves you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This shaver was provided via a program run by Braun. I liked that it had a cleaning system so you didn&#x27;t have to waste time cleaning it yourself. However, I think it&#x27;s dumb that they force you to spend money every few months replacing the cleaning system fluid. The shaver feels too cold to the touch, and maybe I can&#x27;t figure out the correct way to use it, but it feels very awkward to use, and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. I would not recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> My Braun Series 7 was acting up after about five years and figuring that it didn&#x27;t owe me anything, I decided to go for the Cooltec. I&#x27;ve been shaving with it for a week and I must tell you that it makes me laugh when I&#x27;m using it! The cooling feature is absolutely ingenious. It totally eliminated that irritation I would get on my neck is gone, and at the same time, I also get a much closer shave than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very, very, very rough beard, so I&#x27;ve spent much of my life trying razor after razor and shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun (twice). Braun wins and the pricing from Amazon made it a real deal. At the $200 level, it made me wince a bit, but at $135, it was more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this e-razor for just over a month now.  Braun sent this to me to test out and give an honest review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like one needed a degree in aeronautical engineering to operate this when I first opened it up.  WOW at the stuff!  WOW at the reading material!  Once you start looking over everything though it began to make sense, and was rather easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start of with what it has:&lt;br /&gt;Counter station-  This thing is nice.  Kinda big, but it&#x27;s easy to use.  It&#x27;s got a cleaner built into it, which does rather good.  The cleaner is a bit noisy though.  Charging is easy, just drop it in and press.  A beep will let you know it&#x27;s charging.  I have yet to test out the battery life as I charge it every time that I use it.  It has a cleaning fluid reservoir that needs to be changed every so often (I have yet to change mine).  The buttons are easy, the readouts are simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessories- Brush: simple, brush, works.  Case:  Form fitting, tough.  Another plastic holder type thing: I think it&#x27;s used for just setting your e-razor on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now to the razor itself.  Dual wide heads do a good job of shaving.  I&#x27;m personally a fan of the regular razor and cream but it eats my face up if done to often.  The electric razors help to keep a smooth looking face and no burn.  Blades are suppose to last a long time (2 years I think?), 1 month in for me and they are staying strong.  I&#x27;ve tested this out with a variety of stubble from the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow to a few days worth of growth.  It does well with both, but too long and I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work to well (numerous days).  I never really got that tugging/pulling feeling with this razor (think hair plucking), so props to it on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning of this razor is easy, just slide off the blue sleeve remove the heads, shake over a can, and it&#x27;s clean!  Touch up with a brush if needed.  The base/stand does a great final job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nextis the cooling strip.  That&#x27;s what the big hype about this is, the cooling strip.  No razor burn, feels fresh, cool, light.  Well yeah, it does.  Run it for a minute or two then touch it with your finger, it&#x27;s freezing!  I personally never really got razor burn with an electric shaver, so this was kinda....pointless for me.  Did it feel neat?  Sure.  If I had sunburn on my face, it would feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I liked this razor, but I can&#x27;t justify the price of it for that &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; cooltec strip.  Other people here might need it, if so, it is cool (literally, cold).  It did a good job with making your face look clean shaven, but a swipe of the hand told me it was just short enough not to really see (I like my face baby smooth after a shave, like slick, straight razor hot towel kinda smooth).  I have other brands of e-razors and they do a bit better job then this.  I would personally recommend looking at other brands for a razor first.  If others fail you, then fall back on this one (after all it did do it&#x27;s job in the end, just not for the price).</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was the Braun FreeGlider that utilized a skin conditioner to keep the skin lubricated.  Unfortunately, it finally fell apart (after dropping it a few times over the seven years I had it).  This unit utilizes a CoolTec bar that keeps cool and soothes the skin while shaving.  I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but I can assure that it does work well.  The charge and clean base station keeps the unit fully charged.  It also cleans &amp; lubricates the shaving head.  This being the third Braun shaver I have owned over the last 15 years.  I can say that I am a dedicated Braun shaver fan.</li>
            <li> Very good design; ease of holding and very good close shaves as a result. The &amp;#34;CoolTec&amp;#34; aspect of this brand isn&#x27;t a gimmick; it really works. It feels real cool while shaving. Don&#x27;t know how they do this but it&#x27;s a nice feature particularly on sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best electric razor I have had! The cool technology makes shaving so much more comfortable. I get a great shave. Nice and close.</li>
            <li> I just experienced the best shave of my life.  Braun was running a program that afforded me the opportunity to try out the Braun Cooltec system.  I never knew that shaving at such cooler temperatures could make that big of a difference but it did!  I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to conventional razors or shaver again! This new technology is amazing from the closest shave ever with no irritation to talk about.  Even the charging station that cleans the shaver for me after I&#x27;m done...........Well done Braun!  Well done!</li>
            <li> The new Braun CoolTec System is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned and was provided via a program run by Braun. I love the CoolTec technology that leaves my skin feeling less ittitated that any other electric shaver while still giving me a close shave that is comfortable. I would recommend this electric razor to everyone! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I gave up on using electric razors more than a decade ago. During that time I always believed that you just couldn&#x27;t beat the closeness of normal blade based razors. Also in the past electric razors always left me with red bumps on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I relented and started using the ¬∞CoolTec System electric shaver via a program run by Braun. And I am very glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ¬∞CoolTec System left me with a shave just as close as a blade, and the cooling factor prevented the red burn marks that I have experienced in the past. This electric razor changed my mind, saved me time, and has left me with a completely different opinion..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would enthusiastically recommend this product to all men who shave. The benefits are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wives should definitely put this on this holiday shopping list for their sons and husbands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of an electric shaver kind of guy. I tried my dad&#x27;s electric shaver when I first started shaving and it irritated the heck out of my face and didn&#x27;t really shave all that well so I haven&#x27;t tried one since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got the CoolTec shaver the other day from a special program conducted by Braun and all that changed. I got a really close, fast shave and it didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all thanks to the new cooling feature on the CoolTec razor. At first I thought my face was wet, but it was actually just the cooling feature. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I actually dry shaved and it didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. I have super sensitive skin, especially around my neck, but I haven&#x27;t even had as much as one red mark. It even shaves my neck close and the hair runs in all sorts of different directions there. I&#x27;m very impressed with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with the automatic charger that cleans and sanitizes the razor at the same time. it was super easy to setup, too. My razor was cleaned, charged, and ready to go the next morning after setting it up. This is by far the nicest shaver I&#x27;ve ever seen. You can even use it in the shower, which is awesome. I&#x27;m fully converted. No more high priced razor blades.</li>
            <li> I received the 5cc model from a program run by Braun. It&#x27;s certainly a high-tech well manufactured piece of equipment and is extremely comfortable to hold, use and shave with. The cooling does make a noticeable difference and feels great on my face. The automatic cleaning is exceptional and it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;ll always be shaving with a squeaky clean razor. Not necessarily looking forward to replacing the cleaning cartridges as needed as that seems like a hassle to order and acquire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, fast growing facial hair that extends to my neck. While the performance was great on my face, it was very poor on my neck and under my chin. I&#x27;ve tried stretching my skin, pressing harder, made infinite passes, but it just couldn&#x27;t get the job done. I keep having to clean up with a cartridge razor to get an actual good shave out of the device. Sort of defeats the purpose of using an electric razor over a cartridge razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably be great for someone with light/moderate facial hair growth but probably won&#x27;t work out for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have never had an enjoyable shaving experience until I got this product  via a program run by Braun. My shaving ritual usually includes a trim of facial hair before using a foil shaver because if the hair remains long, it yanks at my skin which hurts. I didn&#x27;t have to do that with the Braun CoolTec. I immediately used the electric shaver on my skin (no wet-face or shaving cream necessary) and it cut through my facial hair like butter. I have never, ever shaven my face this quick! It was a close comfortable shave in a matter of minutes. No post-irritation later in the day either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec feature is a definitely a plus! Its almost a relaxing experience to have the cool metal brush against your cheeks. Have a trimmer attachment is another plus because it helps to clean up the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging was a breeze. I like how there&#x27;s two way to charge your Cooltec: 1) through the charging shell or 2) through the Clean&amp;Charge station. Both of which use the same electric outlet connector. I have not noticed any rusting anywhere on the product which is great. The solution that comes with this electric shaver protects and cleans it; giving the blades a longer shelf-life I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of design, it looks really nice- high quality. It has some weight to it but its not heavy. You can still easily maneuver around your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with my new Braun CoolTec. I plan on using this for as long as I can. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is need of an electric shaver who wants to have a clean-shaven look in a matter of minutes. A great choice for a gift to</li>
            <li> (You can skip to the cons below): I have been using rotary shavers (Norelco) for 25+ years.  I just bought myself a new norelco a few months ago because I thought I broke my previous one.  Disappointed to see the newer one did not cut as close, fixed my old one and used the new one as back-up.  My wife bought me this Braun as a gift, not realizing my history with lift and cut razors or that I had just spent money on a new one that I was keeping at work as a back-up.  I had a Braun foil razor like this one 20 years ago and stopped using it for the same reasons I will cite here.  I guess I was hoping technology would have improved these razors over the years and I was hoping I would be getting something better than I had, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Noticeably way LOUDER  than my Norelco three head shaver both when shaving and using the trimmer.  I close the bathroom door lest I wake up other people in the house in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer sucks. Odd curve to it and small shave head make it difficult to do a straight trim on sideburns&lt;br /&gt;-Shave is inferior/inconsistent. Not close.  Leaves &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of hair and you can feel patches in your face that you just can&#x27;t get smooth out with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-Horrible on the neck area. Can&#x27;t get under and just below the jawline on the neck.  Can always feel/see stubble there.  just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes me 3x as long to achieve an inferior shave over the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;-Cool-Tec button is in a bad spot.  I consistently accidentally hit the button while shaving, turning it on needlessly.  I gave up on turning it off and just leave it on, resulting in it going on and off throughout my shave when I hit the button.&lt;br /&gt;-The cleaner/charger port is HUGE, takes up a lot of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;-Travel charger is a &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34; that you can only use if it is laying flat, taking up more room.  Also, it is touchy, and the razor does not secure or snap in place, so any minor bump will knock it out of &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; mode.  Ask me howmany times my wife&#x27;s hair dryer or curling iron have knocked it out of charge mode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can press as hard as you want, go against the grain, etc., but I can&#x27;t get a close shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is a nice gimmick, but not necessary or worth the expense of having to buy replacement cartridges of solution.  I used it once and noticed that it vibrated itself off of the charge &amp;#34;nipples&amp;#34; so that after cleaning it sat in the dock all night not charging because it wasn&#x27;t making contact.  A brush and some rubbing alcohol and about 1 minute of your time will clean this.  The Cool-Tec feature is also a gimmick.  It does noticeably emit a cooling sensation, but as the manual will tell you, using this feature makes the battery drain quicker.  I would never buy a razor with features like this, I think it&#x27;s silly and a way for the manufacturer to jack up the price.  I mean seriously, when all said and done, this is a $20 razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a don&#x27;t buy.  Maybe these style shavers work for some guys, but for me, a high quality 3 head lift and cut would be my second choice (old school lather and blade razor my first if I had the time).  Oh and ladies: I don&#x27;t care how well you think you know your man, electric shavers are one of those things you should not give as gifts!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I was expecting but it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> In my 25 years of shaving, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of gimmicks come and go and most of them really didn&#x27;t add anything to the shave. Braun&#x27;s CoolTec is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past year I have been dry shaving with the highly rated top-of-the line Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1080x and I have never really been satisfied with it, especially for the price. The shave has never been very close, and I found the rotary heads somewhat irritating. By chance one day I came across the Braun CoolTec shaver in a local big-box store and was instantly intrigued by the active cooling technology. I really didn&#x27;t want to drop the cash on another high-end shaver after investing in the Norelco but the CoolTec was just calling to me. A few days later I found it on sale at a good price and bought it on impulse, fully expecting another gimmicky razor with a mediocre shave that would be returned shortly thereafter. Boy, was I wrong. From the first shave I found it faster, closer and definitely more comfortable than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box you&#x27;ll find the razor, cleaning station, power cord, zippered travel case, charging cradle, one Clean and Renew cartridge, cleaning brush and manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar really does cut down on irritation and just plain feels good on the skin. It&#x27;s hard to describe the sensation...it&#x27;s not ice-cold, but it&#x27;s like rubbing a cold spoon on your face. It does take a few seconds for it to reach maximum coldness so I start with my cheeks before moving to the more sensitive areas on the neck. It should be noted that using the CoolTec feature does cut down on battery life, but if you recharge after frequently it&#x27;s really not an issue. Pushing the \\&quot;snowflake\\&quot; button toggles it on and off, and I like that the razor remembers this setting when you turn it off. After shaving with the CoolTec feature, I honestly feel like I don&#x27;t even need aftershave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other button is the power button, which also glows to indicate the battery level. Green when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low. There is also an LED indicator that lights when the razor needs cleaning, and another that tells you when it&#x27;s travel locked. Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice (I got the blue version). The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand. Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that I need too many passes for a good shave, a lot fewer than the Norelco in fact. I also owned a Panasonic Arc 4 before the Norelco, and I would say the Braun CoolTec shaves nearly on par with the Panasonic and much closer than the Norelco. Having said that, keep in mind that every guy&#x27;s beard is different and your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the pop-up trimmer very much yet, but it gets the job done. Again, much better than the tiny slide-out trimmer on the Norelco. This shaver is also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower if you like. I prefer to shave dry before showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station works well and leaves the razor with a fresh, clean scent. I really like that there is a soft \\&quot;beep\\&quot; sound that lets you know the razor is properly seated in the base. I have heard others complain about the cost of refills, but each refill is only about $5-$6 and lasts a month or more. For me, around a buck a week is a small price to pay for a clean, sanitized razor every day. Not to mention it also lubricates the blades which makes them last longer. Speaking of blades, the replacement cartridge for the razor is quite a bit cheaper than the Sensotouch 3D replacement and is rated to last 18 months rather than 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may not have all the bells and whistles of the 790cc or Sensotouch 3D 1080x models, but I have finally come to the realization that I don&#x27;t need those...all I really need is a great shave and the CoolTec delivers.reen when it&#x27;s full, red when it&#x27;s getting low. There is also an LED indicator that lights when the razor needs cleaning, and another that tells you when it&#x27;s travel locked. Fit and finish are excellent, and the lacquer finish is very nice (I got the blue version). The razor is a bit on the large size, but feels very good in the hand.

            <li> I rated this 3 starts based on the product alone.&lt;br /&gt;I just switch to braun after reading in consumer report that it was the best line for shavers. Before this I had a norelco for 10 years, when it kicked the bucket, I decided to try braun. I was hesitate because I wonder how a electric razor with a straight cutting method would work around the adams apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I continue let me say that, I work in the spa industry and am fully aware of all thing steps need before shaving, I am a mix race hispanic/african american male with, medium course hair. That being said, I will say that this shaver is not for course hair. it will leave you with spots of unshaven hair and ingrowns. If you are prone to ingrowns electric probably isn&#x27;t for you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with my noreclo, but with this style shaver, I find that is is more troublesome to turn the shaver to hit all the angle of my face, the back and forth method of shaving leave many areas with hair still on the face, and the adam apple is a nightmare, either you rush and pinch yourself(yes it happends) or you take your time and slowly repeat shaving the area over and over again(time consuming). This is also where the cooling back comes to play, it helps relieve the sooth the skin for irritation.  The cooling Bar works, but a clean shave would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is a joke, a few use and its time to by another, I rinse the razor and use the system sparely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cooling bar works&lt;br /&gt;2) Great packaging&lt;br /&gt;3) Good shave for no thick or course hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1)Try to clean shave around adams apple or under chin.&lt;br /&gt;2:clean system runs our to fast for cost&lt;br /&gt;3.Not for all hair and skin types&lt;br /&gt;4.patchy shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers in the past, and honestly I&#x27;ve never been impressed with any of them.  Then along comes the Braun CoolTec  shaver with active cooling technology! Received my Cooltec through a program sponsored by Braun, and I am impressed. I&#x27;ve always had razor burn issues with electric shavers in the past, but so far this thing is as smooth as, well, ice! It feels good, shaves close, and even comes with its own cleaning/charging station! I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but unless there is some catastrophically epic failure then I&#x27;ve likely found my new favorite shaver! A little pricey on the front end, but hey, you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using my Cooltec daily for 3 weeks and I love it! Zero discomfort issues, no razor burn whatsoever, and I get a comfortable close shave every time.  A little difficult around the base of the neck, but otherwise amazing!</li>
            <li> I just received my cooltec shaver from Braun through a special program and was instantly impressed by the look and feel of the shaver. The cooltec comes with a clean and charge base and a smaller charging stand. After setting everything up it didn&#x27;t take long for it to charge at all. During my first shave I noticed it didn&#x27;t cut as closely as I would have liked on the first or second pass over my skin but after working it around for awhile I got the desired result of a smooth shave. I was impressed with the cooling feature as it actually felt really good on my skin and boy did it get cold. As promised I felt less skin irritation after using the cooltec shaver. I&#x27;m hoping that with time I&#x27;ll get a closer shave on just one pass, but the cooling feature makes this shaver worth a try for anyone that suffers from skin irritation after using electric shavers.</li>
            <li> When I received my Braun CoolTec System (provided via a program run by Braun), I was very excited. I&#x27;ve never been an electric razor guy but I was excited to see how this worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that I&#x27;ve stuck to disposable razors over the years because every experience I&#x27;ve had with electric razors have really burned. I have very sensitive skin. But this looked promising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that there were a lot of pieces. Most very big and bulky. There&#x27;s also a warning on the box about flammable liquid. There&#x27;s a little assembly required and the fear of starting a fire loomed but I pressed on. I got everything together and started the charge. It takes about 45 minutes and is surprisingly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once completed, I was ready to give it a try. The razor itself is rather large but easy to use. It comes with a carrying case and travel charger but, for me, it&#x27;s a little too big to travel with. The cooling effect is great and I&#x27;m happy to say that it did not burn my skin at all (and I&#x27;ve used it a few times). Here&#x27;s the bad part though. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a way to only run the razor over my skin once. There&#x27;s a lot of going over the same spots over and over again to get all the hair. And I had to do a lot of skin stretching as well. So it takes a significant amount of time more to shave than with a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - Although it takes me more time, I do get a very close shave with no burn and that&#x27;s important. Would I be willing to switch and give up my disposable? Not yet but I&#x27;m not giving up on the Braun CoolTec System either.</li>
            <li> Braun let me try this razor out. And here are my findings. Over the years I have gave electric razors chances. I mean the idea of being able to shave without using water and shaving cream sounds good. Especially if you are on the go or in a hurry. Being a person of very sensitive skin I never quite found one that really didn&#x27;t  irritate me and leave me looking and feeling like I had hives. Sadly, this one isn&#x27;t much better. The cooling effect can really be felt and while you are shaving it puts you under the notion that you aren&#x27;t irritated but as soon as you are done the itch and redness come back. One thing I always took as a truth was the more hot the skin was the better a shave you could get. The pores would open and thus allowing more hair to protrude giving you a better shave.  The cooling bar kinda defeats that. They&#x27;re getting better, but not quite there yet.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this item via a program with Braun.  The shave itself is excellent. My face grows very thickly, and the hair grows in more than one direction. The razor leaves my face very well shaved. The only downside is my neck. I&#x27;ve never seen an electric shave my neck clean. This razor comes close, but still leaves visible growth behind. The trimmer works very well, and is accurate... I have a goatee, and sideburns, so that matters. Now, as for the cooling action... I thought it was a gimmick, but now I know better. The concept made sense, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel this much better. I think the Braun team should drill down and share the science behind the cool... why it works... with consumers.  All I know is that it does work, and works well.</li>
            <li> I have always been a shave in the shower using a standard over the counter cheap razor kind of guy. I didn&#x27;t see the need to spend a lot of money on an electric razor. Well I was invited to participate in a program run by Braun that provided me with the CoolTec razor and I have since thrown that old plastic razor away for good! The three stage cutting system was the first noticeable improvement in the shaving experience. Shaving was super fast and smooth and left my face feeling smoother than it has ever felt. I feel that this razor cuts the hair noticeably shorter than a standard plastic razor. Just as impressive is the cooling technology that leaves your face feeling refreshed. I enjoy the cooling sensation but sometimes I feel that it be a little too cool for just getting out of a hot shower. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cooling technology isn&#x27;t like putting an ice cube on your face but it does certainly stand out. The LED display is bright and easy to see in my dimly lit bathroom. Lastly, being fully waterproof is a huge plus that I honestly didn&#x27;t expect. It makes cleaning a breeze and overall allows the whole experience to be worry free. Great product that I would recommend to any plastic razor user!  Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> I recently got to try the Braun CoolTec System via a program run by Braun.  I have sensitive skin and normally use a different Braun cordless shaver since a standard razor irritates my skin.  I was quite impressed with the CoolTec system.  The cooling bar takes a little while to reach 44 degrees, but once it does it is worth the wait.  My skin wasn‚Äôt irritated after shaving, and the cleaning system did a good job just like my other Braun system.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with skin irritation from razors the better part of my adult life.  I use moisturizing shave cream, aftershave etc.  this one device does a better job than all those things combined.  Difficult to describe, it really is different and better than any other shave you have given yourself.  I am thrilled.  Got mine from a program run by Braun, and so happy i did.  User for life now i would say.</li>
            <li> My last braun shaver lasted about 6 years before I left it charging too long, and the battery got damaged. But after 6 years, I thought it was worth it, and that is why I decided to go with Braun again. I want to give it 4 stars because it works good. My last Braun electric razor was nothing compared to this one. The cooling action does make a very noticeable difference. I have nothing to really compare it to because I have not used shaving lotion with my last Braun razor. However, it feels as if there is an ice cube in between your face and the razor, to me. It can get pretty cold. It is a little hard to get some stubborn hairs under my chin and on my neck area. For that, I use the trimmer to get them, and then run back over it with the razor. A little annoying, but worth the cooling action in my opinion. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 for smoothness on face, compared to a regular (non electric) razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend the cleaning/charging station! I will never buy another razor without one. It feels and smells like a new razor every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I had not used an electric shaver for many years, so perhaps I expected too much. I had an opportunity to try a electric shaver with the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun. It was worth trying, although I do not think I would have purchased if I had not had a chance to try it first. Essentially it is like most electric shavers -- a convenience item. To get a clean shave it is still necessary to use the regular shaving cream and a sharp manual razor. You will not get it with an electric shave. Certainly it is not worth the list price, but for less than an hundred it could be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of passes over one&#x27;s face to get an acceptable shave. It does not hurt or pull, and increasing pressure has no effect.</li>
            <li> I received a Braun CoolTec shaving system through a program sponsored by Braun. Shaving is not my favorite thing to do, my skin usually doesn‚Äôt react well to this activity. So the aluminum cooling bar peaked my curiosity. I‚Äôve been using this shaver for a little over a week now and not once have I come away with irritated or cut skin. Some places such as my chin feel very smooth shaving, however places on the sides of my neck don‚Äôt do as well in the smoothness department. The instructions state not to use any lotions before shaving but I found that a closer shave has been achieved by using a pre shave alcohol based liquid a couple of minutes before shaving. The instructions also state the shaver can be used in the shower which I tried. This shower shave was not a close as shaving before entering the shower (which I also read in the instructions). I haven‚Äôt used the supplied cleaning solution yet, I‚Äôve just been rinsing under running water. I‚Äôll give it a few more weeks and post a follow up review but , so far so good!</li>
            <li> I recently received a Braun CoolTec System electric razor via a review program run by Braun. I have been using electric razors for about 15 years now, but I have only owned Norelco razors, so I was interested to try out a new brand to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the razor for a week, so this review will be focused on my initial impressions. I&#x27;ll update my review in a few weeks after I have used it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the unboxing of the razor was a delight. It was immediately evident that the manufacturer has observed problems with other razors and has systematically attempted to solve them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost - it came with a travel charger! It&#x27;s a small thing, but these razors with base stations can be tricky. For the last few years I have used a Norelco system that has a base charging and cleaning station. When I go on longer trips, I cannot use my razor as there is no way to charge it without bringing the base station, which I would never do. This Braum system has a base station, but also a small travel charger, so I can bring it with me wherever I go. I am currently on a three week trip, so I&#x27;m excited to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the base station is smartly designed. I noticed this out of the box because the instructions said to fully charge the razor before using it. My old razor&#x27;s base station had a motor that dropped and raised the razor into the cleaning solution, which was loud and annoying. I usually charge the razor on Sunday nights so it&#x27;s ready Monday morning for the week. I have to remember to do it well before bed time, because my wife can hear it even through the closed bathroom door, and if the door is open the bright flashing light bothers her too, so it needs to be done before we go to sleep. This base station doesn&#x27;t have the loud moving parts, and it doesn&#x27;t have bright flashing lights. Also, the cleaning solution comes in a cartridge that is supposed to last quite a while - no more buying new cleaning solution every month (bye bye recurring order on Amazon)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the razor came with a nice little soft-covered hardshell case for travel. The razor also locks for travel, so it won&#x27;t turn on in my bag and run out of batteries on the plane or freak out a TSA agent. I have arrived at a destination with a dead razor more than once. Thank you Braum for considering us travelers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have about the unboxing was that the instructions weren&#x27;t super clear. They were typical old-school folded paper instructions with multiple languages and minimal graphics. A razor is pretty intuitive, but it would have been nice to see clearer instructions on connecting the cleaning solution cartridge, using the travel charger, and manual cleaning. Maybe a quick start guide with color pictures/illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to using the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually left for a long trip the day after I received it, so I have been using it from hotels on the road. I have now tried it at the sink wet with shaving cream, in the shower with shaving cream, and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry was definitely not a good shave for me, and it left my skin irritated. At the sink was fine, but still a bit irritating. In the shower the shave was great. It was smooth and painless. I felt like this razor moves over my thick stubble around my chin much easier than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is taking some getting used to having a razor that moves in two directions rather than any direction like the Norelco heads. This also makes shaving right under my nose more difficult. I think I&#x27;ll have a better sense for this in a few weeks, so I don&#x27;t want to comment more than my initial impression here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar is AWESOME. What a great idea. I have very sensitive skin, and very thick stubble. That cooling bar just feels so good. Even though it eats up the battery much faster, I can&#x27;t imagine that I will ever turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, so far I love the razor. It solves multiple problems, especially for frequent travelers and those with sensitive skin. I look forward to using it over the coming weeks and giving a more in-depth review of actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, 45 days later:&lt;br /&gt;I am still enjoying this razor after almost two months. It doesn&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as a non-electric razor, but it shaves as close as any other electric razor I have owned in the past. I will be keeping this razor and getting rid of my Norelco. As mentioned previously, it is a pleasure to travel with, especially in comparison to razors I previously used. It is also much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to use the new Braun CoolTec System provided via a program run by Braun.  Throughout my shaving life, I have gone back and forth from electric to manual razors and then to the vibrating-handle manual razors.  I am always searching for the next great thing when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and struggle to find an electric razor that both leaves me with a close shave and without irritation.  What most impressed me about the Braun CoolTec was how great the shaver felt on my skin.  When it says cool, it means cool!  Wow, I couldn&#x27;t believe how cold it got.  I was still a little skeptical, but, I can&#x27;t believe how nice my skin felt after my shave.  Like most electric shavers, it still missed a little that needed a follow-up with a manual razor to get everything, but I will definitely add this to my routine.  It left my skin feeling so much better than the manual razor alone.  The cleaning system is really nice as well and did a great job cleaning the shaver after a shave ‚Äì much better than I would have done ‚Äì and it only takes a few minutes and its done.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the cleaning system is that it requires additional purchases for more cleaning solution ‚Äì hopefully I can find a good deal on those.  Overall I am happy to add the CoolTec shaver to my shaving routine!</li>
            <li> I recently got to try out the new Braun Cooltec shaver. I am interested in trying anything on the market that is innovative and I haven‚Äôt seen before, and I was especially interested in trying this because the Cooltec technology was not something I had ever seen or heard of before in an electric shaver. Skin irritation from shaving is always something I have struggled with, since I have very coarse hair. After I shave I always feel swollen and traditional shavers make my skin break out. Straight out of the package I liked the design, it is very sleek looking and the shaver itself it easy to hold. I liked the way it fit in my hand, and it had some weight to it. Since I didn‚Äôt need to shave right away, I let it charge in its station for about an hour, then came back to it. It was all charged so I was ready to go. The cooling sensation was nice since I always feel a little ‚Äúswollen‚Äù and beat up after shaving, this helped mitigate that. The shave was not the closest shave I have ever had, but using the Braun Cooltec shaver is definitely worth it for me since it soothed that swollen, irritated feeling I usually have after shaving with traditional shavers. Cleaning the razor was also very easy -  I just placed it in the cooling station and it did all the work! Overall, if you are not super concerned about getting the closest shave, but have sensitive skin prone to irritation, the cooling sensation this provides makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try out the new Braun CoolTec Shaving System, through a program run by Braun. I was skeptical at first since I have always had problems with electric shavers. I&#x27;ve used the CoolTec several times now and the cooling system is legit. My skin doesn&#x27;t chafe right away and it&#x27;s a positive experience overall. You definitely feel the cooling the entire time you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve seen is that it sometimes takes two passes at neck hair to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great new technology -- I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received the Braun CoolTec System via a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling Bar:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Shaver includes a cooling bar on the shaver that is supposed to help reduce skin irritation while shaving.  Upon turning on the shaver and applying it to my face, I did not notice a significant amount of cooling on my face.  However, after shaving for about a minute I noticed a cooling sensation on my face where I was shaving.  At first, this sensation felt different on my face but I immediately got used to it and it felt great on my face.  You have the ability to turn off the cooling bar while shaving if you do not like the feeling of it, but I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Irritation:&lt;br /&gt;While shaving my face using the CoolTec shaver, I felt no discomfort or irritation.  When I was done shaving my face, I felt a very little irritation on the lower-right portion of my face.  However, this irritation lasted only about a minute and I did not feel any irritation after that.  My face did not get red in any areas and I have yet to feel any itchiness or irritation since.  This was great for me because I usually shy away from electric razors as they really irritate my skin during and after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I normally do not use electric razors is because they rawly get a close enough shave for my liking.  The Braun CoolTec razor definitely surprised me by providing a very consistent and close shave on my face and neck.  I felt my face in both directions after completing my shave and it was a very similar result as I get from using a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Charge Station:&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge Station that is included with the Braun CoolTec System was a very nice addition as it can get very old having to clean out all the little areas that fill with hair in an electric shaver.  I use the cleaning station after immediately after every shave and find it does an excellent job at removing hair from the razor and keeping it very clean and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am very impressed by the Braun CoolTec System and would definitely recommend this to a family member or friend looking at getting a new razor.  This shaver also drastically improved my opinion of electric shavers and how much technology has been improved to alleviate irritation while getting a nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Very little to no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;Attractive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;A little bulky&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little longer than manual razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 week now and every time I use it my skin never feel irritated or burn. I was a little confused in the beginning with the metal part in between the razor but its a plus to have it makes my skin feel nice and cool and not hot like other shavers. I love it! The clean &amp; charge station works really good and clean my shaver really good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new shaver. #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I got this ‚Å∞CoolTec shaving system from Braun to try out and it was great! It has this bar in the middle that gets cold while you shave. That cool bar soothes my skin as I shave and keeps my face from getting hot and irritated. The other great thing is that this is a system. The shaver indicates when it needs to be cleaned so you just put it into the charging base and press the button. Voila! it cleans and lubricates all by itself! The next shave starts out nice and clean just like it should. Let&#x27;s not forget about the primary purpose: shaving. I get a great shave in no time flat with the Braun ‚Å∞CoolTec. Of course this shaver has a the long hair trimmer you would expect as well as a travel case and a cleaning brush. Plus, when you do take it on the road, you can clean it under running water if the cleaning station isn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> So i got this electric shaver set from a program run by Braun and I just have to say that it is definitely way different than other electric shaver i have tried.....in a good way.  As soon as the cool bar kicks in you feel like your shaving with an ice cube, but in a good, smooth, refreshing way.  Its kind of has that same effect as splashing cold water on your face to wake your self up.  This is why I definitely think it is a razor for the guy who has to shave every morning before he starts his day.  It gives you that nice kick that you need to wake you up.  Although the cooling bar felt awesome and it is probably one of the closest shaves ive had with an electric razor, it did leave me with some irritation a few hours later.  It wasn&#x27;t much irritation, but it still left me feeling a tiny uncomfortable, only for a short period of time.  I definitely recommend this shaver to the everyday man who needs that wake up call in the morning.</li>
            <li> I just got this really cool new Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver System through a Braun program to try out and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started.  The system comes with a shaver with trimming capabilities and a charging/washing/lubrication station which is cool because not only does it charge but it washes the shaver with alcohol to maintain a high level of hygiene and then lubricates to keep the shaver at peak performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ¬∞CoolTec function is great.  All guys deal with some level of irritation after shaving and this adaptation to the shaver does a good job combatting that issue.  It cools the blade system to allow for a cool refreshing shave and little to no irritation afterward - definitely a sweet addition to regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue overall with this shaver is its performance regarding the actual shave.  It unfortunately does not provide the closest shave and in fact is a little disappointing.  My facial hair is by no means a tough shave for my old shaver that I got for less than $40 but my old shaver left me with a much smoother finish than this Braun ¬∞CoolTec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your overall hygiene, ease of use and irritation are larger concerns to you than a close shave, this would definitely be the shaver for you.</li>
            <li> I had been on a long hiatus from my last electric shaver for a handful of years and have been using a Gillette Fusion handle with replaceable blades. These razors have worked for me well over the last few years, but the costs of the blades has continued to go up along with shaving cream, they continually clog, and get dull to fast. So, I decided to look into a more long term solution and when the opportunity came up to try the Braun CoolTec System through a program rub by Braun, I took a chance and said goodbye to my manual shaver.  I had been trying to use the last dull blade as long as I could and literally it took twice as long to shave my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started about a month ago, I was in the thick of Movember and keeping my beard under control while unleashing my Mo&#x27; was priority number one. It took about a week to two weeks before I was comfortable enough/skilled enough to trim around the facial hair I wanted without having to supplement with my old razor. You&#x27;ll have to be willing to go over those areas around the edges of your sideburns and facial hair (ie moustaches, goatees) several times and when you are first starting you may find a few straggling hairs. You may think that this takes longer, but you are saving time cleaning your blade and applying shaving cream/aftershave. The first time, I used it I did not know what to think about the cooling bar and I could not feel it right away, but once it kicked in it really felt nice and cool. I&#x27;m used to that feeling of scraping my face while shaving, but I hardly notice anything with this shaver. While using the system, I have not experienced any clogging while getting the same close shave I did from my previous razor. It may take a few more passes on my face, but I never have to stop and clean it off. When I am done, I like the option of either manually cleaning the shaver with tap water or using the Clean&amp;Charge station. I was caught off guard with how much little bits of facial hair is left behindin the hub and all I had to do was press a button. That is super convenient, but there is still a little clean up if you want to remove that hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice and you need to counter space to set up the Clean&amp;Charge station, but my face is just as smooth as when I used my Gillette razor and I have not had any cuts or irritation since I started using it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend that others use this system with the knowledge that it is a transition if you have not used an electric shaver before. But the Braun CoolTec System is definitely Cooler than expected and I am not just talking about the cooling bar.</li>
            <li> I got the cooltec shaver system a few weeks ago for free through the braun program and have been using it exclusively since. Ill preface my review with a few things 1) I normally shave with a traditional razor 2) I have owned and used 2 electric razors in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the cooltec is a solid shaver it works the best of any electric ive used in the past and the cooling really helps with the irritation ive gotten in the past. I still need to use a traditional razor to clean up but it does do nicely for everyday maintenance. For an electric I would definitely suggest this product and I will continue to use the cooltec system.</li>
            <li> Cooltec is something that should&#x27;ve been invested years ago. Who knows why it took so long to think of something so obviously amazing! I love the cooling sensation as you&#x27;re shaving after a shower. It really does make a huge difference in skin irritation and razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an electric razor itself, the Braun Cooltec is a solid razor. It is actually my first electric razor, but after a lot online research and speaking to friends, I figured that it would be a perfect fit. The only complaint I&#x27;ve heard for this razor is that it might be weaker than a few of the others on the market, but because my facial hair doesn&#x27;t set in as thick, I haven&#x27;t run into any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor through a program run by Braun and have never been more satisfied with a personal grooming device!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun and let me tell you after using it for a month now I can say that it is one cool cat! The Braun ¬∞CoolTec technology make razor burn a thing of the past. I used to get nice red marks on my neck especially with my old electric shaver, but that is non existent thanks to Braun ¬∞CoolTec! Having the nice cool metal on your skin really soothes the skin and makes irritation a thing of the past, I can&#x27;t believe no one has thought of this concept before, thank you Braun for stepping it up a notch when it comes to electric shaving. You are a true pioneer!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for years and I have sensitive skin, what can I say, I am a sensitive guy.  I really like this shaver and it feels really good when the coolness kicks in.  It has a side shaver to control those sideburns, and wherever else you may feel the need to trim.  The self-cleaning solution is really cool and it leaves the razor smelling clean.  If you have used an electric shaver in the past, you know it can sometimes have a funky smell you have to clean with vinegar, not this one.  Clean at the press of a button.  It&#x27;s a winner and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see a razor that did not get really hot when you are using it. The cool tech make the shave have less irritation and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn like I do with my old one. Self cleaning is a breeze and it charges in the same station. This is the first razor I have found that cuts through a thick beard like I have. Totally worth the money. I received mine through a program from Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor now for about 4 months. Frankly it has taken awhile to get use to it. I have had an older model of the series 7-790 and it worked well but left my face feeling a bit raw. So the idea of the cool strip was interesting. I would say that part works fine and I really like that. You still need to splash your face with cold water after you shave but during the shave it is a nice cool feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The part I have had to get use to is the one piece non adjusting shaving head. On the 790 the head moves to the contour of your face and, for me, the shave went faster and was closer. This one seems to be more awkward and less comfortable and seems to take longer. Also the neck shaving just isn&#x27;t as close to me.&lt;br /&gt;The travel charging feature requires a cradle while the 790 you just plug in the charging cord. Not a big deal but an extra piece to take along.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I still give it a 4 because the shave is still one of the best and the cool shave feature works and  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;The best of all worlds would be the cool shave feature on the 790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/29/2014&lt;br /&gt;Short update. Still like the razor and the shave. Points I made above are still the same. Good shave, takes a while, not the best on the neck, like the cool shave bar in the razor probably the best feature of the razor. You really think about the cool sensation each time you shave. The cradle that is needed for the recharge when you are travelling is not much of a problem. Just an extra piece to keep from losing.</li>
            <li> left several uncut hair and perform just a well as a $20 electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;The best part was the automatic cleaning mode did a outstanding job cleaning the blade... I was really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive razor for its performance</li>
            <li> Ever since I have been using Braun CoolTec i have been able to shave fast and properly with the hassle of going over and over my face. I can enjoy a fast, smooth close shave in between my main shaves and it doesn&#x27;t take 15 minutes. Add the cool bar while you have to ease the redness in your face while you shave and you can definitely have a clean shave to remember. The cleaning portion is easy. The equipment added to clean the shaver is easy fast to set up. Also it will charge it while it&#x27;s being cleaned. The greatest part of all is that this product was a free test that I received from Braun.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different shavers and electric and other wise but hadn&#x27;t found one that wouldn&#x27;t cause me problems after using it, until I got my Braun CoolTec Shaving System free to try from Braun. It wasn&#x27;t hard to set up and only took an hour to charge. After using my shaver I made sure to check every inch of my skin to see if there was any red blotching, there was none. My skin didn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to put lotion on and not have pain after! I really love my CoolTec Shaving System!</li>
            <li> Looking for a cool, irritation free, quality electric shave?&lt;br /&gt;Look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years i have used razors and shaving gels, every once in a while getting a cut, and then having to go out and get more razors. Seemed like a never ending cycle. Always battling razor burn and the cost of expensive replacements. There had to be a simpler way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a nice Norelco but still fought with the irritation of a daily shave. Still was thinking there has to be an easier way.&lt;br /&gt;Then i found this miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Braun CoolTec is an amazing piece of technology and innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great daily shaver, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is baby smooth, As soon as you turn on the cooling functionality your face feels so refreshed that i have stopped using aftershave all together.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself, you will be as convinced as i am.</li>
            <li> This is a cool idea for an electric shaver.  With that said this razor only gets the cooling liquid on maybe a third of my face which is then pointless for the rest of my face, there needs to be a better way for it to meter the amount applied to the face so that you can get full coverage.  I have issues with this system actually trimming all of my facial hair which is typically just stubble (I do not have a beard or goatee) my neck and chin are the most difficult areas to shave (I still have to go back when done and use a disposable razor to shave the strays left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to start the cooling liquid application to the razor before I get in the shower as it takes a few minutes and it runs multiple cycles  which is also a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug for the base charger for the razor does not actually firmly fit, it is extremely loose and falls out upon touching the cord or base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Braun CoolTec system through a promotion from Braun and I am great-full for the opportunity to try and use this however I am disappointed in what I received.  I would defiantly not pay for this system. So although I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this for others of you it might be something that is right up your alley, I am just not a fan of electric razors and this did not sway me to start liking them.</li>
            <li> I used the razor four times before I came back to write a review because I wanted to give it a fair go. I‚Äôve always been a cartridge razor user because I‚Äôve never had a clean shave using anything else due to thick facial hair. I also have sensitive skin, so I was excited for the CoolTec experience. I‚Äôll start with that; the CoolTec strip is as advertised. It made a very noticeable difference during my shave and I had no skin irritation when I was done. I do have to wonder though if part of the reason for the lack of irritation was the lack of a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my cheeks, the razor worked well, but as soon as I moved below my jaw-line, the razor struggled to get close. I know that I‚Äôm not going to get anywhere near a cartridge razor shave with an electric, but this wasn‚Äôt close to acceptable. Even against the grain, the shave was very uneven and patchy, to the point where I had to shave with my old razor when finished to even things out. The attached trimmer tool was also not strong enough to make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning and charging station is very nice. It‚Äôs not so big that it takes over my sink space, but the foil and blades come out like new each time. When it‚Äôs not due for a cleaning, the charging station is even smaller and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the only thing I wasn‚Äôt happy with was the shave, which doesn‚Äôt bode well for a razor. For someone with thinner hair, this might work well for you.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec razor through a promotion run by Braun.  I&#x27;ve been a Series 7 user for a few years now (I use a cartridge razor about 70% of the time - shaving daily), and have always been pleased with that product.  The CoolTec is different in a few ways.  Obviously, the latest innovation is the cool bar on the razor head.  I actually really enjoy the bar, as it makes my face feel wet, like with a cartridge razor, as I shave.  On my face, the razor works great and provides a shave comparable to the Series 7 and a cartridge.  I will say I use a cartridge most of the time, because I have a heavy beard, and a cartridge has always been far superior in providing a close shave on my neck without causing irritation.  The Series 7 is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used on my neck, but still falls short of matching a cartridge.  The CoolTec razor lags behind the Series 7 in this key area, as it takes a number of passes from different angles to get a close shave on my neck.  Overall, I think the CoolTec system would be great for someone without a very heavy beard like me, as the cool bar technology provides a very positive improvement to the typical electric shave.  The charging station is very nice looking, and much better looking than my Series 7 unit.  The travel case for the razor is also a big upgrade over the Series 7.  The only other problem with this razor is the plug on the back of the cleaning station.  For some reason, I&#x27;m not sure if my unit is typical, the plug just does not fit very snugly into the base.  I have had the plug fall out a couple of times with little to no movement.  That said, I have gotten the plug to stay for the most part, and that quirk has not damaged my positive experience with this razor!</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec System through a program run by Braun and I love it.  I have had an old shaver for quite sometime and I definitely did not know what I was missing.  I am certainly happy that I have made the switch to the CoolTec System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system not only does the job from a clean shave standpoint, but it also is a very unique experience.  The CoolTec experience is like nothing that I have experienced before from a shaving system. The &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; has prevented any irritation and the cleaning process is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I not only feel good after a shave, but I get a good shave and actually use a perfectly cleaned shaving system.  This has been a very good experience and I am excited to be able to use the system going forward.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible experiences with electric razors in the past, so if it hadn&#x27;t been for a promotional program from Braun I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this razor.  The primary issue I&#x27;ve had with electric razors in the past was extreme irritation.  From my first use, I noticed that the irritation was minimal and it has only improved.  The cooling bar is a nice touch, and does seem to improve the overall experience.  As long as I shave everyday, this razor seems to provide a pretty close shave in minimal time.  However, when I let my hair grow for 2 days or more the growth seems to be more than this razor can handle in a reasonable amount of time...and I don&#x27;t grow facial hair exceptionally fast.  I went 3 days without shaving, and it took me about 15 minutes to complete my shave...and after all this, there were several patches that the razor couldn&#x27;t pick up for some reason.  I tried every direction with different pressures to no avail.  Final negative is that my razor&#x27;s cleaning indicator comes on after every use.  This may be normal, but I see cleaning cartridge refills substantially adding to the cost over time.  I am happy enough with the overall experience that I cancelled my weekly delivery service for disposable razors, but if I had paid ~$200 for this system I would be a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System through a program with Braun after having used the Panasonic ES-LA93 for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that for the previous decade, I had been a loyal Braun user ‚Äì first the predecessor to their 500 series and then the 790 series until just this year.  While those Braun shavers worked well, they had weak points that kept failing ‚Äì the cleaning system broke several times, the foils would tear easily (I have thick beard hair), and then the plastic would deteriorate around the head of the shaver, eventually causing the entire shaver to fail.  So I switched to Panasonic ‚Äì and was willing to give this new Braun CoolTec a try to see if they‚Äôd come up with something more durable and consistent.&lt;br /&gt;Initial impressions:  the Cooltec shaver  is beefy but quite ergonomic and easily to hold while shaving.  Its head does not swivel (which is a downside as discussed later), but it is quite easily to manipulate up and down the face and into those nooks and crannies.  The ‚Äúcooling‚Äù bar is nice, and when you first turn it on and it starts to get frigid, it does make your face feel quite ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it shave?: I tried the Cooltec as my daily shaver for three weeks.  It does not pull or cause irritation, and it is quite nice to have that cooling bar go over the freshly shaved areas.  That said, I have to go over those areas several times to catch all the escapee beard hairs and find myself putting a lot of pressure on the shaver ‚Äì so I am not sure if the foil will last as long as it otherwise would.  It does the job, though certainly not as close and clean of a shave as the old Braun 790 or the new Panasonic.  The reason:  the head does not swivel so it misses those hairs that point in weird directions and you have to change the plane of your shaving frequently in order to get those stubborn whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is nicer than the run-of-the-mill Braun, quieter, and faster.  The shaver is also washable (though not a wet shaver), so you can get it clean pretty easily and only use the cleaning system once in a while (those solution packages are expensive!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression:  The shaver is good ‚Äì certainly worth the lower price that Braun charges, and I‚Äôd say a better value than their top of the line 700 series.  And it appears, at least initially, the shaver is better put together and more durable (we‚Äôll see how long the ‚Äúcooling‚Äù bar lasts).  But, it is a shaver that is mid-range when it comes to a close, clean shave.  I‚Äôve returned to my Panasonic LA93 as its much smoother and is a wet shaver for those long mornings when I am too lazy or just want to multitask in the shower.  But I will use this Cooltec as my travel shaver as its much more compact, certainly good enough as a daily shaver, and ‚Äì since I fall for almost every gimmick ‚Äì has a cool bar that makes my face feel nice in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update if any problems arise‚Ä¶.</li>
            <li> After using various razors(all the fancy ones) for a clean and closer shave, I was looking for something new with less irritation, bumps, etc. I was excited when I read about the features of the CoolTec by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cooling feature works. I was surprised at how cool the CoolTec got and it did provide a good deal of comfort while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The Charging/Cleaning station is nice and stylish. It&#x27;s not too bulky and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case and charger are also a nice touch. It uses the same charger as the base unit so no extra wires/cords to keep up with.&lt;br /&gt;They are also sturdy and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning pack solutions last a pretty reasonable time and refills are not to pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not So Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec didn&#x27;t cut as good as I wanted it to. I went in all directions. I tried both wet and dry shaving and I was a bit disappointed. Granted, I have thick facial hair, and it cut some, but nowhere near the close shave that I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you buy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been using electric shavers over the years and they have worked well on your face, then I would recommend the CoolTec by Bruan. The CoolTec shaver has a nice quality build, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and the travel accessories are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have thick or coarse facial hair, then you may want to research some other electric shavers as this one didn&#x27;t do well on my face. I had high hopes and even tried with less hair on my face a week later. It did cut a bit, but required too much work for those little results, which wasn&#x27;t the clean shave I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this electric razor via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> First of all I received this shaver via a program run by Braun. The shaver came with the clean&amp;charge station. I was very excited to try out this new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and this shaver has no problem cutting through them. The CoolTech bar in the middle definitely is awesome. It is cold to the touch and definitely reduce irritation. It is also refreshing (especially first thing in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTech bar makes the blades further apart. This make it a little harder to maneuver around. I do have run the shaver through the same area a few more times to get a clean shave. At any rate, the shave is still very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun shaver before and the clean&amp;charge station is just awesome. This time, the charge actually turns off when the battery is full. The cleaning action leaves the blades clean and provide a better shave. It also keep the blade sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shaver is cool. I mean literally. I would definitely recommend to people that has sensitive skins and want to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have been able to try the Braun CoolTec Shaving System provided via a program run by Braun. I really like the cooling feature it definitely helps keep my face from getting irritated. The cleaning system is a big plus also. These 2 items are great but what anyone really wants to know is do you get a close shave? NO, I do not get a close shave when I use this product. My Gillette Fusion is gets me a much closer shave and my other electric shaver is still closer then the CoolTec. The CoolTec has a strait cut feature and not a circular rotation shave like my other shaver and I believe that this is the reason that I do not get a close shave. This system is just ok. Not something I would have spent money on.</li>
            <li> When I heard about the CoolTec CT5cc electric razor I was initially very skeptical of the benefits of a ‚Äúcooling‚Äù razor. I had, based on conventional wisdom, always believed that a warm razor gives a closer shave.  For that reason, I usually use a disposable razor and shaving cream.  I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with electric razors, but when I‚Äôve used them I did experience a pretty substantial amount of irritation especially on my neck.  So taking part in this program, in which I was provided this razor by Braun, was a departure from the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the CoolTec razor, the cooling bar took a few moments to cool down.  But after that initial waiting period, the razor performed how I expected it to.  I had to go over my face a few times in order to remove all of the hair. It was annoying to see hair still on my face where I had just shaved.  But overall the product worked the way I expected it to and the cooling bar really helped reduce irritation that I had previously experienced with electric razors.  I wasn‚Äôt too pleased by how ineffective the razor was at removing hair, but the cooling bar made up for my displeasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire package was very cool, though. The travel case was awesome and the cleaning/charging station really makes the product stand out in comparison to other razors I‚Äôve used.  The cleaning station keeps the blade cleaner than other cleaning products that I‚Äôve used with other razors.  Overall, however, the razor didn‚Äôt perform above my expectations, so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a part-time early adopter.  Sometimes I&#x27;m cutting edge (pun intended), other times I&#x27;m a bit behind the curve.  I had a chance to try out this electric razor as part of a Braun program and was fairly pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been around the block with razors, with everything from disposable to battery-powered expensive razors, to electric razors.  With the CoolTec razor, I certainly FEEL like this thing is from the future...maybe from the set of Demolition Man, right next to the 3 shells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a razor, it does its job.  Keeping in mind you&#x27;ll NEVER get as close a shave as with a regular razor, it does a fairly good job for an electric.  It&#x27;s a little tough to get all the last stubble on the neck, but no better/worse than other models for that.  The rest of your face will be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar is nice.  I say &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve never had an issue with razor irritation, so I can&#x27;t say if it helps. It is refreshing to have that coolness while you&#x27;re shaving, and there&#x27;s a bonus on/off switch to turn off the cooling if you&#x27;re trying to save battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base, for me, is probably the coolest thing about the system.  When you&#x27;re done shaving, put the razor in there and hit a button.  It&#x27;ll whirr and buzz a bit for about 5 minutes, but when you use the razor the next morning, it feels as new as the first time you fired it up.  You can pop the top off the razor and see for yourself that the cleaning works.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about this model, the base might tip you over- it&#x27;s definitely a &amp;#34;plus.&amp;#34;  Of course, the necessary &amp;#34;minus&amp;#34; is that you&#x27;ll have to buy refills of the cleaning compartments, which adds up over the life of the product.  You could skip the fluid, clean it yourself, and save some money, but then you won&#x27;t feel like much of an early adopter, now will you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, no complaints about this razor.  It works, feels nice, and the base keeps the razor clean and lubricated for you every morning.  I&#x27;ve only had this about a month, but this thing feels sturdy enough to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun CoolTec Mens Shaving System. I got a close shave with out razor burn which often happpens to my extremely sensitive skin. Five stars is a must for the close shave, easy and quick recharge, simple instructions and wonderful cistomer service</li>
            <li> First thing&#x27;s first.  I received this shaver for free to write my review of the product.  There are several things I like about the shaver and the items it is packaged with: holder/charger/cleaner unit, small brush, cleaning solution, cradle, travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel case is handy and well made.  The small brush is useful to get the small bits of hair out of the shaver mechanism.  Not sure that the cradle will be used much, just put the shaver in the charger/cleaner or the travel case and be done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit charges quickly.  The hair trimmer on the back side of the shaver is a nice touch.  It is made of a non-slick material so you can easily push the trimmer up and lock in place.  When the cooltec is activated by the &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; button, it does feel really nice.  The &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; can be turned on or off to your preference.  The shave resulted in a little irritation on the side of the neck but was not too bad.  The shaver can be charged in the same unit that cleans it.  The cleaning solution is touted to be more hygenic than just rinsing with water.  Don&#x27;t know but being able to clean while charging is nice.  When plugging the cord to the charger/cleaner unit, the plug did not seem to be very securely attached but it charged just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the foils, the top of the shaver comes right off to allow you to clean the hair out of the mechanism easily.  The shaver has some heft to it and seems to be solidly made.  All in all a good shaver.  However, I just can&#x27;t get the same shave that I can with a regular razor.  When I shave with an electric, there are always spots of small stubble left.  Probably not the fault of this shaver, since this happens with any electric razor I use.  I still prefer a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I was selected by Braun to try this product. Being a razor man, I was very skeptical about using this. I have to say my life is easier and I am saving minutes in the morning by switching over to the Cooltec. The cooling sensation this gives you is soothing compared other shavers I have used and returned. I am quite pleased with this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec as part of a promotional program run by Braun and was very excited.  I get razor bumps from electric razors, so I don&#x27;t normally use them, however the cooling technology prevented that from happening.  I also really liked the self cleaning feature.  However great the features are, it is first and foremost supposed to be a razor.  It is so bulky that it doesn&#x27;t shave the contours of your face and neck, and even where it does shave, it doesn&#x27;t get very close.  I am very glad I didn&#x27;t buy one and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and for an electric razor, I am very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers in the past, and haven&#x27;t been a big fan of them - just never really got close enough for my liking or really irritated my skin.  This razor was very helpful with the latter and only a bit better with the former.  I typically have to shave every other day and currently use a Gillete Pro-Fusion razor while taking a shower (I&#x27;ve noticed this is the best place for me to not get my skin as irritated.  Below are some of the Pros and Cons of the Braun CoolTec Razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to setup - pretty much out of the box ready to use (with a small charge of course)&lt;br /&gt;2. The Cooling Bar is fantastic!! I am a very warm blooded person and thoroughly enjoy the cooling feature of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. Close shave - by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever received from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use in the shower - as I typically shave in the shower, it was great to have a new razor that also works in the shower - plus this makes cleanup a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;5. Great travel case included - I travel for business frequently and having this case made it easy to travel with - plus I didn&#x27;t have to bring along any shave cream - less hassle with the FAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Only one - not as of a shave as a blade - while it is a close shave, it&#x27;s not as close as my manual razor.  As I mentioned earlier, I typically shave every other day, but with this razor I noticed that I was needing to shave every day - which wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as the cooling bar kept my skin from getting irritated (which wouldn&#x27;t happen if I shaved every day with a manual razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a close electric shave while keeping your skin free of bumps from irritation of other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I received the CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System through a Braun run program.  Having used their electric shavors before, regularly in the past, I was excited to try it out.  This one is very good and gives you a nice clean shave without too much hassle.  It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  I have thick hair so it&#x27;s hard to get everything with just an electric razor (I usually go over it with a manual one after), but it does just as good as any other I have tried out.  The cool sensation it provides was my favorite part, especially when waking up and getting ready to go in the morning.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge so it&#x27;s great for even weekend trips away from home.  The clean and renew system is great for keeping it fresh and preventing germs and infections.  I recommend it, especially for the price it&#x27;s offered at.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free. It is a nice razor but like most electric razors I have used its difficult to get my neck, I think it&#x27;s due to the hairs growing in different directions. I like using it and will continue to do so. It takes a little longer than a disposable razor but the shave is closer.</li>
            <li> The whole experience and the product, were awesome.</li>
            <li> As someone with a tendency to get bad irritation this was a last hope type purchase. The device causes absolutely no rashes or burns and works incredibly well. The shave is not as close as a straight razor but for someone trying to avoid skin issues this is fine trade. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> After having the Braun CoolTec System for over a week I&#x27;m more impressed with it&#x27;s capabilities. This shaver was was provided via a program run by Braun. The cool bar is a neat feature and I do believe it helps to minimize irritation but it&#x27;s not full proof. The Shaver gets most hairs on the face but the longer you let it grow the more passes you will need. It&#x27;s really good at everyday shaves. I have been only using the cradle station to charge as I don&#x27;t see the need to clean/sanitize each time. The first time I uses the Clean and Charge station, the Braun did come out nice and clean but again I don&#x27;t see a need to use it every shave. I would definitely recommend the CoolTec system if you looking for a nice hand help wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had several different shavers over the years and none seemed to do great. They were just good enough. We the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is the shaver I have been looking for. It delivers a great shave that is, in my opinion, as close as you can get without a straight razor. I have sensitive skin and I always seemed to turn red with irritation in the past. With this shaver I haven&#x27;t experienced it once thanks to the cooling sensation. It is awesome that this cleans itself with the Clean &amp; Charge station. Braun always seems to have some of the best products on the market and they have hit a home run with this one. I have yet to find something about this shaver I don&#x27;t like and find it hard to believe I will. I told my brother about it since we both have the sensitive skin issue and I am waiting to hear how he likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who keeps a beard not because I like it but because my skin gets red and irritated every time I shave with a safety razor. I&#x27;ve tried at least three other electric razors before and they end up so patchy that I end up shaving with a safety razor afterwards anyways. I was provided this razor by a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup was really straightforward, connected the base station to the power cable, popped in the cartridge and charged the razor. The initial shave, after trimming my beard down took a really long time compared to a safety razor, but subsequent shaves were really good and didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the normal longer shaving time the only real issue I&#x27;ve come across is the sound when the charger is sitting idle. It makes a strange high pitched squeal when the razor is left in it, so we&#x27;ve taken to either unplugging it or leaving the razor off the dock. Otherwise, I would completely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Close shave&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans itself!&lt;br /&gt;- Less irritating than any other shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes up a lot of space on the bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;- Weird buzzing sound when left docked&lt;br /&gt;- Not as quick as a safety razor</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m a safety razor user, but when I received my Braun ¬∞CoolTec Solo via a program run by Braun, I immediately cracked it open to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction was how substantial the shaver was. It truly feels like a quality shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began shaving, I had 3 days growth. Normally I shave every other day, so this was a true test. I turned on the cooling action, and was very pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but it felt great. It made the shave very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave on the other hand we a little more difficult going. It took a long time to get my hair to catch in the foil. It took me a bit longer to get a complete shave than usual. But when I was finished, I did have a very close shave with no irritation. If it weren&#x27;t for the cooling action, the shave would not have been pleasurable due to the duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also thoroughly enjoyed how it&#x27;s charged. You simply rest it in your cradle rather than trying to plug a cable into a socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, A+ on the cooling action, but just a B on the shave.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I hate shaving!  I usually put it off for a few days and have a decent amount of stubble.  My old electric razor just yanked out the hair so I‚Äôd often just go with the old fashioned straight razor.  When I got my new Braun ¬∞CoolTec System through a program they offer, I had to put it to the test.  After 3 days of not shaving I powered up my new razor and it worked like a champ!  Smooth shave and the cooling system kept the razor burn at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only challenge was figuring everything out when I opened the box.  The instructions are only mildly helpful.  Since there are no words, you kind of just have to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatically cleaning station is great.  Charges and cleans at the touch of a button.  I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about having to replace the cleaning solution every month.  They don&#x27;t seem to cost a lot, but that is an added expense that I&#x27;d prefer not to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that there is a travel carrier and charger.  I travel from time to time for work and pleasure.  It‚Äôs nice to know my razor can go with me.  I don‚Äôt know how long the charge itself lasts, but I‚Äôm set either way.  Oh and the travel lock is great!  No more opening the suitcase only to find out the razor switched on accidentally ‚Äì yes that really does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someday I might get in the habit of shaving every day, but until then, Braun has got my back!</li>
            <li> Received this system free from a Braun program that they were running. This is a good product and cooling feature is really neat and different. The cooling bar does help sooth the skin and feels good while shaving. The only thing I see as a problem is the cleaning station solution needs to be changed regularly which brings added cost of maintaining the blades. However, use of the cleaning station is optional but can shorten the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> I shave on average about once a week, apparently my facial hair doesn&#x27;t want to keep up with the once a week haircuts that I need. I was provided  Braun‚Äôs NEW ¬∞CoolTec electric shaver via a program run by Braun for review. I have been using it a couple times a week since I received it and although I love the CoolTech system the shaving falls a little short. My hair was a little long on my face the first time I used it and when I started it instantly starting pulling my hair out. My last shaver could handle hair a little longer, it had three rotating blades and the Braun has a foil. After shorting my hair with my trimmer I went back to using the shaver. Immediately loved the cooling sensation on my face and eventually when I was finished it did feel much better than a normal shave. My face is super sensitive normally to shaving but this left me with little to no discomfort, the problem was how long it took me to shave. After going over the same areas over and over again I was able to finish about 20 minutes after starting. My old shave took me on average about 10 minutes to shave, for how lazy I am this took too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap, love the Cooltec system and I believe this is an excellent idea for a shaver, I will continue using it and hopefully with more use I will get faster with it and it will become my go to shaver. I do suggest you purchase one, but give yourself some time to shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec system as a part of a program from Braun.  This is the only electric razor that I have been able to use.  I have very sensitive skin and electric razor tear up my face.  The cooling bar has not only made it possible to use an electric razor but has made it a pleasant experience.  I really enjoy using the Braun CoolTec.  The cleaning system is a great feature and it is super simple to use.  I would recommend this razor to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the electric razor, you‚Äôve been searching for! I recently received the new Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System thanks to a program run by Braun and it has been a mind-blowing shaving experience. The new razor with its adaptable 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade provides a nice clean shave that is close and comfortable. I have very sensitive skin and the CoolTec razor has an added bonus of a cooling bar built into the razor. It feels like running an ice cube over your face which adds to the comfort and soothing effects of shaving with this razor. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with skin irritation since using this phenomenal razor. The Braun CoolTec Shaving System also comes with a clean &amp; charge station that is unparalleled! I‚Äôve been using the clean &amp; charge station and my razor came out looking clean and smelling wonderful, way better than what I‚Äôve been accustomed too. The station fits nicely on my bathroom counter. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone with or without sensitive skin and to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Braun ¬∞CoolTec System is fantastic, I got to try this razor thanks to Braun. I am in the military and I have to shave everyday and that can get a little rough on the skin and does cause it to get irritated. Since I have been using the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System my skin is less irritated and my face feels smoother I like the cooling system it has 3-stage cutting system and SensoBlade, cleaning and charge station. at this point everything is very good I don&#x27;t have any complaints but my old razor was thrown out.</li>
            <li> As a fan of electric razors (the convenience of being able to quickly shave for those mornings when you just don&#x27;t have time to shave with a regular razor), I have found that many times I&#x27;m forced to shave my neck area first, then my face due to the skin irritation I received from an electric razor that quickly warms up after only 20 seconds of use.  That was until I tried the Braun CoolTec System.  This new razor allows me to freely shave my face and neck without having to worry about the red streaks of skin irritation from a warm razor surface.  The CoolTec electric razor has a cooling area between the blades that is very cool to the touch and gives a soothing sense as the razor glides over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that the Braun CoolTec doesn&#x27;t leave the microscopic hairs all over the sink after a shave either.  The self cleaning dock does the work that I often times found messy to do myself and ensures that I&#x27;m getting the closest shave possible with a cleaned razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun heard the cries of my irritated skin and provided me with the CoolTec to try for myself through their program to help guys just like me.  Because of the new CoolTec razor, I can leave for work in the morning knowing that I don&#x27;t have those red streaks to hide on my neck nor do I have to explain how they got there.</li>
            <li> I normally use just regular disposable shavers, and although im not a huge fan of electric shavers, I was excited to try the new Braun CoolTec Shaver. I was lucky enough to receive one via a program run by Braun. Watching the adds for it, and reading what it can do, it sounds like a pretty awesome product. But unfortunately I found in practice its pretty lack luster. Its simple enough to set up/clean/use and what not. But for actual shaving. It just doesnt work particularly well. Letting your beard grow for anymore then 3-4 days and your pushing it as it just has trouble handling it. As a matter of fact I actually thought that perhaps I was giving a broken one with a dull blade or something at first as thats how spotty my shave was. But reading the reviews it seems others have had the same problems. So if your looking for a close shave this isnt it. It also has trouble getting getting more awkward areas and angles like your chin giving you a spotty shave. For the cooling portion of it. It does work, it does feel cool, and is pleasant(although I was also expecting more out of this as well). But considering again how spotty the shave is and how often you have to go over the same area I think this kinda makes this point not as great as if the actual shaver it self worked. There is a side burn trimmer which is convenient. Would I recommend it to a friend? I suppose yea if after hearing the negatives about it they still wanted to check it out. But for full price? I find it hard to justify buying this personally. Also one of the main perks I think of a electric shaver would be the whole saving money in the long run. And quick and easy use. But this is actually just the same if not more time consuming since the shave is not close. I suppose the pluses of this would be if you want a five o clock shadow that sort of atheistic good look to your jaw.. albeit spotty this will give it to you since you wont get a clean shave. And of course you will feel a bit of a cooling sensation which is nice... Anyway cool idea on paper, but in the end unfortunately does not work as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I received this razor via a program run by Braun. I have not used an electric razor in many years, both because I was not impressed with the last model I used and as one who shaves their head I was under the impression that they simply weren&#x27;t a viable option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the Braun Cooltec an honest chance, first using it to do some touch-up work after shaving with my regular razor, then progressed to using it to touch up my face and neck after work before heading to events/functions, finally working up feeling like I could trust it to shave my face and neck completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself very picky about my shave, especially on my head - I take a great deal of time to make sure that it perfectly smooth. Though initially skeptical, I found that the Braun CoolTec able to deliver results that I consider satisfactory. the heads are very good at following all the countours of my neck, face, and head. As an added bonus, I enjoyed the feeling of the cooling bar on my skin. It made the time spent shaving as enjoyable as I think it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the Braun CoolTec is with the integrated trimmer. There are actually two things I did not like. First, the trimmer is not very strong so it takes a very long time to trim coarse facial hair. Second, either the trimmer or that area of the razor throws off a lot of heat - so while you are sitting there, annoyed with the amount of time it&#x27;s taking to trim your &#x27;stache, you&#x27;re also dealing with the added frustration of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, despite from the trimmer being inadequate for my needs, the CoolTec seems to be a great razor that delivers a comfortable and close shave even to the standards of someone as picky as myself. Changed my opinion on electric razors completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth checking this out if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and all have left my face burning so when I was able to try this one through a program run by Braun I was skeptical. I like the cool feeling of the bar on my face and had no burning after. I forgot of the cooltec when trying it out ant thought cold water was on by face. The razor worked good in the shower and after use I just put it in the charger and it cleans itself. the only thing that I do not like about the razor is if I do not shave with it for two days I have to use a blade razor to shave. the Braun works good got maintaining short facial hair but not so good on longer hair. This is still the best electric razor I have used.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver through a trial program held by Braun. I tried the shaver and found it to not work very well. The shaver does well around the cheek area, but leaves a lot behind under the chin and neck. The cooling apparatus in the shaver does, however work very well. The trimmer on the shaver is located awkwardly on the back of the shaver and doesn&#x27;t work very well. Personally, I could not recommend this product to anyone based on the performance I have witnessed using it. The CoolTec is the only part of the shaver I found to be very good and it is more of a cheap gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec System through a program run by Braun. After using it once, I realized that this shaver is the real deal. I got a very close shave and the cooling sensation feels amazing. I have gotten rid of my old shaver and will be using this one for a long time. It has great precision, feels great on my face, and even the cleaning system works great. I am very happy with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> After years of rarely shaving, I decided to try The Braun CoolTec Shaving System. Compared to my Norelco electric razor that I had years ago, it is fantastic. The cooling bar in the middle of the razor is very refreshing. Since I only shave once every few weeks, razor burn and irritation are fairly common but with this razor the irritation is minimal compared to other razors that I have used. The charging and self-cleaning stand works quite well but the replacement cartridges seem a bit pricey. It also come with a travel charger which will come in handy due to its low profile. The beard trimmer feature is not as well designed as on some other electric razors. All in all though, as far as electric razors go, the Braun CoolTec is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun</li>
            <li> First of all I am no grizzly Adams when it comes to growing facial hair. With that being said, Braun&#x27;s CoolTec razor gives me a close and clean shave! Comparing this product to other electric razors that I have purchased in the past, this razor gives me the closest shave, and leaves my skin feeling cool. Braun&#x27;s razor is very smooth and only requires a couple of passes for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is also built very strong. It has a nice heavy, sturdy feel to it, and comes with what seems like a high end  cleaning system. The razor actually gets pretty cold after only a few seconds of running it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend this to friends and family</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for quite a while.  I usually use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power razor and it does well for me.  I got to be part of a Braun testing group and got to try out the Braun CoolTec Shaving System.  I Loved It!  The shaver did a great job on my face of getting really close.  Closer then what I got with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power razor.  The cooling system which is a metal bar that gets quite cold is great.  I can really feel it keeping my face cool during the entire shave.  I have not gotten razor burn at all.  When I was using previous electric shavers (rotary type) I got razor burn a lot and that is why I stopped using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included self cleaning base is genius.  This cleaning base actually works and totally takes the job of cleaning away.  I hated trying to clean the old electric razor.  I was sort of concerned about the refills for the cleaning system but after seeing how well it works I am sold, and have no problem getting them.  I am already planning on getting another one of these for a Christmas gift for my Dad.</li>

            <li> I was excited to receive my Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun and was very excited to try the cooling feature that was well hyped up. The results, however, were mixed. Overall, it&#x27;s a good shaving system and gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The Braun ¬∞CoolTec shaver minimizes shaving irritation. My face felt much cooler and did not sting, compared to a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cooling feature is cool and it makes my face feel good after the shave (even if it&#x27;s all in my head).&lt;br /&gt;3. Works anywhere, even in the shower. The waterproof design makes shaving easy and carefree, wherever I decide to shave.&lt;br /&gt;4. All the parts, pieces, and accessories are high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not shave as closely as a straight razor, but that is true with all electric razors, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;2. The precision trimmer seemed more like an afterthought. It&#x27;s too small and too weak to compete against dedicated trimmers and does not complement the main shaver.&lt;br /&gt;3. The system is too bulky, from a large and uncomfortable-to-hold shaver to a space-hogging cleaning and charging station.&lt;br /&gt;4. The shaver is quite noisy when in use, and so is the cleaning and charging station when it&#x27;s cleaning the shaver. Not too big of a deal unless I&#x27;m shaving or cleaning in the middle of the night, which I don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature is indeed really cool (pun intended), but if you want a perfect shave, I would suggest a straight razor or a different electric razor. Braun delivers an all-in-one system with the ¬∞CoolTec, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t excel as a razor or a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I received this from a program that was run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say after reading about it I was really excited to give it a try, I&#x27;m somebody that would constantly suffer from razor burn so the thought of something like this to keep everything cool in the process sounded amazing.&lt;br /&gt;the cooltec works amazing, the bar keeps my face cool and calm while shavings so on that front this truly is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However from a shaver perspective I gotta say it was alright. It seemed to take forever compared to my manual razor to shave.&lt;br /&gt;it left spots of hair especially on my neck line. it was bad enough that I felt I needed to go back and get my manual razor just to go over everything again. on my face it worked well gave a great feel.&lt;br /&gt;but overall I just can&#x27;t say I feel in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;if you love electric razors its worth a shot, if your somebody like me that doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close or as good a shave from one you might want to pass on it.</li>
            <li> I received this razor directly from Bruan in a marketing campaign. Every manufacturer of electric razors claims to have the best unit when it comes to a clean shave and preventing razor burn.  The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is an upgrade compared to other electric shavers but for me it still is not as good as an &amp;#34;old fashion razor.&amp;#34;  I feel that the shave was good, but the I still experienced razor burn.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaving system from a program run through Braun and let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be MORE PLEASED with this product. This shaving system is hands-down the best that I&#x27;ve ever had. I have purchased a few different brands of electric razors in the past, including other Braun razors, but this system has by far impressed me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I have medium-thickness facial hair, at least enough to need to shave every day, or occasionally get away with waiting 2 days, as well as slightly sensitive skin, and this razor system has kept me looking clean and without irritation for over a month now. I can&#x27;t get over how neat the aluminum cooling bar feels! It really does make a difference. I&#x27;ve only experienced very mild irritation once with this razor and that was probably my fault for pressing it too hard to my face the first time I used it as I didn&#x27;t know how easily and effectively it would cut the &amp;#34;little hairs.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The razor itself is extremely comfortable to hold and does a great job of staying evenly pressed against my face when I&#x27;m shaving. Other razors have caused me to have to hold it in awkward positions to get an even shave, but not this one!! I am also very impressed with the ease of mobility with the travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the sleekness of the razor, and the awesome cooling sensation that seems to actually keep the irritation away, this entire system is very well-designed and stylish. Its so nice to have a charging system that cleans the razor at the same time! As this is my first electric razor that has had a cleaning AND charging station in one, I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I can say that it works extremely well and seems to keep the blades sharp and it definitely keeps the razor in top working order because of its cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that I will be sticking with this razor for the foreseeable future! Braun has come out with a great product and it is working great for me. I would definitely recommend this razor to any of my friends who enjoy a good, clean shave; especially those with sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a promotional program run by Braun. I&#x27;m not much of an electric razor guy, but I was actually quite impressed this one. Out of curiosity, I put it in the charger/cleaning system and let it clean before I shaved for my first time. It only took about 5 minutes, maybe less. With my first use of it, I was already impressed on how cold the razor actually got. The only issue I had was after I cleaned it, when I shaved, there was some cleaning fluid that dripped from the shaver after cleaning. However, I cleaned it again after my first use and the next time I shaved with it, there was no fluid leaking. So, this can easily be solved by letting it dry after its cleaned. I&#x27;d recommend to have it cleaned after you use it and then just let it dry while it charges at the station until your next shave. Other than that, I didn&#x27;t have any issues. It gives quite the close shave and it feels as if your using an ice cube to do it. I also like that it has a retractable razor on the back in case you need to do a major shave and not just a clean up. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec razor through a testing program offered through Braun. I work varying hours and using this product has been great. It gives me a smooth and quick shave when I am on the go. The cooling system cuts down on skin irritation. I have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor so when I got a chance to participate in a promotion where I received a cooltech razor from Braun for free I was excited. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t impress me. Although the chilling effect was \\&quot;cool\\&quot; the razor constantly misses hairs on my face making me have to follow my electric shave with a blade shave (completely defeating the purpose of me having an electric shaver). The only time I didn&#x27;t have this problem as bad was when I shave religiously every morning and never skipped. If this product had a swivel head I think that would fix the problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric razor. Easy to use, cool charger. Just make sure to get some lotion to use with shaver. This is not a good dry shave razor.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec Shaver though a promotion by Braun.  I usually do not use an electric razor so I was not sure how I would like the CoolTec Shaver.  I have to say after using the CoolTec Shaver for a couple of weeks I have found that I prefer a manual razor.  The Braun CoolTec does not do well with facial hair that is longer than a few days of growth.  I do not like to shave daily so this disappointed me.  I feel that a manual razor provides a closer shave.  I really enjoyed the cool-tec feature.  It gave my skin a nice cool and smooth feeling, but that feature alone does not change my mind about keeping my manual razor.  I would try this razor again if Braun fixed it so it provided a closer shave.</li>
            <li> If you avoid other electric razors because they irritate your skin, then consider getting your hands on the Braun CoolTec.  I received mine from a program Braun was running and I can honestly say that I love this razor.  I&#x27;ve used several different ones in the past, but shaving without cream was causing a lot of dry irritation to my face.  I was skeptical at first, but this Braun is not like any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The cooling bar in the middle of the unit makes all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easily, by popping the top off and running a little bit of water on the heads.  And you can charge and clean it at the same time in the cleaning base.  Like most other similar razors, it keeps it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec is surprising quiet for an electric razor.  Maybe it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used a good one, but I was very happy that the noise level was so low.  I also really like the hard shell carry case that comes with it.  It makes it easy to know that I can pack for a business trip and not have to worry about the power button getting hit while it&#x27;s in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over a month now, and I can tell you that I have had none of the dry skin razor burns that I used to get with my previous electric razors.  I am ready to ditch the cream and blades that I&#x27;ve had to deal with.  The cooling bar has saved my face.</li>
            <li> I received the BraunCoolTech razor as part of a promotion and I am extremely happy with it.  I have always had trouble using electric razors in the past, and the only electric razor that has worked for me is the Braun Series 7.  Prior to getting the CoolTech, I had been using my Series 7 for five years.  I had tried others, but all others resulted in a rash or poor shaving.  The CoolTech ranks up there with my Series 7 and maybe even above my Series 7 (at a much lower price point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTech provides a comfortable, smooth shave without irritation.  The cleaning base keeps it both cleaned and oiled, and the cooling technology is a very nice feature.  I highly recommend this shaving system.</li>
            <li> I have had an old Braun for about 5 years now it&#x27;s an 8500 model and this does not work as good.  I received this Braun from Braun so I could test the product. It does have a couple of good features.  I still like the cleaning solution. The cooling feature works well  and is new and different. I don&#x27;t feel the shaver works as good as the older models. I feel like I need to go over the same area more than once for a close shave. The side burn trimmer still works great. This would be perfect if it just gave a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I got this through a program run by Braun. I&#x27;m old fashioned and not used to electric shavers, but this product gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was the cooling technology. I have sensitive skin and frequently have razor burn, but with the cooling bar on the razor, i&#x27;ve never had a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of parts, which again, i&#x27;m not used to. I imagine i&#x27;ll get the hang of it once i get out of the 60&#x27;s and in with technology :)</li>
            <li> I received Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun, below are my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It does cool the skin while shaving&lt;br /&gt;2) Clean&amp;Charge Station is very good&lt;br /&gt;3) Trimmer provided accurate and sharp cut&lt;br /&gt;4) The shaver provided clean shave for halfe my face, then it needed cleaning in order to continue.&lt;br /&gt;5) You need to practice to get it right</li>
            <li> First off let me say I normally use a straight razor and have never used any electric razor that shaves as close.  When I heard about this razor I thought the cooling bar was a marketing trick and wouldn&#x27;t do anything.  I was wrong! The cooling bar stopped razor burn very well (5stars).  Unfortunately the razor that it is attached to did not cut very well.  This razor worked well to keep in my desk for touch ups before a dinner meeting, but struggled to be a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.  I have never used an electric razor and so I did not any expectations or preconceptions.  The cooling feature can be toggled so I used the shaver with it on and off in order to compare.  Definitely leave it on!  It feels as though the razor is gliding over my face when chilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can achieve a close shave with this razor, but with some difficulty.  As I mentioned, I&#x27;m new to electric razors, so I cannot state whether my difficulty is due to my own inexperience or the design of the razor.  I do find that it takes a longer time to complete my shave than if I use a manual razor in the shower.  Again, this could simply be inexperience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, with self-cleaning, this is a great product to have when I just need a close shave, and quickly.  Using a manual razor anywhere but in the shower also produced irritation.  I can simply pick this up and go.  Close shave in a pinch with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Cooltec shaving system from Braun and after using this electric shaver system for about a month I can say it gets the job done.  As with any new electric razor the first couple of shaves will not be ideal and can be irritating.  The Cooltec does help with the irritation, more so than my other electric razors when I first started using them.  Overall, the shave quality became better for me.  I keep a beard during the winter so I use it to clean up my neck and small facial patches and the Braun does a great for this.  I really like the cleaning system as I am lazy and usually in a hurry so keeping the shaver clean was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give it 4 stars for my shaving needs.  After taking off the beard and maintaining a clean-look I will provide an update to see how this works.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec Shaving system through a program with Braun where I could test the system and then report my opinions.  The Braun CoolTec Shaving system is a good electric razor.  It took a little longer than I would like when I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.  The cooling technology was nice but not a must have for me.  I like the electric razor if I am not as concerned with getting a close shave, there is nothing that beats a 5 blade disposable razor for me.  I shave both my head and face and like the closeness of an actual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for someone who shaves regularly.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. Very easy to use and maintain. The manual is very clear and it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try out the Braun cooltec razor to see what it was all about. I received the razor through a promotion ran by Braun. I would have to say there are many good things about this razor. First off it charges extremely fast and has a Led light display to make everything easier to see. The razor provides a good clean shave for an electric razor I was very impressed. My favorite part of this would have to be the aluminum cooling bar it helps my sensitive skin from getting razor burn &amp; irritation. The razor is a bit pricey but I would definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the CoolTec electric shaver by Braun that I received through \\&quot;BzzAgent\\&quot; campaign run by Braun for over a month now and my opinion is that it&#x27;s an ok/average electric razor.  It took a month for my facial hair to become accustomed to the new razor.  The cool strip that is suppose to keep your face from becoming irritated from shaving works, but for me, a guy who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, the drawbacks aren&#x27;t really worth the benefit of this razor.  Because of the design of the razor head with the cool strip, it doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave without a LOT of passes over your face.  And I have some spots on my chin and neck where my beard is really difficult to cut.  Also, the razor is a bit big and bulky and a little bit much to conveniently hold and maneuver around your face while shaving.  Not to mention that the size of the shaving head is so large it&#x27;s not easy to shave your mustache area.  I nick my upper lip just about every time I use it if I&#x27;m not careful.  The self-cleaning feature is really nice and works great.  The charge lasts about a week and that is with the cooling feature turned on.  The charge actually lasts longer than a week, but after about 4 or five days it doesn&#x27;t have enough of a charge to operate the cooling feature.  Over all I give this razor about 3 ¬Ω stars out of five.</li>
            <li> I was overly thrilled with it , my older braun might have been better</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun CoolTec electric razor through a program run by Braun and I am very pleased with the results.  For reference, my two previous electric razors were Norelco rotary type razors, which did a nice job.  This razor gets about as close a shave as you can get with an electric razor, and the cooling bar is awesome.  I wasn&#x27;t sold until I tried it.  It really does help to reduce the irritation I would normally get while shaving.  I would definitely recommend this razor to someone else looking for a way to cut down on skin irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> The braun cool tec razor provided for a free trail by braun has been a pleasant surprise with a close shave combined with cool roller blades instead of the hot one&#x27;s usually against your face that irritate it. It feels like cool rag against your skin without the redness after a close shave. The mustache trimmer attached and it can be pulled up as needed and put in when not on the back. The base has a great liquid that when you recharge it self cleans the blades and dry&#x27;s them. It is a great product for the man on the go who wants a irritation free shave</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun 8000 series razor for quite some time, and was fortunate enough to receive a new Braun CoolTec razor as part of a Braun promotion for testing and review.  This review is a part of that promotion.  The first thing I can say is that the CoolTec technology does in fact work.  It actually works extremely well.  The first few times that I used the razor, it felt like the foil was wet, as if the cleaning solution hadn&#x27;t yet fully evaporated.  It messed with my mind for the first week.  It is a very soothing sensation and really did eliminate razor burn and the need for aftershave lotion, for me, anyway.  The cleaning station is a little sleeker and modern-looking than my 8000 series station.  The package also came with a cleaning solution pack, as well as a travel charger and carry case.  The travel charger uses the same cord as the cleaning station, and acts as a charging cradle.  You can not simply plug the cord into the razor.  The travel case gives the razor a very snug fit, however, there is no room for the charging cradle, or the cord, as my 8000 series case does.  I have not tried it yet, as I am paranoid of dropping it in the shower, however, this is a wet or dry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does have some drawbacks.  I would rather not have the charging cradle, and would prefer to be able to plug the cord directly into my razor for charging and shaving.  I would also want the case to be able to hold the cord to keep everything tidy in one place when traveling.  As it is, you have to remember to take three items, as opposed to one case with the razor and cord inside.  The razor does not come with a plastic shield over the foil, which I would have liked to have included, as foils and cutters are so expensive.  I would appreciate a fifty cent plastic guard protecting a $40 foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is not nearly as powerful as my 8000 series razor.  I approximate it takes me 30% longer to shave in the morning.  I do gain comfort, but something about having a cake and eating it too.  There is no tilt head feature which I use 100% of the time with my 8000 series razor, and the side burn trimmer is very narrow, and without being able to tilt the head out of the way, difficult to use precisely.  I have not been impressed with the side burn trimmer at all, I actually use the one on my 8595.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this razor is one of hope.  I am thoroughly impressed with the CoolTec feature.  If I had that in my 8000 series razor, I would absolutely love it.  I have no idea how much I paid for my 8595, or when, but after having tried out this razor, would pay $30-$50 more to have the CoolTec bar on it.  I am hoping that Braun is satisfied with the results of the CoolTec and decide to incorporate it into their entire razor line.  I have very little knowledge about competitive brands and products (how many times in your life are you in the market for a new electric razor?), but this could indeed be a game changer for Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I received this razor via a program run by Braun. The cooltec system definitely works. Within a few seconds of shaving, you can feel the razor getting cool on contact which makes for a comfortable shave. The shaver is comfortable to hold and looks really nice. It is quiet for an electric razor too which is nice. I was not able to get as close a shave as I would have liked. I&#x27;ve owned electric razors in the past which were better at doing this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver about 3 times a week for a few months now.  The CoolTec feature is a nice addition to this shaver.  The cooling bar only takes a few seconds to cool and feel pretty good on the skin.  I don&#x27;t know if the long-term cooling effect improves irritation, but the instant cooling effect feels nice and seems to provide a smooth shave.  The shave isn&#x27;t the best, but it does provide a smooth, non-irritating shave.  The cooling feature doesn&#x27;t work well on the upper lip since the cooling bar is inbetween the two sets of blades.  There just isn&#x27;t enough room to take advantage of the cooling bar in tight places.  The electric shaver reviewed was provided via a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver, but keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as you might want.  Not that it&#x27;s too far outside the norm of electric shavers, it&#x27;s not, but it does seem slightly worse than average on that front.  On the plus side, the shave is great as far as the cooling sensation.  It does seem to lessen the redness quite a bit, compared to a regular electric razor.  To summarize, ok shave, but better than the average electric razor.  I received this shaver through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> This gets a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works as good as they say that it does in the ads. I&#x27;ve been wanting to switch over to electric shaving since long before I could grow a beard; it looked so cool in all the movies and &amp;#34;Grandpa does it while he drives his car to work&amp;#34;. I was sold on the dream. When I finally got the beard, and asked dad why he DIDN&#x27;T use an electric razor, he explained that he could never get one that worked right. I was stuck with safety razors, but the electric razor dream never died, it would reemerge every couple years as a slick new razor ad struck my fancy. And every time, without fail, I would be savagely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Braun CoolTec; Made in Germany, winner of the reddot award, and the coolest looking looking device I have seen in a while. I was drawn to the design, and when I read about the technology I couldn&#x27;t help but think that maybe this was the shaver I have been searching for. The 60-day money back guarantee sold me, I figured I could just get my money back when it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. I opened up the box, set up the ingenious cleaning station, and charged it for an hour. Then the moment of truth, would this thing actually shave good? Amazingly, YES. And it&#x27;s very very cold while it shaves, which makes it infinitely more comfortable. The cleaning station does all the cleaning for you, and everyday my shaver smells and operates like it&#x27;s fresh out of the hygienic shaver factory back in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the shaving dream, and I&#x27;m living it. (It&#x27;s around 5 bucks a month to keep the cleaning solution flowing, but for now, it&#x27;s worth every of those 500 pennies.)</li>
            <li> I did not receive the CLEANING CARTRIDGE (170ml), as it should be included in the Standard Packaging.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely a bad idea choosing the Frustrating Free Packaging.</li>
            <li> Ok if used every day but miss a day it leaves patches on face I like my rotary unit  much better, except it can not be used in the shower. Would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave. Better than the really pricy 7000 which it is replacing. Thought the cooling thing was a gimmick, but for my beard it really helps! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the product because it gives a smooth close shave . When I used other razors they would make my neck brake out . But the Braun cool shaver does what it says  it would do and that it would take the redness out and cool your skin . Great shaver , I am a believer in the Braun product and will always own one . One more great thing , the shaver cleans it self and that saves a lot of time .</li>
            <li> The shaver meets my expectations.  I have used electric shavers since 1990, and this one works well.  The cooling bar helps keep shaving irritation on my neck down.  I wish it had the pivoting head of the older Pulsonic that I had, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I had virtually no experience with electric razors prior to this product. I owned a three-head Norelco from over 10 years ago that was horrible...I had been using blades until I received this as a gift a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll preface by saying if you want any type of facial hair (beard/stubble, chin strap, goatee, etc.) this product will be useless for you. The pop-up trimmer is only appropriate for evening out sideburns; precision facial hair detailing simply cannot be accomplished with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically, the razor looks great. It feels solid and sturdy, and is comfortable to hold. It looks really cool in its cleaning base, as well, sitting there looking like the sword in the stone when you&#x27;re not using it. That cleaning solution does its job really well too; the foil feels great after being cleaned, and on top of that it comes out smelling like lemons, which is awesome. Battery life is a non-issue; you&#x27;ll have more than enough juice to get you through even a lengthy shave (which is one of this razor&#x27;s main downsides...more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main selling point of this Braun is the CoolTec system. Basically, an aluminum element situated between the cutting foils gradually becomes cooler as you shave. It actually works great. The cooling sensation feels pleasant on the skin, and there&#x27;s definitely less irritation than the old Norelco that I previously used. Since its an electric, you won&#x27;t be nicking or cutting your skin as you shave, either. After about 15-20 minutes, however, the cooling element will cease functioning and need to be...erm...cooled down before being used again. That&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, though, and overall, this product provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and for that it deserves praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a deal breaker is the quality of the shave you get from this product. This is going to be subjective, since everyone&#x27;s facial hair grows differently (directionof hair growth, rate of hair growth, thickness/coarseness, etc). My facial hair grows in pretty quickly and relatively coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, if you have anything more than a two-day old beard, this thing in general is going to be miserable unless you trim down your stubble first. The quality of the shave is quite uneven and immensely disappointing. The shaver does well on the cheeks/jaw and chin, and does an okay job on the upper lip area (provided you use a blade to get the hairs just under your nose). However, it fails miserable in the area underneath the chin, and on the neck. There are always a handful of hairs and/or clusters of stubble that seem to be outside of the shaver&#x27;s ability, even after multiple passes. I&#x27;ve tried shaving dry and using Lectric Shave, and I still have the same problem. You may need to follow up with a pass of a traditional blade to ensure closeness, which kind of defeats the purpose. This increases your shaving time to inconvenient lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to say this is a bad product. The cleaning base and CoolTec functionality are wonderful features to have in an electric shaver, and they really do work as advertised. The shave is serviceable (if uneven), which isn&#x27;t bad, but you&#x27;d expect more from this relatively expensive electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean-shaven look, and as long as you shave every day (every other day at the most), you&#x27;ll be okay with this razor and may even love it. Everyone else should approach this product with caution. One year later, I still use mine sporadically when I want the aforementioned clean-shaven look and don&#x27;t want to nick up my face. At all other times, I&#x27;ll be using a blade.</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;the cooling feature is a nice feature I use it each time&lt;br /&gt;and cleaning system does a great job cleaning the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently got to use the Braun CoolTec electric razor that was provided to me via a program run by Braun and I must say I am surprised by how much I enjoyed using it. Often times I have had problems with skin irritation whether I used a manual or electric razor, shaving cream or gel, hot water, or any other method to minimize razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t think this CoolTec system would really make that much of a difference but it was a relief to find that I was wrong. It gave a nice smooth close shave and the cooling that comes off of such a small strip for the CoolTec system calmed my skin as I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say there were a lot of things to like about the razor and the CoolTec feature: close shave, calm skin, cool feel, quick charge, familiar Braun charging and cleaning station, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I think is not perfect about this is I would have wished that the cooling strip was a slight bit wider, but overall still well above expectations and I would certainly recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use I still stand by my original review in that it is a nice close shave and the cooltec feature is an added benefit. I like the size and feel while holding the razor and it is quick and easy to clean and charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative point I have is that I am a little disappointed in the long hair trimmer feature on this electric razor as I have used other Braun electric razors previously and the long hair trimmer worked just fine for sideburns or if I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days and let my beard/mustache grow out. Other than that I am still quite pleased with the razor and think that the cooltec feature is a nice addition to an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have always flip flopped back and forth between electric razor and blade.  I usually tend to use the blade during summer and the electric during winter because all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve used have heated up after the first 45ish seconds of use.  Hot face + hot shaver &#x3D; bad shave and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as part of a trial program from Braun.  As a person who is always warm (I live in shorts year round), the idea of having a cooling electric shaver intrigued me.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it I opened the box and started putting it all together (it comes with a few thing).  Right off the bat I noticed that the power plug for the charging/cleaning pod did was not a tight fit.  It easily came out of its socket.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was designed that way (maybe safety reasons) or if mine was a defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few thing I noticed before while assembling:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit bulky/heavy.  My Panasonic (similar setup to the Braun) weighs 6.1oz while the Braun is 9.9oz.  This is understandable since it has a cooling function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution that was supplied smells like cheap vodka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice in your hand, but i feel that the on/off and cooling button should be switched (my thumb rested right on the cooling button).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When charging it MUST be sitting face down at an angle (strange).&lt;br /&gt;Charging time was surprisingly fast, straight out of the box it has no jiuce, and about a half hour on the charger the indicator light went off and it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The First Shave:&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I hit the button I noticed that it has a lower frequency buzz than my Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The cooling function is defaulted to On so it started cooling right off the bat.  The cooling comes from a metal bar in the middle of the two screens.  After letting it run for 10 seconds, I touched the bar and it was surprisingly cold.  I figured that it would have been slightly colder than the shaver head, but WOW, it feels likeyou touched the inside of your freezer.&lt;br /&gt;I started in on my first shave, and the cold sensation is very nice.  I wish that the shaver head itself was a bit narrower (too much of a gap between the screens, but the cooling bar had to go somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt nice after the shave.  The best way I can equate the cooling feature is if you put a cold can of soda on your warm face/forehead.  It felt really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Left a few long hairs on my face, but not many.&lt;br /&gt;It has a side-burn/hair trimmer on the back that worked nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i was done i took of the screen and brushed away the hairs using the supplied brush and put it in its cradle for its first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;One push of the (only) button on the cradle and it started its cleaning cycle.  The cycle ran for about 5 min (shorter than the Panasonic) and it was done.  Upon inspection of the cutting head, it is as clean as before i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use the crap out of this during summer (too bad its November now).  The cooling feature works amazingly well.  I can imagine it took quite a bit of engineering to fit a cooling system into a shaver.  All in all, its a great shaver!</li>
            <li> I recently picked this razor up through a program Braun is running and I am excited about it.  I grow a thick beard and typically get gnarly razor burn so I almost never use an electric razor.  I usually just trim it on zero setting with a trimmer but I wanted to try this out anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the cooling on the razor.  It was very refreshing and was a smooth, cool feeling.  It was nice.  The razor cut through my beard and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, not even on my neck, which is a sure thing.  I think the cleaning system helps that out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this razor to my manly friends.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that at first I was not sure about this.. I have tried other shavers before and none of them got close and even worse left my face burning! I tried this shaver and none of those problems.. the cooling effect left my face feeling great and it cut very close to the skin.. I also loved the fact that when you are done you just put it in the cleaning solution and your done... no fuss!! This is a great product! I was so happy to review this for Braun!</li>
            <li> UPDATED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor for a couple weeks now, I am thrilled with its quality and ability!  The razor continues to give me a shave that is nearly as close as a straight razor (without the risk of grave injury).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec bar continues to feel like an ice cube between the foils that allows you to send skin irritation the way of the Dodo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth every single penny!  Its MSRP is  $199 I believe and I&#x27;ve seen it for as low as $149 on Amazon.  Either price point is WELL worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two charging stations.  One is for cleaning and the other is for portability.  The cleaning dock is great and very quiet!  I use it in a bathroom that is about 20 feet from my sleeping kids (5, 2 1/2 and less than a year old).  It doesn&#x27;t wake them or even make them stir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portable station is very compact and does not have any latching mechanisms.  I find this to be great for quick one handed access to the razor.  However, I can see how some may not like the lack of a latch to hold the razor in the charging station.  To be clear, the cleaning station DOES have a latch, but the smaller charging station DOES NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this razor 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 is because the trimmer attachment leaves MUCH to be desired.  However, if you have a trimmer already (like I do), then the trimmer attachment is a VERY minor aspect of the overall razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  The shaver was provided through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun CoolTec from a program they run. It has significantly reduced the appearance of razor bumps for me.  The cooling effect that this razor has really caters to those with sensitive skin like myself.  I usually shave with cartridge razors, but this Braun is able to get a very close shave which surprised me. The cleaning station is also a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit tha I was a little skeptical when Braun provided me the opportunity to try out this shaver through a program they were running.  My skin is a little sensitive, and when they promoted their CoolTec system, i figured I would try it out.  It is great.  you can definitely feel the coolness when you shave.  my skin feels great.  It takes care of everything.  I also love the cleaning station that makes it sterile.  It definitly practices what it preaches.</li>
            <li> Received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System from a program ran by Bruan.  Was fairly skeptical as my skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never found an electric razor I could use without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System it was very nicely packaged and everything is very high-quality.  The direction could certainly be a little better and explain things a little more.  Basically they provide a string of pictures which is nice but no detail into all the parts and how it all works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time using the shaver I was sold!  The cool feeling truly feels very good on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause the normal skin irritation that I&#x27;m used to getting from these types of shavers.  To test it further I waited to shave a couple days to see how it would handle my facial hair once it got a little long.  Same results!  Worked smoothly and perfectly without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean &amp; charge station is also a pretty nice feature as it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and fully charged!  Nice having a cradle to just set the shaver in for charging instead of messing around with cords.  Then the cleaning station makes it good as new, looks like it just came out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this shaver to my friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> I received my Braun CoolTec Shaver System  and the first time I used it I could immediately see a difference in the way my skin feels and also how it looks. The cut was close and the cooling part made it very comfortable!</li>
            <li> I recently received the Braun ¬∞CoolTec System via a program run by Braun in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a black male, I was very excited about this product because I often suffer from skin irritation and sometimes razor bumps from electric or non-electric shavers.  After using the Braun product on the first day to shave, the cooling system really did provide less irritation to the skin, although it was not as cool as I thought it would be.  Additionally, there was no razor bumps the following day.  Although all of those things was great about the shaver, the product fell short on some other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun product does not provide a very close shave as to what I am use to when I compare this product with the Andis T-liner shaver. Also, I have side burns and there is not really a great way to shave my side burns easily so that it is even all the way around. This seems to be an all or nothing approach when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is great for men who do not need a very close shave and for men who suffer from razor bumps or skin irritation when shaving.  As for me, I will probably continue to use this product for maintenance in between barber visits because I do not have to worry about getting razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec shaver via a Braun program.  I have always been anti-electric shavers until now.  I have extremely sensitive skin that became red and irritated when I shaved but not any more with the Braun CoolTec shaver.  The cooling technology of this shaver automatically cools the skin while I shave, reducing irritation.  I do not even need to use gels or lotions.  The specially designed shaving blades target and capture hairs growing in different directions.  Another cool feature of this Braun shaver is the speed at which it recharges the battery.  It only takes an hour till a full charge is achieved.  The Braun shaver comes with a cleaning station that works well and the battery recharges while cleaning.</li>
            <li> Though I got this electric shaver was provided via a program run by Braun, I feel that the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I hate to do when I shaved is to feel the heat on my face. CoolTec definitely changed my perspective in shaving. Believe it or not, I look forward to shave now. The system also helps to clean up the blade so it prolong the blade life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is anything that I wish that I could change is the ability to drain the blade rather quickly after the cleaning since the liquid tend to drip all over. It contains some alcohol ( I think!) so it dries up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I received the shaver about a week ago through a promotion from Braun. So far so good. The shaver is well made along with the cleaning unit. The cooling feature is awesome i find myself still shaving even after all the whiskers are gone because it feels so soothing. I have tried other electrics and had all but given up on them because my face would break out from irritation. But with the cool tech after using for more than a week daily my face is in tip top shape no break outs no irritation. The trimmer is also handy and works well. This shaver, just like all electric shavers,does not like longer whiskers so be sure to use the trimmer first if your beard is longer.  The battery life is good. Will update again in a week or so. All in all I recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Husband says it&#x27;s the best razor he has ever had.  He had a lot of trouble with patchy red blotches on his skin with his old razor, probably skin fungus because there was no way to really clean the razor heads.  This one has a built-in cleaning system, but also is a much cleaner shave - works great!</li>
            <li> I tried out the Braun Cooltec system provided via a program run by Braun. I was a skeptic at first about the Cooltec technology but I really like it. I believe the Packaging kit is worth it because it comes with extras that are actually useful .&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It provides a great shave for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;-The cooltec system does work and I believe makes a difference if you dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-  The cleaning system is a little bulky .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend if you want a shaver that you can use in a dry shave or wet scenario and take advantage of the cooltec that no other shaver has.</li>
            <li> Ive used the Braun Cooltec a few times already, which I had received from Braun through a promotional campaign, which admittedly has been tricky since I have decided to go beard/scruff for a while, and grooming my neck/jawline is simply easier with a more traditional grooming tool and a Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES have a cool feeling when shaving... which was somewhat surreal. I just dont feel like I get a good shave with an electric razor and really prefer a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; disposable blade razor. I dont like having to rub my face over and over and over to get those 3-4 rogue hairs that it seems to keep missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough to have been selected to try out the CoolTec System for free via a program run by Braun. Now let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a hairy man and I hate shaving. On top of all that, I have very sensitive skin. Because of this, I have never really found an electric shaver that works great for me. They usually fall short somewhere. Now to the CoolTec System. It is not the closest shave but for me it is perfect. I honestly have not found any electric shaver that give me a shave that I consider close. The feature that stands out above all the others is the cooling bar. All I can say is Wow! I read about it and thought is was just another gimmick, not the case. It actually helps make the shave feel very comfortable. I also did not break out afterwards like I normally do so I&#x27;m guessing the cool bar actually did was it was advertised to do. It felt great. This was also the first electric shaver I tried with the automatic cleaning. That is just cool. I have no clue how much it is to replace the cleaning solution it uses but it is pretty cool. Solid product and glad I&#x27;m shaving with it. Do not hesitate to buy this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received this razor from a program run by Braun. Was very skeptical about all the hype. But this razor has been the best thing I have ever used. Always have a break out after shaving because of sensitive skin but with this it has not been an issue at all. It really does everything they say it can. The cooling action was something that took a few minutes to get used to but after the initial shock absolutely loved it. Having everything all together and organized in the station is  great. When I go back for another shave everything is clean, charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec Shaver system from a program run by Braun. As a man with very sensitive skin, I was hesitant yet intrigued to try out the shaver. I have tried several different electric shavers and razors, but most of them end up causing moderate to severe razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the CT5 cc model which includes the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station. Setup was easy straight out of the box and I went ahead and ran the cleaning system while it was charging. The cleaning process itself took around 3 minutes, but it was suggested to let it dry for a few hours before using the shaver. The cleaning system itself has been very nice and very convenient. I have been able to just throw it on the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station after each use and not have to worry about it being charged or cleaned when I went to shave next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being cleaned and charged, I tried it out for the first time. For the first shave, I did what the instructions suggested and did a completely dry shave. After trimming the longer hair with the handy long hair trimmer, I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth the shaver went across my face. There were one or two pulls around my chin, but it was smooth other than that. The aluminum cooling bar was nice, but was not shockingly cool. The next morning, I shaved while in the shower. It was even smoother in the shower with a damp face than it was dry. I was immediately aware of the cooling bar and it added a whole different level to the shaving experience. The face on my skin stayed cooler than the rest of my body which led to a very enjoyable shaving experience. One this to be careful about if you do shave in the shower - the cleaning solution in the &amp;#34;Clean and Charge&amp;#34; station is comprised of alcohol and perfume. I made the mistake of leaving my mouth open while shaving part of my face and got a very bitter taste in my mouth. I was confused as to what it was at first, but realized that it was probably residualcleaning solution that had dried on the blades, only to be re-wet and shaken off when used with water. If you do a dry shave, this should not be a problem. Before trying this shaver, I used a five-bladed razor but could not shave against the grain because of the sensitivity of my face. This shaving system allowed an extremely close shave and I was able to go against the grain without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest test for this shaving system was whether or not I would get razor burn in the few hours after I had shaved. I was incredibly pleased that I did not receive any razor burn or other types of irritation after using this system. I have made this shaving system my new primary shaver and will be recommending it!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Cooltec razor from Braun last month for free as part of a trial program. I will admit, the razor gives you a very close shave, but there is typically a lot of pain involved in the process. If your facial hair is longer than the average five o&#x27;clock shadow, the razor pulls the hair quite a bit for a less-than-comfortable shaving experience. The cooling bar is pretty cool and helps to some degree, but I find that other Braun models - such as the Series 7 - achieve the same or similar results with less pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the first time I used the cleaning station, I set it at night before going to bed and the thing kept running through the night and was still going when I woke up 7 hours later. There were also no lights on to indicate what exactly was supposed to be happening. All in all, the cooling technology was a great idea, I just think it should be implemented on a better quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using the razor for a few weeks now and, overall, I like it and will continue to use it as my main electric razor. The cleaning system still malfunctions from time to time, but it&#x27;s not very difficult to remove the head and brush off the cutting blades. If you&#x27;ve got some dough and want to buy a unique razor, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed with the Cooltec.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  At first I was unsure if it had fully charged since it makes so much less noise than any electric shaver I have previously had.  Somehow they managed to keep all the shaving power, but make it much quieter.  It provides a great shave, and immediately starts cooling once it&#x27;s turned on.  It feels great and is a nice change from other shavers that feel like they&#x27;re going to burn your skin by the time you get done shaving.  Every generation of new Braun product keeps getting better.  My only concern with this one is the price of a replacement head.  Since the cooling tech is all integrated with the blade, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to cost quite a bit when I need to replace it.  This shaver looks great, and since it doesn&#x27;t have a port to plug it in, you can actually use it to shave in the shower.  A great time saver when you&#x27;re running late.  I love the cleaning system and this version allows to you control how often it cleans so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of fluid quickly.  It also seems to be more frugal with how much cleaning fluid it uses since I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cartridge and I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now.  I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys electric shavers, but has sensitive skin or breaks.  I am so glad that I was sent a Braun CoolTec Shaver through a program run by Braun.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out as I have had bad experiences with electric razors in the past, and again I was disappointed.  After a couple weeks of using this shaving system, I could never get an adequate shave.  I consistently had missed spots that no matter which way I moved the shaver, I could not get.  In turn I would have to use a manual razor to clean up leaving me a nice case of razor burn.  While the CoolTec is an intriguing option, it did nothing to help enhance my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I received a Braun CoolTec shaver to try out via a program run by Braun.  I typically shave using a razor, but was tempted into trying out an electric shaver again with Brauns innovative new cooling system.  I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the CoolTec.  It&#x27;s a very nice looking unit, the dock solves the problem of where to store the shaver (having it sat next to the sink means it&#x27;s easier for me to grab and use than my razors which I have to keep away from my toddler).  It was easy to get going and prime with fluid, and so far seems like a very no-fuss setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is the most important thing here, and for me it was the closest I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor.  It dealt with a few days of stubble with no issue, and left me silky smooth, which quite frankly I was suprised at.  Based on past experience with electric shavers I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the actual shave.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is that I still don&#x27;t think an electric shaver can get quite the same result as a razor.  Maybe this is unfair, and maybe I&#x27;m setting my standards too high, but that&#x27;s just how I feel.  It shouldn&#x27;t take away from the fact that it delivered a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected the cooling system to be a novelty, but it&#x27;s actually very effective.  There&#x27;s a metal bar that sits between the two cutting blades which really does get ice cold, and I found it helped cut down on irritation.  The main reason I switched to manual razors years ago is because I have sensitive skin and pushing an electric shaver around my face used to leave me with blotchy skin.  The CoolTec didn&#x27;t have that effect, so that&#x27;s a thumbs up from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to work well.  As other reviewers have mentioned it leaves the shave head with a subtle chemical smell, but it smells clean, so doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;m still on the first batch of cleaning fluid so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they actually last, and I am slightly cynically thinking this may be just a wayto get a few more pennies out of us, but I am reserving judgement.  If it prevents my shaver from clogging up then it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel dock is a useful addition, allowing you to charge the shaver out of the cleaning dock.  It&#x27;d make more sense to me if you could just plug the charger cable straight into the shaver, but as long as I don&#x27;t have to take the cleaning station on holiday with me I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried out is the long hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to get hold of the CoolTec and it wasn&#x27;t a disappointing experience.  Overall I&#x27;m more impressed than I expected to be.  It&#x27;s actually converted me back to electric shaving.  Good job Braun.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun CoolTec through a program with Braun.  I am very use too using Electric Razors as they are my preferred method of shaving. Almost all razors I used in the past left me with some irritation and redness. So when I heard that this razor would greatly reduce this I was a little skeptical. However I was willing to try and it and see. At first the Cooling pad felt very weird as it made my face feel like to was freezing. However I did notice that this almost had no irritation or redness. After a few shaves I got very use to the Coolness and enjoyed it. The razors also gave a extremely close shave. This was better than almost every other razor I used in the past. The cleaning container made cleaning of the razor a breeze. It is so easy to just return the razor and have the unit clean and charge it for me. I am extremely happy that I had the opportunity to use this product. I highly recommend this product especially if you have any type of irritation or redness while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was provided the razor via a promotion through Braun, so I am totally unbiased. I have used several of the top brands before including Braun and never really noticed much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a premium razor with high quality construction. It is meant to be used as a daily razor and not a &amp;#34;once-a-month shave my beard razor&amp;#34;. I have gone back and forth with straight razors vs electric and I always seem to shy away from the electric after a while because of the skin irritation they cause. This razor is meant to alleviate the heat caused by all the friction and thus reduce some of the unnecessary skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have used it for the past several weeks and as an electric razor, this is top notch. Its comfortable, powerful, and precise. The square head makes it easy to control if you have a goatee or mustache you don&#x27;t want to accidentally shave. On top of that, the cooling feature actually works. I have no earthly idea what makes it so cold, but it literally feels like someone took it straight out of the freezer when its turned on. It takes a second or two to kick in but its definitely cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the cooling has no effect on the razor&#x27;s ability to shave your hair. It is there to increase comfort and reduce irritation. So far, I would definitely say its much more comfortable than any other electric razor I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cleaning station that is super cool. I hate cleaning out my other razors and this makes the process much easier and I actually trust that its clean now. Battery life seems pretty good, I can go a week+ on one charge so on short trips all you need is the razor and its carrying case (provided).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the type that shaves every morning, this is sure to make that process easier and much more comfortable. I would definitely recommend and  buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few electronic shavers but I always went back to using my regular shaver. When I was introduced to Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving system via a Braun program, I was so excited to try something to new. To say that this has been a life changer for me would be an understatement. This is hands down the best electronic shaver that is out there that is out there in the market today. This gives me a close shave and it gives me no irritation afterward. I have grown to love this and I feel that everytime I shave I get better at maneouvering around and also finishing my shaving sooner every time! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new electronic shaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver in addition to razors for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving. I&#x27;ve always liked using electric for the convenience, but always knowing that a razor gets much closer and is a bit more comfortable. That said, this &#x27;shaving system&#x27; is pretty nice. I was able to test the shaver through a program run by Braun and have been working with it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Feels very good in hand. It has a nice weight with balance. The &#x27;CoolTec&#x27; feature is very nice. A problem that many electric shavers have is the friction can make your face feel warm and not as comfortable. The idea of cooltec is to create a cooling sensation while shaving. I liked it a lot. The shaving experience is pretty good for electric. You&#x27;ll need to work around your skin for coverage and a complete shave. Again, not as good as a razor, but awfully convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Although it feels good in the hand, it is a bit more cumbersome to maneuver. If there was a bit more articulation to the shaving head would come in handy. The cooltec would also be nice if it was on the perimeter of the shaving head rather than the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a very nice shaver and the cooltec makes for a good feature and experience. I&#x27;d think it make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I am not a regular shaver but was more than happy to try this out as part of a Braun promotion. I like to maintain a beard and just shave my neck on occasion. I was happy with the result I got from this razor. I always have issues with getting me neck just the way I want and with this razor I was able to get it the best. My Adam&#x27;s Apple stick out fairly far and I always have shaving it without either cutting myself or having major irritation. This razor was able to resolve both issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that the Cooling bar was cold instantly. Using the cleaning base is optional and does provide benefits. The razor can be cleaned just using running tap water but the cleaning solution helps keep the razor sanitary and prolongs the life of the razor head.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun CoolTec system for a couple of weeks now. First of all, the cooling bar is really great and quite innovative. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it at first, since we are all used to the notion of a &amp;#34;hot shave&amp;#34;, but I find it to be really soothing. This is especially good for me since I am prone to real irritation from electric shavers. My previous model was a Toni &amp; Guy that I picked up in Europe - it went straight in the wastebin once I tried the Braun CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I did receive this system as from Braun as part of a campaign, so I figured I had nothing to lose, but it has really won me over. I have long been a daily disposable razor head guy - I have never found an electric razor that gets as close a shave as I like. Unfortunately, I still haven&#x27;t - but the Braun CoolTec comes close. I still see myself shaving with a regular razor most often, but I can see the potential for the Braun to fill in one to two days a week. The clean and charge system is another nice feature - I&#x27;ve never liked dismantling a razor and going in there with those tiny brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say that the Braun CoolTec is the closest I have come to finding an electric razor that meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be given the chance to experience the Braun CoolTec Shaving System by a program run by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was excited as this was my first foray into the electric shaving department, that excitement quickly turned to frustration, although not entirely the CoolTec products fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a niche product, its designed extremely well, built like a tank, and reliable like any good razor should be. The Cooling System is a piece of metal that, you guessed it, gets cool during shaving. The cooling only lasts a short time, around 15 minutes but if you need to shave longer than 15 minutes you should be using something else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with charging station that cleans and hydrates the razor, one important note is that the cradle is very large and takes up a decent amount of counter space, couple that with the $5 cartridges it can get pricey quick. Braun recommends you change the blades on the razor every 18 months, those can cost you anywhere in the $50 price, Amazon doesn&#x27;t have them in stock anymore. When you combine all this you have a product which initial cost can be expensive compared to a manual, but how does it stack up against a manual?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t, I hate to say it but it seems that this shave is just not as close a manual razor, but I don&#x27;t think its supposed to. The cooling does help, it feels nice when the razor glides over your face. I&#x27;m a person who has thick facial hair, I had to do numerous passes to experience what I thought was a close shave, those pesky hairs by the neckline might as well be impossible to get with the electric razor. Do I like it? Yes and No. Am I going to continue using it? Certainly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to its not the CoolTecs Fault, because I have thick follicles, as others may have, the system is tougher for us to use, electric shavers are not for everyone, but this one does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically Designed&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof- Nice to shave in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Cooling system is a nice feature, but gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning in charging station feels clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Close but not close enough&lt;br /&gt;Tough to get in the tight places&lt;br /&gt;Expensive Cartidge Refills&lt;br /&gt;Base Station very large.</li>
            <li> I already had an older model of Braun shaver, but obtained a CoolTec shaving system via a program run by Braun. While the older unit still worked perfectly, I immediately switched over and have ditched the old unit for this one. My skin is very sensitive, especially on my neck and I break out easily. The aluminum cooling bar helps keep the irritation down and allows me to run over the hard to reach areas several times without the burning sensation that typically follows. It also has a smaller charging/cleaning station than my old unit so it looks much better in my bathroom. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the unit and between the old experience and now this improved experience... I&#x27;m a Braun customer for life. Don&#x27;t be afraid to spend the money, they last forever! My old shaver has been in FREQUENT use for over 4 years and it still works great. I now use it as my travel razor and use the CoolTec as the &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; shaver.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this out when I first received it. I was sent this product from Braun to try and keep for free. As a guy who maintains a shaved head, I am always at the sink cleaning up my neck line (I have a beard) and/or shaving my head. I was hoping this could take the place of water/shaving cream approach. After using this for a few weeks, here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works well on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;- Quick, clean, and efficient&lt;br /&gt;- As someone who hasn&#x27;t used an electric razor in 10+ years, this is easily MUCH better than any other razor I tried in the past&lt;br /&gt;- It is compact, sleek, and comes with a nice case&lt;br /&gt;- The battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;- The blades seem sharp and I haven&#x27;t experience any pulling or pinching&lt;br /&gt;- The auto clean feature is pretty cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- While this works great on my scalp, it is awful on my actual facial hair. It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and make it necessary to go over the same spots multiple times because it has trouble trimming all the hair. I have tried pulling my skin tighter, going with the grain, against the grain, sideways, upside down... it doesn&#x27;t matter. I always have to go over my face and neck again with a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;- It needs cleaning often. Without fail, the light indicating it needs to be cleaned comes on midway through my shave. The only way to turn it off is to put it in the base and engage the cleaning cycle with the included solution so give it a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning base is pretty large and take up a lot of counter/sink space. It isn&#x27;t something you can easily keep out. It definitely gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am neutral on the cooling feature. It drains the battery faster and it doesn&#x27;t really make the shave any better. I guess it feels kind of nice, but that is about it. It doesn&#x27;t prevent razor burn or ingrown hairs or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will keep using it for quick touch ups on my face and head, but when I wantto look extra fly, there is nothing better than my plain ol&#x27; razor with shaving cream,</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome idea how cool the shaver is, it really relieved my issues with skin irritation after shaving. It hits the spot with close shave and my skin feeling good after I use it.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this shaving system through a program that Braun was running. I really enjoyed this shaver because of the close and smooth shave it provided me. I usually have trouble getting a close shave without irritating my skin, but I was nicely surprised after using this shaver. The CoolTec technology of the shaving makes it so that the shave doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I also loved to cool feel on my skin. The mini trimmer included in the other side of the shaver was a really nice &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; which was useful when shaving new curves. One of the things I loved about this trimmer was the sleek look it had. Instead of hiding the shaver in cabinets or drawers in my bathroom, I excitedly set it up on my bathroom countertop. There are two holders/chargers that come with this system, both of which are very sleek and stylish. I used the big holder on my counter top and kept the small one for travel. I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who is looking for a close, smooth shave or anyone who has irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not, the coolness performs as advertised, however, it does NOT provide anywhere near a close shave &amp; I found it inferior to my Norelco shaver which itself is inferior to the old reliable straight razor which I still have not been able to find a replacement for relative to closeness</li>
            <li> I got the braun cooltec for free from a program im a part of and I must say this is by far the best shaver I have ever used the best feature is the coldness it gets down to a cool 44 degrees which prevented me from getting afterburn which I hate if I were to say anything bad its the fact that it really doesn&#x27;t work if your facial hair Is too long other than that its the best shave ive ever had</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of electric shavers as I unfortunately have sensitive skin that reacts adversely to them.  I&#x27;ve tired a few different brands in the past(Norelco I believe) but haven&#x27;t found any that work for me and had more or less sworn off ever using electric shavers again.  However, I was presented an opportunity to receive a free Braun CoolTec Shaving System through a program that was being run by Braun and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot(it was free, what did I have to lose, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box I was quite impressed.  Looked like a lot of machine and a very quality product.  I read through the instruction manual(yeah, I&#x27;m a geek) and was excited to get it started up ready to use.  Now, I will add here that I was coming off of a no shave November and had a little bit of half beard going.  So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised when it didn&#x27;t give me the closest shave of my life.  First impressions..........LOVED the CoolTec part of the shaver as it completely left my skin feeling &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;(duh) with no irritation at all.  However, I was not impressed with closeness of the shave.  I had patches of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; that I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get no matter how hard I tried to go over them.  As a result, I pulled out my shaving blade and took care of the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days I gave it another shot and once again amazed by the cooling affect.  I should insert here that in all of my other experiences with electric shavers I would experience &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; that would later turn into blisters(a lot like some cold sores).  With the Braun CoolTec system this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  But.........again a problem with getting all of the stubble around my jawline and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At this point I thought I would be leaving a poor review.  Thankfully I persevered and continued to use my Braun.  Maybe it was because I had been used to the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; of the three rounded variety and I wasn&#x27;t used to this system, but after about a week I had figured the Braun out and it was shaving like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the system now:  It is a quick close shave, and as I mentioned above, the cooling system is amazing!  It also comes with a self cleaning unit that does the trick and keeps it sparkling and sanitary. The Braun CoolTec system is incredibly simple and easy to use.  For the most part, it just involves pressing a few buttons!  I have not had to replace any of the cleaning packs yet and haven&#x27;t researched the cost, but I&#x27;ll jump that hurdle when I get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pleased with my Braun CoolTec shaving system...........after learning how to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through multiple electric shavers since my first shaver was handed down to me from my dad when my beard just started coming in at the ripe old age of 8...ok maybe 15.  That first shaver was awesome, it signified my transition to manhood, but it was ultimately a heaping pile of junk and soon replaced with a regular razor as it just did not give as close or as quick a shave.  Since then every shaver I&#x27;ve had was not able to compete with a razor on quickness or smoothness of shave so I was skeptical when Braun offered me the chance to review the CoolTec Men&#x27;s shaver for free, but hey it&#x27;s free right, so why not give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the shaver was the price, almost $200 retail?!  It better be good for that price!  The next thing I noticed when I received my package was the bulkiness of the cleaning station (my bathroom is currently very small and I share it with my wife, enough said).  Well I set it up and let it clean the razor, it was a bit loud but pretty quick.  I then sadly used the trimmer on my epic beard I had grown over Movember, which was oddly satisfying for my wife, and was pleased with the smoothness and effectiveness of the trimmer.  I was also impressed with the weight and feel of the shaver in my hand, it felt very comfortable and solid, like if I dropped it on the tile it would be fine, not the cheap light plastic feel I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok the trimmer works great, that&#x27;s nice but not terribly surprising.  I flipped on the cooling feature of the razor since it is the cornerstone of the product and began my shave.  The cooling kicked in almost immediately and provided a marked difference to the feel of the shaver against my skin.  It was refreshing and kept my skin from sticking to the shaver and my hair from getting pulled.  The fact that the shaver was also freshly cleaned was noticeable as well, it kept the blades very smooth and lubricated, unlike any electric shaver I had experienced previously, even when freshly cleaned with a third party lubricating agent.  The shave went relatively fast and I did not find myself needing to go over many areas repeatedly, except for a few small trouble areas.  Once the shave was complete I was honestly amazed with how close and smooth of a shave I had received from an electric shaver.  I would say it was about 95% as good as the best manual razor I&#x27;ve used, which was miles ahead of any other shaver I have experienced previously, and there was almost no irritation, which again, was unexpected and impressive.  Next came cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver was a cinch.  The head pops right off and is easily rinsed, as is the shaver itself.  Putting the head back on was just as easy and popping it on the cleaning station for a fresh, complete clean was a snap, much easier than other razors that you need to disassemble piece by piece, then lubricate with a spray or other third party agent, then most likely next time you use will need to apply a pre-electric shave gel or other prepping agent.  Not that you couldn&#x27;t do that with the CoolTec shaver but I really don&#x27;t see a need to.  Storing the razor safely is easy with the travel case and docking station provided.  Storing the cleaning station is a bit more of a challenge as the cleaning agent in the system can spill if it is tilted too much, but the plug and cord detach which is good for storage and I found a nice spot under my sink to set the system until next time.  I would definitely recommend using the cleaning station after every use to get the closest, smoothest shave out of your Braun CoolTec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was completely amazed with the quality of shave and ease of use of the Braun CoolTec shaver and my expectations, low as they were, were far exceeded.  I would say this shaver gave the best electric shave I have ever experienced.  That being said I still think using a quality manual razor is faster and gives a slightly cleaner shave, although thecost of replacements can be steep and will eventually exceed the cost of this system if you require frequent shaving for your job or other reason.  I won&#x27;t be putting away my razors just yet but for travelling and for a quick touch up the Braun CoolTec Shaver is miles ahead of other shavers if you can get over the price and have a little bit of storage under your sink!  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver through a promotion that was offered through Braun itself. I initially was very skeptical of a shaver that cools the skin, because my thinking was that heat would works better. After all it is known as a hot shave and not a cold one. I was quite surprised though to find that not only does it offer an incredible shave but the cooling actually reduces irritation and at appears to create smoother skin. The cold does take a little while to get used to though. The self cleaning aspect makes this a perfect product to maintain.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been a devout user of a manual razor ever since I started shaving in my late teenage years. I have tough facial hair and like the smooth closeness that I am able to achieve using my manual razor. I‚Äôve tried a few electric shavers in the past, but have never been impressed by the results. When I received an offer to try the CoolTec via a program run by Braun, I thought there was no harm in trying the product out. The Braun CoolTec‚Äôs main selling point is that it has a cooling bar, which is meant to minimize redness, burning, and skin irritation from shaving. Does it work? Yes and no. It has some advantages but they are unfortunately outweighed by the negatives, which have made me go back to my manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I found that the Braun CoolTec delivers on its promises regarding the active cooling technology, cleaning system, and comfortable design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFRESHINGLY COOL&lt;br /&gt;The cooling bar definitely works and added a level of refreshing comfort to my skin which I had never experienced before. Unlike electric razors that I have tried in the past, it did not pinch my skin or pull my hair. The combination of the cooling bar and the lubricated blades helped the razor glide across my skin effortlessly. This is a great product for anyone who has sensitive skin or suffers from razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is extremely easy and allows for a refreshing experience even after repeated uses. The razor is accompanied by a base which serves as a charger and cleaning station. This keeps the product clean and lubricated. It is also easy to rinse the razor in the sink since it comes with a easily detachable head. The maintenance on this product is therefore quite minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO GRIP&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, I was very impressed by the design of the razor. It is compact, modern-looking, and easy-to-grip. The handle fits easily in my hand and the razor contours to the shape of my face effortlessly. Because of its compact size, it is easy to carry along when travelling and comes with a sleek travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I found that the Braun CoolTec failed to deliver when it came to closeness of the shave and efficiency ‚Äì two factors that matter most to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT CLOSE ENOUGH&lt;br /&gt;I have tough facial hair and am accustomed to a clean, close shave with my manual razor. I found it very challenging to get a similar level of closeness in my shave using the Braun CoolTec even after going over the same areas several times. Likewise, no matter how I maneuvered the device, I was left with stray hair below my jaw line and neck, which I ultimately had to clean up using a manual razor. Furthermore, when I tried shaving on a some short stubble, there were minimal results because the hair was not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT FAST ENOUGH&lt;br /&gt;I had expected that in comparison to a manual razor, the electric razor would be allow me to complete my shave more quickly because no shaving creams were required and the cooling bar allowed for effortless gliding across my skin. However, because I found myself having to go over the same areas (particularly on the neck) several times in order to get a clean shave, it actually took me almost 10 minutes longer to complete my shave using the Braun CoolTec. I couldn‚Äôt really afford to spend this extra time in the mornings before work, especially when the results were subpar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I think the preference for choice of shaving device is highly dependent upon the user. Manual vs Electric, Wet vs Dry, etc. The choices in the market are vast. I think I‚Äôm just one of those men who prefers a classic wet shave with shaving lotion and a manual razor. I cannot get a smoother results by any other method. I think the Braun CoolTec is an innovative product and will definitely be loved by a lot of individuals, especially those with sensitive skin that suffer from irritation. I tried very hard to give this product a chance and used it continually for three weeks to see if I would get accustomed to it, but the performance did not meet my standards.</li>
            <li> Love it and would buy it again. Thats about it. yep yep yep it is a great shaver would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good shaving...fine days...</li>
            <li> Inferior product...Does not shave facial hair from face even after numerous&lt;br /&gt;Strokes..very disappointing..am returning.  Very pricey and not up to standard.</li>
            <li> It is a very cool shaving on summer.&lt;br /&gt;Very good and I love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;The clean system is good at clean the shaving and use it very faster to clean</li>
            <li> Awesome design for holding.  Love the cool tec feel. Got cleaning and charging station...very effective. Won&#x27;t go back to razors!</li>
            <li> What I can say? I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love it, very smooth. Now since I have it, I think that the cooling technology is useless. But anyway the product is great. 4 Stars, only because you don&#x27;t need the cooling system.</li>
            <li> Get a cool close shave! Have a series 7 it gives a great shave but the Cool Tec doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck!</li>
            <li> Worst hunk of garbage I&#x27;ve ever used. This thing doesn&#x27;t do what it should. It takes me 20 min of swearing trying to shave hair that it will not cut. I&#x27;ve even bought a new head right away thinking maybe the head that came with it was just bad. I was wrong this does not cut. Leave a lot of hair that it will never cut so I end up using my bic</li>
            <li> actually, he loves it</li>
