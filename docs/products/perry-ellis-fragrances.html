            <li>Smells great, husband loved it</li>
            <li>even our kids tell him he smells good when he is wearing it.</li>
            <li>Smells goods and a good price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, this is a fine fragrance from Perry Ellis (it truly is!), but I give it two stars because Amazon is selling some crappy batch.</li>
            <li>and I love smelling it on him...</li>
            <li>is okay</li>
            <li>but it is not as strong as i remember in the store.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>This cologne is probably best for a date due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last forever but does smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice parfume, smells really good..fresh</li>
            <li>I love the clean, fresh, and aquatic vibe this scent gives off.</li>
            <li>Despite its longevity issues, I&#x27;d still highly recommend Perry Ellis Aqua cologne for the amazing smell alone.</li>
            <li>Smells good enough to wear but didn&#x27;t make it into my rotation.</li>
            <li>Not bad .the</li>
            <li>Would be good to wear for work or other occasions where you don&#x27;t want a super strong scent.</li>
            <li>a mix of aquatic (hints the name) and a fresh clean type smell.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was super diluted alcohol with water.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li>Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very averse to strong odors.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this fragrance, it is very soft yet manly.</li>
            <li>and recently I&#x27;ve bought it from Amazon, and I got a good bottle with the normal scent.</li>
            <li>it s not so strong from far away</li>
            <li>but I do two out of respect for the cologne, because I really like it!</li>
            <li>and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..</li>
            <li>Smell manly and modern,</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..</li>
            <li>but it doesnt last long before u need to spray some more.</li>
            <li>Used this cologne for a few years, love it.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, at least this fragrance wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelming to others.</li>
            <li>And the problem is not that it is some knock off version because I (who have bougth several of these before) examined the bottle and it seemed pretty legit.</li>
            <li>I smelled this at Macys and fell in love with it, however they only sell the small bottles, but I&#x27;m glad I found it on here because it probably would&#x27;ve been more expensive at Macys anyway.</li>
            <li>I sprayed almost the whole content of the bottle on me in one week just to get enough scent.</li>
            <li>Or maybe those are really old colgnes.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last too much.  </li>
            <li>and, like I said, I got a good bottle, but this last I bought two weeks ago came exactly as described by those other bad reviews</li>
            <li>: it came watered down and it really doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>so much I wear a little bit myself sometimes.</li>

            <li> I sprayed almost the whole content of the bottle on me in one week just to get enough scent. It seemed like it was super diluted alcohol with water.  I am very disappointed to say the least and I am not buying this product again. Zero &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; for this product. I&#x27;m giving One &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance and great delivery service!</li>
            <li> Smells good enough to wear but didn&#x27;t make it into my rotation.</li>
            <li> Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li> Nice parfume, smells really good..fresh</li>
            <li> Great. Just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and quality cologne. Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Smells great, husband loved it and I love smelling it on him... Smell manly and modern, even our kids tell him he smells good when he is wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this fragrance, it is very soft yet manly. It doesn&#x27;t last long but I&#x27;m very averse to strong odors. It&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t smell it at all. It is one of those colognes you gotta get close to the person in oder to perceive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem and the reason I am now writing a review is because I&#x27;ve bought it in several places before and recently I&#x27;ve bought it from Amazon, and I got a good bottle with the normal scent. Except the last one I got thru Amazon came with no scent at all!&lt;br /&gt;There are other reviews (and those have been there for a while) of people complaining how they got a watered down version of some sort. I ignored them because I had tested this cologne before and bought the fragrance here and, like I said, I got a good bottle, but this last I bought two weeks ago came exactly as described by those other bad reviews: it came watered down and it really doesn&#x27;t smell at all. And the problem is not that it is some knock off version because I (who have bougth several of these before) examined the bottle and it seemed pretty legit. I think the problem might be with some batch of bad colognes Amazon has. Maybe they&#x27;re being cheap and buy bad colognes that Perry Ellis gives them at a discounted price or something. Or maybe those are really old colgnes. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, this is a fine fragrance from Perry Ellis (it truly is!), but I give it two stars because Amazon is selling some crappy batch. And so, I should give one but I do two out of respect for the cologne, because I really like it!</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne, but I wish it lasted longer. Very nice quality fragrance that is not that known about. I love the clean, fresh, and aquatic vibe this scent gives off. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t even get 3 hours of use without having to reapply. On a positive note, at least this fragrance wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelming to others. Would be good to wear for work or other occasions where you don&#x27;t want a super strong scent. Despite its longevity issues, I&#x27;d still highly recommend Perry Ellis Aqua cologne for the amazing smell alone.</li>
            <li> The cologne seemed water down. It has the Perry Ellis smell but it doesnt last long before u need to spray some more.</li>
            <li> Not bad .the cap is falling off  and I like the smell&lt;br /&gt;But it s not so strong from far away&lt;br /&gt;.. Thant you alot</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Love it and a lot less expensive than department store. Will order again when runs out. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very smooth smelling cologne! !!</li>
            <li> perfect gift for the hubs!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Son but I like to scent so much I wear a little bit myself sometimes.</li>
            <li> Used this cologne for a few years, love it.</li>
            <li> I feel like i got cheated the smell is okay but it is not as strong as i remember in the store. Like it is watered down. and the smell it self is a little off.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis Aqua gets four stars. The cologne smells wonderful......a mix of aquatic (hints the name) and a fresh clean type smell. The only problem with it is that the scent sticks close to your skin. Within 1 to 2 hours you can only smell it from putting your nose within a couple inches from the applied area. This cologne is probably best for a date due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last forever but does smell amazing!</li>
            <li> excelent, everything was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
            <li> five minutes after you pour on, the smell is gone i think is diluted x 20</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last too much.  Seems like water with a litthe hint of cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells goods and a good price</li>
            <li> I smelled this at Macys and fell in love with it, however they only sell the small bottles, but I&#x27;m glad I found it on here because it probably would&#x27;ve been more expensive at Macys anyway. Great Buy!!!</li>
