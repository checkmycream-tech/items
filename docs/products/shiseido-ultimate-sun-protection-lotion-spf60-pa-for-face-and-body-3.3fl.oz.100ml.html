            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is really effective, my wife has been using it for a while</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the very best sun protection product you can buy.</li>
            <li>what kind of day I use this product alone or under my makeup.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but this one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>what you pay. :)</li>
            <li>This sunblock lotion is light and effective.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this product does do its job with sun protection</li>
            <li>Men are attracted to women with healthy skin and vice versa.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this for many years</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is not oily...</li>
            <li>more water based.  </li>
            <li>Tried many different product before but this is the best.</li>
            <li>best japanese skin brand i would trust.</li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen for almost three years now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on</li>
            <li>I have tried so many sun screens...</li>
            <li>I just gently wash it off at night with a good cleanser, and I have no issues.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive and greasy skin and all of the sun screen protection I&#x27;ve used before caused a lot of irritation and even greasier skin appearance plus they didn&#x27;t offer good sun protection even when tried the SPF 100.</li>
            <li>ACCURATELY IS ATTACHING TO THE CUSTOMER</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel comfortable and moist.</li>
            <li>Feels really smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and truly works to save your skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Feels silky smooth going on and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This has been a very protective sun lotion for me, and the lotion goes on very easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>after reading so many positive reviews i went on a ahead.</li>
            <li>very easy to spread on skin, not thick at all.</li>
            <li>If you care about your facial skin and want good sun protection -- this is SPF 60 --</li>
            <li>this is about the only good product.</li>
            <li>Being a beach addict, I have used several (if not all) sun proctectors, some did a fair job</li>
            <li>The smell is a tad strong when you first apply it, but it&#x27;s not bad, and quickly subsides.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it absorbs quickly leaving a radiant but not greasy skin appearance.</li>
            <li>I love this sun protection because its not very greasy and its really nice to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen for everyday use over moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But is it worth the price?</li>
            <li>yes, but its well worth it.</li>
            <li>I guess they have a right.</li>
            <li>Great production, use it daily, use sparingly and will last  for months.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely non-greasy feeling, and has a slight, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several kinds, which all made my face even more oily.</li>
            <li>I am a really avid sunscreen user.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and soft-</li>
            <li>First off I am a sunscreen junkie, I do not like tans</li>
            <li>The Shiseido sunscreen offers a very good sun protection, I am brown and brown people tend to tan easily with only a few minutes under the sun.</li>
            <li>I think so, but I still think they overcharge too much for this.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it goes on really silky like, and doesn&#x27;t make me look oily.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a real plus with antioxidant in it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking forever for the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; of sunscreens- one that absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and gross, and lasts on my skin for the day...</li>
            <li>I could feel the hot sunlight beating down on my face as when im out in the golfcourse, and i feel secure knowing</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But one bottle lasted me about two months of daily usage on my face, arms, chest, and neck, so I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I have been wearing sunblock everyday since I was in my teens, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive for sure, but I&#x27;m more likely to put it on than other stuff that&#x27;s cheaper but more</li>
            <li>Living in Texas and having to deal with the hot heat in the summer, I  felt this product was a tad thick, creating that whiteness during application and just too strong in scent while you&#x27;re sweating.  </li>
            <li>bother to put on and less comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>During the summer time especially the UV index is very high since the sun is closer to the earth</li>
            <li>Defintely the best sunscreen lotion I&#x27;ve tried -- and the only one I dare put on my bad, sensitive face.</li>
            <li>and it is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and leaves no white cast.</li>
            <li>No tearing up when it is applied near the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also purchased two bottles (possibly a coincidence) where it was very watery often times needing a lot of shaking before it can be applied or it has separated in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and wears well with PUR minerals makeup when not needed for heavy activity.</li>
            <li>Felt different then the one I usually use, more towards yellow/orange</li>
            <li>According to my wife, this product is highly recomended for asian skins.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need to put on too much.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after a day of golfing, my skin is well protected and it barely gets a tan since the sunscreen was doing its job of blocking out the harmful rays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure not all customers have experienced the same thing, but after giving this fairly expensive sunscreen a few tries, I see little reason to give it another chance.</li>
            <li>My mother in law has dry skin and only uses this sunscreen because it makes her skin very moisturized and protected.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure not all customers have experienced the same thing, but after giving this fairly expensive sunscreen a few tries, I see little reason to give it another chance.</li>
            <li> My mother in law has dry skin and only uses this sunscreen because it makes her skin very moisturized and protected.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, but this was very hard to cleanse away without scrubbing (not a preferred method of mine, pulling at the skin and such).</li>
            <li> and she introduced it to me, I did&#x27;t want to use it at first because I consider it to be expensive but was really amazed how it helped me not to get sunburned after continous hours of sun exposure</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but the bottle will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> but you can get the same result with a cheaper price tag and minimal scent to not irritate my nose and skin.</li>
            <li> I read it deflects UV rays unlike the other sun blocks that take in the UV rays and break it down in the skin making you feel cooler and not so suffocated and hot like the heavy lotion of drug store brands.</li>
            <li> The only inconvenience is that it is quite expensive but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight white layer, but I was unconcerned about that just because it stays on so well while in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> For a similar sunscreen (around the same price, equally difficult to clean off, still smooth, but less watery and less unpleasant smell)</li>
            <li> The price might be a little \\&quot;uhhh\\&quot; but we are talking per diem here one bottle lasts me anywhere between 3-4 months (face only).  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but well worth it if you care about your skin.</li>
            <li> I used this on my cruise in the Caribbean and didn&#x27;t even get slightly pink.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy nor thick and provides a lot of coverage.  </li>
            <li> I came across this and read all the reviews from other women.</li>
            <li> and I would not use any other sunblock on my face.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to work for me as someone who works outside and sweats a lot in the summer months.</li>
            <li> This is less of a \\&quot;sun lotion\\&quot; than it is a \\&quot;sun cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even get tan a little, plus</li>
            <li> it does not have that terrible sun screen smell that most do!</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep for the amount and how often you will need to reapply the lotion.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars if it is priced a little lower...</li>
            <li> I usually wait about 5-10 minutes after applying this stuff to put makeup on.    </li>
            <li> I usually go to play 18 holes of golf with a friend</li>
            <li> this is the only one doesnt make my eyes uncomfortable, so it is still my favorate.</li>
            <li> My wife has a delicate skin and cannot get too exposed</li>
            <li> DUH.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and watery, which I think helps it absorb extremely well.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> If you are on the market for a sunscreen this is it, seriously.</li>
            <li> the product is really poor, it did not protect my skin at all, after I used this product, there are two sun spots appears in my skin.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Every other sun screen I have used burns your eyes and smells terrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I had to say anything that was slightly bad about this product it would be that I can&#x27;t always tell</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does to job and it is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. Every morning I just put this on and done. No need for moisturizer or anything. It makes my skin feel comfortable and moist.</li>
            <li> Great production, use it daily, use sparingly and will last  for months.  Will purchase again or until I find something better!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen. it&#x27;s not heavy nor thick and provides a lot of coverage.  The bottle lasted a year with daily usage!</li>
            <li> Defintely the best sunscreen lotion I&#x27;ve tried -- and the only one I dare put on my bad, sensitive face. But is it worth the price? I think so, but I still think they overcharge too much for this. I guess they have a right. If you care about your facial skin and want good sun protection -- this is SPF 60 -- this is about the only good product.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen its expensive for the size yes, but its well worth it. It absorbs fast and leaves no white cast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always known that you should use sunblock, especially on your face. I&#x27;ve used several kinds, which all made my face even more oily. So I&#x27;d end up taking it off. I came across this and read all the reviews from other women. I purchased it, when I used it I noticed that it goes on really silky like, and doesn&#x27;t make me look oily. I love this and I would not use any other sunblock on my face.</li>
            <li> I am a really avid sunscreen user. I have been looking forever for the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; of sunscreens- one that absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and gross, and lasts on my skin for the day...well, I think I found it.    This is less of a \\&quot;sun lotion\\&quot; than it is a \\&quot;sun cream\\&quot;. It is very thin and watery, which I think helps it absorb extremely well. It leaves my face smooth and soft- and if I didn&#x27;t tell anyone, they would never know I was wearing it. The smell is a tad strong when you first apply it, but it&#x27;s not bad, and quickly subsides. I usually wait about 5-10 minutes after applying this stuff to put makeup on.    Some people will say that this stuff clogs pores- I have never had any problems with that. I just gently wash it off at night with a good cleanser, and I have no issues. (I believe shiseido actually makes a cleanser for the sunscreen, though, if you want to be extra-sure)    Overall, if you like sunscreens, check this one out. Seriously. It&#x27;s amazing.  The only problem I have with it is...well, it&#x27;s expensive. But one bottle lasted me about two months of daily usage on my face, arms, chest, and neck, so I think it&#x27;s well worth what you pay. :)</li>
            <li> Shiseido makes great skin care products.  This sunblock lotion is light and effective.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive and greasy skin and all of the sun screen protection I&#x27;ve used before caused a lot of irritation and even greasier skin appearance plus they didn&#x27;t offer good sun protection even when tried the SPF 100. The Shiseido sunscreen offers a very good sun protection, I am brown and brown people tend to tan easily with only a few minutes under the sun. Well I spend about 3 hours daily under the sun and I don&#x27;t even get tan a little, plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it absorbs quickly leaving a radiant but not greasy skin appearance. The only inconvenience is that it is quite expensive but it is worth the price. I will continue buying this great product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT THE SIZE ACCURATELY IS ATTACHING TO THE CUSTOMER NEED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT RECOMMENDS WITH CONFIDENCE YOU CAN REQUEST ORDER WITHOUT PROBLEM</li>
            <li> I ordered Sun Protection Lotion SPF60, but the item arrived as SPF38, and I  could not contact the seller. the product is really poor, it did not protect my skin at all, after I used this product, there are two sun spots appears in my skin.</li>
            <li> Felt different then the one I usually use, more towards yellow/orange</li>
            <li> I have been wearing sunblock everyday since I was in my teens, and this is my favorite.  It is a bit pricey, but the bottle will last for a long time.  This is a great price, and I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with sunscreens and have tried many different brands. Shiseido Ultimate sun protection lotion spf60 works wonder. It&#x27;s not sticky nor streaky. Feels really smooth on my skin. And it&#x27;s a real plus with antioxidant in it. I love this product and will continue buying it!!</li>
            <li> Being a beach addict, I have used several (if not all) sun proctectors, some did a fair job but this one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. It is really effective, my wife has been using it for a while and she introduced it to me, I did&#x27;t want to use it at first because I consider it to be expensive but was really amazed how it helped me not to get sunburned after continous hours of sun exposure My wife has a delicate skin and cannot get too exposed and I gotta say it does the and splendid job. According to my wife, this product is highly recomended for asian skins.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! it does not have that terrible sun screen smell that most do! In Addition it does not burn your eyes. Every other sun screen I have used burns your eyes and smells terrible. This sunscreen feel nice, light and makes your skin smell good! The fact that I dont have burning eyes when I use it is also a plus! I use this on my kids as well.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the very best sun protection product you can buy. It goes on smooth and truly works to save your skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have received this sun product in a sun kit I got online. Even though it&#x27;s not a shocker since it is Shiseido, I still don&#x27;t like the fact the product smells too perfume-y.  Living in Texas and having to deal with the hot heat in the summer, I  felt this product was a tad thick, creating that whiteness during application and just too strong in scent while you&#x27;re sweating.  I am sure this product does do its job with sun protection but you can get the same result with a cheaper price tag and minimal scent to not irritate my nose and skin.</li>
            <li> This has been a very protective sun lotion for me, and the lotion goes on very easily and smoothly.  It is absolutely non-greasy feeling, and has a slight, pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s expensive for sure, but I&#x27;m more likely to put it on than other stuff that&#x27;s cheaper but more bother to put on and less comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis.  Sometimes I just put them on after I washed my face when I don&#x27;t have time to put on moisturizer!  It works well with my skin and it&#x27;s very easy to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and it smell very nice!</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but well worth it if you care about your skin. I usually go to play 18 holes of golf with a friend and I always use this one. During the summer time especially the UV index is very high since the sun is closer to the earth DUH. I noticed after a day of golfing, my skin is well protected and it barely gets a tan since the sunscreen was doing its job of blocking out the harmful rays. If your skin gets tanned, that is your skin trying to protect itself and also when your skin gets tanned, that means your skin is already damaged and its trying to defend itself by getting darker. When using this sunscreen sufficiently, the skin never gets tanned. I could feel the hot sunlight beating down on my face as when im out in the golfcourse, and i feel secure knowing I have this to protect my beautiful face, and arms. Men are attracted to women with healthy skin and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Number One facial protection from the sun. No tearing up when it is applied near the eyes. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use on my face. Works well in tropical sun.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this for many years and I love the fact that it is not oily...more water based.  It lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need to put on too much.  Well worth the price! Shiseido has the best products!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and should be used every day! I love this sun protection because its not very greasy and its really nice to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and well packed.</li>
            <li> My mother in law has dry skin and only uses this sunscreen because it makes her skin very moisturized and protected.</li>
            <li> Tried many different product before but this is the best. after reading so many positive reviews i went on a ahead. very happy i did. very easy to spread on skin, not thick at all. and it keep my skin moist just enough but breathable. best japanese skin brand i would trust.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, but this was very hard to cleanse away without scrubbing (not a preferred method of mine, pulling at the skin and such). I&#x27;ve also purchased two bottles (possibly a coincidence) where it was very watery often times needing a lot of shaking before it can be applied or it has separated in the bottle. The smell is unpleasant. I&#x27;m sure not all customers have experienced the same thing, but after giving this fairly expensive sunscreen a few tries, I see little reason to give it another chance. For a similar sunscreen (around the same price, equally difficult to clean off, still smooth, but less watery and less unpleasant smell) I suggest MD Solar Sciences sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it while in Hawaii and Thailand. I was very impressed by it&#x27;s ability to stay one while swimming, boarding, and lounging. It does leave a slight white layer, but I was unconcerned about that just because it stays on so well while in and out of the water. Great product!</li>
            <li> First off I am a sunscreen junkie, I do not like tans so I put this on no matter what kind of day I use this product alone or under my makeup. I have been using this sunscreen for almost three years now and absolutely love it.  It has a nice powdery finish that leaves your skin feeling really smooth, it is also good for those who have oily skin too!  The price might be a little \\&quot;uhhh\\&quot; but we are talking per diem here one bottle lasts me anywhere between 3-4 months (face only).  If you are on the market for a sunscreen this is it, seriously.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for everyday use over moisturizer. Feels silky smooth going on and lasts all day. I used while at Myrtle Beach, SC and had great protection even while in the sun when I forgot my hat.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this lotion on my skin but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to work for me as someone who works outside and sweats a lot in the summer months. I can&#x27;t stop and reapply all the time which is what I think will be needed to stay protected. It&#x27;s light and wears well with PUR minerals makeup when not needed for heavy activity. The price is a little steep for the amount and how often you will need to reapply the lotion. I read it deflects UV rays unlike the other sun blocks that take in the UV rays and break it down in the skin making you feel cooler and not so suffocated and hot like the heavy lotion of drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this review by saying I&#x27;m a red head.  Yup, the sun is to me as it is to a vampire, poof!  I used this on my cruise in the Caribbean and didn&#x27;t even get slightly pink.  My freckles didn&#x27;t even come out!  I love the way it goes on and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say anything that was slightly bad about this product it would be that I can&#x27;t always tell where I&#x27;ve already applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a case of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many sun screens...this is the only one doesnt make my eyes uncomfortable, so it is still my favorate. I would give 5 stars if it is priced a little lower...</li>
