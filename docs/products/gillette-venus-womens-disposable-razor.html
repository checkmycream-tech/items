            <li>I liked the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice change of pace.  </li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t be buying them again because they break very easily.</li>
            <li>The blades feel nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin Disposable Women&#x27;s Razors are the best disposable razors I have found to date.</li>
            <li>And you get MANY nice, close, no nick shaves with one razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaver did an incredible job, no bumps, and super smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>The water was good, though, because I needed it to clean off my razor (9001 times...</li>
            <li>Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight.</li>
            <li>And the handle is nice and the blade is great and all, but I have been getting a lot of razor burn and stubble after using even brand new ones...strange.</li>
            <li>and I love these.</li>
            <li>I am sure I have bought them before.</li>
            <li>You can save even more $$$.</li>
            <li>These razors look classier that the cheap disposables, so they&#x27;re nice to have on hand for guests.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would order the mens&#x27; version again, after these blades wear out :)</li>
            <li>Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely.</li>
            <li>Love that they are pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone talks about how they love these</li>
            <li>These glide so smoothly that I almost never get cut!  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>My regular razors have been discontinued so with all the great reviews I thought these would be a good substitute.</li>
            <li>a male, I am hesitant to say where I use this item, but it is the best razor for trimming you know where that I have found.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>i have to add more words to submit my review.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>With four blades it contours better.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin nice and smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely.</li>
            <li>I think the ones with the replaceable heads are probably better, but these suit my needs.</li>
            <li>Inconsistent Quality but better than most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It might be better for someone else.</li>
            <li>At the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li>These work best, in my opinion, when you have not shaved after several days.  </li>
            <li>They cut through much better than the products made for men.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>love these when I travel.  </li>
            <li>Work great for disposable razors, I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>They do such a good job, stay sharper longer, and are on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>An easy handle to grip, too.  </li>
            <li>They do get all the hairs in one pass, and glide easily across skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use</li>
            <li>Razors work fine.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer strip, they last forever.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light and flimsy and they don&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li>I guess they get the job done, but they don&#x27;t get your legs silky smooth.</li>
            <li>razor gives an extremely smooth shave job, and I didn&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
            <li>Cheap razors that gave me razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth for shaving as I am used to</li>
            <li>These do not shave smooth at all.</li>
            <li>The feel of this razor in your hand is comfy and secure.  </li>
            <li>I have cut myself with these and don&#x27;t find them as comfortable as others.</li>
            <li>These razors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as smooth as a Noxema Razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for awhile now and it is good for those who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>perfect short term replacement for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved the best out of all I have used&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have liked more glide on them, so perhaps the next time I buy a kit, it will be the ones with the goop on the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and colorful.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality for disposable razors and cute pink color.  </li>
            <li>very sensitive and very inexpensive... good service too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this was a great price but loved the convenience of quantity purchase of product I&#x27;ve previously used versus visiting a local Walmart.</li>
            <li>and I can shave quickly without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast too!</li>
            <li>but well worth it</li>
            <li>Love these for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of disposables, these are the ones that work the best without irritating.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another kind next time around.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about these razors.</li>
            <li>but so worth it</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I shaved pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Since these are a personal care item, I don&#x27;t feel safe using them.</li>
            <li>They are the first affordable razors that I have found that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not use them more than once which is the key.</li>
            <li>works pretty darn</li>
            <li>Love the product and again it comes automatically now to my home and saves me going to store just open and store.</li>
            <li>Soooooo much better than my last ones.</li>
            <li>The pink Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin are great for skin which is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up when a family member (who does stuff like this often) banged on the door</li>
            <li>i usually buy the fusion with the soap on it but figured i would try this one out since it was a good price</li>
            <li>I have found my new shaver!!</li>
            <li>thought i might only give one star due to the overwhelming response to my smooth stilts and the flocks of men i have to shoo, and the odorless environment created in the sexy-made-by-venus pits of my arms, but then realized i would just be another dude with no peter interested in me without it.  </li>
            <li>sure these razors might work a little easier for others who are experienced or at least not trying to shave stealthily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li>just kidding, but it was a lot of times) when it filled up with hair as well as extra smoothness on my shaving area.</li>
            <li>These almost feel like a real razor that you can then throw away and replace.</li>
            <li>razor arrived in a timely manner very neatly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;being</li>
            <li>It works, it cuts hair and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I am very prone to razor bumps/burn on my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>i have to be fast when in the shower</li>
            <li>I adore Venus razors, and having the ability to buy a big package of disposables was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my other razor made me smooth like butter this one seemed like the cheap daily disposable one SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I love the price because they are way more expensive in stores</li>
            <li>My wife is a huge fan of Venus razors, so I ordered this set for her, but immediately we noticed that the size of the head was different then with her first try of the razor, she was cut, then she tried another razor, same thing happened.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these on a subscribe and save plan.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the other Gillette Venus razors that are not for sensitive skin work better.</li>
            <li>I normally get her the ones with the replaceable heads vs. the disposable...</li>
            <li>They also last a while so they are worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This leaves my extremely sensitive skin very soft with a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I did try to go the budget route and try out a similar generic version at Target, but the blades rusted really quickly!</li>
            <li>no annoying nicks or cuts like other disposables.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to do it stealthy (because I never shave, so that would bring questioning to the family members I live with) in a bathtub...</li>
            <li>I bought these because I could not find the new Divine replacement heads now that they have changed all of their packaging.  </li>
            <li>As far as disposable razors go, I have super sensitive skin, and these are the only ones I can use without my legs looking like I attempted a botched amputation.</li>
            <li>I get a pretty smooth shave from these razors, only a few rare cuts, with no subsequent redness or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Too sensitive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how many times you are supposed to use these, but I use them for a month and have no issues with dullness at the end of the month.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d think $2.30~ per razor is fine too, as they last a long time.</li>
            <li>Razors are ok, it seems like they get dull after a shave or two</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for buying the multi-part pivoting disposables instead of the old one-piece molded ones.</li>
            <li>5 blades moistureizer and all a sensitive skin girl is looking for.  </li>
            <li>Lasts about triple the time of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Lasts about 3x that of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have two lil ones under 2 yrs old</li>
            <li>Not at all for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>and my skin&#x27;s not even that sensitive.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a pack of three, which was considerably cheaper than buying in stores.</li>
            <li>And buying theme here is considerably cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li>but wow what a find for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Personally I find the handle to be a bit big, but the angle is just right.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great packed together with other items - nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>Actually, I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved better than I expected:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because normally I get broken out after I shave. :)</li>
            <li>right under the sharp razor part, are these softeners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to getting 4 or more shaves from my cheap Daisy razors, so I was disappointed that when I tried reusing the Venus Disposable, I had to keep going over the same spots again and again to finally get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>: Each razor is really only good for one use, which makes it an expensive disposable.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and Venus razors have never irritated me or left me with razor burn.</li>
            <li>I removed a lot of hair, but I&#x27;d say these must be pretty dull (which I actually don&#x27;t mind too much since I&#x27;m terribly afraid of shaving my bits) since I didn&#x27;t get it all that great.</li>
            <li>Especially for sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li>I received one as a promotion with my old variety, Simply Venus, and now I&#x27;ve converted to these.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough for these razors.</li>
            <li>I had used a regular razor for years and thought i just had to live with my legs covered with red bumps.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, I got a bad batch..who know, won&#x27;t buy again but love this brand so I would still say go for it ladies!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really find these work as well as some of the other razors I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>3 out of the package were super dull, had to throw away.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> And you get MANY nice, close, no nick shaves with one razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaver did an incredible job, no bumps, and super smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> The water was good, though, because I needed it to clean off my razor (9001 times...</li>
            <li> Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight.</li>
            <li> And the handle is nice and the blade is great and all, but I have been getting a lot of razor burn and stubble after using even brand new ones...strange.</li>
            <li> and I love these.</li>
            <li> I am sure I have bought them before.</li>
            <li> You can save even more $$$.</li>
            <li> These razors look classier that the cheap disposables, so they&#x27;re nice to have on hand for guests.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would order the mens&#x27; version again, after these blades wear out :)</li>
            <li> Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely.</li>
            <li> Love that they are pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone talks about how they love these</li>
            <li> These glide so smoothly that I almost never get cut!  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> My regular razors have been discontinued so with all the great reviews I thought these would be a good substitute.</li>
            <li> a male, I am hesitant to say where I use this item, but it is the best razor for trimming you know where that I have found.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  </li>
            <li> i have to add more words to submit my review.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> With four blades it contours better.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin nice and smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely.</li>
            <li> I think the ones with the replaceable heads are probably better, but these suit my needs.</li>
            <li> Inconsistent Quality but better than most.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It might be better for someone else.</li>
            <li> At the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li> These work best, in my opinion, when you have not shaved after several days.  </li>
            <li> They cut through much better than the products made for men.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> love these when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Work great for disposable razors, I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> They do such a good job, stay sharper longer, and are on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> An easy handle to grip, too.  </li>
            <li> They do get all the hairs in one pass, and glide easily across skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use</li>
            <li> Razors work fine.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer strip, they last forever.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light and flimsy and they don&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I guess they get the job done, but they don&#x27;t get your legs silky smooth.</li>
            <li> razor gives an extremely smooth shave job, and I didn&#x27;t cut myself once.</li>
            <li> Cheap razors that gave me razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Not as smooth for shaving as I am used to</li>
            <li> These do not shave smooth at all.</li>
            <li> The feel of this razor in your hand is comfy and secure.  </li>
            <li> I have cut myself with these and don&#x27;t find them as comfortable as others.</li>
            <li> These razors are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as smooth as a Noxema Razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now and it is good for those who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> perfect short term replacement for the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved the best out of all I have used&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would have liked more glide on them, so perhaps the next time I buy a kit, it will be the ones with the goop on the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and colorful.  </li>
            <li> They are good quality for disposable razors and cute pink color.  </li>
            <li> very sensitive and very inexpensive... good service too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this was a great price but loved the convenience of quantity purchase of product I&#x27;ve previously used versus visiting a local Walmart.</li>
            <li> and I can shave quickly without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast too!</li>
            <li> but well worth it</li>
            <li> Love these for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of disposables, these are the ones that work the best without irritating.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another kind next time around.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about these razors.</li>
            <li> but so worth it</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I shaved pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Since these are a personal care item, I don&#x27;t feel safe using them.</li>
            <li> They are the first affordable razors that I have found that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not use them more than once which is the key.</li>
            <li> works pretty darn</li>
            <li> Love the product and again it comes automatically now to my home and saves me going to store just open and store.</li>
            <li> Soooooo much better than my last ones.</li>
            <li> The pink Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin are great for skin which is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up when a family member (who does stuff like this often) banged on the door</li>
            <li> i usually buy the fusion with the soap on it but figured i would try this one out since it was a good price</li>
            <li> I have found my new shaver!!</li>
            <li> thought i might only give one star due to the overwhelming response to my smooth stilts and the flocks of men i have to shoo, and the odorless environment created in the sexy-made-by-venus pits of my arms, but then realized i would just be another dude with no peter interested in me without it.  </li>
            <li> sure these razors might work a little easier for others who are experienced or at least not trying to shave stealthily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> just kidding, but it was a lot of times) when it filled up with hair as well as extra smoothness on my shaving area.</li>
            <li> These almost feel like a real razor that you can then throw away and replace.</li>
            <li> razor arrived in a timely manner very neatly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;being</li>
            <li> It works, it cuts hair and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I am very prone to razor bumps/burn on my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> i have to be fast when in the shower</li>
            <li> I adore Venus razors, and having the ability to buy a big package of disposables was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my other razor made me smooth like butter this one seemed like the cheap daily disposable one SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I love the price because they are way more expensive in stores</li>
            <li> My wife is a huge fan of Venus razors, so I ordered this set for her, but immediately we noticed that the size of the head was different then with her first try of the razor, she was cut, then she tried another razor, same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these on a subscribe and save plan.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the other Gillette Venus razors that are not for sensitive skin work better.</li>
            <li> I normally get her the ones with the replaceable heads vs. the disposable...</li>
            <li> They also last a while so they are worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This leaves my extremely sensitive skin very soft with a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I did try to go the budget route and try out a similar generic version at Target, but the blades rusted really quickly!</li>
            <li> no annoying nicks or cuts like other disposables.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to do it stealthy (because I never shave, so that would bring questioning to the family members I live with) in a bathtub...</li>
            <li> I bought these because I could not find the new Divine replacement heads now that they have changed all of their packaging.  </li>
            <li> As far as disposable razors go, I have super sensitive skin, and these are the only ones I can use without my legs looking like I attempted a botched amputation.</li>
            <li> I get a pretty smooth shave from these razors, only a few rare cuts, with no subsequent redness or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Too sensitive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how many times you are supposed to use these, but I use them for a month and have no issues with dullness at the end of the month.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d think $2.30~ per razor is fine too, as they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Razors are ok, it seems like they get dull after a shave or two</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for buying the multi-part pivoting disposables instead of the old one-piece molded ones.</li>
            <li> 5 blades moistureizer and all a sensitive skin girl is looking for.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about triple the time of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 3x that of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have two lil ones under 2 yrs old</li>
            <li> Not at all for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> and my skin&#x27;s not even that sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a pack of three, which was considerably cheaper than buying in stores.</li>
            <li> And buying theme here is considerably cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> but wow what a find for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Personally I find the handle to be a bit big, but the angle is just right.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great packed together with other items - nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Actually, I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved better than I expected:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because normally I get broken out after I shave. :)</li>
            <li> right under the sharp razor part, are these softeners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to getting 4 or more shaves from my cheap Daisy razors, so I was disappointed that when I tried reusing the Venus Disposable, I had to keep going over the same spots again and again to finally get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> : Each razor is really only good for one use, which makes it an expensive disposable.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and Venus razors have never irritated me or left me with razor burn.</li>
            <li> I removed a lot of hair, but I&#x27;d say these must be pretty dull (which I actually don&#x27;t mind too much since I&#x27;m terribly afraid of shaving my bits) since I didn&#x27;t get it all that great.</li>
            <li> Especially for sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li> I received one as a promotion with my old variety, Simply Venus, and now I&#x27;ve converted to these.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough for these razors.</li>
            <li> I had used a regular razor for years and thought i just had to live with my legs covered with red bumps.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, I got a bad batch..who know, won&#x27;t buy again but love this brand so I would still say go for it ladies!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find these work as well as some of the other razors I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> 3 out of the package were super dull, had to throw away.  </li>
            <li> Due to extremely sensitive skin, these are the only disposable razors I can use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually shave, but a certain someone requested it</li>
            <li> a big dry compare to the larger one with soap enhancer</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but these razors don&#x27;t seem to give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> My mom and I even did an experiment where we kept using them to see how long they would last, she went 6 months</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strip on these razors is so large it makes them hard to manuver.  </li>
            <li> Glides like a dream and each razor lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought the six pack and they arrived open and some were partially smashed (reason for 3star)</li>
            <li> not particularly careful - other razors are always causing me nicks - no matter how careful I am.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time, unlike other disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> They tend to last longer than other brands</li>
            <li> I was very nervous around the dangerous areas (nearing my bits REAL close) and also in a confined tub with water running over my head.</li>
            <li> I have to shave over the same spots several times to get a close shave, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few razor bumps, when I normally never get any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of disposable razors for a long time</li>
            <li> We buy these on Prime for a little extra savings, and I never run out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Pink color is a bonus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Just wet and shave.</li>
            <li> I have to be really careful with these</li>
            <li> I have used other types of feminine razors and to my dismay they did not workout.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Gillette seems to have changed the formula in their regular Venus razors in the past few years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about getting cold right after I shave.</li>
            <li> i literally shave my legs and half of it</li>
            <li> Nothing too special or too bad about them.</li>
            <li> If I shave a little too soon the sharpness can work against me and I bleed.</li>
            <li> i grab two and shave my legs fast no worries about cutting or razor burn .</li>
            <li> Because the head breaks off at the narrow part where it pivots, there&#x27;s no way to fix it</li>
            <li> Close shave just be prepared to toss a few after 1 use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I started buying these a few years ago after the originals made my legs ITCH for about 30-45 min after a shower.</li>
            <li> and I have had trouble with razors in the past.</li>
            <li> The blades start getting a little dull after 2-3 weeks or so, but it still beats out a lot of others in the market.</li>
            <li> Also, the blade does not come into contact with the skin very well, a bad design.  </li>
            <li> No more nicks or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this type anymore</li>
            <li> Or at least don&#x27;t have people banging on a bathroom door.</li>
            <li> but seriously I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> recommend these razors hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> i was def WRONG</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> but it is what I ordered and razors are expensive anyways.</li>
            <li> They are TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> These were the worst razors I have ever bought.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nice way to stay stocked</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THESE BEFORE BUT COULDN&#x27;T FIND THEM TIL NOW. I like how good they cut without harm to your skin and does a good job good price and shipping.</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  Especially for sensitive skin types.  I have very sensitive/dry skin.  And these do not bother me at all.  Arrived very fast too!</li>
            <li> Hard to find this type anymore but these are just the ones I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors over the years and these are the best.  I have NEVER cut myself while using these razors - even when I have been in a hurry and not particularly careful - other razors are always causing me nicks - no matter how careful I am.  Love, Love, Love these razors!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I will ever use.  Never cuts and does a nice job.  Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Best Razors around. and a great price for them.</li>
            <li> My g/f and I love these. Expensive but well worth it</li>
            <li> Venus are, in my opinion, the best razors out there. Great moisturizer strip, they last forever.</li>
            <li> My fiance likes them.  I guess they work!</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but these razors don&#x27;t seem to give me a very close shave. I am sure I have bought them before. And the handle is nice and the blade is great and all, but I have been getting a lot of razor burn and stubble after using even brand new ones...strange.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as good as I was expecting. They&#x27;re light and flimsy and they don&#x27;t give a close shave. I guess they get the job done, but they don&#x27;t get your legs silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife is a huge fan of Venus razors, so I ordered this set for her, but immediately we noticed that the size of the head was different then with her first try of the razor, she was cut, then she tried another razor, same thing happened. I ended up having to go buy her more off the shelf at Target!</li>
            <li> very sensitive and very inexpensive... good service too.</li>
            <li> Love these for my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s a close shave on my legs and I never have the irritated skin after, even when I use these longer than I should.  We buy these on Prime for a little extra savings, and I never run out.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of disposables, these are the ones that work the best without irritating.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife. She loves the Venus razors. I highly recommend getting these on a subscribe and save plan. You can save even more $$$.</li>
            <li> very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I get a pretty smooth shave from these razors, only a few rare cuts, with no subsequent redness or skin irritation. Personally I find the handle to be a bit big, but the angle is just right. These razors look classier that the cheap disposables, so they&#x27;re nice to have on hand for guests. However, I won&#x27;t be buying them again because they break very easily. If I accidentally drop one or someone knocks it off our shower shelf, nine times out of ten it breaks. Because the head breaks off at the narrow part where it pivots, there&#x27;s no way to fix it and it goes in the trash. I&#x27;ve been using other brands of disposable razors for a long time and I don&#x27;t ever remember one breaking from a fall to the shower floor. I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for buying the multi-part pivoting disposables instead of the old one-piece molded ones. Now I keep the razor on the floor of the shower so no one bumps it while reaching for the shampoo. When I use up this batch of razors, I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Now this is a razor!  5 blades moistureizer and all a sensitive skin girl is looking for.  Oh yeah!  it is the perfect razor for me and my daughter.  we do like these.</li>
            <li> I got a 3-pack for $3.50 (Managers discount) at my grocery store, so value was in mind - not the girly color. Although I&#x27;d think $2.30~ per razor is fine too, as they last a long time. Good investment! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives an extremely smooth shave job, and I didn&#x27;t cut myself once. There&#x27;s no burning feeling after shaving, either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order the mens&#x27; version again, after these blades wear out :)</li>
            <li> a big dry compare to the larger one with soap enhancer</li>
            <li> The product arrived already opened. Since these are a personal care item, I don&#x27;t feel safe using them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this was a great price but loved the convenience of quantity purchase of product I&#x27;ve previously used versus visiting a local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> For me I happened upon these razors while shopping and decided to give them a try. Actually, I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved better than I expected:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely. No cuts or nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Lasts about triple the time of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Love that they are pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> i usually buy the fusion with the soap on it but figured i would try this one out since it was a good price i was def WRONG it does nothing for my hair i literally shave my legs and half of it&#x27;s still there my other razor made me smooth like butter this one seemed like the cheap daily disposable one SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Best razors ever! I always end up nicking my legs while shaving because I&#x27;m always in a hurry! These are amazing! These didn&#x27;t cut me once and I shaved pretty quick. The blades feel nice and smooth! I would def. recommend these razors hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> Work great for disposable razors, I was happily surprised. I will definitely purchase again once I run out of them.</li>
            <li> Everyone talks about how they love these but seriously I don&#x27;t get it. I have very sensitive skin and the other Gillette Venus razors that are not for sensitive skin work better. Maybe, I got a bad batch..who know, won&#x27;t buy again but love this brand so I would still say go for it ladies!!</li>
            <li> These glide so smoothly that I almost never get cut!  An easy handle to grip, too.  I appreciate that with my carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> Updated.   Pros All the above plus, 4. Don&#x27;t always need soap or shave gel or cream,  Cons,  If I shave a little too soon the sharpness can work against me and I bleed. I have to remember which way to shave Sometimes I need shave gel or cream for the best results. Especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> The pink Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin are great for skin which is sensitive. My skin is sensitive. The packaging was great packed together with other items - nothing was broken. I have used other types of feminine razors and to my dismay they did not workout. But the shape of this one is different.  It glides along my legs without leaving red makes.</li>
            <li> Look no further! Gillette Venus Sensitive Skin Disposable Women&#x27;s Razors are the best disposable razors I have found to date.</li>
            <li> I love these. These are the only razors I use! I love the price because they are way more expensive in stores</li>
            <li> My regular razors have been discontinued so with all the great reviews I thought these would be a good substitute. They are TERRIBLE. They slide all over my leg when I use shaving cream and the shave itself isn&#x27;t close at all. I feel like I need to shave my legs again by the end of the day. I&#x27;d never buy these again, and am actually considering writing to the company to complain.</li>
            <li> The best disposables out there. Very happy with how it feels on my skin as well as how it shaves.</li>
            <li> Pros: Great for a one-time shave. And I Iove how the razor glides over curves and knees without nicking my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Each razor is really only good for one use, which makes it an expensive disposable. I&#x27;m used to getting 4 or more shaves from my cheap Daisy razors, so I was disappointed that when I tried reusing the Venus Disposable, I had to keep going over the same spots again and again to finally get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually shave, but a certain someone requested it so I went ahead and got these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to do it stealthy (because I never shave, so that would bring questioning to the family members I live with) in a bathtub...&lt;br /&gt;last night I trimmed my forest of hair, today I shaved. I used shampoo and conditioner (I don&#x27;t have shaving cream) to lubricate the area. The area I shaved is my &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; area. I removed a lot of hair, but I&#x27;d say these must be pretty dull (which I actually don&#x27;t mind too much since I&#x27;m terribly afraid of shaving my bits) since I didn&#x27;t get it all that great. I was very nervous around the dangerous areas (nearing my bits REAL close) and also in a confined tub with water running over my head. The water was good, though, because I needed it to clean off my razor (9001 times... just kidding, but it was a lot of times) when it filled up with hair as well as extra smoothness on my shaving area. I pretty much gave up when a family member (who does stuff like this often) banged on the door (they later said they did that just to see if anyone was in there), that startled me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these razors might work a little easier for others who are experienced or at least not trying to shave stealthily. Or at least don&#x27;t have people banging on a bathroom door.</li>
            <li> I use these razors as my permanent razors.  They last a long time, unlike other disposable razors.  These almost feel like a real razor that you can then throw away and replace.</li>
            <li> razor arrived in a timely manner very neatly packaged.&lt;br /&gt;being a male, I am hesitant to say where I use this item, but it is the best razor for trimming you know where that I have found.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  They are the first affordable razors that I have found that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I do not use them more than once which is the key.</li>
            <li> thought i might only give one star due to the overwhelming response to my smooth stilts and the flocks of men i have to shoo, and the odorless environment created in the sexy-made-by-venus pits of my arms, but then realized i would just be another dude with no peter interested in me without it.  been buying these for years.  works pretty darn tootin&#x27; good for ladies of all ages.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Work great for the price</li>
            <li> Used these for years, good price</li>
            <li> Razors work fine. Nothing too special or too bad about them. Would have liked more glide on them, so perhaps the next time I buy a kit, it will be the ones with the goop on the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find these work as well as some of the other razors I&#x27;ve used before. I have to shave over the same spots several times to get a close shave, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few razor bumps, when I normally never get any. Guess they don&#x27;t work as well for me as they do for others. I will be buying another kind next time around.</li>
            <li> great price for the product</li>
            <li> These were the worst razors I have ever bought. I liked the price but I got what I paid for.  Cheap razors that gave me razor burn.  Boo.</li>
            <li> It works, it cuts hair and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  i have to add more words to submit my review.  woot!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t cut but may have to re-shave to get everything</li>
            <li> I had used a regular razor for years and thought i just had to live with my legs covered with red bumps.  It turns out I don&#x27;t.  This shaver did an incredible job, no bumps, and super smooth legs.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This razors were a great value.  I prefer the Venus razors that have 4 blades.  With four blades it contours better.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to razor bumps/burn on my legs and underarms. These razors do a great job of not causing me cuts, nicks or the bumps. I received one as a promotion with my old variety, Simply Venus, and now I&#x27;ve converted to these. They do get all the hairs in one pass, and glide easily across skin.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strip on these razors is so large it makes them hard to manuver.  Also, the blade does not come into contact with the skin very well, a bad design.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have found my new shaver!! No more nicks or razor burn.  Glides like a dream and each razor lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This was like a 4 billion pack, I will still be using these in 2027</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin nice and smooth after a shave. Which is good- because normally I get broken out after I shave. :)</li>
            <li> good deal but I&#x27;m not crazy about these razors. Not as smooth for shaving as I am used to</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now and it is good for those who have sensitive skin.  :)</li>
            <li> Friend recommended these so decided to give them a try. I was not sure what to expect, yet these have proved the best out of all I have used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shaves my legs and underarm areas closely and safely. No cuts or nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Pink color is a bonus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Lasts about 3x that of my old brand of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Good razors for a good price.</li>
            <li> These do not shave smooth at all.</li>
            <li> These are convenient to use and work well.  I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> these r good for me i have to be fast when in the shower have two lil ones under 2 yrs old so dont have time to waiste these for me r pricey but so worth it i grab two and shave my legs fast no worries about cutting or razor burn . ive been using these for yrs but found them here cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my guest room basket.  They are good quality for disposable razors and cute pink color.  would buy again</li>
            <li> Easy to use and colorful.  It is very light weight.</li>
            <li> These are good for disposables. I think the ones with the replaceable heads are probably better, but these suit my needs. I have pretty sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have any problems with ingrown hairs or it drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I could not find the new Divine replacement heads now that they have changed all of their packaging.  Thought these would be comparable but they&#x27;re not at all.  Don&#x27;t shave close and do not give me the same amount of moisture on the strip as the divine did.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Inconsistent Quality but better than most. Close shave just be prepared to toss a few after 1 use.</li>
            <li> Not at all for sensitive skin...and my skin&#x27;s not even that sensitive.</li>
            <li> I adore Venus razors, and having the ability to buy a big package of disposables was fantastic.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a pack of three, which was considerably cheaper than buying in stores. As far as disposable razors go, I have super sensitive skin, and these are the only ones I can use without my legs looking like I attempted a botched amputation.</li>
            <li> Too sensitive! I guess my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough for these razors. I feel like I have to go over the same spot 2-3 times. I&#x27;m going back to my guy&#x27;s gillette razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 33 now). I have very sensitive skin and Venus razors have never irritated me or left me with razor burn. I&#x27;m a lifer for sure!</li>
            <li> 3 out of the package were super dull, had to throw away.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I gets the job done. I think the handle is a bit too bulky for what me. It might be better for someone else.</li>
            <li> Due to extremely sensitive skin, these are the only disposable razors I can use. They work extremely well. And buying theme here is considerably cheaper than in the store. I bought the six pack and they arrived open and some were partially smashed (reason for 3star)</li>
            <li> I have used these type of razors before and I have to use foam to shave my arms and legs. A number of months ago at Walgreens, I found this Gillette Venus that was $11 on sale. Pricey, but wow what a find for me. You do not have to use any cream or foam when you shave. At the top and the bottom. right under the sharp razor part, are these softeners. When you shave, even under your arms, there are no nicks or cuts and razor burn. I will have to go to Walgreens and see if they still have it. It is worth the money. It has lasted all those months.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used. No need for soap or anything. Just wet and shave. Good good razor that lasts  weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife as she will only use the VENUS.  I normally get her the ones with the replaceable heads vs. the disposable... but the price was just too good to pass up.  Ironically, I like these too.  I will often switch between Schick Hydro, Gillette Fusion and these... it&#x27;s a nice change of pace.  The blades are spaced further apart.  These work best, in my opinion, when you have not shaved after several days.  They cut through much better than the products made for men.</li>
            <li> Gillette razors are the best and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Great item, shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Razors are ok, it seems like they get dull after a shave or two but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> The feel of this razor in your hand is comfy and secure.  Whatever formula they put in the strip doesn&#x27;t irritate my legs or underarms.  And you get MANY nice, close, no nick shaves with one razor.  Great shaves, great value, just a great razor.</li>
            <li> These work great! I have sensitive skin and they don&#x27;t irritate. They also last a while so they are worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Gillette seems to have changed the formula in their regular Venus razors in the past few years. I started buying these a few years ago after the originals made my legs ITCH for about 30-45 min after a shower. I have no issue with these. I did try to go the budget route and try out a similar generic version at Target, but the blades rusted really quickly! No thank you.... sticking with name brand! Amazon also has the best deal - look for coupons and try out subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> I only use the disposable razors when I travel, which is often.  I have to be really careful with these or I cut myself.  I think the blades are not as flexible as the razor I have at home.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 5 years, I prefer the disposable because I travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to worry about losing a $10 razor. They are good quality and very effective. I&#x27;m not sure how many times you are supposed to use these, but I use them for a month and have no issues with dullness at the end of the month. My mom and I even did an experiment where we kept using them to see how long they would last, she went 6 months, I gave up at 3.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite disposable razors.  They tend to last longer than other brands and I can shave quickly without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I have had trouble with razors in the past. I love these guys! They do such a good job, stay sharper longer, and are on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I have cut myself with these and don&#x27;t find them as comfortable as others.</li>
            <li> expensive but it is what I ordered and razors are expensive anyways. It did take awhile to receive it in the mail, but I did get it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and again it comes automatically now to my home and saves me going to store just open and store.</li>
            <li> These razors are fantastic. I don&#x27;t worry about getting cold right after I shave. I don&#x27;t have to deal with razor burn anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying these in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. This leaves my extremely sensitive skin very soft with a very close shave. It&#x27;s the only razor I use now.</li>
            <li> These razors are great!  Just tried them out this morning and I loved them.  Soooooo much better than my last ones.</li>
            <li> love these when I travel.  perfect short term replacement for the real thing.  no annoying nicks or cuts like other disposables.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thought it was five blades but does work well.</li>
            <li> Does not get a close enough shave for me. I don&#x27;t feel as smooth as a Noxema Razor.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Price and product were a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love these! I shave every day and these continually give me a close shave. The blades start getting a little dull after 2-3 weeks or so, but it still beats out a lot of others in the market.</li>
