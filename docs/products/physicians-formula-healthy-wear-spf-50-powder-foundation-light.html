            <li>I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>good like!</li>
            <li>This foundation goes on beautifully, and *stays put</li>
            <li>daughter has a very fair complexion with quite a lot of freckles - which I find charming, but she does not.</li>
            <li>Not just a summer product great during winter with some moisturizer underneath.  </li>
            <li>Great price though.</li>
            <li>Great for people who burn or freckle.  </li>
            <li>I use this product all summer without a foundation; sometimes use it over a sunscreen;  it does a great job</li>
            <li>Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li>And, because of the great SPF, she uses it in place of sunscreen on her neck and d√©colletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neither of us has ever gotten sunburned while wearing this, and we spend a great deal of time in the sun watching my son play baseball.</li>
            <li>Happy with spf, but don&#x27;t rely on it for sun protection.</li>
            <li>Great powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is great, and at a steal of a price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d better not stop making this!!</li>
            <li>My skin is very light so this shade is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation and the person who sent it was great !</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, nice texture, and great SPF protection.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very cute, attractive, sturdy case.</li>
            <li>Because the color is very light, good for very fair skin.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect and goes on smooth, almost invisible and not cakey.</li>
            <li>Now I use everday minerals in fair neutral</li>
            <li>The product is good.  </li>
            <li>, I was concerned that it could be to fair for my skin, but it isn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product, high level of protection and a great Price!</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in stores anymore, so I was happy to find this online until I can find an alternative, although I don&#x27;t think anything will match.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t easily look caked or unnatural the way many SPF powder foundations do  Leaves skin looking flawless   </li>
            <li>I really really love this!</li>
            <li>Still love this powder!</li>
            <li>I love this powder!</li>
            <li>I wear it every day and have for years - love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this product!</li>
            <li>I started using this powder a couple of years ago and love it!</li>
            <li>but this is just amazing.</li>
            <li>This is great to get light coverage.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels nice after application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the cotton kind would build up the makeup like that.</li>
            <li>I do think to call it a foundation on its own</li>
            <li>is kind of misleading</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>and it covers it nicely without causing any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>, my skin is highly reactive and cannot handle a lot of sunscreens, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>For your information: Light is very light, great for porcelain skin tones.    </li>
            <li>When I tried this Healthy Wear SPF 50 powder foundation, I was thrilled, and have continued to be thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>but this is great if im in a hurry to just put on quickly for some medium coverage.</li>
            <li>In terms of color, I am fair skined and this shade was fine.  </li>
            <li>Smooth  Good coverage  </li>
            <li>Good thing is they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>While providing excellent sun protection, it&#x27;s far cooler than using sunscreen lotion</li>
            <li>I use this as I feel it gives better coverage than application with one of my own powder</li>
            <li>So far the best affordable choice there is!</li>
            <li>Formula Healthy Wear Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 50, Fair to Light 7067, 1 oz.]] to set it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and live in Florida.</li>
            <li>Not chalky at all just one of my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know I&#x27;m getting sunscreen coverage, but the powder is a bit chalky for my taste.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50.</li>
            <li>Favorite powder ever, had to start looking in eBay since this color isn&#x27;t on amazon anymore.</li>
            <li>It just leaves your face really matte without looking powdery/ghostly, great coverage even with no foundation and love the spf 50.</li>
            <li>and so the translucent is perfect for me, especially since I wear it over foundation.</li>
            <li>, it seems more like a tinted powdered sunscreen if anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have not had many issues with clogged pores either.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for quite some time and love it for my oily skin and for its SPF of 50.  </li>
            <li>It may be more my shade in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, love the exterior look of the compact and that the powder is spf 50.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation powder.  </li>
            <li>I can wear this powder instead of foundation many days.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation powder.</li>
            <li>Simply, the best!</li>
            <li>it would look okay.</li>
            <li>but I need and plan to order more to stock up while I still can.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to locate it here.  </li>
            <li>This is OK.  </li>
            <li>Nice, smooth powder.</li>
            <li>so I think is more for the light/fair/pink skin tones.</li>
            <li>Love the price</li>
            <li>It is a great idea and the price was certainly reasonable.</li>
            <li>Build able coverage, never melts or feels like a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>IMO it&#x27;s better than Clinique powder foundation as well as Body Shop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am totally in love with this. :)</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>excellent ratings from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database</li>
            <li>The color is just right for my fair but spotty skin.  </li>
            <li>It covers better than the $40 lancome and clinique liquids I&#x27;ve tried, and blends much more easily too.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out, and it came in a duo pack with a bronzer for fair skin.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE that it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was recommended by the Environmental Working Group as a safe and effective product and by golly, they were right.</li>
            <li>It has no orange or yellowness to it either, so it is a very true</li>
            <li>This is a great powder because it has great coverage and the SPF 50 is hard to find.</li>
            <li>This powder is very light, that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>After applying my pale skin matching foundation, I put a layer of this over the top and it gave the PERFECT tan!</li>
            <li>(I have a light / medium complexion that tans easily ) .Then</li>
            <li>Foundations should go on smooth with a brush and blend easily over the face.  </li>
            <li>It is light and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>It does not cake or gather in fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is really finely milled and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought  translucent light</li>
            <li>so it was important that I find something that matched my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for anyone that needs to reapply sunscreen without ruining their makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the light</li>
            <li>It is too compressed on the compact making it not so smooth to pick up on the sponge.</li>
            <li>BY FAR one of the best sunscreens available, and at a completely acceptable price.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for light coverage with sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Light coverage.</li>
            <li>I would say light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>The ingredients do give a good broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the quality of it, it goes on smooth and no white or funky residue, and leaves a natural looking finish.</li>
            <li>This is the first powder that doesn&#x27;t make me look even more paler than I am.</li>
            <li>I have normal-to-day skin and this Healthy Wear SPF 50 foundation has been the only powder foundation I have ever been able to use without it being even more drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Came in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Meaning, someone has taken the compact out of its original box/packaging, slipped it in a padded envelope, and shipped it.  </li>
            <li>Where is the original Physicians Formula box/packaging?  </li>
            <li>While they don&#x27;t recommend only wearing SPF powder for sun protection, there are so many physical UV blockers in this powder that I layer it over my foundation or sunscreen and am adequately protected from the sun, skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li>Avene Eau Thermale High Protection Tinted Compact SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; also very good quality and same protection</li>
            <li>It evens skin out nicely, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old, and have never had nice skin.  </li>
            <li>(I have read very good reviews): &#x27;&#x27;Colorescience Colorescience Sunforgettable Shimmer SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; in Fair Color, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford this right now.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost too light for me right now (during the summer).  </li>
            <li>have a very fair but almost ruddy complexion, and one layer of this foundation covers the red, evening my skin tone out completely.</li>
            <li>Does not make me break out      For those looking for adequate sun protection, these numbers speak for themselves:     </li>
            <li>I would not wear this as a foundation rather just a quick powder sunscreen for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I still have to powder my oily nose from time to time ~ but the foundation maintains smooth coverage, and is FAR better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li>on easily, feels light, and wears well all day with minimal touch-ups needed.(I do not typically wear foundation, so I cannot give a good review on coverage or cosmetic quality, sorry)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke out in a huge itchy rash all over where I used it (including my eyes which also got really puffy).</li>
            <li>This looks more natural as the day continues and yet keeps providing protection.</li>
            <li>Having used this cosmetic, I didn&#x27;t think I could return it nor was the effort even worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this was a mineral product, as I have been diligently searching a true broad spectrum (SPF-UVB, PPD-UVA) powder sunscreen I can easily just brush on alone or over makeup and GO.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a light coverage powder with a high SPF.</li>
            <li>color is much lighter than I expected from the pictures, but it is still ok as I don&#x27;t apply very much on top of my foundation or SPF30 cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use in the mornings and provides decent coverage.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect for a pale cave dweller such as myself.</li>
            <li>great sun protection without the use of greasy hard to apply lotions and creams</li>
            <li>Towards the end of my first one, the clasp broke, but it&#x27;s plastic and the powder was almost gone</li>
            <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s SPF 50, which is just about the only way I&#x27;ll put on sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this exact item at Dollar Tree, of course, it was one dollar.</li>
            <li>I have tried several mineral make-up lines and most of those contain bismuth oxychloride.  </li>
            <li>The product came from AZ liquidators, but this is the exact site I bought it from.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty white/chalky looking.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering and my husband says it isn&#x27;t noticeable by others, but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li>I believe they have several more.</li>
            <li>the powder arrives exactly as you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li>but it made me break out after the first time</li>
            <li>Plus the compact is just adorable (the photo shows it red and orange</li>
            <li>I first found this foundation on Amazon, but bought it at Target.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought I would like it...  </li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I think, and though they haven&#x27;t been tested by the FDA for SPF, they are titanium oxide and zinc oxide based, so they&#x27;re a good substitute for that if any pale ladies are still looking for a semi-sun protecting powder.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for an easy compact powder foundation easy to apply with decent coverage especially since I live in FL&#x27;s hot and humid rainy climate .  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a makeup powder that had a high SPF protection, there is a very good option for far more expensive than this one</li>
            <li>Colorevolution 100% Natural Full Coverage Mineral Foundation, Toffee, 9 Gram]]</li>
            <li>light dusting of this powder covers almost all of my natural copper freckles, and those that need a little more are easily taken care of with the use of a concealer brush to spot-apply a little more.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to buy this to add on top of my made-up face so that I don&#x27;t have to take all my makeup off and reapply it if I needed extra sunscreen throughout the day (I have melasma and live in a very sunny area!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it only for the high SPF, but will not be purchasing any more physician&#x27;s formula products.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came in a slightly darker color for the summer.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell how much powder is needed for adequate SPF protection</li>
            <li>It never gets greasy, doesn&#x27;t settle into pores, has never caused a single itch or pimple, and it provides as much coverage (or better) than any liquid sold of a comparable price.</li>
            <li>Esthetically, it really does rival a non SPF powder   </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>I really hope the SPF 50 is for real cause</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the brush though</li>
            <li>very unattractive.    </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well, but when I use it my skin reacts with it and it smells very metallic.</li>
            <li>Also the texture isn&#x27;t great, but I was willing to look past that for extra uv protection and a color matched powder.</li>
            <li>but it looks very</li>
            <li>It covers for many hours, but you can&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage.  </li>
            <li>It seems the whole disc will come out at some point</li>
            <li>How do I really know this stuff has SPF 50?</li>
            <li>it really has no color.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I do find that mid-day I have to use oil absorbing powder as I can have oily skin</li>
            <li>At this age, I still have a very greasy T-zone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased and liked Physicians Formula products in the past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Shiesido pressed powder sunscreen for years, and this is half the price, more water resistant, etc.  </li>
            <li>With doctors, dermatologists and even the skin cancer foundation urging people on having adequate sun protection, this is an ultimate gem.</li>
            <li>We all know that the sun is a main contributor to find lines and nobody likes age spots.     </li>
            <li>It kept my face from getting burned, matched my skin color really well, and even though I have very sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>So, as both a foundation and a sunscreen, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I ony bought this for the high SPF.  </li>
            <li>a little more pricey but no smell.</li>
            <li>This product is great for those who wear make up everyday and don&#x27;t want to ruin it w/ conventional sunscreen ( spray or lotion) .</li>
            <li>and it actually looks fresh even after 8 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and one of the very few (or the only one?)</li>
            <li>The cute little pink puff gets full of make up fast though and requires you to clean it every other day to prevent the puff and the powder itself from getting an oily shine on it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product u wont feel sorry for trying it cause it did really protect my skin from sun damage even that I live in a hot country, your appearance will be a little gray if your skin is light brown like me</li>
            <li>The product is described as &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;in box&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Translucent looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I actually finished the first one, and who ever finishes a compact?</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or allergies watch out for the applicator!</li>
            <li>I have very pale skin, and this color looks very cheap and yellowish on my skin.  </li>
            <li>, how am I supposed to know if It was new or old.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t look fake, just choose the right tone for you.</li>
            <li>The color is a little light but wearing it during the winter was not a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pale, but I&#x27;m not tan either.  </li>
            <li>plus it gives a natural look.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t tell how much product it was actually picking up,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how much sun protection it actually provides.</li>
            <li>I have a few light freckles</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes me look like I&#x27;m naturally an NC25 (I know this because I went to MAC for something</li>
            <li>It covers flaws well,controls oil,yet somehow does not dry out your skin or make you look older.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I just threw it away and continued to search for a good foundation.  </li>
            <li>Light is for extremely pale porcelain skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s very white which made me look whiter than normal.</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California and i have to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>With this foundation, I have the serious coverage I need and, overall, a much more youthful looking</li>
            <li>added, so I am using this alone directly over my Olay Regenerist Serum and even though sometimes I&#x27;m out in the sun several hours, I have not burned using this with no other</li>
            <li>This is the only powder I can find with such a high spf.</li>
            <li>I constantly read makeup and skin product reviews by professional makeup artists/dermatologists and came across this recommendation.</li>
            <li>At first I bought the translucent medium and it oxidized and became too dark and orangey within 10 minutes of application .</li>
            <li>or we&#x27;re just extra sensitive.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually pink where the red is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in translucent medium purely by accident.</li>
            <li>Does not control oil very well on my extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li>But, it is very difficult to get the powder on the sponge, the sponge breaks apart when trying to get a good amount of the powder on the sponge.</li>
            <li>I have photosensitive dermatitis, and this stuff really helped me get less sun.</li>
            <li>I am very very fair-skinned and the translucent is perfect!!There is no better powder than this in the history of the world in my opinion.</li>

            <li> This foundation goes on beautifully, and *stays put</li>
            <li> daughter has a very fair complexion with quite a lot of freckles - which I find charming, but she does not.</li>
            <li> Not just a summer product great during winter with some moisturizer underneath.  </li>
            <li> Great price though.</li>
            <li> Great for people who burn or freckle.  </li>
            <li> I use this product all summer without a foundation; sometimes use it over a sunscreen;  it does a great job</li>
            <li> Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li> And, because of the great SPF, she uses it in place of sunscreen on her neck and d√©colletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither of us has ever gotten sunburned while wearing this, and we spend a great deal of time in the sun watching my son play baseball.</li>
            <li> Happy with spf, but don&#x27;t rely on it for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Great powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is great, and at a steal of a price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d better not stop making this!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very light so this shade is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation and the person who sent it was great !</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, nice texture, and great SPF protection.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very cute, attractive, sturdy case.</li>
            <li> Because the color is very light, good for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect and goes on smooth, almost invisible and not cakey.</li>
            <li> Now I use everday minerals in fair neutral</li>
            <li> The product is good.  </li>
            <li> , I was concerned that it could be to fair for my skin, but it isn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product, high level of protection and a great Price!</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find it in stores anymore, so I was happy to find this online until I can find an alternative, although I don&#x27;t think anything will match.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this foundation.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t easily look caked or unnatural the way many SPF powder foundations do  Leaves skin looking flawless   </li>
            <li> I really really love this!</li>
            <li> Still love this powder!</li>
            <li> I love this powder!</li>
            <li> I wear it every day and have for years - love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I started using this powder a couple of years ago and love it!</li>
            <li> but this is just amazing.</li>
            <li> This is great to get light coverage.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels nice after application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the cotton kind would build up the makeup like that.</li>
            <li> I do think to call it a foundation on its own</li>
            <li> is kind of misleading</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> and it covers it nicely without causing any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> , my skin is highly reactive and cannot handle a lot of sunscreens, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> For your information: Light is very light, great for porcelain skin tones.    </li>
            <li> When I tried this Healthy Wear SPF 50 powder foundation, I was thrilled, and have continued to be thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> but this is great if im in a hurry to just put on quickly for some medium coverage.</li>
            <li> In terms of color, I am fair skined and this shade was fine.  </li>
            <li> Smooth  Good coverage  </li>
            <li> Good thing is they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> While providing excellent sun protection, it&#x27;s far cooler than using sunscreen lotion</li>
            <li> I use this as I feel it gives better coverage than application with one of my own powder</li>
            <li> So far the best affordable choice there is!</li>
            <li> Formula Healthy Wear Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 50, Fair to Light 7067, 1 oz.]] to set it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and live in Florida.</li>
            <li> Not chalky at all just one of my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to know I&#x27;m getting sunscreen coverage, but the powder is a bit chalky for my taste.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50.</li>
            <li> Favorite powder ever, had to start looking in eBay since this color isn&#x27;t on amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> It just leaves your face really matte without looking powdery/ghostly, great coverage even with no foundation and love the spf 50.</li>
            <li> and so the translucent is perfect for me, especially since I wear it over foundation.</li>
            <li> , it seems more like a tinted powdered sunscreen if anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not had many issues with clogged pores either.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for quite some time and love it for my oily skin and for its SPF of 50.  </li>
            <li> It may be more my shade in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, love the exterior look of the compact and that the powder is spf 50.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation powder.  </li>
            <li> I can wear this powder instead of foundation many days.  </li>
            <li> I love this foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Simply, the best!</li>
            <li> it would look okay.</li>
            <li> but I need and plan to order more to stock up while I still can.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to locate it here.  </li>
            <li> This is OK.  </li>
            <li> Nice, smooth powder.</li>
            <li> so I think is more for the light/fair/pink skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love the price</li>
            <li> It is a great idea and the price was certainly reasonable.</li>
            <li> Build able coverage, never melts or feels like a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> IMO it&#x27;s better than Clinique powder foundation as well as Body Shop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am totally in love with this. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> excellent ratings from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database</li>
            <li> The color is just right for my fair but spotty skin.  </li>
            <li> It covers better than the $40 lancome and clinique liquids I&#x27;ve tried, and blends much more easily too.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out, and it came in a duo pack with a bronzer for fair skin.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE that it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was recommended by the Environmental Working Group as a safe and effective product and by golly, they were right.</li>
            <li> It has no orange or yellowness to it either, so it is a very true</li>
            <li> This is a great powder because it has great coverage and the SPF 50 is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This powder is very light, that&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> After applying my pale skin matching foundation, I put a layer of this over the top and it gave the PERFECT tan!</li>
            <li> (I have a light / medium complexion that tans easily ) .Then</li>
            <li> Foundations should go on smooth with a brush and blend easily over the face.  </li>
            <li> It is light and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> It does not cake or gather in fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is really finely milled and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought  translucent light</li>
            <li> so it was important that I find something that matched my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for anyone that needs to reapply sunscreen without ruining their makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the light</li>
            <li> It is too compressed on the compact making it not so smooth to pick up on the sponge.</li>
            <li> BY FAR one of the best sunscreens available, and at a completely acceptable price.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for light coverage with sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Light coverage.</li>
            <li> I would say light to medium coverage</li>
            <li> The ingredients do give a good broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of it, it goes on smooth and no white or funky residue, and leaves a natural looking finish.</li>
            <li> This is the first powder that doesn&#x27;t make me look even more paler than I am.</li>
            <li> I have normal-to-day skin and this Healthy Wear SPF 50 foundation has been the only powder foundation I have ever been able to use without it being even more drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Came in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Meaning, someone has taken the compact out of its original box/packaging, slipped it in a padded envelope, and shipped it.  </li>
            <li> Where is the original Physicians Formula box/packaging?  </li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t recommend only wearing SPF powder for sun protection, there are so many physical UV blockers in this powder that I layer it over my foundation or sunscreen and am adequately protected from the sun, skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> Avene Eau Thermale High Protection Tinted Compact SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; also very good quality and same protection</li>
            <li> It evens skin out nicely, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old, and have never had nice skin.  </li>
            <li> (I have read very good reviews): &#x27;&#x27;Colorescience Colorescience Sunforgettable Shimmer SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; in Fair Color, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford this right now.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost too light for me right now (during the summer).  </li>
            <li> have a very fair but almost ruddy complexion, and one layer of this foundation covers the red, evening my skin tone out completely.</li>
            <li> Does not make me break out      For those looking for adequate sun protection, these numbers speak for themselves:     </li>
            <li> I would not wear this as a foundation rather just a quick powder sunscreen for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I still have to powder my oily nose from time to time ~ but the foundation maintains smooth coverage, and is FAR better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> on easily, feels light, and wears well all day with minimal touch-ups needed.(I do not typically wear foundation, so I cannot give a good review on coverage or cosmetic quality, sorry)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke out in a huge itchy rash all over where I used it (including my eyes which also got really puffy).</li>
            <li> This looks more natural as the day continues and yet keeps providing protection.</li>
            <li> Having used this cosmetic, I didn&#x27;t think I could return it nor was the effort even worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a mineral product, as I have been diligently searching a true broad spectrum (SPF-UVB, PPD-UVA) powder sunscreen I can easily just brush on alone or over makeup and GO.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a light coverage powder with a high SPF.</li>
            <li> color is much lighter than I expected from the pictures, but it is still ok as I don&#x27;t apply very much on top of my foundation or SPF30 cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use in the mornings and provides decent coverage.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for a pale cave dweller such as myself.</li>
            <li> great sun protection without the use of greasy hard to apply lotions and creams</li>
            <li> Towards the end of my first one, the clasp broke, but it&#x27;s plastic and the powder was almost gone</li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s SPF 50, which is just about the only way I&#x27;ll put on sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact item at Dollar Tree, of course, it was one dollar.</li>
            <li> I have tried several mineral make-up lines and most of those contain bismuth oxychloride.  </li>
            <li> The product came from AZ liquidators, but this is the exact site I bought it from.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty white/chalky looking.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and my husband says it isn&#x27;t noticeable by others, but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li> I believe they have several more.</li>
            <li> the powder arrives exactly as you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li> but it made me break out after the first time</li>
            <li> Plus the compact is just adorable (the photo shows it red and orange</li>
            <li> I first found this foundation on Amazon, but bought it at Target.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought I would like it...  </li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I think, and though they haven&#x27;t been tested by the FDA for SPF, they are titanium oxide and zinc oxide based, so they&#x27;re a good substitute for that if any pale ladies are still looking for a semi-sun protecting powder.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an easy compact powder foundation easy to apply with decent coverage especially since I live in FL&#x27;s hot and humid rainy climate .  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup powder that had a high SPF protection, there is a very good option for far more expensive than this one</li>
            <li> Colorevolution 100% Natural Full Coverage Mineral Foundation, Toffee, 9 Gram]]</li>
            <li> light dusting of this powder covers almost all of my natural copper freckles, and those that need a little more are easily taken care of with the use of a concealer brush to spot-apply a little more.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to buy this to add on top of my made-up face so that I don&#x27;t have to take all my makeup off and reapply it if I needed extra sunscreen throughout the day (I have melasma and live in a very sunny area!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it only for the high SPF, but will not be purchasing any more physician&#x27;s formula products.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in a slightly darker color for the summer.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell how much powder is needed for adequate SPF protection</li>
            <li> It never gets greasy, doesn&#x27;t settle into pores, has never caused a single itch or pimple, and it provides as much coverage (or better) than any liquid sold of a comparable price.</li>
            <li> Esthetically, it really does rival a non SPF powder   </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> I really hope the SPF 50 is for real cause</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the brush though</li>
            <li> very unattractive.    </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well, but when I use it my skin reacts with it and it smells very metallic.</li>
            <li> Also the texture isn&#x27;t great, but I was willing to look past that for extra uv protection and a color matched powder.</li>
            <li> but it looks very</li>
            <li> It covers for many hours, but you can&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage.  </li>
            <li> It seems the whole disc will come out at some point</li>
            <li> How do I really know this stuff has SPF 50?</li>
            <li> it really has no color.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I do find that mid-day I have to use oil absorbing powder as I can have oily skin</li>
            <li> At this age, I still have a very greasy T-zone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and liked Physicians Formula products in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shiesido pressed powder sunscreen for years, and this is half the price, more water resistant, etc.  </li>
            <li> With doctors, dermatologists and even the skin cancer foundation urging people on having adequate sun protection, this is an ultimate gem.</li>
            <li> We all know that the sun is a main contributor to find lines and nobody likes age spots.     </li>
            <li> It kept my face from getting burned, matched my skin color really well, and even though I have very sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> So, as both a foundation and a sunscreen, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ony bought this for the high SPF.  </li>
            <li> a little more pricey but no smell.</li>
            <li> This product is great for those who wear make up everyday and don&#x27;t want to ruin it w/ conventional sunscreen ( spray or lotion) .</li>
            <li> and it actually looks fresh even after 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and one of the very few (or the only one?)</li>
            <li> The cute little pink puff gets full of make up fast though and requires you to clean it every other day to prevent the puff and the powder itself from getting an oily shine on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product u wont feel sorry for trying it cause it did really protect my skin from sun damage even that I live in a hot country, your appearance will be a little gray if your skin is light brown like me</li>
            <li> The product is described as &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;in box&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Translucent looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I actually finished the first one, and who ever finishes a compact?</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or allergies watch out for the applicator!</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, and this color looks very cheap and yellowish on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , how am I supposed to know if It was new or old.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t look fake, just choose the right tone for you.</li>
            <li> The color is a little light but wearing it during the winter was not a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pale, but I&#x27;m not tan either.  </li>
            <li> plus it gives a natural look.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t tell how much product it was actually picking up,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how much sun protection it actually provides.</li>
            <li> I have a few light freckles</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes me look like I&#x27;m naturally an NC25 (I know this because I went to MAC for something</li>
            <li> It covers flaws well,controls oil,yet somehow does not dry out your skin or make you look older.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just threw it away and continued to search for a good foundation.  </li>
            <li> Light is for extremely pale porcelain skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s very white which made me look whiter than normal.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California and i have to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> With this foundation, I have the serious coverage I need and, overall, a much more youthful looking</li>
            <li> added, so I am using this alone directly over my Olay Regenerist Serum and even though sometimes I&#x27;m out in the sun several hours, I have not burned using this with no other</li>
            <li> This is the only powder I can find with such a high spf.</li>
            <li> I constantly read makeup and skin product reviews by professional makeup artists/dermatologists and came across this recommendation.</li>
            <li> At first I bought the translucent medium and it oxidized and became too dark and orangey within 10 minutes of application .</li>
            <li> or we&#x27;re just extra sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually pink where the red is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in translucent medium purely by accident.</li>
            <li> Does not control oil very well on my extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> But, it is very difficult to get the powder on the sponge, the sponge breaks apart when trying to get a good amount of the powder on the sponge.</li>
            <li> I have photosensitive dermatitis, and this stuff really helped me get less sun.</li>
            <li> I am very very fair-skinned and the translucent is perfect!!There is no better powder than this in the history of the world in my opinion.</li>
            <li> very pale, verging on goth-gitl white, which is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to most sunscreens and have been searching hard for the past year or so for an affordable one that I can actually use.</li>
            <li> Colorscience&#x27;s was messy to use, and even though the SPF was high on the one from Peter Thomas Roth, I still burned even when reapplying it multiple times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizers and liquid foundations that provide this high SPF look like heavy makeup.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also very oily, but with this I have a matte finish that - even after hours of wearing it - doesn&#x27;t slide around; and yet, it doesn&#x27;t settle into small wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li> I apply it before long runs outside to up my SPF</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A tad expensive if you&#x27;re looking for just foundation (but very reasonable if looking for the high SPF).&lt;br /&gt;-Has</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pinker than I expected, and applying it to my entire face gives me an overall pink, make-up-y appearance, so I really use this as a blemish concealer under my other, yellower powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I pat this stuff on at least once a day to protect me from those intense fluorescent lights.</li>
            <li> However, the coverage is not heavy, so if you need heavy coverage this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> I hope they make this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a a long while</li>
            <li> Does not cake like similar item in other brand (Clinique).</li>
            <li> But this foundation did not live up to the standard I thought all my other Physician Plus products had.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a foundation that had a high SPF, but hardly anything went over 35.</li>
            <li> It has a high SPF and feels like I&#x27;m hardly wearing anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look dry or cakey.  </li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t highlight dry patches or flakes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of make-up on, but it does tone-down my dark spots and protects them from the sun at the same time.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;-I wish they made a loose powder version so it would be easier to apply with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before trying this, I had used P.F.&#x27;s loose mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li> A one-layer application of this foundation tones her freckles way down; a second layer makes them all but disappear, leaving her looking like a porcelain doll.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It clears my skin with in a few days of wearing and it&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but very worth it.</li>
            <li> If I must complain, the compact is thicker/bigger then I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only seen a few others complain of this in reviews</li>
            <li> You do not look like your wearing foundation if applied properly and not too heavily.  </li>
            <li> have tried other powder sunscreens (Colorscience and Peter Thomas Roth) and didn&#x27;t like either one.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer, there is a metallic smell when exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li> So, I use it for gardening so that I&#x27;m not around other people.</li>
            <li> a week of use the powder disc (I&#x27;m not sure what to call the actual make-up part of the compact) has begun to loosen from the plastic and moves a bit when I&#x27;m picking up powder with my brush or sponge.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive compared to other SPF powders and never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it in a travel bag in lieu of carrying other foundation.</li>
            <li> Maybe you can try the other colors</li>
            <li> Target no longer carries it ~ nor does any other store I&#x27;ve looked through.  </li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t make my forehead itch like other powdered foundations,</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients:   </li>
            <li> Gave me a dark ring around my face.</li>
            <li> Color was too dark for me.</li>
            <li> If anyone has recommendations for anther product that covers dark spots, please let me know.</li>
            <li> It causes a little dryness upon application, but it goes on thick enough to cover redness and blemishes, and still doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that odd .</li>
            <li> To say I am disappointed this powder is discontinued in stores is a huge understatement.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup that way.  </li>
            <li> The color is not a true translucent either.  </li>
            <li> Money wasted again.</li>
            <li> and I can sleep in this stuff because it has so few ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also have red spots, broken veins, age spots, and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> I have already wasted money trying to find something else</li>
            <li> I am afraid this is discontinued, but really hope that is not true!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too pale and pasty and doesn&#x27;t cover pores, spots etc .</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re exceptionally pale, this won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I guess if you had really pale skin</li>
            <li> I have reddish skin with a few small scars and always wear foundation.  </li>
            <li> If you think you&#x27;re pale, but drugstore foundations usually work for your skin color, I think this would as well.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they don&#x27;t have it in a light/fair shade they only have two colors beige and honey, so they are too dark for me!!</li>
            <li> I hate the shiny look sunscreens can give you, and Neutrogena&#x27;s Dry Touch line makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning as my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Next time ill go one shade darker.</li>
            <li> The only weird thing is..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it provides spf 50 coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to discern how old this product is.  </li>
            <li> This sounds crazy, but I don&#x27;t notice it until I step out into the sun, and then I instantly smell something metallic.</li>
            <li> but I soon discovered that it separated horribly and quickly on my T-zone.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to use the applicator it came with because it&#x27;s too firmly packed for the blush brush to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> I finally found something that can give me some SPF protection without feeling like I have an oil sick on my face.</li>
            <li> no packaging, the powder was worn down, and the applicator was dirty.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the purchase at all.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired of the liquid foundation routine !  </li>
            <li> That made me feel weird.  </li>
            <li> I am bronzer-stupid and always make myself look orange or dirty</li>
            <li> But it had a horrible smell that I couldn&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t cake on too bad, though I would use a foundation or BB cream underneath.</li>
            <li> Bad product.  </li>
            <li> so maybe we got a bad batch</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I asked and the producer told me that it is discontinued :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brand makes an SPF lotion, but I hate putting lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> I wear a base of sunscreen under my makeup, so I use this powder sunscreen as a touch up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use an SPF powder so that I would be reinforcing my base sunscreen layer every time I did a touch up</li>
            <li> And I keep the compact in my purse at all times to prepare for any encounters with the dreadful SUN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I constantly read makeup and skin product reviews by professional makeup artists/dermatologists and came across this recommendation. With doctors, dermatologists and even the skin cancer foundation urging people on having adequate sun protection, this is an ultimate gem. We all know that the sun is a main contributor to find lines and nobody likes age spots.     Even if you don&#x27;t care for sun protection, as a powder itself:     Smooth  Good coverage  Doesn&#x27;t easily look caked or unnatural the way many SPF powder foundations do  Leaves skin looking flawless   Esthetically, it really does rival a non SPF powder   Does not make me break out      For those looking for adequate sun protection, these numbers speak for themselves:     Active Ingredients:   4% Octinoxate - blocks UVB  21% Titanium Dioxide - physical blocker of UVA   3% Zinc Oxide - physical blocker of UVA    These percentages are humongous. While they don&#x27;t recommend only wearing SPF powder for sun protection, there are so many physical UV blockers in this powder that I layer it over my foundation or sunscreen and am adequately protected from the sun, skin looking flawless. I hate the shiny look sunscreens can give you, and Neutrogena&#x27;s Dry Touch line makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning as my skin is very sensitive. I also prefer physical UV protection over chemical ingredients like Avobenzone because they only last about 2 hours tops for sun protection while this powder will keep on protecting all day. I just touch up here and there if I sweat a bit or as hours have gone by.    For your information: Light is very light, great for porcelain skin tones.    I bought this product for Buy One Get One 50% at drugstores. Not all drugstores carry this item. MSRP is about $15.</li>
            <li> I really really love this! Ive never tried a powder foundation before but this is just amazing. I use my concealer and then this over it when I need a lot of coverage but this is great if im in a hurry to just put on quickly for some medium coverage. Not chalky at all just one of my favorite all time products especially because of that spf 50. Not just a summer product great during winter with some moisturizer underneath.  Light is for extremely pale porcelain skin. Next time ill go one shade darker. I only wish this company had options for darker skins like my mom but they give no reason why they dont when asked.  Good thing is they are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to know I&#x27;m getting sunscreen coverage, but the powder is a bit chalky for my taste. Great price though.</li>
            <li> This is my second compact. I actually finished the first one, and who ever finishes a compact? I had to order online this time because stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I love that it&#x27;s SPF 50. The store brands were SPF 12 or thereabouts, and I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough. This brand makes an SPF lotion, but I hate putting lotion on my face. My skin is very light so this shade is perfect for me. It&#x27;s not mega coverage or anything, but I don&#x27;t need that. Towards the end of my first one, the clasp broke, but it&#x27;s plastic and the powder was almost gone so I didn&#x27;t really mind. They&#x27;d better not stop making this!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t look fake, just choose the right tone for you. I really hope the SPF 50 is for real cause someday I don&#x60;t use sunscreen, just this.</li>
            <li> Great for people who burn or freckle.  My skin looks and feels nice after application. It&#x27;s a little expensive but very worth it. It comes in a very cute, attractive, sturdy case.</li>
            <li> Favorite powder ever, had to start looking in eBay since this color isn&#x27;t on amazon anymore. It just leaves your face really matte without looking powdery/ghostly, great coverage even with no foundation and love the spf 50. It&#x27;ll last for about 4 hours until you start noticing a bit of a difference. Recently started wearing porefessional (pore minimizer) and primer under it and it actually looks fresh even after 8 hours.</li>
            <li> While providing excellent sun protection, it&#x27;s far cooler than using sunscreen lotion plus it gives a natural look.  Tinted moisturizers and liquid foundations that provide this high SPF look like heavy makeup.  This looks more natural as the day continues and yet keeps providing protection.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder because it has great coverage and the SPF 50 is hard to find. The cute little pink puff gets full of make up fast though and requires you to clean it every other day to prevent the puff and the powder itself from getting an oily shine on it. I would simply replace the foam puff with a cotton one. I don&#x27;t think the cotton kind would build up the makeup like that. You can find them at the dollar store. Still love this powder!</li>
            <li> At first I bought the translucent medium and it oxidized and became too dark and orangey within 10 minutes of application . Gave me a dark ring around my face. (I have a light / medium complexion that tans easily ) .Then I bought  translucent light but it&#x27;s too pale and pasty and doesn&#x27;t cover pores, spots etc . Looks rutty on my face. Money wasted again. I&#x27;ll just use it as a sunscreen on my face when I&#x27;m hanging out in the backyard ...ALONE !  I was hoping for an easy compact powder foundation easy to apply with decent coverage especially since I live in FL&#x27;s hot and humid rainy climate .  I&#x27;m so tired of the liquid foundation routine !  I&#x27;ll have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out, and it came in a duo pack with a bronzer for fair skin. I discarded the sponge it came with and substituted the brush that came with the bronzer as I don&#x27;t like sponges. I didn&#x27;t really like the brush though, it tended to shed on me and I couldn&#x27;t tell how much product it was actually picking up, so I bought a portable kabuki brush to go with it. I carry these two items in my purse all the time. I wear a base of sunscreen under my makeup, so I use this powder sunscreen as a touch up throughout the day. I am very impressed with the quality of it, it goes on smooth and no white or funky residue, and leaves a natural looking finish. I am very fair and so the translucent is perfect for me, especially since I wear it over foundation. I do think to call it a foundation on its own is kind of misleading, it seems more like a tinted powdered sunscreen if anything.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other powder sunscreens (Colorscience and Peter Thomas Roth) and didn&#x27;t like either one. Colorscience&#x27;s was messy to use, and even though the SPF was high on the one from Peter Thomas Roth, I still burned even when reapplying it multiple times throughout the day. With this product I never have burned, even when out in the sun all day (with reapplications of course). And I LOVE that it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, my skin is highly reactive and cannot handle a lot of sunscreens, so this is perfect for me. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer, there is a metallic smell when exposed to the sun. Plus it&#x27;s very white which made me look whiter than normal. I tried it once and that was it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use in the mornings and provides decent coverage. On top of that, it&#x27;s SPF 50, which is just about the only way I&#x27;ll put on sunscreen every day. Throughout the day, though, you do have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I use this product all summer without a foundation; sometimes use it over a sunscreen;  it does a great job and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the first powder that doesn&#x27;t make me look even more paler than I am. I put it over my [[ASIN:B0039B3KNQ Physicians Formula Healthy Wear Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 50, Fair to Light 7067, 1 oz.]] to set it. I definitely like that it is also an SPF powder. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I had hoped to find an alternative to BE so I ordered this product based on the reviews I read.  I was not happy with the purchase at all.    Foundations should go on smooth with a brush and blend easily over the face.  This product does not do that.  Instead, it lays on the skin so that when you look closely in the mirror, it is obvious you have a \\&quot;powder type substance\\&quot; laying on your face....very unattractive.    I&#x27;ve purchased and liked Physicians Formula products in the past.  But this foundation did not live up to the standard I thought all my other Physician Plus products had.    Having used this cosmetic, I didn&#x27;t think I could return it nor was the effort even worth it.  Unfortunately, I just threw it away and continued to search for a good foundation.  And I found an excellent product at Amazon.com -    [[ASIN:B008GTO5TO Colorevolution 100% Natural Full Coverage Mineral Foundation, Toffee, 9 Gram]]</li>
            <li> I love this powder! It is light and goes on easy. I use a brush to apply. I apply it before long runs outside to up my SPF I have not had many issues with clogged pores either.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, unfortunately there is some material in the sponge that my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with - I broke out in a huge itchy rash all over where I used it (including my eyes which also got really puffy). If you have sensitive skin or allergies watch out for the applicator! Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> I recently used this while on vacation. It kept my face from getting burned, matched my skin color really well, and even though I have very sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I would definitely buy this again. I am very fair skinned so it was important that I find something that matched my skin tone. It also didn&#x27;t cake on too bad, though I would use a foundation or BB cream underneath.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for anyone that needs to reapply sunscreen without ruining their makeup. I work as an actress and one of the makeup artists on set recommended it to me. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light coverage powder with a high SPF. This product is perfect and goes on smooth, almost invisible and not cakey. I will be buying this powder from now on.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for quite some time and love it for my oily skin and for its SPF of 50.  Could no longer find it in the stores.  This product did come unpackaged.  The seller explained they are factory over-runs.  Have been using it for the last couple of weeks and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well, but when I use it my skin reacts with it and it smells very metallic. So, I use it for gardening so that I&#x27;m not around other people.</li>
            <li> It causes a little dryness upon application, but it goes on thick enough to cover redness and blemishes, and still doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup. It&#x27;s a little pinker than I expected, and applying it to my entire face gives me an overall pink, make-up-y appearance, so I really use this as a blemish concealer under my other, yellower powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Too cakey. Don&#x27;t know how much sun protection it actually provides.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact item at Dollar Tree, of course, it was one dollar. I also found it at Big Lots. Check around before buying this one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re exceptionally pale, this won&#x27;t work for you. If you think you&#x27;re pale, but drugstore foundations usually work for your skin color, I think this would as well. As a reference, Missha perfect no 13 bb cream is a perfect match for me. Also the texture isn&#x27;t great, but I was willing to look past that for extra uv protection and a color matched powder. Now I use everday minerals in fair neutral I think, and though they haven&#x27;t been tested by the FDA for SPF, they are titanium oxide and zinc oxide based, so they&#x27;re a good substitute for that if any pale ladies are still looking for a semi-sun protecting powder.</li>
            <li> I have normal-to-day skin and this Healthy Wear SPF 50 foundation has been the only powder foundation I have ever been able to use without it being even more drying to my skin.  It does not cake or gather in fine lines or wrinkles.  However, the coverage is not heavy, so if you need heavy coverage this may not be for you.  I have a few light freckles and they show through somewhat - but it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains no ingredients that make me itch.  I have tried several mineral make-up lines and most of those contain bismuth oxychloride.  This does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion shade is fair/medium.  I bought this in the light but it&#x27;s almost too light for me right now (during the summer).  It may be more my shade in the winter.  But it&#x27;s almost translucent when applied, so on days I don&#x27;t self tan this shade works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underneath the powder, there is a foam applicator sponge.  I use this as I feel it gives better coverage than application with one of my own powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the chemical smell of moisturizers with SPF added, so I am using this alone directly over my Olay Regenerist Serum and even though sometimes I&#x27;m out in the sun several hours, I have not burned using this with no other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this again, but probably in the next darkest shade.</li>
            <li> Came in original packaging. Love this product. Does not cake like similar item in other brand (Clinique). Because the color is very light, good for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> It evens skin out nicely, and looks natural. But, it is very difficult to get the powder on the sponge, the sponge breaks apart when trying to get a good amount of the powder on the sponge. It is too compressed on the compact making it not so smooth to pick up on the sponge. Otherwise, love the exterior look of the compact and that the powder is spf 50.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!!!!!!! Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation and the person who sent it was great !&lt;br /&gt;It clears my skin with in a few days of wearing and it&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> BY FAR one of the best sunscreens available, and at a completely acceptable price.  I&#x27;ve used Shiesido pressed powder sunscreen for years, and this is half the price, more water resistant, etc.  It&#x27;s excellent because you put it on and go.  No waiting for it to soak in and clog your pores.  Doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes for that burning sensation that won&#x27;t go away.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation powder.  I have reddish skin with a few small scars and always wear foundation.  I can wear this powder instead of foundation many days.  It gives great coverage.  I also put some on before going out in the middle of the day for the sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup that way.  I hope they make this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> The product is described as &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;in box&#x27;.  It was sent with no box, no packaging, the powder was worn down, and the applicator was dirty.  THIS WAS USED!  DISGUSTING!&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the seller there was no apology, a mailing label, and I have to pay for postage to send it back.  So I get to pay postage both ways for a USED product not at all as advertised.  The product came from AZ liquidators, but this is the exact site I bought it from.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and one of the very few (or the only one?) with SPF50 ( I&#x27;m referring to powders for oily skin especially).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I asked and the producer told me that it is discontinued :(&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a powder, not as a foundation .&lt;br /&gt;The color is much lighter than I expected from the pictures, but it is still ok as I don&#x27;t apply very much on top of my foundation or SPF30 cream.</li>
            <li> I use these for an off-label use- as sunscreen on my kids faces. The lightest color is so translucent, even boys can wear it. As a mom of a redhead, I&#x27;ve gone through about 5 of these compacts. It covers for many hours, but you can&#x27;t get it wet. This is the only powder I can find with such a high spf. I also use it on my daughters head where Her hair is parted.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation powder. It is *truly* very pale, verging on goth-gitl white, which is exactly what I need.  It has no orange or yellowness to it either, so it is a very true neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A light dusting of this powder covers almost all of my natural copper freckles, and those that need a little more are easily taken care of with the use of a concealer brush to spot-apply a little more. It blends as well as any finishing powder and doesn&#x27;t settle into the crevices or bend lines of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I can sleep in this stuff because it has so few ingredients. It never gets greasy, doesn&#x27;t settle into pores, has never caused a single itch or pimple, and it provides as much coverage (or better) than any liquid sold of a comparable price. It covers better than the $40 lancome and clinique liquids I&#x27;ve tried, and blends much more easily too. This stuff keeps my oily nose matte all day unless I&#x27;m sweating, then I just spot reapply once mid-day. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it before I can stock up!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST power/foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  Excellent coverage &amp; SPF. I wear it every day and have for years - love it!</li>
            <li> Color was too dark for me. It makes me look as though I&#x27;m wearing several  makeup shades darker than my skin tone. Too cheap,to send back. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sun protection or matching color.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that can give me some SPF protection without feeling like I have an oil sick on my face. The color is a little light but wearing it during the winter was not a problem. It would be nice if it came in a slightly darker color for the summer.</li>
            <li> Excellent size and wonderful protection for your face.  The color is also a perfect match.  Simply, the best!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to buy this to add on top of my made-up face so that I don&#x27;t have to take all my makeup off and reapply it if I needed extra sunscreen throughout the day (I have melasma and live in a very sunny area!).  I thought I could just dust it on with a blush brush.  Unfortunately, I had to use the applicator it came with because it&#x27;s too firmly packed for the blush brush to pick it up.  Also, it&#x27;s pretty white/chalky looking.  I&#x27;m not pale, but I&#x27;m not tan either.  I guess if you had really pale skin it would look okay.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  The price per ounce on the webpage ($1.87/oz) is misleading.  The net weight is .34 oz.  The price per ounce should be $26.44 if it is sold for $8.99.</li>
            <li> I am someone who needs a lot of coverage from both my foundation and my powder.I am very very fair-skinned and the translucent is perfect!!There is no better powder than this in the history of the world in my opinion.To say I am disappointed this powder is discontinued in stores is a huge understatement.I ordered 2 but I need and plan to order more to stock up while I still can.I don&#x27;t know what I will do when I can no longer purchase this product here.It has the best coverage you can get from a powder.It covers flaws well,controls oil,yet somehow does not dry out your skin or make you look older.The fact that it has 50 SPF is just icing on the cake.HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a a long while and now I cannot locate it anywhere.  Was so glad to locate it here.  I really like the coverage.  I can use is over makeup or just over my moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t look dry or cakey.  I would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> What a find! I&#x27;d been looking for a foundation that had a high SPF, but hardly anything went over 35. Then I discovered this. Hallelujah! Both my daughter and I use it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very fair but almost ruddy complexion, and one layer of this foundation covers the red, evening my skin tone out completely. My skin is also very oily, but with this I have a matte finish that - even after hours of wearing it - doesn&#x27;t slide around; and yet, it doesn&#x27;t settle into small wrinkles, either. With this foundation, I have the serious coverage I need and, overall, a much more youthful looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has a very fair complexion with quite a lot of freckles - which I find charming, but she does not. A one-layer application of this foundation tones her freckles way down; a second layer makes them all but disappear, leaving her looking like a porcelain doll. Even with two layers, there&#x27;s still no caking effect. And, because of the great SPF, she uses it in place of sunscreen on her neck and d√©colletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us has ever gotten sunburned while wearing this, and we spend a great deal of time in the sun watching my son play baseball. So, as both a foundation and a sunscreen, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t use it but why is it unboxed  , how am I supposed to know if It was new or old. no seal what so ever f</li>
            <li> I have used this bronzer for probably a year or so. It was recommended by the Environmental Working Group as a safe and effective product and by golly, they were right. Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most sunscreens and have been searching hard for the past year or so for an affordable one that I can actually use. This foundation is an absolutely perfect answer! It has a high SPF and feels like I&#x27;m hardly wearing anything. Best of all I have no rashes, burning or itching! Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on easily, feels light, and wears well all day with minimal touch-ups needed.(I do not typically wear foundation, so I cannot give a good review on coverage or cosmetic quality, sorry)&lt;br /&gt;-High SPF/Good choice for those with sunscreen allergies. Can be applied to arms, neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-Applicator sponge stores in the compact (I&#x27;ve been applying with a kabuki brush, then using the sponge for on-the-go touch-ups)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A tad expensive if you&#x27;re looking for just foundation (but very reasonable if looking for the high SPF).&lt;br /&gt;-Has a metallic smell. This sounds crazy, but I don&#x27;t notice it until I step out into the sun, and then I instantly smell something metallic. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and my husband says it isn&#x27;t noticeable by others, but just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;-After a week of use the powder disc (I&#x27;m not sure what to call the actual make-up part of the compact) has begun to loosen from the plastic and moves a bit when I&#x27;m picking up powder with my brush or sponge. It seems the whole disc will come out at some point and I&#x27;ll have to glue it back in.&lt;br /&gt;-I wish they made a loose powder version so it would be easier to apply with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I will buy this product again (and again), and I&#x27;ve told my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made this!  It was inexpensive compared to other SPF powders and never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> This does what it says.  In terms of color, I am fair skined and this shade was fine.  If I must complain, the compact is thicker/bigger then I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever.  I think they should start making it again!</li>
            <li> great sun protection without the use of greasy hard to apply lotions and creams</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a mineral product, as I have been diligently searching a true broad spectrum (SPF-UVB, PPD-UVA) powder sunscreen I can easily just brush on alone or over makeup and GO.  This is OK.  Does not control oil very well on my extremely oily skin.  The ingredients do give a good broad spectrum coverage. I would not wear this as a foundation rather just a quick powder sunscreen for my face and neck.  A bit chalky, not refined enough.  The ONLY place I could locate this item is here on Amazon, even thought when I emailed the company they said different stores carry different merchandise.  Still searching for a Holy Grail daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth powder. Happy with spf, but don&#x27;t rely on it for sun protection. Second time to buy this.</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> This is great to get light coverage. I plan to use it in a travel bag in lieu of carrying other foundation. The compact is well designed with a sponge and mirror - great for the purse!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful, and so affordable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup powder that had a high SPF protection, there is a very good option for far more expensive than this one (I have read very good reviews): &#x27;&#x27;Colorescience Colorescience Sunforgettable Shimmer SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; in Fair Color, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford this right now. There is also &#x27;&#x27;Avene Eau Thermale High Protection Tinted Compact SPF 50&#x27;&#x27; also very good quality and same protection but unfortunately they don&#x27;t have it in a light/fair shade they only have two colors beige and honey, so they are too dark for me!! This powder is very light, that&#x27;s true so I think is more for the light/fair/pink skin tones. Maybe you can try the other colors I believe they have several more. Great ingredients, nice texture, and great SPF protection. So far the best affordable choice there is! I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for light coverage with sun protection.  The only weird thing is.. the powder arrives exactly as you see in the picture.  Meaning, someone has taken the compact out of its original box/packaging, slipped it in a padded envelope, and shipped it.  That made me feel weird.  Where is the original Physicians Formula box/packaging?  What are the ingredients?  How do I really know this stuff has SPF 50?</li>
            <li> I like everything about it, I was concerned that it could be to fair for my skin, but it isn&#x27;t.. it really has no color. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product, high level of protection and a great Price!</li>
            <li> Great powder sunscreen. Blends well. No shine! Love it! Good for everyday use. Light coverage. Love the price and it compares to more expensive powder sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and I love this product!</li>
            <li> It covers well but it made me break out after the first time so I didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> You know that feeling where you want to put on sunblock, but you can&#x27;t because you&#x27;re makeup is already on? This stuff is a cure for that problem. I have photosensitive dermatitis, and this stuff really helped me get less sun. The only thing I am not jazzed about is the sponge it came with. It grabbed the liquid makeup off of my face and deposited a layer of it on the powder. I would suggest getting a pouf for it if you wear liquid foundation. Anyway, this product is great, and at a steal of a price.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a fishing trip for it&#x27;s convenience.I lhope it has not expired. I couldn&#x27;t find a date on the product.It is a great idea and the price was certainly reasonable.Are they still producing this product? I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> This works for me. I have rosecea and it covers it nicely without causing any skin irritation.  I do find that mid-day I have to use oil absorbing powder as I can have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t stop that at all.  I will stick with it.  It works.</li>
            <li> SPF 50!!! Build able coverage, never melts or feels like a liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and can now only find on Amazon and eBay. IMO it&#x27;s better than Clinique powder foundation as well as Body Shop. I&#x27;m very fair and live in Florida. This product is my best friend.</li>
            <li> I ony bought this for the high SPF.  All spfs have expiration dates, but this manufacturer does not put it on the box.  It&#x27;s impossible to discern how old this product is.  The color is not a true translucent either.  I have very pale skin, and this color looks very cheap and yellowish on my skin.  I&#x27;m keeping it only for the high SPF, but will not be purchasing any more physician&#x27;s formula products.  Bad product.  Next time, I&#x27;m sticking with another brand like PUR  even if the SPF is lower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product u wont feel sorry for trying it cause it did really protect my skin from sun damage even that I live in a hot country, your appearance will be a little gray if your skin is light brown like me but it&#x27;s not that odd . good like!</li>
            <li> I am NC15 and look transparent. I am bronzer-stupid and always make myself look orange or dirty so I&#x27;d basically given up. I wanted to use an SPF powder so that I would be reinforcing my base sunscreen layer every time I did a touch up and this was the cheapest option. Plus the compact is just adorable (the photo shows it red and orange but it&#x27;s actually pink where the red is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in translucent medium purely by accident. After applying my pale skin matching foundation, I put a layer of this over the top and it gave the PERFECT tan! It makes me look like I&#x27;m naturally an NC25 (I know this because I went to MAC for something and that&#x27;s what she put me at, and she had no idea it was the makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is really finely milled and goes on smooth. No caking, no dryness, and no settling into lines. I have very dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t highlight dry patches or flakes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally in love with this. :)</li>
            <li> It seemed to work very well the few days I used it on my beach vacation in Mexico. But it had a horrible smell that I couldn&#x27;t get past. I have only seen a few others complain of this in reviews so maybe we got a bad batch or we&#x27;re just extra sensitive. I couldn&#x27;t stand the stink so I returned and got BE mineral veil with spf instead. a little more pricey but no smell.</li>
            <li> I first found this foundation on Amazon, but bought it at Target.  Target no longer carries it ~ nor does any other store I&#x27;ve looked through.  I fear that Physicians Formula will stop making this, and I never want to use anything else!!!!!  Before trying this, I had used P.F.&#x27;s loose mineral foundation.  At first, I thought I would like it...  but I soon discovered that it separated horribly and quickly on my T-zone.  When I tried this Healthy Wear SPF 50 powder foundation, I was thrilled, and have continued to be thrilled with it.  I am 55 years old, and have never had nice skin.  At this age, I still have a very greasy T-zone.  I also have red spots, broken veins, age spots, and enlarged pores.  (YUCK)  This foundation goes on beautifully, and *stays put*.  Of course, I still have to powder my oily nose from time to time ~ but the foundation maintains smooth coverage, and is FAR better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The amount of coverage is perfect for me.  The color is just right for my fair but spotty skin.  *LOVE IT* !!!!!</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California and i have to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours. This product is great for those who wear make up everyday and don&#x27;t want to ruin it w/ conventional sunscreen ( spray or lotion) .</li>
            <li> I started using this powder a couple of years ago and love it! I have not been able to find it in stores anymore, so I was happy to find this online until I can find an alternative, although I don&#x27;t think anything will match. It is translucent so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a lot of make-up on, but it does tone-down my dark spots and protects them from the sun at the same time. I use lotion with sunscreen with it, and there is no clumping and you cannot tell you are wearing anything. I am afraid this is discontinued, but really hope that is not true! If anyone has recommendations for anther product that covers dark spots, please let me know. I have already wasted money trying to find something else and no dice yet.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this foundation.  Spf 50 is what I wanted.  Translucent looks very natural.  You do not look like your wearing foundation if applied properly and not too heavily.  I would say light to medium coverage is what to expect.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not sure if it provides spf 50 coverage.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for a pale cave dweller such as myself. I pat this stuff on at least once a day to protect me from those intense fluorescent lights. And I keep the compact in my purse at all times to prepare for any encounters with the dreadful SUN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Doesn&#x27;t make my forehead itch like other powdered foundations, excellent ratings from the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s kind of hard to tell how much powder is needed for adequate SPF protection</li>
