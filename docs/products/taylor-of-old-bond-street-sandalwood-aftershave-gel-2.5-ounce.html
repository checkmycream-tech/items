            <li>The shaving creams (croaps) are just as good as TH and almost as good as GFT.</li>
            <li>Good scent though and soothing.</li>
            <li>and you have as good a shaving experience as you can get.</li>
            <li>but this is good.</li>

            <li>The smell is good and not over powering.</li>
            <li>the scent, the sandalwood aroma smells good</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff still does a good job</li>
            <li>and it smells good</li>
            <li>Feels good when you apply but it is too costly for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>This is one of the BEST after shaves available anywhere at any price.  </li>
            <li>a good companion to the sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
            <li>You smell good, feel good, and look good.</li>
            <li>The sensual fragrance of sandalwood is very appealing, and he is always groomed well, so I can say that this is a good product to try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more affordable version of the AOS Sandalwood and was happy to find this; until I smelled it.</li>
            <li>It is good, the sandalwood scent is nice, but not as nice as Trumper&#x27;s sandalwook</li>
            <li>SO glad I can now get through Amazon and not have to order from the UK!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this aftershave!</li>
            <li>My husband loves this aftershave and we both love the scent!</li>

            <li>it feels nice</li>
            <li>Nice smell that is not overpowering and disappears under a cologne.  </li>
            <li>sandalwood aftershave has a great feel and scent when it goes on; I&#x27;ll agree that it&#x27;s not the greatest moisturizer, but it *definitely* helps with soothing any nicks or cuts I might have had.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>but on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>This stuff is the absolute BEST smelling aftershave gel I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The aftershave soothed my face and moisturized it quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>This is great shave cream and works great with my straight razor.</li>
            <li>So from a cost effective standpoint they work for me.</li>
            <li>Nice sent , not overpowering,</li>
            <li>Everything from the scent, to the rich lather to the soothing coolness of the aftershave makes shaving a joy.</li>

            <li>Smells super great and has a nice feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>great product line for mature men who don&#x27;t want to smell like a fancy boy, just a great clean manly smell and it conditions as well as having a great smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves my face feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soothing gel with a nice masculine scent, perfect for keeping my face intact after the assault of the razor.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells so wonderful and it has completely removed the irritation after a shave.</li>
            <li>Really nice smelling balm and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood is the GREATEST smelling stuff!  </li>
            <li>this stuff smells great and the first 3 ingredients are witch hazel, water, and castor oil</li>
            <li>This aftershave is pricey but it has a very nice light texture, leaves your skin feeling very smooth, and has a very distinct old-timey barbershop smell.  </li>
            <li>it is fantastic and the ladies love it!</li>
            <li>Love the Sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I just suggest searching for it outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li>(sophisticated applause)  </li>
            <li>Sincerely and with Utmost Respect,  Cletus Joe Bob Henry Jed &amp;#34;Coon-Hound&amp;#34; Skunker Jr.</li>
            <li>shave cream and pre shave oil (which I love those two</li>
            <li>This has became my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>I love how it soothes my skin and moisturizes it, and  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product and really does its job well.</li>
            <li>and I love it, so</li>
            <li>and it works much better.</li>
            <li>This product being a gel and not containing alcohol is a healthy aftershave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit better if I mix it with some 444 (ItalianBarber.com),</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>Great scent and cools very well post-shave.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoying shaving using this product</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as a thicker balm aftershave like American Crew.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that TOBS has an alcohol-free after-shave to complement their peerless Sandalwood Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street, and this gel is on par with all of their excellent products.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but not a fan of this product.  </li>
            <li>Wish Taylor made more of a creamy balm type product in Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love the scent.</li>
            <li>Will buy again... to be sure...</li>
            <li>This is our son&#x27;s favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m pleased with this TOBS aftershave and will purchase more once I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The aftershave balms do a better job at that.  </li>
            <li>Love the sandalwood scent on my face after I shave.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite smelling aftershave, and the gel is quite soothing.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more.  </li>
            <li>this is better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>You love Sandalwood?  </li>
            <li>You will love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product feel and smell but, wont buy more because it contains triethanolamine.</li>
            <li>I literally use a spot the size of my pinky nail after I shave and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood a favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It just not get any better than this.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot more of witch-hazel than Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and highly recommended to a first time aftershave buyer!</li>
            <li>Not bad, and it provides a bit of a cooling feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Nivea&#x27;s excellent sensitive skin after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My tube smells great, just like classic sandalwood, and there&#x27;s plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff with reservations.</li>
            <li>I love the distinctive, strong, manly sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>It acts as a mild toner, lubricates the skin, and does NOT leave any kind of sheen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, and goes well with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street are great products.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street has great shaving products.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell if your a guy like me and doesn&#x27;t really believe in wearing perfume and tons of fragrance on yourself.</li>
            <li>Goes on good and absorbs fast leaving your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product because I love the sandalwood smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent goes on strong and diminishes after about 30 minutes, so you don&#x27;t overpower people with it.</li>
            <li>I own all their other products that do have that great sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>and they do a great job - well packed, on time, and fresh new product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product is new or if I&#x27;ve just discovered it, but I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li>It is light on scent, applies easy, and works.  </li>
            <li>, I just think it&#x27;s best to keep a sense of humor, however odd it may be, when dealing with commerce.  </li>
            <li>That was fine with me since  </li>
            <li>which is why I think it&#x27;s a fantastic product, and I will purchase it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to soothe the skin post-shave.</li>
            <li>I realize that aftershave is a personal choice, but for me this works great..</li>
            <li>I much enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Not as great of a product as I hoped for especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy all things TOBS.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this aftershave.</li>
            <li>great smell and prevents red bumps after shaving</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well as it leaves my skin felling calm and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you give this a try!!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, does not burn and dries cleanly (unlike some aftershaves that seem to leave a film on your face that sort of peels off alter).</li>
            <li>sandalwood finish at first more tobacco pine b4 in tube</li>
            <li>I use this post shave then apply a scented aftershave like Old Spice or even use ToOBS&#x27;s sandalwood  preshave oil very diluted if i really want that delicious sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and makes the shaving experience far more enjoyable... and manly.  </li>
            <li>But even thought the aftershave doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the shave cream, it still has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, but pleasant, and it lasts for several hours.  </li>
            <li>I shave very close and it leaves my face very smooth</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t by this for the smell, and there&#x27;s way better products for the skin care.  </li>
            <li>This is a Christmas gift for a special man in my life.</li>
            <li>Now, as far as how the product works, its an amazing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product and seems to last quite well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and my husband absolutely loves the product....</li>
            <li>so it feels cool and soothing, leaving my skin nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Considering that I can go buy a mass-market aftershave balm from any drugstore for around $5, the current price of $18 is worth it for a product that does the job with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Gel is strong smelling at first and smells nothing like Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>more words, here, and here, four more, last word.</li>
            <li>One of the things I like most about it is the clean, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>but castor oil is apparently good for treating sunburn, abrasions, acne, dry skin, boils, warts, stretch marks, liver/age spots, athletes foot and chronic itching, inflamed skin, and wrinkles).  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it if you are REALLY into strong sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Normally their stuff is very clean, but this just didn&#x27;t get me that way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more liquid than gel, and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood smell is not as pleasant as other sandalwood products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>use the sandalwood shaving cream from Taylor of Old Bond Street and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>For the discerning gentlemen who wants a lovely aftershave that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol, has a lovely scent and lessens and prevents razor burn and irritation look no further.</li>
            <li>The cost is worth it given the quality</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue to use it both for its woody and masculine scent, which my wife loves on me, but also for its ability as an aftershave.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good at what is does but don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>A nice close shave (DE only for me) and some TOBS shave gel.</li>
            <li>Love the Taylor on Old Bond Street products.  </li>
            <li>It is very clean &amp; masculine.</li>
            <li>I guess i would recommend this product in general, but if you&#x27;re looking for the good old sandalwood scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>The aroma is nice, but does not linger long.</li>
            <li>I wish I could link the Taylor of Old Bond Street line into this review, because the whole sandlewood line of pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and the aftershave is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with all of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line and this stuff really refreshes after a close shave.</li>
            <li>This lotion not only smells great, but really helps soothe my skin, even after I had a major razor burn incident</li>
            <li>I recently decided to try this aftershave and right away was pleased with the compliments I started getting from friends at work and even strangers in the elevator.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soaps for a while and enjoy them very much.  </li>
            <li>The 2.5 ounces last for many months.  </li>
            <li>This is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>While this gel does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do - heal your face from the damage of shaving - the scent is off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently it is safe to ship to me, but not back to them.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments after a big hug.</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff because I love the TOBS sandalwood shave soap and was hoping to get an aftershave product that would have a similar scent.  </li>
            <li>The thing that makes it worth it to me (and most likely you) is how my face feels I shave very close</li>
            <li>This TOBS aftershave is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky not much aroma.</li>
            <li>Also, feels nice after a shave and rubs in well doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or slippery or anything other than alright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to deny that this,(Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel, 2.5-Ounce), well it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Invigorating, masculine and clean...</li>
            <li>They cost more than some other products, but you can tell right away that they are a higher end line.</li>
            <li>I have added another line so you can just keep the positive review.</li>
            <li>Somehow, as much as I avoid my lip area, it still leaves a funny taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I refused to pay $50 for a set of &#x27;5 gel, moving blade hype&#x27; when the safety razor does the same exact thing and puts an amazing &#x27;weight&#x27; back into your hands to shave with.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly new to traditional shaving, I am glad to have this product in my repertoire.    </li>
            <li>Wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>It had a medicinal smell to it that I didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>if not for that it would rate much lower in my book.</li>
            <li>The witch hazel real  soothes my face and the aloe</li>
            <li>- it is a gel and soothes, but does not provide much in the way of emollients.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this after-shave gel/balm.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing, and since he shaves his head, face and neck, I think he is eminently qualified to rate this product.  </li>
            <li>With that being said I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>To me, this stuff didn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not having a smell wouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker if it performed really well as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my father who really likes the scent of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very soothing after shaving.</li>
            <li>Really overpowering and offensive (to me) aroma.</li>
            <li>I found it not to really have much of a TOBS scent at all if any.</li>
            <li>This is also a plus since it goes on very anonymously as it refreshes your face.</li>
            <li>so I shave really close.</li>
            <li>This aftershave has a very manly smell to it.</li>
            <li>It smells O.K., but it really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the sandalwood I know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the classic Aftershave Balm (blue box)</li>
            <li>However for your entertainment, I have left the original review I composed intact below.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with companies increasing their profit margin, as long as it&#x27;s within my scope of reason.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and very fresh, not a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scent but still gives a very clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great skin feel- goes on smooth to powedry dry finish extra ordinarily soothing</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin (usually the opposite, fairly oily), it&#x27;s quite dry after shaving and this stuff does a good job at re-moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, I completely understand the laws of economics such as supply and demand, and the fact that this product is imported from England, so the price of it now is justified in my mind.</li>
            <li>However, having said that, where this product really shines is on those rare occasions that I do not properly lather for my shave and get the razor burn from hell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic.  </li>
            <li>The Sandalwood Aftershave gel does have a sandalwood aroma, but it is not quite the same as the TOBS shaving cream, the scents are similar but the shaving cream is a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a “classic” aftershave upscaled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M HOOKED on this high end, quality product that soothes and helps my skin.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a little more sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something clean and invigorating about it and the scent hasn&#x27;t gotten old in several months of use.  </li>
            <li>Combine this with Taylor of old bond street shaving soap and a modern razor</li>
            <li>The sandalwood aroma is solid but not overly powerful.</li>
            <li>Well a price increase such as this is hardly worth the prime benefit.</li>
            <li>Though the initial cost is a bit more, the products seem to go a long way.</li>
            <li>It is such a powerful smell</li>
            <li>As for the smell it like the rest of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line is an old english barber style scent of Sandalwood and light floral notes that yields a refined masculine scent.</li>
            <li>But the important part is that it leaves my skin feeling like a sharp blade was not just scraped across it, and causes my face to just be there instead of feeling like it&#x27;s being sanded away with acid.   </li>
            <li>(I, without thinking, did a full cross-grain pass across my chin with several short fast strokes after I had rinsed off the blade and hadn&#x27;t yet reapplied shaving cream).  </li>
            <li>The Sandalwood scent is nice and subtle, but still gets noticed for its musky/woody scent.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>this seemed the next logical step.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like a toilet air freshener that they use at work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended the only reason for 4 stars is the price is a bit high and</li>
            <li>I have several Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams for brush and safety or straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband,he says it makes his face soft.</li>
            <li>Soothes my face after a shave and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for all the extra kisses after I shave!</li>
            <li>Really old school.  </li>
            <li>I use Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream</li>
            <li>For example with the aftershave, a pea sized dollop on the finger is enough to cover your whole face and then some.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this is the ticket.</li>
            <li>I would say as far as how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>but this never burns and my face in Just two weeks is as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate/moisten my skin as much as I&#x27;d like it to.  </li>
            <li>I cannot begin to tell you the number of compliments I received since applying Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Unlike drug store aftershaves, this fragrance is not at all common and is most pleasing to men AND women who know and respect quality when they smell it.  </li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are picking this aftershave only for its scent and established brand, it would be worth going with your second option.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not exactly the same scent as the TOBS sandalwood shaving cream, which smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has a classic aroma that brings you back to the barber shop days of old.</li>
            <li>After the first application it now has become daily routine with shaving and they have a regular customer.</li>
            <li>Will definitely not buy again, but will be buying the classic balm...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big TOBS shaving cream fan, so I had high expectations for this aftershave.  </li>
            <li>One little drop is adequate, and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation if you are new to saftey razor shaving is get an alum block.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the only things that works with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Anything that Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) makes... is a cut above the rest... and this sandalwood after shave gel is no exception to the TOBS line of shaving products!</li>
            <li>This came poorly packed and the gell leaked out of the tube, and the smell was so potent that I had to throw it out.  </li>
            <li>Normally I get dry skin and just splash on some alcohol and</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li>The fragrance changes also and finally settles on a gently Sandalwood scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>this is a super product that takes only a small amount to work.  </li>
            <li>assuming it&#x27;s non-toxic, my only other concern is that my skin didn&#x27;t really feel all that moisturized after using this after-shave.</li>
            <li>Not really what I would normally purchase</li>
            <li>A little of the gel goes a long way, not sure I would buy again, but only because I was hoping the scent would be more similar to the shaving cream.</li>

            <li> and you have as good a shaving experience as you can get.</li>

            <li> a good companion to the sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You smell good, feel good, and look good.</li>
            <li> The sensual fragrance of sandalwood is very appealing, and he is always groomed well, so I can say that this is a good product to try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more affordable version of the AOS Sandalwood and was happy to find this; until I smelled it.</li>
            <li> It is good, the sandalwood scent is nice, but not as nice as Trumper&#x27;s sandalwook</li>
            <li> SO glad I can now get through Amazon and not have to order from the UK!</li>

            <li> sandalwood aftershave has a great feel and scent when it goes on; I&#x27;ll agree that it&#x27;s not the greatest moisturizer, but it *definitely* helps with soothing any nicks or cuts I might have had.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> but on it&#x27;s own</li>

            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> This is great shave cream and works great with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> So from a cost effective standpoint they work for me.</li>

            <li> It smells great, leaves my face feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soothing gel with a nice masculine scent, perfect for keeping my face intact after the assault of the razor.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells so wonderful and it has completely removed the irritation after a shave.</li>
            <li> Really nice smelling balm and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood is the GREATEST smelling stuff!  </li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and the first 3 ingredients are witch hazel, water, and castor oil</li>
            <li> This aftershave is pricey but it has a very nice light texture, leaves your skin feeling very smooth, and has a very distinct old-timey barbershop smell.  </li>

            <li> (sophisticated applause)  </li>
            <li> Sincerely and with Utmost Respect,  Cletus Joe Bob Henry Jed &amp;#34;Coon-Hound&amp;#34; Skunker Jr.</li>
            <li> shave cream and pre shave oil (which I love those two</li>
            <li> This has became my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> I love how it soothes my skin and moisturizes it, and  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product and really does its job well.</li>
            <li> and I love it, so</li>
            <li> and it works much better.</li>
            <li> This product being a gel and not containing alcohol is a healthy aftershave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit better if I mix it with some 444 (ItalianBarber.com),</li>
            <li> It was ok.  </li>
            <li> Great scent and cools very well post-shave.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoying shaving using this product</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as a thicker balm aftershave like American Crew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that TOBS has an alcohol-free after-shave to complement their peerless Sandalwood Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street, and this gel is on par with all of their excellent products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but not a fan of this product.  </li>
            <li> Wish Taylor made more of a creamy balm type product in Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love the scent.</li>
            <li> Will buy again... to be sure...</li>
            <li> This is our son&#x27;s favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m pleased with this TOBS aftershave and will purchase more once I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> The aftershave balms do a better job at that.  </li>
            <li> Love the sandalwood scent on my face after I shave.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite smelling aftershave, and the gel is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more.  </li>
            <li> this is better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> You love Sandalwood?  </li>
            <li> You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product feel and smell but, wont buy more because it contains triethanolamine.</li>
            <li> I literally use a spot the size of my pinky nail after I shave and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood a favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> It just not get any better than this.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot more of witch-hazel than Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and highly recommended to a first time aftershave buyer!</li>
            <li> Not bad, and it provides a bit of a cooling feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Nivea&#x27;s excellent sensitive skin after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tube smells great, just like classic sandalwood, and there&#x27;s plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff with reservations.</li>
            <li> I love the distinctive, strong, manly sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li> It acts as a mild toner, lubricates the skin, and does NOT leave any kind of sheen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, and goes well with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street are great products.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street has great shaving products.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell if your a guy like me and doesn&#x27;t really believe in wearing perfume and tons of fragrance on yourself.</li>
            <li> Goes on good and absorbs fast leaving your skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product because I love the sandalwood smell.  </li>
            <li> The scent goes on strong and diminishes after about 30 minutes, so you don&#x27;t overpower people with it.</li>
            <li> I own all their other products that do have that great sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> and they do a great job - well packed, on time, and fresh new product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is new or if I&#x27;ve just discovered it, but I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> It is light on scent, applies easy, and works.  </li>
            <li> , I just think it&#x27;s best to keep a sense of humor, however odd it may be, when dealing with commerce.  </li>
            <li> That was fine with me since  </li>
            <li> which is why I think it&#x27;s a fantastic product, and I will purchase it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to soothe the skin post-shave.</li>
            <li> I realize that aftershave is a personal choice, but for me this works great..</li>
            <li> I much enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> Not as great of a product as I hoped for especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy all things TOBS.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this aftershave.</li>
            <li> great smell and prevents red bumps after shaving</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well as it leaves my skin felling calm and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you give this a try!!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, does not burn and dries cleanly (unlike some aftershaves that seem to leave a film on your face that sort of peels off alter).</li>
            <li> sandalwood finish at first more tobacco pine b4 in tube</li>
            <li> I use this post shave then apply a scented aftershave like Old Spice or even use ToOBS&#x27;s sandalwood  preshave oil very diluted if i really want that delicious sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and makes the shaving experience far more enjoyable... and manly.  </li>
            <li> But even thought the aftershave doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the shave cream, it still has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, but pleasant, and it lasts for several hours.  </li>
            <li> I shave very close and it leaves my face very smooth</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t by this for the smell, and there&#x27;s way better products for the skin care.  </li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for a special man in my life.</li>
            <li> Now, as far as how the product works, its an amazing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product and seems to last quite well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and my husband absolutely loves the product....</li>
            <li> so it feels cool and soothing, leaving my skin nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Considering that I can go buy a mass-market aftershave balm from any drugstore for around $5, the current price of $18 is worth it for a product that does the job with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Gel is strong smelling at first and smells nothing like Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> more words, here, and here, four more, last word.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like most about it is the clean, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> but castor oil is apparently good for treating sunburn, abrasions, acne, dry skin, boils, warts, stretch marks, liver/age spots, athletes foot and chronic itching, inflamed skin, and wrinkles).  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it if you are REALLY into strong sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Normally their stuff is very clean, but this just didn&#x27;t get me that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more liquid than gel, and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood smell is not as pleasant as other sandalwood products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> use the sandalwood shaving cream from Taylor of Old Bond Street and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> For the discerning gentlemen who wants a lovely aftershave that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol, has a lovely scent and lessens and prevents razor burn and irritation look no further.</li>
            <li> The cost is worth it given the quality</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will continue to use it both for its woody and masculine scent, which my wife loves on me, but also for its ability as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good at what is does but don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> A nice close shave (DE only for me) and some TOBS shave gel.</li>
            <li> Love the Taylor on Old Bond Street products.  </li>
            <li> It is very clean &amp; masculine.</li>
            <li> I guess i would recommend this product in general, but if you&#x27;re looking for the good old sandalwood scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> The aroma is nice, but does not linger long.</li>
            <li> I wish I could link the Taylor of Old Bond Street line into this review, because the whole sandlewood line of pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and the aftershave is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with all of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line and this stuff really refreshes after a close shave.</li>
            <li> This lotion not only smells great, but really helps soothe my skin, even after I had a major razor burn incident</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try this aftershave and right away was pleased with the compliments I started getting from friends at work and even strangers in the elevator.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soaps for a while and enjoy them very much.  </li>
            <li> The 2.5 ounces last for many months.  </li>
            <li> This is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> While this gel does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do - heal your face from the damage of shaving - the scent is off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently it is safe to ship to me, but not back to them.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments after a big hug.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff because I love the TOBS sandalwood shave soap and was hoping to get an aftershave product that would have a similar scent.  </li>
            <li> The thing that makes it worth it to me (and most likely you) is how my face feels I shave very close</li>
            <li> This TOBS aftershave is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky not much aroma.</li>
            <li> Also, feels nice after a shave and rubs in well doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or slippery or anything other than alright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to deny that this,(Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel, 2.5-Ounce), well it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Invigorating, masculine and clean...</li>
            <li> They cost more than some other products, but you can tell right away that they are a higher end line.</li>
            <li> I have added another line so you can just keep the positive review.</li>
            <li> Somehow, as much as I avoid my lip area, it still leaves a funny taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I refused to pay $50 for a set of &#x27;5 gel, moving blade hype&#x27; when the safety razor does the same exact thing and puts an amazing &#x27;weight&#x27; back into your hands to shave with.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly new to traditional shaving, I am glad to have this product in my repertoire.    </li>
            <li> Wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> It had a medicinal smell to it that I didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> if not for that it would rate much lower in my book.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel real  soothes my face and the aloe</li>
            <li> - it is a gel and soothes, but does not provide much in the way of emollients.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this after-shave gel/balm.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing, and since he shaves his head, face and neck, I think he is eminently qualified to rate this product.  </li>
            <li> With that being said I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> To me, this stuff didn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not having a smell wouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker if it performed really well as an aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father who really likes the scent of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very soothing after shaving.</li>
            <li> Really overpowering and offensive (to me) aroma.</li>
            <li> I found it not to really have much of a TOBS scent at all if any.</li>
            <li> This is also a plus since it goes on very anonymously as it refreshes your face.</li>
            <li> so I shave really close.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a very manly smell to it.</li>
            <li> It smells O.K., but it really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the sandalwood I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the classic Aftershave Balm (blue box)</li>
            <li> However for your entertainment, I have left the original review I composed intact below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with companies increasing their profit margin, as long as it&#x27;s within my scope of reason.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and very fresh, not a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scent but still gives a very clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Great skin feel- goes on smooth to powedry dry finish extra ordinarily soothing</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin (usually the opposite, fairly oily), it&#x27;s quite dry after shaving and this stuff does a good job at re-moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I completely understand the laws of economics such as supply and demand, and the fact that this product is imported from England, so the price of it now is justified in my mind.</li>
            <li> However, having said that, where this product really shines is on those rare occasions that I do not properly lather for my shave and get the razor burn from hell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classic.  </li>
            <li> The Sandalwood Aftershave gel does have a sandalwood aroma, but it is not quite the same as the TOBS shaving cream, the scents are similar but the shaving cream is a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a “classic” aftershave upscaled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M HOOKED on this high end, quality product that soothes and helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little more sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something clean and invigorating about it and the scent hasn&#x27;t gotten old in several months of use.  </li>
            <li> Combine this with Taylor of old bond street shaving soap and a modern razor</li>
            <li> The sandalwood aroma is solid but not overly powerful.</li>
            <li> Well a price increase such as this is hardly worth the prime benefit.</li>
            <li> Though the initial cost is a bit more, the products seem to go a long way.</li>
            <li> It is such a powerful smell</li>
            <li> As for the smell it like the rest of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line is an old english barber style scent of Sandalwood and light floral notes that yields a refined masculine scent.</li>
            <li> But the important part is that it leaves my skin feeling like a sharp blade was not just scraped across it, and causes my face to just be there instead of feeling like it&#x27;s being sanded away with acid.   </li>
            <li> (I, without thinking, did a full cross-grain pass across my chin with several short fast strokes after I had rinsed off the blade and hadn&#x27;t yet reapplied shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> The Sandalwood scent is nice and subtle, but still gets noticed for its musky/woody scent.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> this seemed the next logical step.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like a toilet air freshener that they use at work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended the only reason for 4 stars is the price is a bit high and</li>
            <li> I have several Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams for brush and safety or straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband,he says it makes his face soft.</li>
            <li> Soothes my face after a shave and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for all the extra kisses after I shave!</li>
            <li> Really old school.  </li>
            <li> I use Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream</li>
            <li> For example with the aftershave, a pea sized dollop on the finger is enough to cover your whole face and then some.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> I would say as far as how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> but this never burns and my face in Just two weeks is as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate/moisten my skin as much as I&#x27;d like it to.  </li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell you the number of compliments I received since applying Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Unlike drug store aftershaves, this fragrance is not at all common and is most pleasing to men AND women who know and respect quality when they smell it.  </li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are picking this aftershave only for its scent and established brand, it would be worth going with your second option.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not exactly the same scent as the TOBS sandalwood shaving cream, which smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has a classic aroma that brings you back to the barber shop days of old.</li>
            <li> After the first application it now has become daily routine with shaving and they have a regular customer.</li>
            <li> Will definitely not buy again, but will be buying the classic balm...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big TOBS shaving cream fan, so I had high expectations for this aftershave.  </li>
            <li> One little drop is adequate, and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation if you are new to saftey razor shaving is get an alum block.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the only things that works with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Anything that Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) makes... is a cut above the rest... and this sandalwood after shave gel is no exception to the TOBS line of shaving products!</li>
            <li> This came poorly packed and the gell leaked out of the tube, and the smell was so potent that I had to throw it out.  </li>
            <li> Normally I get dry skin and just splash on some alcohol and</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li> The fragrance changes also and finally settles on a gently Sandalwood scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> this is a super product that takes only a small amount to work.  </li>
            <li> assuming it&#x27;s non-toxic, my only other concern is that my skin didn&#x27;t really feel all that moisturized after using this after-shave.</li>
            <li> Not really what I would normally purchase</li>
            <li> A little of the gel goes a long way, not sure I would buy again, but only because I was hoping the scent would be more similar to the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to the world of shaving with a straight or safety razor, and I&#x27;ve been trying to step up my game across the board.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this - the gel leaves my skin dry shortly after application.  </li>
            <li> but I notice their aftershave and deodorant last a long time; meaning months instead of weeks.</li>
            <li> So as long as you followed directions and cut with scissors, you can just keep this part if you like.</li>
            <li> So as long as the price remains in the $18-$20 realm, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A complete  waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like any other part of it just use white out to cover it up.  </li>
            <li> an increase similar to what I&#x27;ve noticed among some other products at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I see some other recent reviewers complain about the smell or the lack thereof.  </li>
            <li> It soothes the burn but almost immediately it leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry, neither does it feel irritable after using the product.</li>
            <li> It also helps to condition my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> Soothes the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin</li>
            <li> The scent only seems to last a few hours, it&#x27;s not a lingering all day smell (or I just get used to it).     </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now and the scent may only last a few hours</li>
            <li> At first I was slightly disappointed in the smell, but given a few uses, I now quite enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It also seems to leave my face feeling very dry in which I still have to apply some lotion.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve never tried other aftershaves, including the liquid stlye aftershaves because I assume they&#x27;re alcohol based and therefore would dry out the skin (again, just my assumption).&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the price is now almost triple what I paid, (roughly $18 in fall of 2014)</li>
            <li> But mostly be careful because if you try and return it, this is what you get:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ex military and law enforcement</li>
            <li> It is not a “pure” Sandalwood fragrance but is a fragrance blend that works for me.</li>
            <li> It can, however, be rough on the face because of the user&#x27;s lack of experience and because the blades are so sharp.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it dries leaving a white residue on my face, even with just using very little product.</li>
            <li> If it returns to a higher price I&#x27;ll just wait it out instead of posting weird reviews about it.</li>
            <li> It is nothing lika any of the other TOBS products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what other guys are wearing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some high-dollar Polo or whatever that every other guy is wearing, so it sets me apart in that way.  </li>
            <li> goes on without stinging and dries without oily residue like some other products.</li>
            <li> They complement each other well.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried endless creams and products on my head</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of the price vs size factor.</li>
            <li> Makes me smile &amp; have sweet little evil thoughts!!!!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much compared to less expensive products.</li>
            <li> It’s not overwhelming and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I could care less.</li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients are all things you can pronounce which separates this product line from the typical drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li> This has an odd antiseptic smell...nothing like sandlewood</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a very small amount, so despite it being relatively expensive, it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> but it always left my head greasy and shiny (not a good look for a bald man).  </li>
            <li> I was a little torn on how to rate this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> However a very small amount, like a pea size, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tend to like sweeter/citrus scents so this is a little heavy for me.</li>
            <li> aftershave doesn&#x27;t have the same &amp;#34;quality of smell&amp;#34; (if that makes any sense) as the pre shave and shaving cream, not that it smells bad, just not the same.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do you!</li>

            <li> I switched from the really expensive cartridge razors to a simple safety razor.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to avoid getting painful razor bumps post-shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that even small nicks stop being irritating after using this.  </li>
            <li> for half the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no good.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best aftershave I&#x27;ve found although a bit expensive. Love the Sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband,he says it makes his face soft.I told him it smells so good I will follow him everywhere.I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Seller was excellent and so was the product. Been using this for a while now, and the smell has grown on me. At first I was slightly disappointed in the smell, but given a few uses, I now quite enjoy it. This is a witch hazel based afterahave. I noticed no burning sensation, and my complexion has improved vastly. Give it a try...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> ONE of these is perhaps a year&#x27;s supply. One little drop is adequate, and it does what it is supposed to do. The aroma is nice, but does not linger long. Buy the cologne for that.</li>
            <li> I recently went &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and reverted to the safety razor, double sided blade as my grandfather and father have used for years. I refused to pay $50 for a set of &#x27;5 gel, moving blade hype&#x27; when the safety razor does the same exact thing and puts an amazing &#x27;weight&#x27; back into your hands to shave with.  This TAYLOR Sandalwood Aftershave puts on the finishing touches of a close shave and helps my skin during the winter months and drying out.  After the first application it now has become daily routine with shaving and they have a regular customer. I&#x27;M HOOKED on this high end, quality product that soothes and helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Complements the shave cream nicely.  Wish it had a little more sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months, it smells nice, but not overpowering.  I am fairly new to traditional shaving, I am glad to have this product in my repertoire.    The scent only seems to last a few hours, it&#x27;s not a lingering all day smell (or I just get used to it).     it feels nice, there&#x27;s no alcohol burn, it&#x27;s clear(ish) so it doesn&#x27;t stain.    it&#x27;s a good product and seems to last quite well.  I&#x27;m about 1/2 through my 2.5 oz tube in just over 2 months.</li>
            <li> received shaving lotion instead of AS gel. It is good, the sandalwood scent is nice, but not as nice as Trumper&#x27;s sandalwook</li>
            <li> Goes with the shaving cream of the same name. Pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and the first 3 ingredients are witch hazel, water, and castor oil (i didn&#x27;t know this but castor oil is apparently good for treating sunburn, abrasions, acne, dry skin, boils, warts, stretch marks, liver/age spots, athletes foot and chronic itching, inflamed skin, and wrinkles).  my concern is ingredient #4: triethanolamine. cosmeticsinfo.org says that this stuff is:  \\&quot;...safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the skin, the concentration of Triethanolamine and Diethanolamine should not exceed 5%.\\&quot;  i&#x27;m hoping the concentration of triethanolamine is under 5% &#x3D;/  assuming it&#x27;s non-toxic, my only other concern is that my skin didn&#x27;t really feel all that moisturized after using this after-shave. i&#x27;ve been using the body shop&#x27;s maca root aftershave cream and my skin feels well-moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the only things that works with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  It is light on scent, applies easy, and works.  We have a subscription to have a bottle a month delivered to the house.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is a soothing gel that has a great aroma.  It&#x27;s excellent for eliminating razor burn and also moisturizes the skin.  The sandalwood aroma is solid but not overly powerful.</li>
            <li> this is a super product that takes only a small amount to work.  Smells super great and has a nice feeling on the skin.  The 2.5 ounces last for many months.  Taylor of Old Bond Street are great products.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not overpowering. Wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood smell is so fragrant that simply handling the box will leave the scent on your fingers. It&#x27;s a little more liquid than gel, and goes on nicely. My sensitive skin handled it well after 2 passes with minimal irritation. Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product because I love the sandalwood smell.  You just can&#x27;t beat it.  When the product arrived i was disappointed in what I discovered.  It had a medicinal smell to it that I didn&#x27;t really like.  That should not be the reason for you to not get this product.  That is just my opinion and that might be the sandalwood smell you are used to.  I like the AoS sandalwood smell and this one is just different.  Now, as far as how the product works, its an amazing moisturizer.  Its a gel and feels great going on and leaves my face feeling good after a shave.  I just don&#x27;t care for the smell.  If they had an unscented version of the gel I would be hooked.  4 stars for the product performance and 2 stars for the smell.</li>
            <li> Five star product. It&#x27;s a soothing gel with a nice masculine scent, perfect for keeping my face intact after the assault of the razor.  ----------------(future edit break; cut here with scissors)----------------------------------------------------------------------------- And the price has finally changed to one that I feel is the proper value for the product in question. Yes, I completely understand the laws of economics such as supply and demand, and the fact that this product is imported from England, so the price of it now is justified in my mind. Considering that I can go buy a mass-market aftershave balm from any drugstore for around $5, the current price of $18 is worth it for a product that does the job with a pleasant scent. However for your entertainment, I have left the original review I composed intact below. So as long as you followed directions and cut with scissors, you can just keep this part if you like. Just peel it back off your screen. I have added another line so you can just keep the positive review. If you don&#x27;t like any other part of it just use white out to cover it up.  No, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re stupid or a blonde as the joke says, I just think it&#x27;s best to keep a sense of humor, however odd it may be, when dealing with commerce.  So as long as the price remains in the $18-$20 realm, I&#x27;ll continue to use it. If it returns to a higher price I&#x27;ll just wait it out instead of posting weird reviews about it. But the important part is that it leaves my skin feeling like a sharp blade was not just scraped across it, and causes my face to just be there instead of feeling like it&#x27;s being sanded away with acid.   -----------------------(cut here with scissors)----------------------(original review below)---------------------------(cut here with scissors)------------------  However, the price is now almost triple what I paid, (roughly $18 in fall of 2014) an increase similar to what I&#x27;ve noticed among some other products at Amazon. This one, being imported, tends to fall under various marketplace retailers and often has not qualified for prime shipping. Well a price increase such as this is hardly worth the prime benefit. So unfortunately for the seller, I must subtract, without hyperbole, at least fifteen stars. Since no such rating exists, a one star rating must suffice.  Wonderful product, I just suggest searching for it outside of Amazon. The fact is, when prices are up for any reason, I will simply stop purchasing things I want. I could care less. If the price is good and the incentive is there, I&#x27;ll purchase. If a transaction doesn&#x27;t meet my standards, I&#x27;ll simply not make the purchase. My loss? Sorry, I&#x27;m not that attached to material goods. I&#x27;m fine with companies increasing their profit margin, as long as it&#x27;s within my scope of reason. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll just find something else.  Good luck in the marketplace, online sellers. I may be one tiny person out of millions, but one by one folks like me will likely go away from products like this and take our money with us.  -------------------------------(future edit break end; cut here with scissors to remove negative review)---------------------------------------------------------  ...which is why I think it&#x27;s a fantastic product, and I will purchase it repeatedly. Well done retailers!  (sophisticated applause)  Sincerely and with Utmost Respect,  Cletus Joe Bob Henry Jed &amp;#34;Coon-Hound&amp;#34; Skunker Jr.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell if your a guy like me and doesn&#x27;t really believe in wearing perfume and tons of fragrance on yourself. Also, feels nice after a shave and rubs in well doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or slippery or anything other than alright.</li>
            <li> Soothes my face after a shave and makes my skin feel soft.  Nice smell that is not overpowering and disappears under a cologne.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> It is nothing lika any of the other TOBS products it&#x27;s smell is nasty and the feeling of it is something you don&#x27;t wanton your face or head</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff with reservations. Gel is strong smelling at first and smells nothing like Sandalwood. It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of gel to get the face soothed and tightened up. The fragrance changes also and finally settles on a gently Sandalwood scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. This will probably be my last purchase of the gel as I can&#x27;t justify the price for the amount of gel nor the length of time the fragrance lasts. As for soothing the face, it is 2-3 stars at best. Just too expensive for the lack of a lasting fragrance and soothing feeling that lasts.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I feel the need to express my satisfaction with this product. This is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m ever changing. The scent smells so wonderful and it has completely removed the irritation after a shave. Awesome product and highly recommended to a first time aftershave buyer! Boom!</li>
            <li> I was a little torn on how to rate this product. It was given to me as a gift along with the ToOBS sandalwood shave cream and pre shave oil (which I love those two products)&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave doesn&#x27;t have the same &amp;#34;quality of smell&amp;#34; (if that makes any sense) as the pre shave and shaving cream, not that it smells bad, just not the same. It also seems to leave my face feeling very dry in which I still have to apply some lotion. However, having said that, where this product really shines is on those rare occasions that I do not properly lather for my shave and get the razor burn from hell. This definitely puts the fire out instantly. Since it does this so well I give it three stars, if not for that it would rate much lower in my book.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of TOBS since I started wet-shaving about a year ago. What can you say about a company that has been making shaving products for 160 years? The Sandalwood scent is nice and subtle, but still gets noticed for its musky/woody scent.</li>
            <li> This has became my favorite aftershave. The witch hazel real  soothes my face and the aloe keeps my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> maybe I should say my wife loves it! I smell like a million bucks using this. I also use the shaving cream. Thanks for all the extra kisses after I shave!</li>
            <li> This is now my go-to aftershave.  I love how it soothes my skin and moisturizes it, and  I love the distinctive, strong, manly sandalwood scent.  It&#x27;s just not what other guys are wearing.  It&#x27;s not some high-dollar Polo or whatever that every other guy is wearing, so it sets me apart in that way.  It&#x27;s classic.  Kinda old-school, maybe.  Really old school.  I like that.  My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood, best smell in the world.  great aftershave, it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> If you like sandalwood then this is very nice. I tend to like sweeter/citrus scents so this is a little heavy for me. TOBS products in my opinion provide a great bang for the buck. The shaving creams (croaps) are just as good as TH and almost as good as GFT. for half the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. This aftershave gel though, as some write, is not a moisturizer per se - it is a gel and soothes, but does not provide much in the way of emollients. Good scent though and soothing. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered from the vendor SimplyBeautiful and they do a great job - well packed, on time, and fresh new product!</li>
            <li> I switched from the really expensive cartridge razors to a simple safety razor.  It&#x27;s cheaper and makes the shaving experience far more enjoyable... and manly.  It can, however, be rough on the face because of the user&#x27;s lack of experience and because the blades are so sharp.  The purpose of the gel is to soothe that away and help the skin recover quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sandalwood shaving cream from Taylor of Old Bond Street and absolutely love it.  One of the things I like most about it is the clean, masculine scent.  While this gel does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do - heal your face from the damage of shaving - the scent is off.  It doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the shaving cream and, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t care for how it does smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting a star for the mismatched scent.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product and really does its job well.</li>
            <li> I use Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream and I love it, so this seemed the next logical step. The scent is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to soothe the skin post-shave. It soothes the burn but almost immediately it leaves my face feeling dry. I switched to just unscented face lotion and it works much better. I would pass on this item, but I do recommend ToOBS shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn and my wife loves the smell. Nuf Said.</li>
            <li> great scent! goes on without stinging and dries without oily residue like some other products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for 35 years. Wonderful scent and just an excellent skin product. SO glad I can now get through Amazon and not have to order from the UK!</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave! I&#x27;m relatively new to the world of shaving with a straight or safety razor, and I&#x27;ve been trying to step up my game across the board. I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to avoid getting painful razor bumps post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandalwood aftershave has a great feel and scent when it goes on; I&#x27;ll agree that it&#x27;s not the greatest moisturizer, but it *definitely* helps with soothing any nicks or cuts I might have had.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave.  I shave very close and it leaves my face very smooth</li>
            <li> I wish I could link the Taylor of Old Bond Street line into this review, because the whole sandlewood line of pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and the aftershave is phenomenal. They cost more than some other products, but you can tell right away that they are a higher end line. Everything from the scent, to the rich lather to the soothing coolness of the aftershave makes shaving a joy. Though the initial cost is a bit more, the products seem to go a long way. For example with the aftershave, a pea sized dollop on the finger is enough to cover your whole face and then some. Very impressed. Also, the ingredients are all things you can pronounce which separates this product line from the typical drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this after-shave gel/balm.  It is very soothing, and since he shaves his head, face and neck, I think he is eminently qualified to rate this product.  The sensual fragrance of sandalwood is very appealing, and he is always groomed well, so I can say that this is a good product to try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I realize that aftershave is a personal choice, but for me this works great.. It is soothing and the scent is pleasant, but not over powering. Combine this with Taylor of old bond street shaving soap and a modern razor and you have as good a shaving experience as you can get.</li>
            <li> I hope I just got a bad batch, but I could smell it before I opened the box. It is such a powerful smell I never put it on, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it feels on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it is safe to ship to me, but not back to them. &amp;#34; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be the guy who everyone smells before they see, purchase this immediately.</li>
            <li> For the discerning gentlemen who wants a lovely aftershave that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol, has a lovely scent and lessens and prevents razor burn and irritation look no further. If you have sensitive skin this is the ticket. It contains witch-hazel which has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, it&#x27;s a very good astringent, so it&#x27;s always a plus. This product being a gel and not containing alcohol is a healthy aftershave. It will tingle in areas of irritation, nicks, or razor burn but this is good. It shows you how good you did shaving. you can feel and see the difference using this product. It makes me feel and look like a million bucks. A good aftershave rejuvenates and does wonders for the skin. This actually minimizes/eliminates redness/irritation and razor burn.  As for the smell it like the rest of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line is an old english barber style scent of Sandalwood and light floral notes that yields a refined masculine scent. You smell good, feel good, and look good. With that being said I highly recommend this product! 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That being said I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have several Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams for brush and safety or straight razor.  I like this sandalwood scent.  There&#x27;s something clean and invigorating about it and the scent hasn&#x27;t gotten old in several months of use.  It&#x27;s not overly perfumy, which I do not like.</li>
            <li> While I like the smell I&#x27;m not a big fan of this - the gel leaves my skin dry shortly after application.  It&#x27;s a bit better if I mix it with some 444 (ItalianBarber.com), but on it&#x27;s own it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> Feels great going on.  When it dries it leaves a dusty powder that makes your face feel so smooth. It smells great also.</li>
            <li> Really nice smelling balm and refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, and goes well with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry, neither does it feel irritable after using the product.</li>
            <li> great product line for mature men who don&#x27;t want to smell like a fancy boy, just a great clean manly smell and it conditions as well as having a great smell.</li>
            <li> Gel is a high-quality product, but the sandalwood scent is overpowering.  I used it one time after a 3-pass shave and the scent lingered (annoyingly so) all day.  I even washed my face at noon and I could still smell it.  Wife couldn&#x27;t stand it, either.  Had to move it out of the bathroom because it was so powerfully-scented.  But, the gel works well and I would recommend it if you are REALLY into strong sandalwood.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Not nearly what I expect of this brand, even worse, it&#x27;s a gel that feels greasy, which I hate.  Normally their stuff is very clean, but this just didn&#x27;t get me that way.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great scent and cools very well post-shave.  The cost is worth it given the quality and you don&#x27;t have to use much compared to less expensive products.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this aftershave! The scent goes on strong and diminishes after about 30 minutes, so you don&#x27;t overpower people with it.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it after shaving with the sandalwood shaving cream. Pleasant smelling and not overpowering as others have said. I really enjoying shaving using this product</li>
            <li> Super product. My son uses it and it has several products like with-hazel which do not cause his skin to break out.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as a thicker balm aftershave like American Crew. Somehow, as much as I avoid my lip area, it still leaves a funny taste in my mouth. If you are picking this aftershave only for its scent and established brand, it would be worth going with your second option.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and does a wonderful job as an aftershave.  Not a moisturizer or anything like that, this soothes the skin after shaving.  I find that even small nicks stop being irritating after using this.  I love this stuff and will continue to use it both for its woody and masculine scent, which my wife loves on me, but also for its ability as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> I much enjoy the scent. The gel helps soothe my face after a shave. I find the tube difficult to manage because of the gel&#x27;s fluidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that TOBS has an alcohol-free after-shave to complement their peerless Sandalwood Shave Cream. I don&#x27;t know if the product is new or if I&#x27;ve just discovered it, but I&#x27;m delighted with it. It&#x27;s the perfect soothing finish to the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this aftershave and we both love the scent! He also uses the shaving cream and oil. The combination is perfect for him.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !! It soothes the skin and smells great. I get many compliments after a big hug.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is pricey but it has a very nice light texture, leaves your skin feeling very smooth, and has a very distinct old-timey barbershop smell.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood is the GREATEST smelling stuff!  I absolutely love the smell and my husband absolutely loves the product....the shaving soap too!!!!  Highly recommend you give this a try!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff because I love the TOBS sandalwood shave soap and was hoping to get an aftershave product that would have a similar scent.  To me, this stuff didn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all and I couldn&#x27;t detect any of the shave soap sandalwood smell in it.  On smell I give this a 3 out of 10.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having a smell wouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker if it performed really well as an aftershave.  I would say as far as how it feels on my skin it&#x27;s a 5 out of 10.  Not bad, and it provides a bit of a cooling feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Nivea&#x27;s excellent sensitive skin after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I certainly wouldn&#x27;t by this for the smell, and there&#x27;s way better products for the skin care.  I used it once and am returning it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute BEST smelling aftershave gel I have ever owned. Goes on good and absorbs fast leaving your skin feeling refreshed. Smell reminds me of going to the barbershop with my grandpaw when I was a kid. Will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> My go-to aftershave gel bar none.  The scent is subtle and very fresh, not a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scent but still gives a very clean fragrance.  I am a huge fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street, and this gel is on par with all of their excellent products.</li>
            <li> This after shave have a great scent and feels good on my face but the amount of product you get doesn&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
            <li> I like it, my wife hates the smell.

            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father who really likes the scent of sandalwood.  He was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but not a fan of this product.  Don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very soothing after shaving. Wish Taylor made more of a creamy balm type product in Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Just a dab will do, it will last for months.&lt;br /&gt;10 more words, here, and here, four more, last word.</li>
            <li> This lotion not only smells great, but really helps soothe my skin, even after I had a major razor burn incident (I, without thinking, did a full cross-grain pass across my chin with several short fast strokes after I had rinsed off the blade and hadn&#x27;t yet reapplied shaving cream).  Even though I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin (usually the opposite, fairly oily), it&#x27;s quite dry after shaving and this stuff does a good job at re-moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the classic Aftershave Balm (blue box) so I thought I&#x27;d try this sandalwood version. It&#x27;s horrible! It smells exactly like a toilet air freshener that they use at work. Really overpowering and offensive (to me) aroma. Will definitely not buy again, but will be buying the classic balm...I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love the scent.</li>
            <li> Best scent on the planet!</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood Aftershave gel does have a sandalwood aroma, but it is not quite the same as the TOBS shaving cream, the scents are similar but the shaving cream is a lot better.  The product is pretty good at what is does but don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly the same.  A little of the gel goes a long way, not sure I would buy again, but only because I was hoping the scent would be more similar to the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great after shave. Soothes my skin without the alcohol burn. Just a pea size dab is all you need. Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A very good aftershave gel! Anything that Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS) makes... is a cut above the rest... and this sandalwood after shave gel is no exception to the TOBS line of shaving products! Will buy again... to be sure...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with all of the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood line and this stuff really refreshes after a close shave.</li>
            <li> excellent will purchase again from this merchant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this product. The smell is good and not over powering. What I don&#x27;t like is that it dries leaving a white residue on my face, even with just using very little product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! Nothing beats the smell of Sandalwood and it works great too.</li>
            <li> Not as great of a product as I hoped for especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this after shave as a fathers day gift.  I also have the Taylor Sandalwood Shave Cream.  They complement each other well.  I really enjoy the fragrance.  My only recommendation if you are new to saftey razor shaving is get an alum block.</li>
            <li> The aftershave soothed my face and moisturized it quite nicely. I didn&#x27;t like the overpowering scent. I am a nurse so I can&#x27;t wear anything overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is our son&#x27;s favorite aftershave. It was a pleasure to find it on Amazon and that I could order it online and have it shipped to his home.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood smell is not as pleasant as other sandalwood products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I have used the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soaps for a while and enjoy them very much.  I recently decided to try this aftershave and right away was pleased with the compliments I started getting from friends at work and even strangers in the elevator.  It goes on smoothly, does not burn and dries cleanly (unlike some aftershaves that seem to leave a film on your face that sort of peels off alter).</li>
            <li> I enjoy all things TOBS. So I invested in this shave gel. I found it not to really have much of a TOBS scent at all if any. That was fine with me since  I own all their other products that do have that great sandalwood scent. The consistency of the product is thinner than say a hair gel might be. This is also a plus since it goes on very anonymously as it refreshes your face. A nice close shave (DE only for me) and some TOBS shave gel. Nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to deny that this,(Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel, 2.5-Ounce), well it is worth it! I have been using this for about two weeks now and the scent may only last a few hours it is fantastic and the ladies love it! The thing that makes it worth it to me (and most likely you) is how my face feels I shave very close I&#x27;m ex military and law enforcement so I shave really close. Normally I get dry skin and just splash on some alcohol and scream n&#x27; go but this never burns and my face in Just two weeks is as soft as a baby&#x27;s. RAZOR BURN no red face no pain hey this stuff is the best thing I have found in years! Please try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Deason, in Texas</li>
            <li> Love this.  Great Smell, and feels great after a shave</li>
            <li> This TOBS aftershave is the first aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a gel, not a liquid so it feels cool and soothing, leaving my skin nourished and refreshed. Again, I&#x27;ve never tried other aftershaves, including the liquid stlye aftershaves because I assume they&#x27;re alcohol based and therefore would dry out the skin (again, just my assumption).&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m pleased with this TOBS aftershave and will purchase more once I&#x27;m running low.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the scent, the sandalwood aroma smells good but it&#x27;s not exactly the same scent as the TOBS sandalwood shaving cream, which smells absolutely fantastic. But even thought the aftershave doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the shave cream, it still has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This has an odd antiseptic smell...nothing like sandlewood</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big TOBS shaving cream fan, so I had high expectations for this aftershave.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I see some other recent reviewers complain about the smell or the lack thereof.  That&#x27;s not my experience.  My tube smells great, just like classic sandalwood, and there&#x27;s plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes on nice and cool, which feels great after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying again when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a very manly smell to it. It also helps to condition my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this aftershave. The scent is great but not overpowering. You only need to apply a very small amount, so despite it being relatively expensive, it will last me a long time. I will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I love this and so does my wife!  It smells great, leaves my face feeling smooth and healthy.  The scent is not overpowering, but pleasant, and it lasts for several hours.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Not really what I would normally purchase and I doubt I will again. Kind of sticky not much aroma. I think it is a personal choice as to if you like or dislike it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good.  Makes you smell like a man, not a flower.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t hydrate/moisten my skin as much as I&#x27;d like it to.  The aftershave balms do a better job at that.  But this stuff still does a good job and it smells good so I&#x27;m all about it.</li>
            <li> Love the sandalwood scent on my face after I shave.</li>
            <li> It feels alright when I use it but i think there is one ingredient missing...SANDALWOOD! I was looking for a more affordable version of the AOS Sandalwood and was happy to find this; until I smelled it. It smells O.K., but it really doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the sandalwood I know. I guess i would recommend this product in general, but if you&#x27;re looking for the good old sandalwood scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Feels good when you apply but it is too costly for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite smelling aftershave, and the gel is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> great smell and prevents red bumps after shaving</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Soothes the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Im an every day shaver and even have to shave my head.  Ive tried endless creams and products on my head but it always left my head greasy and shiny (not a good look for a bald man).  This aftershave lotion is perfect.  It acts as a mild toner, lubricates the skin, and does NOT leave any kind of sheen.</li>
            <li> This came poorly packed and the gell leaked out of the tube, and the smell was so potent that I had to throw it out.  I tried to return it but was informed that this was a non reurnable product.  A complete  waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is great shave cream and works great with my straight razor.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street has great shaving products.  This is no exception.  The scent is great.  I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will be getting more.  Forget Art of shaving this is better and cheaper.  You love Sandalwood?  You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product feel and smell but, wont buy more because it contains triethanolamine. triethanolamine is listed under Schedule 3, part B of the Chemical Weapons Convention as it can be used in the manufacture of nitrogen mustards.</li>
            <li> Great product, zero alcohol. Just a little dab will do you! Will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST after shaves available anywhere at any price.  It has a classic aroma that brings you back to the barber shop days of old. Invigorating, masculine and clean...a little goes a long way.  It is soothing and cooling when applied and with a touch of witch hazel that acts as an astringent also. I cannot begin to tell you the number of compliments I received since applying Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave.  Unlike drug store aftershaves, this fragrance is not at all common and is most pleasing to men AND women who know and respect quality when they smell it.  When you look, feel and smell great...you know it is going to be a good day.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> TOBS makes great products period. I love the smell as well as it leaves my skin felling calm and moisturized. The smell is on the floral side for sandalwood but it&#x27;s moderate scent sticks around for awhile and is a pleasure too use. Highly recommended the only reason for 4 stars is the price is a bit high and the tube isn&#x27;t all that big but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Aftershave Gel is great stuff. It is not a “pure” Sandalwood fragrance but is a fragrance blend that works for me. It smells like a “classic” aftershave upscaled. It’s not overwhelming and a little goes a long way. I literally use a spot the size of my pinky nail after I shave and it lasts most of the day. Taylor of Bond Street products are not as inexpensive as some but I notice their aftershave and deodorant last a long time; meaning months instead of weeks. So from a cost effective standpoint they work for me.</li>
            <li> Meets my needs. Sandalwood a favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave I&#x27;ve usd!!!</li>
            <li> It just not get any better than this.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of the price vs size factor. However a very small amount, like a pea size, goes a long way. Has a pleasant smell and will not dehydrate your face.</li>
            <li> Great skin feel- goes on smooth to powedry dry finish extra ordinarily soothing&lt;br /&gt;Scent profile- sandalwood finish at first more tobacco pine b4 in tube</li>
            <li> It smells a lot more of witch-hazel than Sandalwood. I use this post shave then apply a scented aftershave like Old Spice or even use ToOBS&#x27;s sandalwood  preshave oil very diluted if i really want that delicious sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Love the Taylor on Old Bond Street products.  This is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for a special man in my life. I Love the scent. It is very clean &amp; masculine. I like making him smell good!! Makes me smile &amp; have sweet little evil thoughts!!!! This is an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin</li>
            <li> Nice sent , not overpowering, a good companion to the sandalwood shaving cream.</li>
