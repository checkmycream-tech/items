            <li>The pigments are rich and full of color and the shimmer is perfect.  </li>
            <li>OMG, I love this, they all came packaged and sealed nicely.</li>
            <li>You can have a neutral look or a bold bright look with these pigments.</li>
            <li>this is a very good product and you get alot of good product for not much money.i would tell anyone to get this</li>
            <li>The price was excellent, and I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>then you will love this for sure.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend someone be somewhat skilled in makeup application.  </li>
            <li>Many eye shodows, many colors.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start off by saying I love NYX brand.</li>
            <li>but if you love eye color like myself</li>
            <li>really love these in every color, they are the best loose eyeshadow I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>I love makeup, specially eyeshadow in bright vivid colors</li>
            <li>So, many color and fun.  </li>
            <li>They are inexpensive, good for experimental use.</li>
            <li>and it works like super glue while being smooth as silk and light as a feather.</li>
            <li>I bought the pack along with the NYX Eyeshadow Base White ESB01, and the colors looked even more beautiful and vivid, so I think it&#x27;s a very good call if you are looking for an impressive result that lasts longer ;)</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and actually stays on when I put it on.</li>
            <li>They were like $2.99 and I still thought it was a sweet deal.</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Really the only two words needed for these are beautiful and fun.  </li>
            <li>I use makeup every day, and the pressed eye shadow pallete would run out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Most products are comparable to the high dollar cosmetics, including this.</li>
            <li>But other than that i like pigments and there very nice colors.</li>
            <li>Though some colors only differ by a shade they look awesome on there own or mixed with an opposite color.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a good eye make-up remover, because the color can be hard to remove, depending on which one you are using.</li>
            <li>I should know I own about 35 different shades of the Mac shadows.</li>
            <li>Wow great product arrived quickly , these eyeshadows last all day and are pretty colors</li>
            <li>The pack has all the colors displayed on the seller&#x27;s picture (none of them repeated), and also a small brush, perfect to create those soft edges or merge two colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it takes very little product for great coverage.  </li>
            <li>These are very pigmented and blend very easily the only thing I wish is</li>
            <li>And shipping was surprisigly fast!</li>
            <li>The products to have shimmer to them and most people do prefer matte colors, but with a tiny amount of color the shimmer doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your eyes.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li>but otherwise you get exactly what you paid for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i will most def order again from the seller in the future.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are beautiful; ive been wearing different shades to wk everyday &amp; get compliments on how pretty they are.</li>
            <li>I got so much compliments when I wore them.</li>
            <li>They came faster than expected - maybe 4 days at the most.  </li>
            <li>but then I looked on YouTube and found how to really work with them.</li>
            <li>I often spill a lot when using no matter how careful I am with the twist off top.</li>
            <li>What am I going to do with 4 bottles of light blue eye shadow!</li>
            <li>You can dab exactly what you need onto an eye shadow brush with no waste.  </li>
            <li>Be ready to do the fold and reuse trick because that&#x27;s the only way you will be able to put the unused powder back in.</li>
            <li>As far as the product I love the NYX shadows, they ARE comparable to the mac loose powders.</li>
            <li>When I first found these fun little shimmery bottles at a local beauty store I fell in love.</li>
            <li>With a lid primer, the color is set all day even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>product.there are alot of collors for little money this would be on my top</li>
            <li>Also, since they come in the small bottle and tend to get everywhere, I bought stackable clear jars from Michaels craft store and depoted them for quick and easy storage and for use.</li>
            <li>First, they really are as tiny as they look</li>
            <li>so I bought these to try something new</li>
            <li>I was more than anxious to recieve these eyeshadow pigments...</li>
            <li>With the loose eye shadow I am still using my first purchase and its going onto a year already!</li>
            <li>Use a flat small concealer brush or a small eyeshadow brush like the 239MAC to pack it right on the lid or inner corner for a bright eye.</li>
            <li>Because of the loose texture of these shadows you really need to use an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and long lasting!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that tapping just what I need out onto a slick smooth surface such as a mirror or a cream jar lid is just the trick.  </li>
            <li>Needless, to really say in the end you&#x27;ll loose more shadow than you&#x27;ll use.</li>

            <li> I was hoping to receive a variety of colors but the colors were limited.</li>
            <li> They are loose shimmery or sparkly powders with lots of pigment and come in tons of fashionable colors.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are dupes for the MAC loose pigments.</li>
            <li> If only other brands would follow your idea!</li>
            <li> The wet method holds up a lot better, the dry is impossible to use.</li>
            <li> - i think such a small amount is needed that these will last the rest of my life</li>
            <li> and I have applied them both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> And it came before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> However, because the container bottle is so small the only way to use this is by dumping some powder on paper.</li>
            <li> Wish I had less blue and green!</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a little pricey a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> the base for the shadows still look better</li>
            <li> eye shadow was going to waste.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because when i got the package some had spilled and others that hadn&#x27;t spilled were missing lots of product.</li>
            <li> It can be messy</li>
            <li> They are a little too small for your brush.</li>
            <li> Its annoying and inconvenient to have to pour a little out @ a time just to use it :/ other than that i am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know they were going to be soooo SMALL.</li>
            <li> but I just dump some out into the cap or use one of my small detailing brushes...</li>
            <li> I use to use the cap, but it became very messy and</li>
            <li> They are also VERY SMALL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you and the deftness of hand whether you want subtle or pop results.  </li>
            <li> However, while the colors are highly pigmented, the little bottles are horrific in use and size.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows even with a primer are very hard to even out</li>
            <li> It was out of poor luck, just gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Well the quality is horrible, how can anyone even slightly compare this to MAC?</li>

            <li> Wow great product arrived quickly , these eyeshadows last all day and are pretty colors - i think such a small amount is needed that these will last the rest of my life lol</li>
            <li> Everyone said the delivery was soo quick and it was, eyeshadows are perfect and go on great A+</li>
            <li> So, many color and fun.  Wish I had less blue and green!</li>
            <li> I love makeup, specially eyeshadow in bright vivid colors so I bought these to try something new and they are Gorgeous!. The pack has all the colors displayed on the seller&#x27;s picture (none of them repeated), and also a small brush, perfect to create those soft edges or merge two colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these in every color, they are the best loose eyeshadow I&#x27;ve worn. I bought the pack along with the NYX Eyeshadow Base White ESB01, and the colors looked even more beautiful and vivid, so I think it&#x27;s a very good call if you are looking for an impressive result that lasts longer ;)</li>
            <li> I was hoping to receive a variety of colors but the colors were limited. I received like 5 or 6 different shades of each color. So I ended up getting like 4 or 5 colors in all. The product itself is really good though. The colors are bright and actually stays on when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I got so much compliments when I wore them. Id definitely recommend this to my friends. And shipping was surprisigly fast!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this eye shadow, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I have never used this product before but I love bright eye shadows! This product is wonderful! The colors are very vibrant and long lasting! Make sure you have a good eye make-up remover, because the color can be hard to remove, depending on which one you are using. I would recommend this product to anyone that is not afraid to use bright colors on their eyes!</li>
            <li> The Pigments were as described.  30 colors, no duplicates. They came faster than expected - maybe 4 days at the most.  The price was excellent, and I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> this is a very good product and you get alot of good product for not much money.i would tell anyone to get this product.there are alot of collors for little money this would be on my top ten.if you like makeup then you will love this for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought these eye shadows back in August. It was out of poor luck, just gave it a shot. AND I LOVE THEM! I use makeup every day, and the pressed eye shadow pallete would run out so quickly. With the loose eye shadow I am still using my first purchase and its going onto a year already! You can have a neutral look or a bold bright look with these pigments. The products to have shimmer to them and most people do prefer matte colors, but with a tiny amount of color the shimmer doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your eyes. Even a smoky eye is gorgeous, that lasts All day! One issue is the containers. They are a little too small for your brush. I use to use the cap, but it became very messy and eye shadow was going to waste. So I purchased a case of reusable containers. And it works perfect! GREAT JOB NYX! If only other brands would follow your idea!</li>
            <li> When I first found these fun little shimmery bottles at a local beauty store I fell in love. They were like $2.99 and I still thought it was a sweet deal. They are loose shimmery or sparkly powders with lots of pigment and come in tons of fashionable colors. Last FOREVER. The neons and golds make awesome highlight colors and there are lots of nudes and smokies for a more neutral look. Don&#x27;t forget the primer!!! Because of the loose texture of these shadows you really need to use an eyeshadow primer. I&#x27;d recommend Urban Decay cause even though it&#x27;s a little pricey a little goes a long way and it works like super glue while being smooth as silk and light as a feather.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because when i got the package some had spilled and others that hadn&#x27;t spilled were missing lots of product. They are also VERY SMALL. Didn&#x27;t know they were going to be soooo SMALL. But other than that i like pigments and there very nice colors. They are inexpensive, good for experimental use.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and so many colors to choose from. I will being doing a review on them on Youtube Channel @ bsbeautymix</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are dupes for the MAC loose pigments. I bought this almost 2 years ago and had no idea what I was doing with them but then I looked on YouTube and found how to really work with them. They are shimmery and pearl like.. I sometimes apply the NYX pigment over my lid after I&#x27;ve already placed my eyeshadow color to give it that extra pop.. Use a flat small concealer brush or a small eyeshadow brush like the 239MAC to pack it right on the lid or inner corner for a bright eye. Also, since they come in the small bottle and tend to get everywhere, I bought stackable clear jars from Michaels craft store and depoted them for quick and easy storage and for use.</li>
            <li> Really the only two words needed for these are beautiful and fun.  If you&#x27;ve never used them before, I would recommend buying 1 or 2 individuals and trying them out.  The pigments are rich and full of color and the shimmer is perfect.  I would also recommend someone be somewhat skilled in makeup application.  You don&#x27;t have to be an expert but it helps to have an idea of blending and brushes.  It can be messy but I&#x27;ve found that tapping just what I need out onto a slick smooth surface such as a mirror or a cream jar lid is just the trick.  You can dab exactly what you need onto an eye shadow brush with no waste.  I&#x27;ve also found that it takes very little product for great coverage.  The colors are beautiful, especially nice to have shimmered lids in the summer with tanned skin.  It&#x27;s up to you and the deftness of hand whether you want subtle or pop results.  With a lid primer, the color is set all day even in high humidity.  You don&#x27;t have to be in your twenties to wear these gorgeous colors, you just have to know what your doing.</li>
            <li> Cute, and perfect.  Many eye shodows, many colors.  We used it as giveaway at baby shower.  Great hit.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful no duplicates and they last forever I got them within four days of ordering. These are very pigmented and blend very easily the only thing I wish is the hole was a tad bigger but I just dump some out into the cap or use one of my small detailing brushes...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off by saying I love NYX brand. Most products are comparable to the high dollar cosmetics, including this. However, while the colors are highly pigmented, the little bottles are horrific in use and size. First, they really are as tiny as they look but if you love eye color like myself I guess you won&#x27;t send it back based on that. However, because the container bottle is so small the only way to use this is by dumping some powder on paper. Be ready to do the fold and reuse trick because that&#x27;s the only way you will be able to put the unused powder back in. Needless, to really say in the end you&#x27;ll loose more shadow than you&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> Great quality eyeshadow. I now have an eyeshadow color for any and every occasion and outfit possible. The only thing that I would change is the container the eyeshadow comes in. I often spill a lot when using no matter how careful I am with the twist off top.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
            <li> I am just trying to warn anyone else who buys this. You get 30 bottle of DUPLICATES. You do NOT get 30 colors like it says I got 14 color. What am I going to do with 4 bottles of light blue eye shadow! I am not Mimi! As far as the product I love the NYX shadows, they ARE comparable to the mac loose powders. I should know I own about 35 different shades of the Mac shadows.</li>
            <li> Well the quality is horrible, how can anyone even slightly compare this to MAC? I had these eye shadows for two weeks now and I have applied them both wet and dry. The wet method holds up a lot better, the dry is impossible to use. The eyeshadows even with a primer are very hard to even out and they are not smooth and look very cakey. This is a great set for someone who is a beginner and needs to explore but otherwise you get exactly what you paid for.</li>
            <li> OMG, I love this, they all came packaged and sealed nicely. And it came before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I just love these eye shadows! Though some colors only differ by a shade they look awesome on there own or mixed with an opposite color. Color lasts all day and i do not use a primer before applying. They were also larger containers then i had in mind. This would make a great gift to anyone that loves to play with makeup!</li>
            <li> A girlfriend and.I split the colors up and paid 20 dollars each and split them up 50/50. We.got 15 each. Awesomely pigmented, beautiful shadows. Plus they&#x27;ll last FOREVER!! Very pleased with my decision. ;)</li>
            <li> SUPER!!bright!sparkle! excellent flow on forever and stay all day. I advise everyone! the base for the shadows still look better</li>
            <li> I was more than anxious to recieve these eyeshadow pigments... my bf got them for me as a bday gift and i was more than happy... All of the colors are beautiful; ive been wearing different shades to wk everyday &amp; get compliments on how pretty they are. The one thing i would change is the packaging of the product. Its annoying and inconvenient to have to pour a little out @ a time just to use it :/ other than that i am very pleased with the product. i will most def order again from the seller in the future.</li>
