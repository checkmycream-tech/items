            <li> Very good price and fast shipping.  This perfume also has my very nostalgic memory from the past.  I&#x27;m glad I found this perfume.</li>
            <li> After Coty discontinued their Wild Musk Oil, I had to find a new favorite scent. This is it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and like the spray bottles. I have gotten many compliments and my husband says he loves the fragrance also. When I run out, I will order it again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. This is here favorite fragrance, and it stands up to her scrutiny. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Always fairly priced and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and vintage. I do not want to smell like everyone else that is wearing the same fashion trendy Mall perfume. This is a classic. Smells great and The price is right. The scents stay fresh on your body for a long time. A little bit goes a long way. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with this transaction. The Perfume arrived very fast, and I got the bottle I requested. Just some complains because of some damages to the perfume&#x27;s box, but the bottle is intact. I thought it is better to sell this kind of things (perfumes, etc.) in carton box, not in the bubbled envelop. Otherwise, I very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are making the sent weaker or what but everyone in my family agrees~ it doesn&#x27;t smell right!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Great to do business with you.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, It&#x27;s her absolute favorite perfume! She&#x27;s been wearing it for yrs..A loyal customer. I like this bottle better then the standard tube shape.</li>
            <li> Great gift and good service . This is one of those things that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was true to old scent unlike the Ambush I got here. Loved the bottle too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people say they can&#x27;t wear Tabu, it smells terrible on them - but it smells great on me, so it&#x27;s obviously not for everyone.  I like it - it has a lingering effervescent, mildly spicy scent that lingers well into the afternoon and goes well with my body chemistry.  I&#x27;m a big BIG fan.</li>
            <li> Tabu is what I&#x27;ve been using since 1976.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent 30 years ago and I still do.  It is very strong though so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the only perfume I wear</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff - she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since I was in highschool and it is still my favorite!  The price was excellent, the service was fast.  Will reorder as soon as I start getting low.</li>
            <li> Every year I buy Tabu for my wife for her birthday. It&#x27;s her &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent, as I suppose it is for many women.&lt;br /&gt;But, if thats what the wifey wants, thats what she gets.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it every year, the same item, from the same place.... Tabu By Dana for Women, 3 Ounce [Misc.]&lt;br /&gt;Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt;$17.29.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the collectible style &amp;#34;Violin&amp;#34; bottle, (as opposed to the 3 oz., square-ish, not very interesting spray bottle), and has amassed quite the collection of pretty, empty bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the buyer, I like that it comes (I believe) directly from Amazon, and the price is always right. I trust Amazon to package and deliver any item I buy with speed and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a special woman in your life, and want to treat her to something special, (and not break the bank), Tabu by Dana is the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, and you get rewarded twice over by your lady for buying her such a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;You know what I&#x27;m saying, right fella&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t think to look at how big this bottle was going to be, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I got for the price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you have never worn Tabu, it&#x27;s time to try it! I have been wearing it since the early 1970&#x27;s and literally everyday get compliments!  Great scent ot wear to work because it does not smother people in the office. I will buy it as long as they make it!!! Let me know when there is a sale so I can stock up!</li>
            <li> Tabu By Dan is great. This is my favorite perfume I have be wearing this stuff for so many years.</li>
            <li> Took me back in a flash. What a great scent. My daughter loved it also, so I had to order it again, this time in a Dana gift set. What a great scent, like no other.</li>
