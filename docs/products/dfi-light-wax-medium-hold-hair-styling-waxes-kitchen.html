            <li>/&gt;Short Sexy Hair Rocked Out</li>
            <li>this is a wax, in reality it feels more like a glue or paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, and I love the way it smells, too.</li>
            <li>...make it look healthy even though it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I shower, dry my hair, rub a bit of this into my hands and work it through my hair, and it works great!</li>
            <li>There were many Amazon sellers I could choose from, and, when I did, my products arrived in a few days in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Easy styles hair into a pieced look.</li>
            <li>I have relatively fine hair, but plenty of it.</li>
            <li>Light stickiness and does a great hold for short and non-strong hair.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazingly light weight product and gets the job done even in the rainy Northwest.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, non sticky, FANTASTIC formula.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this product at Beauty First or Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was cheaper then the company website and arrived quickly.</li>

            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>First off it states</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li>I loved the way it held and added definition without being heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My hair is very use</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it smells great.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, and very straight, and this stuff picks it right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used d:fi for many years on my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product for short hair - use only a little and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It works better than other similar products I tried before.  </li>
            <li>The hair wax holds your hair and blends in softly.  </li>
            <li>I really like it but local beauty supply stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.  </li>
            <li>This does a Greta job without leaving any stickiness and no sheen finish..makes the hair have a natural hold look.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t gooey like the medium hold wax with the green top, made by the same company.</li>
            <li>product works well if you have straight hair and use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes after using the flat iron the hair needs a polish so that it looks more natural and less dry.  </li>
            <li>This is not a great product; it&#x27;s not really even a good product.</li>
            <li>I am african american hair that sometimes has some flywaways after a rollerset, I apply a little of this and my hair looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy short hair and all I do is shower, air dry and throw some wax in</li>

            <li> it really keeps my style going all day and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that controls my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> product is not cheap but you only need a little bit of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are usually several vendors on Amazon and you usually have different places available.</li>
            <li> I especially like that the result doesn&#x27;t look stiff so your hair still looks sleek and natural.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that I can no longer find it in stores, only on line.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I now could not live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya, so I anticipate this lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> second complaint I had with it was how greasy looking it left my hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all day wet hair look then this would be the product for you.</li>
            <li> With looking like you have wet hair</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair, and this wax keeps my hair styled while looking natural.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, and I apply a little of this once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s old and outdated</li>
            <li> I also use this when I wear a pony tail to lay my edges down.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something with little to no shine, stay away.</li>
            <li> I found if you use a little dab and rub it in your palms before putting it on your hair, it works well.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dfi was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Found this as the bets alternative after a few trial s and errors.  </li>
            <li> Any products I use to try to make it look less dry and thin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up or get my hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in my town, but it became unavailable in the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on Amazon reviews, which are usually quite reliable.</li>
            <li> and he can keep molding his hair all day on the small amount he uses in the morning</li>
            <li> made it look greasy and very heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it seems when I grow it longer than my shoulders, it looks thin and frizzy, not very healthy at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years, but found that it is less expensive if I buy it online (and NOT from my hairdresser).</li>
            <li> Makes your hair a little on the sticky side and feels sort of dirty</li>
            <li> Too shiny and not a great hold</li>
            <li> Of all the products I have used this particular product is among the worst.</li>
            <li> In this case, however, I think the majority of the reviewers got it wrong.</li>
            <li> too bad because i bought three jars of it.</li>

            <li> I can not live without this product.  I have naturally wavy short hair and all I do is shower, air dry and throw some wax in and my hair doesn&#x27;t need to be touched for the rest of the day.  Not too heavy.  Just a right texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used d:fi for many years on my thin, fine hair.  It works better than other similar products I tried before.  It doesn&#x27;t build up or get my hair sticky or stiff.  I used to buy this product in my town, but it became unavailable in the past 6 months.  So I went to Amazon to find it.  There were many Amazon sellers I could choose from, and, when I did, my products arrived in a few days in perfect condition.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Easy styles hair into a pieced look. Not sticky or heavy.  Have tried other products but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this  hair wax. The hair wax holds your hair and blends in softly.  It isn&#x27;t gooey like the medium hold wax with the green top, made by the same company.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly light weight product and gets the job done even in the rainy Northwest. I especially like that the result doesn&#x27;t look stiff so your hair still looks sleek and natural.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. I use it as a molding paste for my short hair. A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This hair wax is awesome it really keeps my style going all day and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> love it I use it a lot wish it came in a bigger amount. maybe a 3 pack would be nice</li>
            <li> Great product for short hair - use only a little and lasts all day.  My hairstylist uses this on her clients.</li>
            <li> Best hair wax I&#x27;ve found yet. I&#x27;d highly recommend it! The only down side is that I can no longer find it in stores, only on line.</li>
            <li> Have been buying stuff for years. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at my barber. My hair is very use it blows all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;The product is not cheap but you only need a little bit of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are usually several vendors on Amazon and you usually have different places available.</li>
            <li> I now could not live without this stuff. I have wavy/curly hair, and I apply a little of this once my hair is dry. It calms the frizz and helps me shape my hair like I want. Love it!</li>
            <li> Provides a good hold, not too stiff or light. Best for short hair, doesn&#x27;t hold that well for anything longer than 3-4 inches.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on Amazon reviews, which are usually quite reliable. In this case, however, I think the majority of the reviewers got it wrong. This is not a great product; it&#x27;s not really even a good product. I have relatively fine hair, but plenty of it. This does nothing to give my hair volume, make it stick out or allow me to &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short Sexy Hair Rocked Out does a much better job of giving my hair volume and hold, with Bedhead Manipulator being a good backup product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dfi was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about what products I use in my hair. I&#x27;ve used numerous brands in all different price ranges. Of all the products I have used this particular product is among the worst. First off it states this is a wax, in reality it feels more like a glue or paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second complaint I had with it was how greasy looking it left my hair. If you are looking for an all day wet hair look then this would be the product for you. If you are looking for something with little to no shine, stay away. With looking like you have wet hair it also means your hair will be shiny as it left my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would not recommend this product, nor will I buy it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple years ago after my hairdresser used it on my hair.  I really like it but local beauty supply stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.  Glad I could find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair, and this wax keeps my hair styled while looking natural. The scent is mildly pleasant.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore so I ordered it on amazon. it&#x27;s not the same. i think it&#x27;s old and outdated, therefore doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;as it should. too bad because i bought three jars of it.</li>
            <li> great product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li> Non greasy, non sticky, FANTASTIC formula.  The best!</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly.  It&#x27;s really the best hair wax for any length hair on the market that I have come across.  It also smells great.  I used to be able to buy this product at Beauty First or Ulta.  I can now only find it online.  Thank God!  I thought it was no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well if you have straight hair and use a flat iron.  Sometimes after using the flat iron the hair needs a polish so that it looks more natural and less dry.  d:fi with the yellow lid will do that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years, but found that it is less expensive if I buy it online (and NOT from my hairdresser). I shower, dry my hair, rub a bit of this into my hands and work it through my hair, and it works great! It is not sticky, and I love the way it smells, too. My hair is short, and very straight, and this stuff picks it right up. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that controls my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  This is the only product that I use to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months. I got it from a friend who cut my hair. I loved the way it held and added definition without being heavy. When i started getting low, i looked everywhere and no local stores sold it. Thank Goodness for Amazon. It was cheaper then the company website and arrived quickly. thanks</li>
            <li> When we lost one brand as it went out of business.  Found this as the bets alternative after a few trial s and errors.  Light stickiness and does a great hold for short and non-strong hair.  This does a Greta job without leaving any stickiness and no sheen finish..makes the hair have a natural hold look.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it seems when I grow it longer than my shoulders, it looks thin and frizzy, not very healthy at all. Any products I use to try to make it look less dry and thin made it look greasy and very heavy. This wax did not. It did exactly what I wanted it to do...make it look healthy even though it isn&#x27;t. A little dab will do ya, so I anticipate this lasting a very long time. It also has a pleasant lemon grass like smell, which is a plus. I would highly recommend this to anyone with thin hair. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair a little on the sticky side and feels sort of dirty so you must use sparingly.  I found if you use a little dab and rub it in your palms before putting it on your hair, it works well.</li>
            <li> It the best product for holding my hubby&#x27;s gorgeous hair. It&#x27;s not heavy very light and he can keep molding his hair all day on the small amount he uses in the morning</li>
            <li> Too shiny and not a great hold</li>
            <li> This wax provides a light hold that is very flexible. I am african american hair that sometimes has some flywaways after a rollerset, I apply a little of this and my hair looks fabulous. I also use this when I wear a pony tail to lay my edges down. A little goes a long way and it smells great.</li>
