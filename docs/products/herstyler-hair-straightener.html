            <li>Good price hope it lasts</li>
            <li>Good straightener for the money.</li>
            <li>She loved it.  </li>
            <li>It was a good price</li>
            <li>Even after 4 years it still works just as good as it did the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>Great product for the price..would be nice if it had a automatic shut off..</li>
            <li>This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>worked good for a while then shorted out.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good straightener but not longer than a year because after awhile there was a burnt smell to it and the plates are coming apart.</li>
            <li>and she loved the design but loved the results on her hair even more!</li>
            <li>so I was using the Remington wet/dry - surprisingly the Remington does a better job than the Herstyler!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very cute and works well - I&#x27;ve used this straightener for about two years now &amp; have had no issues.</li>
            <li>We were very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>she says it is great and &amp;#34;thanks dad&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li>Gets very very hot though, although she doesn&#x27;t mind she is a weave expert!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this straightener!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li>This also produced lovely curls!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love itttttt!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied purchaser!</li>
            <li>My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more!</li>
            <li>If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity!</li>
            <li>There is better!  </li>
            <li>Then again, love the straightener!</li>
            <li>It came very quickly, like in 2 days and it works great.</li>
            <li>It works fine and it is attractive</li>
            <li>I loved it, im sure you will too! :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It heats up amazingly, and I have had it for almost two years now</li>
            <li>The price was very affordable and it works great!</li>
            <li>I bought this product and the plates on the edges of the straightener make it look, well kind of... used.</li>
            <li>LMAO</li>
            <li>but im still kind of upset they lied..</li>
            <li>It heats up to 400 degrees which I&#x27;m sure can not be good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT THE KIND</li>
            <li>and it seemed nice.</li>
            <li>The product came in excellent condition and smelled brand new.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It is a great straightener, and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>it heats up nicely :)</li>
            <li>Was a great gift, much loved, by 18 year old daughter of friend.</li>
            <li>This styler started out great but started losing heat capabilities pretty soon.</li>
            <li>But its super cute, gets really hot, and straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up very quickly and works much better then the Conair we own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad I bought it on Amazon instead of in the mall because the price was wayyyy better</li>
            <li>Love the zebra print.</li>
            <li>She said they were so much better than the $100</li>
            <li>I love this herstyler.</li>
            <li>I love my Herstyler Hair Straightener.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if it had heat settings it would be better but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK, even at that price.</li>
            <li>I have used many hair straighteners and this one is among one of the top.</li>
            <li>The print is really cute too.</li>
            <li>I would also like it more if it had adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So beyond that, I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I tried the straightener yesterday and it made my hair so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>and I love hat</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s zebra print because it makes it so much more fashionable.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER.   </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the zebra style too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it for more than a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>so it works alot better on my hair</li>
            <li>i love the zebra</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>would pay triple what I paid for it and still be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Sure it says you are getting the Herstyle one</li>
            <li>but I must warn you it works better the more you use it.</li>
            <li>It is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made the only reason I am replacing it now with</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister &amp; since I had purchased one at the mall before for over $100 seeing this product on amazon for this price made me want to buy it more.</li>
            <li>I have already used it and just love it.</li>
            <li>we both LOVE them..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I wish it had more than an \\&quot;off/on\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>The product does not have any worthwhile features.</li>
            <li>TO COMPARE THE FEATURES, SO YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANTED :)</li>
            <li>I use this every day and just love it.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once.</li>
            <li>I love this straightner</li>
            <li>i have used many</li>
            <li>straightner is ok, bought for a backup.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would be able to afford something like this.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic and the deal of the year for me!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Should hold up better.</li>
            <li>found this product on thier website and am so glad I found it here for a much better price.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the straihhtner to an extent.</li>
            <li>it be better for people with less&lt;br /&gt;hair and thinner</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone in their right mind would think this is a good straightener.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find such a good deal!</li>
            <li>She has not used it yet but was very excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.. and a great price too.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t quite as hot as I was expecting but still a good straightener</li>
            <li>and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>So decide for yourself whats worth more!</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the fact that it got hot as soon as it was plugged in and it got VERY hot.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly just to straight my hair, and it works excellent.</li>
            <li>It has a very cool design and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>Such a great purchase for such a great price!</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener recently and loved it!  </li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>I have a large one, but this one is perfect for traveling and for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot but not too hot.</li>
            <li>Is iron is ok not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Wonderful for black womens hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and it NEVER snags my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>This has smoothed out my naturally curly hair into a sleek straight look, but it is also great for touching up my curls.</li>
            <li>The straightener made my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>Couple it with their products (I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the serum), and you get silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It works fabulous</li>
            <li>and it was great, but only lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because of only one heat setting, but she has already used it and said it&#x27;s great and loves it.</li>
            <li>The cheap one you get isn&#x27;t even up to par with the cheap ones you can get at Walmart</li>
            <li>It works well and fabulous</li>
            <li>It was fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It lease her hair so smooth</li>
            <li>I bought this hair straightener back in July and it worked great for a while, but now it wont stay on while im trying to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and worth the money</li>
            <li>The straighterner heated up fast which I liked so</li>
            <li>It works smoothly.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly over my hair and makes it nice and straight.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my niece and so far so good, she loves the zebra print, and the package it came in.</li>
            <li>This is a complete knock off straightener, the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>it says its 30$ and originally 300$?</li>
            <li>I love this straightener because it heats up fast, arrived in a timely manner, and the product works!</li>
            <li>I had tried many out in the mall before finally buying one of my own on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing to die for so much I recommend to buy this product right away love it so much a lot</li>
            <li>and she wanted this one in particular because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>It works really good on her extra curly hair!  </li>
            <li>My sister got this straightener for full price at the Galleria.</li>
            <li>well I love it so much</li>
            <li>but this one works very well the top straightner i have ever used.....</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this straighter is its zebra.</li>
            <li>We have used several brands and this one is a good one.  </li>
            <li>But as far as being quick and effective...</li>
            <li>The red light that indicates that it is on has never worked and that is kind of bothersome.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it that when it came to the door I went and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really smooth  and does the job very fast .</li>
            <li>Other than the print coming off pretty fast, this works great:)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>works well and does get very hot.</li>
            <li>everyone loves the new straightener better than any others they&#x27;ve had...</li>
            <li>The straightener is just too hot!</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews that said it was so hot !</li>
            <li>For thicker llonger hair ladies this one is only ok !</li>
            <li>This takes my naturally curly long hair to silky smoothe straight in seconds, trust me, I think this is the best straightner I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses it everyday and is happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a cheap box with not even a real product name.</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft, i recommend this to everybody :)</li>
            <li>Powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I got the real herstyler at such a good price.</li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on something useful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work much better, but OK for $25.00.</li>
            <li>I tried it out and it pulled my hair out of my head and was super hot and burned it, and made me hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>My wife was thrilled to have the flat iron she wanted</li>
            <li>When I found it on Amazon for around $30, I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>I returned it right after.</li>
            <li>it looks right.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone needing a fantastic, durable and reliable straightner.</li>
            <li>It gets dirty easily, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>, I get my hair straight so easily now and it heats up fast</li>
            <li>Since using the Herstyler, my hair has looked great without any smoothing hair products and it stays slick throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to use ANY hot tools on your hair WITHOUT a heat protector spray, you&#x27;re not doing it right</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>I need the hot heat so the fact that it has no temp control is not a problem.</li>
            <li>was my first review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way to hot.</li>
            <li>My daughter not only loves the cute zebra print</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li>screeching hot.</li>
            <li>I have the purple 1\\&quot; using it 2nd year now, and it start heating up a bit more on the fingers</li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied with this hair straightener, I dont only get to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time before an outdoor sporting event.</li>
            <li>The zebra paint also started chipping on the first use.</li>
            <li>I just received it 4 days ago and it smells like it gets way to hot.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>I feel like it gets too hot</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying one at the kiosk at the mall!</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend this to anyone !!</li>
            <li>and it got pretty hot which made me feel like it would work.</li>
            <li>doesnt get hot enough,my daughter is disapointed.</li>
            <li>Was way to hot and didn&#x27;t clap onto my hair all the way.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>The item was delivered on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have ever bought</li>
            <li>i feel it doesnt get as hot as it says it does.</li>
            <li>There is no temperature setting, so the straightener does not get hot enough&lt;</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, works like a charm!</li>
            <li>and I have tried several different flat irons and this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Although I love this flat iron...</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely loving my new flat iron</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a wrong way of me using the zebra straightener, even though i don&#x27;t hold it in the front part while using it, it shouldn&#x27;t HEAT that much that u feel it trough the plastic.</li>
            <li>A late review, but I have had this flat iron for 2 years and it has worked beautifully!</li>
            <li>so I need a straightener that&#x27;s going to heat up hot and be fast to use.</li>
            <li>and so I tried my other straightener and it just smelled like regular hair burning (lol).</li>
            <li>Glides through hair easily and doesn&#x27;t require going over the same chunk of hair over and over til</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have chosen my Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair straightener,it heats immediately ,successfully straightens &amp; smooths  my short thick hair &amp; my daughter&#x27;s long locks.</li>
            <li>Works great, good quality,  and less expensive than in a stores.</li>
            <li>My natural wavy hair stayed as straight as a board!!</li>
            <li>I opened it up only to find that the quality of the product is beyond cheap and looked very</li>
            <li>My wife saw these at the kiosk in the mall and really wanted one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>So, Yeah too much...</li>
            <li>It gets it done fast</li>
            <li>she picked this and got it fast for christmas.</li>
            <li>It came with a box to put it away in and that is very convenient as well.</li>
            <li>I like this hair straighter, but I really wish it had a temperature changing option.</li>
            <li>but I can tell it is made very well</li>
            <li>I have straight hair to begin with</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that the product heats up fast and straightens hair really really well.</li>
            <li>I run through really fast.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very like it.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>This straightener did not quite do the job in getting it straight.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the rotating electric cord</li>
            <li>the product does make my hair straight and it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>The Zebra stribes are very hip to.</li>
            <li>it to look pin straight</li>
            <li>I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li>African american hair straightened nicely.</li>
            <li>Her Styler is suppose to be such a &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34; brand of flat iron to own, so I thought.</li>
            <li>and my hair has never been so flat and smooth unless I go to a salon.</li>
            <li>When it arrived that box wasnt damaged and the flat iron itself got hot quick.</li>
            <li>Damp hair or dry, this is sweet!</li>
            <li>And it looks full not flat like some straighteners do.</li>
            <li>it gets really hot to my old one</li>
            <li>My daughter straightened her hair while watching tv on the couch, laid it down while grabbing more hair and burnt my microfiber couch</li>
            <li>I had would do amazing curls and silly smooth straightening</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great as a curler - only negative comment she also had was the fact that there is no temp control -</li>
            <li>Yes, there is only one heat setting and it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>My Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair Straightener exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am a older retired hairdresser and I&#x27;ve used a lot of tools.</li>
            <li>but the classic zebra from the customer is not the classic zebra.</li>
            <li>Not only have I straightened my hair with I also curried it and my curls turn out very pretty (like beachy curls)</li>
            <li>The one I have doesn&#x27;t heat up high, and doesn&#x27;t straighten well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the straightener is too hot if you have natural hair or even if you&#x27;re a person that wants to take good care of there hair, this much heat is UNNECESSARY!</li>
            <li>For the money I expected it to be decent, cheap but decent.</li>
            <li>A complete knockoff!!</li>
            <li>but you definitly won&#x27;t have to worry about it getting hot enough to get your straight.</li>
            <li>The only problem is you can&#x27;t control the temperature, but based on the price,it definitely worth to buy.</li>
            <li>It works great, straightens my hair in no time at all (and I have long, thick hair).</li>
            <li>Retails for about $300 normally</li>
            <li>Good, not great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low number of reviews and the major price drop of the straightener from it&#x27;s original price</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron, I really can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>It arrived a day before expected &amp; came in the original package box sealed with plastic.</li>
            <li>It is not as smooth on my hair as other iron&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li>This new straighter works just as well as the $100 dollar one form the mall</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get my new one from amazon.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>but I was very please with how fast it was delivered considering it was a standard delivery.</li>
            <li>and it was hardly hot enough to straighten it.</li>
            <li>I chose a one star rating because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have owned a Her Styler b 4 the exact same as this one and the plates came unglued</li>
            <li>I bought the exact same iron from a kiosk in the mall 4 years ago for $300.  </li>
            <li>This straighter does not get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I also use a protective spray prior to use and it is still just too hot.</li>
            <li>same exact styler told the hair sales lady at mall</li>
            <li>It get very hot quickly and it works wonders on my thick course hair.</li>
            <li>It works great on thick hair, hair that you just blow dried, and takes the frizz right out in only one pass.</li>
            <li>Got the zebra few days ago and as pretty and fun as it looks, it gets even HOTTER on the fingers than my purple one.</li>
            <li>the same exact iron is because it is beginning to look old.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and is wide enough to get a lot of my hair at a time.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and makes my thick hair so soft and straight.</li>
            <li>I purchased this straightener, like a christmas gift for my wife, who has natural curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;She told me rating this item with 5 stars, because truly flatten her hair...</li>
            <li>My 12 year old niece is VERRY picky.</li>
            <li>Im only replacing it because of unavoidable damage through dying my hair amd using it so much.</li>
            <li>It got really humid, poured rain, cooled off, and repeated that process several times.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any young girl or woman.</li>
            <li>I have had it about a month  so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the Chi, and when I came across this one I couldn&#x27;t resist the fun zebra design, and low, low price!</li>
            <li>The Herstyler is perfect for thick hair, but because it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control setting, I would not recommend it for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Other then that it straighten and curls well worth the price i got it at.</li>
            <li>I have super thick and curly hair, so it is kind of hard to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it two times and it was heating so hot that it actually burned the outside of the iron.  </li>
            <li>I have long and thick hair and couldnt believe how nice the iron made it.</li>
            <li>Only stays at a high heat setting.</li>
            <li>Straightens my whole hair in less than 40 minutes and my hair is very long(almost under my bottom)</li>
            <li>I get no flyaways and my hair stays perfectly straight all day long.</li>
            <li>The guys at the kiosk started off asking $150 and eventually got down to $100, but I got the exact same product on Amazon much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>thin, 1-inch plates make it easy to curl your hair, too!</li>
            <li>My daughter is a hair stylist and highly recommend that I get this flat iron</li>
            <li>I looked at reviews and this flat iron comes highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I have seen my share of cheap straighteners but this was beyond the most atrocious I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>When I look for a flat iron I want one that will give me flat hair without too much work</li>
            <li>Especially for not having a temperature control, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and this straightener totally does its job!!!</li>
            <li>But thing is, if you have very curly, curly hair, I suggest to use heat protector and to not straighten when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li>The girl and the kiosk made a nice bouncy curl in my hair, but I have been unable to replicate it at home.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so this is not good for me.</li>
            <li>She loves it how hot it gets she uses it everyday</li>
            <li>the first time i used it i was worried but it redemed itself on the second round.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and for thick curly hair it just won&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li>I was straightening a small section of hair in the back of my hair and my hair burned right off -_-...</li>
            <li>So I just endured it until I finished my whole head, and mind you my hair is very thick, and very curly</li>

            <li> and she loved it</li>
            <li> worked good for a while then shorted out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener but not longer than a year because after awhile there was a burnt smell to it and the plates are coming apart.</li>
            <li> and she loved the design but loved the results on her hair even more!</li>
            <li> so I was using the Remington wet/dry - surprisingly the Remington does a better job than the Herstyler!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute and works well - I&#x27;ve used this straightener for about two years now &amp; have had no issues.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> This also produced lovely curls!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love itttttt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied purchaser!</li>
            <li> My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more!</li>
            <li> If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity!</li>
            <li> There is better!  </li>
            <li> Then again, love the straightener!</li>
            <li> It came very quickly, like in 2 days and it works great.</li>
            <li> It works fine and it is attractive</li>
            <li> I loved it, im sure you will too! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It heats up amazingly, and I have had it for almost two years now</li>
            <li> The price was very affordable and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the plates on the edges of the straightener make it look, well kind of... used.</li>
            <li> LMAO</li>
            <li> but im still kind of upset they lied..</li>
            <li> It heats up to 400 degrees which I&#x27;m sure can not be good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT THE KIND</li>
            <li> and it seemed nice.</li>
            <li> The product came in excellent condition and smelled brand new.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It is a great straightener, and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> it heats up nicely :)</li>
            <li> Was a great gift, much loved, by 18 year old daughter of friend.</li>
            <li> This styler started out great but started losing heat capabilities pretty soon.</li>
            <li> But its super cute, gets really hot, and straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up very quickly and works much better then the Conair we own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad I bought it on Amazon instead of in the mall because the price was wayyyy better</li>
            <li> Love the zebra print.</li>
            <li> She said they were so much better than the $100</li>
            <li> I love this herstyler.</li>
            <li> I love my Herstyler Hair Straightener.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if it had heat settings it would be better but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK, even at that price.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair straighteners and this one is among one of the top.</li>
            <li> The print is really cute too.</li>
            <li> I would also like it more if it had adjustable heat settings.</li>

            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> would pay triple what I paid for it and still be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Sure it says you are getting the Herstyle one</li>
            <li> but I must warn you it works better the more you use it.</li>
            <li> It is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made the only reason I am replacing it now with</li>
            <li> Love this....</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister &amp; since I had purchased one at the mall before for over $100 seeing this product on amazon for this price made me want to buy it more.</li>
            <li> I have already used it and just love it.</li>
            <li> we both LOVE them..</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I wish it had more than an \\&quot;off/on\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li> and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> The product does not have any worthwhile features.</li>
            <li> TO COMPARE THE FEATURES, SO YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANTED :)</li>
            <li> I use this every day and just love it.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner</li>
            <li> i have used many</li>
            <li> straightner is ok, bought for a backup.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be able to afford something like this.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic and the deal of the year for me!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Should hold up better.</li>
            <li> found this product on thier website and am so glad I found it here for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the straihhtner to an extent.</li>
            <li> it be better for people with less&lt;br /&gt;hair and thinner</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone in their right mind would think this is a good straightener.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to find such a good deal!</li>
            <li> She has not used it yet but was very excited to get it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.. and a great price too.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite as hot as I was expecting but still a good straightener</li>
            <li> and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> So decide for yourself whats worth more!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the fact that it got hot as soon as it was plugged in and it got VERY hot.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly just to straight my hair, and it works excellent.</li>
            <li> It has a very cool design and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Such a great purchase for such a great price!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener recently and loved it!  </li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> I have a large one, but this one is perfect for traveling and for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot but not too hot.</li>
            <li> Is iron is ok not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Wonderful for black womens hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and it NEVER snags my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> This has smoothed out my naturally curly hair into a sleek straight look, but it is also great for touching up my curls.</li>
            <li> The straightener made my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> Couple it with their products (I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the serum), and you get silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It works fabulous</li>
            <li> and it was great, but only lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because of only one heat setting, but she has already used it and said it&#x27;s great and loves it.</li>
            <li> The cheap one you get isn&#x27;t even up to par with the cheap ones you can get at Walmart</li>
            <li> It works well and fabulous</li>
            <li> It was fabulous.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> It lease her hair so smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener back in July and it worked great for a while, but now it wont stay on while im trying to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and worth the money</li>
            <li> The straighterner heated up fast which I liked so</li>
            <li> It works smoothly.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly over my hair and makes it nice and straight.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my niece and so far so good, she loves the zebra print, and the package it came in.</li>
            <li> This is a complete knock off straightener, the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> it says its 30$ and originally 300$?</li>
            <li> I love this straightener because it heats up fast, arrived in a timely manner, and the product works!</li>
            <li> I had tried many out in the mall before finally buying one of my own on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing to die for so much I recommend to buy this product right away love it so much a lot</li>
            <li> and she wanted this one in particular because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> It works really good on her extra curly hair!  </li>
            <li> My sister got this straightener for full price at the Galleria.</li>
            <li> well I love it so much</li>
            <li> but this one works very well the top straightner i have ever used.....</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this straighter is its zebra.</li>
            <li> We have used several brands and this one is a good one.  </li>
            <li> But as far as being quick and effective...</li>
            <li> The red light that indicates that it is on has never worked and that is kind of bothersome.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it that when it came to the door I went and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really smooth  and does the job very fast .</li>
            <li> Other than the print coming off pretty fast, this works great:)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> works well and does get very hot.</li>
            <li> everyone loves the new straightener better than any others they&#x27;ve had...</li>
            <li> The straightener is just too hot!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews that said it was so hot !</li>
            <li> For thicker llonger hair ladies this one is only ok !</li>
            <li> This takes my naturally curly long hair to silky smoothe straight in seconds, trust me, I think this is the best straightner I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses it everyday and is happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a cheap box with not even a real product name.</li>
            <li> my hair was so soft, i recommend this to everybody :)</li>
            <li> Powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I got the real herstyler at such a good price.</li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on something useful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work much better, but OK for $25.00.</li>
            <li> I tried it out and it pulled my hair out of my head and was super hot and burned it, and made me hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> My wife was thrilled to have the flat iron she wanted</li>
            <li> When I found it on Amazon for around $30, I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> I returned it right after.</li>
            <li> it looks right.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone needing a fantastic, durable and reliable straightner.</li>
            <li> It gets dirty easily, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> , I get my hair straight so easily now and it heats up fast</li>
            <li> Since using the Herstyler, my hair has looked great without any smoothing hair products and it stays slick throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to use ANY hot tools on your hair WITHOUT a heat protector spray, you&#x27;re not doing it right</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> I need the hot heat so the fact that it has no temp control is not a problem.</li>
            <li> was my first review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to hot.</li>
            <li> My daughter not only loves the cute zebra print</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> screeching hot.</li>
            <li> I have the purple 1\\&quot; using it 2nd year now, and it start heating up a bit more on the fingers</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied with this hair straightener, I dont only get to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time before an outdoor sporting event.</li>
            <li> The zebra paint also started chipping on the first use.</li>
            <li> I just received it 4 days ago and it smells like it gets way to hot.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gets too hot</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying one at the kiosk at the mall!</li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend this to anyone !!</li>
            <li> and it got pretty hot which made me feel like it would work.</li>
            <li> doesnt get hot enough,my daughter is disapointed.</li>
            <li> Was way to hot and didn&#x27;t clap onto my hair all the way.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> The item was delivered on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have ever bought</li>
            <li> i feel it doesnt get as hot as it says it does.</li>
            <li> There is no temperature setting, so the straightener does not get hot enough&lt;</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> and I have tried several different flat irons and this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Although I love this flat iron...</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely loving my new flat iron</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a wrong way of me using the zebra straightener, even though i don&#x27;t hold it in the front part while using it, it shouldn&#x27;t HEAT that much that u feel it trough the plastic.</li>
            <li> A late review, but I have had this flat iron for 2 years and it has worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> so I need a straightener that&#x27;s going to heat up hot and be fast to use.</li>
            <li> and so I tried my other straightener and it just smelled like regular hair burning (lol).</li>
            <li> Glides through hair easily and doesn&#x27;t require going over the same chunk of hair over and over til</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have chosen my Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair straightener,it heats immediately ,successfully straightens &amp; smooths  my short thick hair &amp; my daughter&#x27;s long locks.</li>
            <li> Works great, good quality,  and less expensive than in a stores.</li>
            <li> My natural wavy hair stayed as straight as a board!!</li>
            <li> I opened it up only to find that the quality of the product is beyond cheap and looked very</li>
            <li> My wife saw these at the kiosk in the mall and really wanted one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> So, Yeah too much...</li>
            <li> It gets it done fast</li>
            <li> she picked this and got it fast for christmas.</li>
            <li> It came with a box to put it away in and that is very convenient as well.</li>
            <li> I like this hair straighter, but I really wish it had a temperature changing option.</li>
            <li> but I can tell it is made very well</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to begin with</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that the product heats up fast and straightens hair really really well.</li>
            <li> I run through really fast.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very like it.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> This straightener did not quite do the job in getting it straight.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the rotating electric cord</li>
            <li> the product does make my hair straight and it heats up fast.</li>
            <li> The Zebra stribes are very hip to.</li>
            <li> it to look pin straight</li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  </li>
            <li> African american hair straightened nicely.</li>
            <li> Her Styler is suppose to be such a &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34; brand of flat iron to own, so I thought.</li>
            <li> and my hair has never been so flat and smooth unless I go to a salon.</li>
            <li> When it arrived that box wasnt damaged and the flat iron itself got hot quick.</li>
            <li> Damp hair or dry, this is sweet!</li>
            <li> And it looks full not flat like some straighteners do.</li>
            <li> it gets really hot to my old one</li>
            <li> My daughter straightened her hair while watching tv on the couch, laid it down while grabbing more hair and burnt my microfiber couch</li>
            <li> I had would do amazing curls and silly smooth straightening</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great as a curler - only negative comment she also had was the fact that there is no temp control -</li>
            <li> Yes, there is only one heat setting and it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> My Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair Straightener exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am a older retired hairdresser and I&#x27;ve used a lot of tools.</li>
            <li> but the classic zebra from the customer is not the classic zebra.</li>
            <li> Not only have I straightened my hair with I also curried it and my curls turn out very pretty (like beachy curls)</li>
            <li> The one I have doesn&#x27;t heat up high, and doesn&#x27;t straighten well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the straightener is too hot if you have natural hair or even if you&#x27;re a person that wants to take good care of there hair, this much heat is UNNECESSARY!</li>
            <li> For the money I expected it to be decent, cheap but decent.</li>
            <li> A complete knockoff!!</li>
            <li> but you definitly won&#x27;t have to worry about it getting hot enough to get your straight.</li>
            <li> The only problem is you can&#x27;t control the temperature, but based on the price,it definitely worth to buy.</li>
            <li> It works great, straightens my hair in no time at all (and I have long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> Retails for about $300 normally</li>
            <li> Good, not great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low number of reviews and the major price drop of the straightener from it&#x27;s original price</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron, I really can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day before expected &amp; came in the original package box sealed with plastic.</li>
            <li> It is not as smooth on my hair as other iron&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li> This new straighter works just as well as the $100 dollar one form the mall</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get my new one from amazon.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> but I was very please with how fast it was delivered considering it was a standard delivery.</li>
            <li> and it was hardly hot enough to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I chose a one star rating because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Her Styler b 4 the exact same as this one and the plates came unglued</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same iron from a kiosk in the mall 4 years ago for $300.  </li>
            <li> This straighter does not get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I also use a protective spray prior to use and it is still just too hot.</li>
            <li> same exact styler told the hair sales lady at mall</li>
            <li> It get very hot quickly and it works wonders on my thick course hair.</li>
            <li> It works great on thick hair, hair that you just blow dried, and takes the frizz right out in only one pass.</li>
            <li> Got the zebra few days ago and as pretty and fun as it looks, it gets even HOTTER on the fingers than my purple one.</li>
            <li> the same exact iron is because it is beginning to look old.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and is wide enough to get a lot of my hair at a time.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and makes my thick hair so soft and straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener, like a christmas gift for my wife, who has natural curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;She told me rating this item with 5 stars, because truly flatten her hair...</li>
            <li> My 12 year old niece is VERRY picky.</li>
            <li> Im only replacing it because of unavoidable damage through dying my hair amd using it so much.</li>
            <li> It got really humid, poured rain, cooled off, and repeated that process several times.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to any young girl or woman.</li>
            <li> I have had it about a month  so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the Chi, and when I came across this one I couldn&#x27;t resist the fun zebra design, and low, low price!</li>
            <li> The Herstyler is perfect for thick hair, but because it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control setting, I would not recommend it for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Other then that it straighten and curls well worth the price i got it at.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and curly hair, so it is kind of hard to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it two times and it was heating so hot that it actually burned the outside of the iron.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and couldnt believe how nice the iron made it.</li>
            <li> Only stays at a high heat setting.</li>
            <li> Straightens my whole hair in less than 40 minutes and my hair is very long(almost under my bottom)</li>
            <li> I get no flyaways and my hair stays perfectly straight all day long.</li>
            <li> The guys at the kiosk started off asking $150 and eventually got down to $100, but I got the exact same product on Amazon much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> thin, 1-inch plates make it easy to curl your hair, too!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a hair stylist and highly recommend that I get this flat iron</li>
            <li> I looked at reviews and this flat iron comes highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I have seen my share of cheap straighteners but this was beyond the most atrocious I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> When I look for a flat iron I want one that will give me flat hair without too much work</li>
            <li> Especially for not having a temperature control, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and this straightener totally does its job!!!</li>
            <li> But thing is, if you have very curly, curly hair, I suggest to use heat protector and to not straighten when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The girl and the kiosk made a nice bouncy curl in my hair, but I have been unable to replicate it at home.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so this is not good for me.</li>
            <li> She loves it how hot it gets she uses it everyday</li>
            <li> the first time i used it i was worried but it redemed itself on the second round.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and for thick curly hair it just won&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> I was straightening a small section of hair in the back of my hair and my hair burned right off -_-...</li>
            <li> So I just endured it until I finished my whole head, and mind you my hair is very thick, and very curly</li>
            <li> I had to order another flat iron 4 months later.</li>
            <li> She has very tight curls and it works like a charm to give her silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> But it did take like 4-5 times of passing it through each small section for it to come out pin straight.</li>
            <li> I wish it were bigger since I have long think hair.</li>
            <li> Just use the thing like you use any flat iron and you won&#x27;t burn your hair.</li>
            <li> It is also scratched up a bit on the zebra print of the body of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying a used flat iron period.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair flat...</li>
            <li> The extra long cord is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> The zebra flat iron worked well but did not last too long.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> I only used a few times do far.</li>
            <li> I am beyond relieved that the Her Styler booth at the mall was closed when I went back to buy this iron.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take long for me.</li>
            <li> I have curly long</li>
            <li> But, it is because I haven&#x27;t straighten it out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed, but glad I got it at the Amazon price instead of the ridiculous Mall price - takes a little sting out of it.</li>
            <li> I only came across this product the other day at the mall after they stopped me and used the styler on my hair.</li>
            <li> Even with regular use of serum and after using straightener only three times I can see little burnt patches in my hair..</li>
            <li> I cant remember how long ago I bought it, but it has been over a year, and it still works like a charm!</li>
            <li> She was always complaining straighteners were never hot enough for her hair.</li>
            <li> Daughter in Law just loves it but still not hot enuff for her coarse hair but isn&#x27;t leaving hair all frizzy either.</li>
            <li> They started getting really dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or anything like that</li>
            <li> and it doesnt straighten my hair all the way, which is crazy because EVERY other straightener ive ever used has worked better than what this one does.</li>
            <li> I still have it in my drawer wishing I could use it but its not worth the burnt patches which will only go away after they grow out.</li>
            <li> You will loose your curls.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other flat iron again!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener as a replacement for my previous one that finally burned out on me after 6 years.</li>
            <li> I have normal wavy hair and now it has random patches of african american looking frizzy hair (just trying to describe what the burn looks like!).</li>
            <li> I use to have tight curls and now it is starting to look wavy.</li>
            <li> Its a little smaller than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> it is my $30 spent</li>
            <li> it is not what i expected at all....</li>
            <li> I have to lay it down and mess with the cord for it to turn back on.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing was the small vent on the end which meant I had to figure out how to get better with just the one handed smoothing to not accidentally burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> Not very useful as a hair straigtener.</li>
            <li> and it has a bunch of small visible cracks (not deep just visible) on the heat plates.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair as burnt as other brand of irons</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, other than that.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that has always been a little frizzy, no matter how many different kinds of hair products I used, which drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is now my main straightener!</li>
            <li> It is also very pretty and expensive looking!</li>
            <li> When told, too late to send back, exchange.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t control the temperature.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t bother with buying this product it is not worth the money nor the hassle or headache.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to turn it down...</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> It cut done on half the time of doing hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a replacement for the one my daughter previously ownned.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased one form a mall Kiosk that was well over $100</li>
            <li> but for MUCH MUCH less money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in the mail and appeared as it had dirt on the black ceramic area of where you use it on your hair.</li>
            <li> The Solia straightener I was using previously broke, so I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product for someone who has impossible hair and needs high heat.</li>
            <li> so I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it didnt really live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> settings but ill live.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw the price compared to the price if you buy from Herstyler directly, (as shown on the Herstyler website  [...]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, doesn&#x27;t even heat up enough to straighten my hair smooth, the one b 4</li>
            <li> I even bought one for my mom after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned, never cheap out on hair straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;-Effy</li>
            <li> I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> this flat iron got my hair extreamly staight, and i have very thick curly and wavey hair.</li>
            <li> some parts it was just black and in others the paint was already worn off!</li>
            <li> I would say if you have thin hair, this is not the flat iron for you.</li>
            <li> it being this hot is bad for you even in moderation...</li>
            <li> Over all this product is pretty bad, I may just use this as a emergency straightener or perhaps may just give it away to a niece or sister.</li>
            <li> , they slowly slid it down my hair.</li>
            <li> 150$ less,  the people selling it were pushy &amp; rude.</li>
            <li> I know very little about</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used a Remington then a Chi straightener.  </li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> also i just noticed it today but the plates have these small crack like lines all over them, why is that</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit to small for my hair</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too small for my hair seeing as how my hair is extremely thick, but it works wonders.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it to do what I want.</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> I was seriously afraid of turning it on, I thought it would crack further with the heat</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews that the one heat setting would work for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to straighten with it, but that is probably because my hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> Not amazing as the ones in the stores.</li>
            <li> it slipped off the counter onto a thick plush rug.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this would probably work well for you.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my step-daughter who has thick pin curls for hair.  </li>
            <li> I am super disappointed!</li>
            <li> it is very  very slick, heat does not seem evenly distributed to me at all....</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical about this product because of the price.</li>
            <li> i feel bad for the girls that have actually paid 300$ for this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> totally sucks!</li>
            <li> and it works on my very thick hair</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product at all.</li>
            <li> so people with thin hair should not get this it may burn off your hair.</li>
            <li> Never have I had anything so easily broken.</li>
            <li> That was totally false.</li>
            <li> and I mean VERY poorly made.</li>
            <li> but I was doubtful as I had just showered (hair was totally dry by this time)</li>
            <li> This was Terrible a complete knock off I had to return.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying this offline esspecailly with</li>
            <li> However, it is difficult to use it on yourself as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but I must say I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Considering of getting another of herstyler&#x27;s products because i do like them, just not the zebra one unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Wrong size wrong color and no Herstyler logo</li>
            <li> Sadly being a mum of three girls</li>
            <li> Just not sure what my hair dresser will say once she sees my damaage.  :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all and do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I ordered the straightener with benefit of the doubt to the rest of the one stars it has received and boy did I prove myself wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job :(</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> So I go on to straighten my hair and as soon as I&#x27;m about an Inch into it, it starts letting off this god awful smell (</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not realy like this item because there is only one control button temperature.  I would not recomment this item to my freind.</li>
            <li> Other than the print coming off pretty fast, this works great:) And it doesnt have a temperature setting..I&#x27;m also glad I bought it on Amazon instead of in the mall because the price was wayyyy better 150$ less,  the people selling it were pushy &amp; rude. Thank god for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter.  She had a cousin that had one and loved it.  My daughter uses it everyday and is happy with this product.  She has had straighteners, but this one tops the list...Highly recommended.. and a great price too.</li>
            <li> Used for a month and it started coming apart. Not happy with the product at all. Love the zebra print.</li>
            <li> This straightener works amazing! Especially for not having a temperature control, which was unexpected. But its super cute, gets really hot, and straightens my hair perfectly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener, like a christmas gift for my wife, who has natural curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;She told me rating this item with 5 stars, because truly flatten her hair...</li>
            <li> Is iron is ok not bad for the price</li>
            <li> I got this straightener for my sister and she LOVES it! The price was very affordable and it works great!</li>
            <li> My wife saw these at the kiosk in the mall and really wanted one for Christmas.  She said they were so much better than the $100 Chi I&#x27;d already gotten her.  The guys at the kiosk started off asking $150 and eventually got down to $100, but I got the exact same product on Amazon much cheaper.  My wife was thrilled to have the flat iron she wanted and I was thrilled to find such a good deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the plates on the edges of the straightener make it look, well kind of... used. I tried it out and it pulled my hair out of my head and was super hot and burned it, and made me hair frizzy. i would suggest putting in product before use. Other then that it straighten and curls well worth the price i got it at. It is also very pretty and expensive looking!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s also great as a curler - only negative comment she also had was the fact that there is no temp control - but she still loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this herstyler. It cut done on half the time of doing hair. It make your hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I love my Herstyler Hair Straightener.  This has smoothed out my naturally curly hair into a sleek straight look, but it is also great for touching up my curls. I need the hot heat so the fact that it has no temp control is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener recently and loved it!  Then I started noticing the ends of my hair breaking off while I was using it.  They started getting really dry and I couldn&#x27;t even run my hands thru my hair anymore.  I dont like how there is no way to change the heat settings.  I am buying a different straightener now so my hair wont break off anymore</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I have naturally curly hair and I have tried several different flat irons and this one works perfectly. I will never buy any other flat iron again!</li>
            <li> It works well but doesn&#x27;t sit well on the counter always falling sideways.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with my straightners but when i got this one, omg!!! my hair was so soft, i recommend this to everybody :)</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I was really happy with the fact that it got hot as soon as it was plugged in and it got VERY hot. There a no temperature settings but you definitly won&#x27;t have to worry about it getting hot enough to get your straight. The straightener made my hair silky smooth and I loved it. I was really skeptical about buying this offline esspecailly with it&#x27;s low number of reviews and the major price drop of the straightener from it&#x27;s original price but I&#x27;m happy I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~Edit~~&lt;br /&gt;That was my first review. I gave it 5 stars then but let me say. The straightener is just too hot! After a like 2 ses on my hair I started to smell a burnt smell &gt;_&lt; the straightener is too hot if you have natural hair or even if you&#x27;re a person that wants to take good care of there hair, this much heat is UNNECESSARY! It&#x27;s way to hot. I was straightening a small section of hair in the back of my hair and my hair burned right off -_-...So, Yeah too much...Maybe if it had heat settings it would be better but it being this hot is bad for you even in moderation...</li>
            <li> It works well. This is my first flat iron, I really can&#x27;t compare. I only used a few times do far. I still need to get used to it yet.</li>
            <li> I am beyond relieved that the Her Styler booth at the mall was closed when I went back to buy this iron. I can&#x27;t believe I was actually considering paying $125 for it! When I found it on Amazon for around $30, I ordered it right away.  It&#x27;s just OK, even at that price. The heat is not adjustible, rather on or off. It glides smoothly over my hair and makes it nice and straight. However, it is difficult to use it on yourself as a curling iron. The girl and the kiosk made a nice bouncy curl in my hair, but I have been unable to replicate it at home. It probably wouldn&#x27;t matter, since my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls even with loads of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair straighteners and this one is among one of the top. It works pretty well and pretty quickly. I wish it were bigger since I have long think hair. Its a little smaller than I prefer. The print is really cute too. The cord could be longer. I have to use an extension cord when I use it, but its not big deal. I would also like it more if it had adjustable heat settings. It only has an on/off switch, so the temp. is what it is.</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters and hair straighteners are a big deal at our house...everyone loves the new straightener better than any others they&#x27;ve had...My wife said it is a very good product.  Very good product and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! My daughter not only loves the cute zebra print but it straightens great. She has very tight curls and it works like a charm to give her silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> I brought this as gift for my daughter and she just loves her herstyler. Works great and she loves the Zebra design.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and I still have it and use it. I love it. When I look for a flat iron I want one that will give me flat hair without too much work (I have thick hair so I already expect to put some work into it). It gets it done fast and my hair has never been so flat and smooth unless I go to a salon. I wanted the salon hair without having to go to the salon all the time and that&#x27;s what this one delivers. Yes, there is only one heat setting and it gets pretty hot. But it&#x27;s called use a GOOD heat protecting spray. If you&#x27;re trying to use ANY hot tools on your hair WITHOUT a heat protector spray, you&#x27;re not doing it right and you&#x27;re going to get damage. Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a replacement for the one my daughter previously ownned.  It is a great straightener, and well worth the money.  My daughter loves the fact that it&#x27;s zebra print, as well.  Beats the heck out of what I paid for mine at the kiosk in the mall!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw the price compared to the price if you buy from Herstyler directly, (as shown on the Herstyler website  [...] but I must say I was proven wrong. I absolutely love this product and use it daily. I have had it for months and have dropped it several times and it is still working like new. My only wish is that it had an automatic timer to shut off as I have forgotten to turn it off a couple times and have come home to it screeching hot. I would highly recommend to anyone needing a fantastic, durable and reliable straightner.</li>
            <li> Bought as an silent auction gift.</li>
            <li> I have the purple 1\\&quot; using it 2nd year now, and it start heating up a bit more on the fingers so decided it&#x27;s time for replacement even though still does great job straightening and curling. Got the zebra few days ago and as pretty and fun as it looks, it gets even HOTTER on the fingers than my purple one. Very disappointing and i&#x27;m returning it back. I got the giraffe 1.5\\&quot; for a gift to a friend and hers does not get on the fingers at all. Considering of getting another of herstyler&#x27;s products because i do like them, just not the zebra one unfortunately. :/&lt;br /&gt;P.s and it&#x27;s not a wrong way of me using the zebra straightener, even though i don&#x27;t hold it in the front part while using it, it shouldn&#x27;t HEAT that much that u feel it trough the plastic.</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied with this hair straightener, I dont only get to straighten my hair I can also wave or curl my hair, very easy to handle and the zebra print is so cute!!!!! I have told alot of my friends about this hair straightener and they want to buy it after useing mine</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that i have used in my hair. I have thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to get it to do what I want. This definitely tames my hair!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old niece is VERRY picky. I didnt know what to get her so i had her pick it out herself lol! she picked this and got it fast for christmas. She loves it how hot it gets she uses it everyday</li>
            <li> A late review, but I have had this flat iron for 2 years and it has worked beautifully! When it arrived that box wasnt damaged and the flat iron itself got hot quick. this flat iron got my hair extreamly staight, and i have very thick curly and wavey hair. This also produced lovely curls! Im only replacing it because of unavoidable damage through dying my hair amd using it so much. I loved it, im sure you will too! :)</li>
            <li> My daughter is a hair stylist and highly recommend that I get this flat iron and she was right I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly just to straight my hair, and it works excellent. Powerful and efficient. The only problem is you can&#x27;t control the temperature, but based on the price,it definitely worth to buy.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I will warn you... when I went to the mall and they did a &#x27;demo&#x27; on me, they slowly slid it down my hair. DO NOT DO THAT!! I&#x27;ve messed up my bangs doing that. Just use the thing like you use any flat iron and you won&#x27;t burn your hair. So beyond that, I absolutely love this thing. Couple it with their products (I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the serum), and you get silky, smooth hair. I can&#x27;t believe they are selling this for $125 in the mall. What a scam.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 29th birthday...she LOVES it!!  It works really good on her extra curly hair!  GREAT price, too!!:)</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it for Xmas. Only problem was she got tiger instead of Zebra. When told, too late to send back, exchange. Still likes it.</li>
            <li> The product came in excellent condition and smelled brand new. I tried the straightener yesterday and it made my hair so silky and smooth! I love it!</li>
            <li> This straightener is absolutely great. I get no flyaways and my hair stays perfectly straight all day long. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or anything like that and I love hat it&#x27;s zebra print because it makes it so much more fashionable. It came with a box to put it away in and that is very convenient as well. Love itttttt!</li>
            <li> My sister got this straightener for full price at the Galleria. I used it for the first time before an outdoor sporting event. It got really humid, poured rain, cooled off, and repeated that process several times. My natural wavy hair stayed as straight as a board!! LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER.   P.S.- I also learned how to spiral curl my hair with this straighter and it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> It is so good on my hair it is my $30 spent well I love it so much my sister tray to take it from me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and for thick curly hair it just won&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews that the one heat setting would work for thick hair. That was totally false. I have pretty thick hair and it was hardly hot enough to straighten it. When I used it to curl my hair those wouldn&#x27;t stay in even with a lot of hair spray. The zebra paint also started chipping on the first use. This will definitely be returned.</li>
            <li> It works fabulous I just received it 4 days ago and it smells like it gets way to hot. Not sure how long it will last but it looks and acts just like the one in the mall. It is even shipped in same packaging I saw at the kiosk. Good price hope it lasts I&#x27;ve now had it about a year and it works great do not lay it n fabric it will leave burn marks. My daughter straightened her hair while watching tv on the couch, laid it down while grabbing more hair and burnt my microfiber couch</li>
            <li> Nothing like the description states, but has a zebra print. Not a Herstyler. No where on the item or box does it says Herstyler. A complete knockoff!!</li>
            <li> totally sucks! no temp control setting and it doesnt straighten my hair all the way, which is crazy because EVERY other straightener ive ever used has worked better than what this one does. it says its 30$ and originally 300$? LMAO i feel bad for the girls that have actually paid 300$ for this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Sorry, it didnt really live up to all the hype. In the past I&#x27;ve used a Remington then a Chi straightener.  My Chi broke so I was using the Remington wet/dry - surprisingly the Remington does a better job than the Herstyler! I was a little dissapointed, but glad I got it at the Amazon price instead of the ridiculous Mall price - takes a little sting out of it.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical about this product because of the price. I had previously purchased one form a mall Kiosk that was well over $100 and it was great, but only lasted 2 years. This new straighter works just as well as the $100 dollar one form the mall but for MUCH MUCH less money.</li>
            <li> I chose a one star rating because it didn&#x27;t heat up hot enough. I have thick hair so I need a straightener that&#x27;s going to heat up hot and be fast to use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I only chose 5 stars for it coming in only 2 days. I returned it right after.</li>
            <li> Was a great gift, much loved, by 18 year old daughter of friend. African american hair straightened nicely. She also loves design.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and curly hair, so it is kind of hard to straighten my hair. I read the reviews and purchased one. I have to say I am satisfied overall. It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  And it looks full not flat like some straighteners do. It takes awhile to straighten with it, but that is probably because my hair is so thick. Good straightener for the money.</li>
            <li> It works great. The red light that indicates that it is on has never worked and that is kind of bothersome. It does the job that I bought it to do!</li>
            <li> I love it I never have problems with it and it works on my very thick hair it&#x27;s amazing (: I also use tresseme heat protection just in case</li>
            <li> I recently bought this straightener just to use as a back up at home. Needless to say it is now my main straightener! It heats up as soon as you plug it in. It works great, straightens my hair in no time at all (and I have long, thick hair). I am very pleased with this item and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has worked beautifully when I need it. Happy with product and recommend it to anyone. Love the zebra style too</li>
            <li> I like this hair straighter, but I really wish it had a temperature changing option. I feel like it gets too hot and I am worried I am frying my hair. I would only recommend this product for someone who has impossible hair and needs high heat.</li>
            <li> Amazing to die for so much I recommend to buy this product right away love it so much a lot</li>
            <li> My hair looks great when I use this straightener and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying one at the kiosk at the mall! I&#x27;ve owned it for more than a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> This  straightner works so well , I would highly recommend this to anyone !!</li>
            <li> Product is just as described!!  Awesome packaging, great heat and really works!!  Such a great purchase for such a great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have one of these straighteners.  We really love them and they are excellent value for what we paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price. I even bought one for my mom after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> it gets really hot to my old one so it works alot better on my hair n i love the zebra</li>
            <li> This was a present for my daughter for christmas.  She loved it.  I was concerned because of only one heat setting, but she has already used it and said it&#x27;s great and loves it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!! My hair is naturally wavy and this straightener totally does its job!!! And at that price it&#x27;s practically a steal!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t control the temperature.</li>
            <li> This was a great straightener - lasted over three years.</li>
            <li> I know very little about but I can tell it is made very well and my wife thinks it is great so 5 stars..</li>
            <li> Good, not great. Not amazing as the ones in the stores. I&#x27;m ok.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. not to mention it is pretty&lt;br /&gt;I would pay triple what I paid for it and still be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very cute and works well - I&#x27;ve used this straightener for about two years now &amp; have had no issues.</li>
            <li> Her Styler is suppose to be such a &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34; brand of flat iron to own, so I thought. I had tried many out in the mall before finally buying one of my own on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in the mail and appeared as it had dirt on the black ceramic area of where you use it on your hair. It is also scratched up a bit on the zebra print of the body of the flat iron. I would not recommend buying a used flat iron period. It doesn&#x27;t do the great job of straightening all of the hair as it appears to suppose to work as.</li>
            <li> This straightener gets the job done. I have straight hair to begin with so it doesn&#x27;t take long for me. It wasn&#x27;t quite as hot as I was expecting but still a good straightener</li>
            <li> This is a complete knock off straightener, the price is too good to be true. Sure it says you are getting the Herstyle one but when you get it, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s in a cheap box with not even a real product name. The cheap one you get isn&#x27;t even up to par with the cheap ones you can get at Walmart</li>
            <li> This was Terrible a complete knock off I had to return. It didn&#x27;t even look like the picture or even match the picture on the box. Wrong size wrong color and no Herstyler logo</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas.  She has not used it yet but was very excited to get it.  It was a good price</li>
            <li> Works great, good quality,  and less expensive than in a stores.</li>
            <li> I have a large one, but this one is perfect for traveling and for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot but not too hot. It works well and fabulous price.&lt;br /&gt;Like it tons.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Her Styler b 4 the exact same as this one and the plates came unglued and so I bought this one. It&#x27;s awful, doesn&#x27;t even heat up enough to straighten my hair smooth, the one b 4 I had would do amazing curls and silly smooth straightening and this one does nothing. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a replica or just a lemon lol but it does not do it&#x27;s job :( I am super disappointed!</li>
            <li> *UPDATE* Almost 6 years later and my Herstyler straightener is still working perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this product! The Solia straightener I was using previously broke, so I was looking for a replacement. I&#x27;m not a fan of the Chi, and when I came across this one I couldn&#x27;t resist the fun zebra design, and low, low price! (I got mine for about $30). It heats up quickly and it NEVER snags my hair! The Herstyler is perfect for thick hair, but because it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control setting, I would not recommend it for thin hair. There&#x27;s no way to turn it down...it has one setting - HOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thin, 1-inch plates make it easy to curl your hair, too! I&#x27;m SO pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This styler started out great but started losing heat capabilities pretty soon. Didn&#x27;t last as long as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener as a replacement for my previous one that finally burned out on me after 6 years. So far so good. I was worried this would be too small for my hair seeing as how my hair is extremely thick, but it works wonders. I wish it had temp. settings but ill live. If you want your hair flat... this one will work for you but I must warn you it works better the more you use it. the first time i used it i was worried but it redemed itself on the second round.</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same iron from a kiosk in the mall 4 years ago for $300.  It is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made the only reason I am replacing it now with the same exact iron is because it is beginning to look old.  Even after 4 years it still works just as good as it did the day I bought it.  I can&#x27;t wait to get my new one from amazon.</li>
            <li> it says on the page they are 100% ceramic but when i recieved the zebra straightner it says on the box they are  titanium plats? huh? So i still decided to try it and see if i like it and i do! It works great but im still kind of upset they lied.. but i guess i will keep it and use it</li>
            <li> Love this....just as good as a chi!!! You will not be disappointed!  I have tried others and I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece.  I used hers and was so impresses so I bought me one.  Buy it today!!!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have ever had! It heats up amazingly, and I have had it for almost two years now and it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister &amp; since I had purchased one at the mall before for over $100 seeing this product on amazon for this price made me want to buy it more. It arrived a day before expected &amp; came in the original package box sealed with plastic. The product is great quality &amp; works perfectly!</li>
            <li> My Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair Straightener exceeded my expectations. I was so excited to get it that when it came to the door I went and tried it out right away. It was fabulous.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it and my dog chewed the wire off , so I told her I&#x27;d buy her another one and she wanted this one in particular because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I only came across this product the other day at the mall after they stopped me and used the styler on my hair.I have long and thick hair and couldnt believe how nice the iron made it.Sadly being a mum of three girls i couldnt afford the price they wanted.So i came home saw it at such a discounted price here on Amazon and purchased it.Fast delivery and nicely packaged.I have already used it and just love it.So easy to use and makes my thick hair so soft and straight.Iam going to buy some for family members.Awesome would recommened to all.</li>
            <li> When I got this hair straightener I opened it up only to find that the quality of the product is beyond cheap and looked very and I mean VERY poorly made. I could see the painted on zebra print was not evenly painted, some parts it was just black and in others the paint was already worn off! I am beyond disappointed. I have seen my share of cheap straighteners but this was beyond the most atrocious I&#x27;ve seen. For the money I expected it to be decent, cheap but decent. That was not the case with this one. It has NO heat temp. control and it has a bunch of small visible cracks (not deep just visible) on the heat plates. I was seriously afraid of turning it on, I thought it would crack further with the heat but I did eventually turn it on. It took about a min for it to heat up and it got pretty hot which made me feel like it would work. So I go on to straighten my hair and as soon as I&#x27;m about an Inch into it, it starts letting off this god awful smell (Nothing compared to burning hair). It smelled a bit like burning rubber and plastic. I was worried it was my hair letting of that smell but I was doubtful as I had just showered (hair was totally dry by this time) and so I tried my other straightener and it just smelled like regular hair burning (lol). So I just endured it until I finished my whole head, and mind you my hair is very thick, and very curly and it did a pretty good job. But it did take like 4-5 times of passing it through each small section for it to come out pin straight. Over all this product is pretty bad, I may just use this as a emergency straightener or perhaps may just give it away to a niece or sister. Please don&#x27;t bother with buying this product it is not worth the money nor the hassle or headache. I don&#x27;t know why anyone in their right mind would think this is a good straightener. Lesson learned, never cheap out on hair straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;-Effy</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these one for me and one for my niece we both LOVE them.. We were very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that the product heats up fast and straightens hair really really well. HOWEVER------it burned my hair! And I dont hold the straighter in one place when straightening my hair.. I run through really fast. Even with regular use of serum and after using straightener only three times I can see little burnt patches in my hair.. I have normal wavy hair and now it has random patches of african american looking frizzy hair (just trying to describe what the burn looks like!). I still have it in my drawer wishing I could use it but its not worth the burnt patches which will only go away after they grow out. So decide for yourself whats worth more!</li>
            <li> I love it, I get my hair straight so easily now and it heats up fast so Im not waiting along time to get going on my hair. the only bad thing was the small vent on the end which meant I had to figure out how to get better with just the one handed smoothing to not accidentally burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> doesnt get hot enough,my daughter is disapointed. i plan on returning it&lt;br /&gt;possibly just defected.I would still consider a purschase</li>
            <li> Although I love this flat iron...I wish it had more than an \\&quot;off/on\\&quot; button.  It heats up to 400 degrees which I&#x27;m sure can not be good for my hair.  But as far as being quick and effective...oh yeah.  Just not sure what my hair dresser will say once she sees my damaage.  :(</li>
            <li> Great product for the price..would be nice if it had a automatic shut off.. I have one for me and one for my daughter. We both love it.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter. She&#x27;s very like it. It works very well. This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really smooth  and does the job very fast . Can&#x27;t believe I got the real herstyler at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have chosen my Herstyler Classic Zebra Hair straightener,it heats immediately ,successfully straightens &amp; smooths  my short thick hair &amp; my daughter&#x27;s long locks. I am a satisfied purchaser!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener from Ulta. I have very curly, dry, frizzy hair. This straightener did not quite do the job in getting it straight. It just gets it wavy-straight.</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Straightens my whole hair in less than 40 minutes and my hair is very long(almost under my bottom) I really like it. Leaves my hair with a nice shine to it. It leave my hair as burnt as other brand of irons I&#x27;ve used on my hair. I love it!!! I just don&#x27;t like how I can&#x27;t control the degrees on it. I really like the rotating electric cord it&#x27;s just perfect. I think every wonan needs this hair straightener. Not only have I straightened my hair with I also curried it and my curls turn out very pretty (like beachy curls) awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews that said it was so hot ! I am East Indian so I have thick long hair. This straighter does not get hot enough for my hair. I believe if you have short thinner hair yes this would be perfect . For thicker llonger hair ladies this one is only ok ! There is better!  Happy with the price lol</li>
            <li> Love this thing. I cant remember how long ago I bought it, but it has been over a year, and it still works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Not very useful as a hair straigtener. The product does not have any worthwhile features. It heats up.....that&#x27;s about it. Spend your money on something useful. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I wish it had different temperature settings. I have no complaints, other than that. It works fine and it is attractive</li>
            <li> Was way to hot and didn&#x27;t clap onto my hair all the way. Would not recommend it. I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I love this straightner best one I have ever used great price recommend to anyone. it heats up nicely :)</li>
            <li> I CAME ON LINE TO LOOK FOR THE ONE THEY WERE SELLING IN THE MALL, IT IS THE SAME BRAND BUT NOT THE KIND I WANTED. SOOOOOO BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT, CHECK ALL THE FEATURES YOU WANT AND CHECK ON HERSTYLER.COM TO COMPARE THE FEATURES, SO YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANTED :)</li>
            <li> worked good for a while then shorted out. could not get ahold of the company.</li>
            <li> This takes my naturally curly long hair to silky smoothe straight in seconds, trust me, I think this is the best straightner I have ever had.  Damp hair or dry, this is sweet!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair and it&#x27;s Zebra print! Great product. Compared to Chi, when I bought it, was half-price and does the SAME thing!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and just love it. Very satisfied with the product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who loves it.  It lease her hair so smooth and she doesn&#x27;t have to go over it more than once. It has a very cool design and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner i have used many but this one works very well the top straightner i have ever used..... i do wish it was wider but a very good make</li>
            <li> straightner is ok, bought for a backup. i feel that it doesnt get hot enough though, other than that it doesnt snag your hair like other ones i have bought</li>
            <li> I love this straightener because it heats up fast, arrived in a timely manner, and the product works! I&#x27;d recommend this to any young girl or woman.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this straighter is its zebra. I had to go over each strand over and over just to get the curl to wavy! Not impressed at all and do not recommend this product but I was very please with how fast it was delivered considering it was a standard delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on christmas and received a on December 30. Standard shipping it was only five days. It works great on thick hair, hair that you just blow dried, and takes the frizz right out in only one pass. It gets really hot so people with thin hair should not get this it may burn off your hair. It goes up to 440° without a dial. Just a regular on and off switch. I&#x27;m only 15 and I am absolutely loving my new flat iron</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be able to afford something like this.  Fantastic and the deal of the year for me!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used! Glides through hair easily and doesn&#x27;t require going over the same chunk of hair over and over til it looks right. One or two swipes on the chunk of hair and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Going on 3 years. Still works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter says its great.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She was always complaining straighteners were never hot enough for her hair. She is Latina with curly hair. No complaints after this.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. Says it is the best she has used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she loved it!  Works great and you just can&#x27;t beat the price!  The item was delivered on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Bought this the middle of December and it seemed nice. This morning (4 days after warranty ran out) it slipped off the counter onto a thick plush rug. That was the end of that. Should hold up better. I am a older retired hairdresser and I&#x27;ve used a lot of tools. Never have I had anything so easily broken.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough. It also pulls my hair.  It is not as smooth on my hair as other iron&#x27;s I have gotten.</li>
            <li> it is not what i expected at all.... it is very  very slick, heat does not seem evenly distributed to me at all.... i will not buy this again or anything with the name on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it had good reviews.  I was very disappointed with it.  My daughter used it two times and it was heating so hot that it actually burned the outside of the iron.  I was concerned because it may have damaged her hair if I hadnt noticed.  I returned the item.</li>
            <li> the product does make my hair straight and it heats up fast. but the classic zebra from the customer is not the classic zebra. It makes me doubt the site... also i just noticed it today but the plates have these small crack like lines all over them, why is that so......</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It came very quickly, like in 2 days and it works great. I would say if you have thin hair, this is not the flat iron for you. It get very hot quickly and it works wonders on my thick course hair. It&#x27;s exaclty what I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener back in July and it worked great for a while, but now it wont stay on while im trying to straighten my hair. I have to lay it down and mess with the cord for it to turn back on. Looks like i&#x27;m going to have to buy another one soon!</li>
            <li> Best pricing ever!  I looked at reviews and this flat iron comes highly recommended.  Great quality at a great price.  Retails for about $300 normally</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beautician as a Christmas gift and she loves it.  The price was spectacular!!!  Gets very very hot though, although she doesn&#x27;t mind she is a weave expert!!!</li>
            <li> There is no temperature control. Only stays at a high heat setting. I have fine hair, so this is not good for me. I also use a protective spray prior to use and it is still just too hot. My hair was singed. No good. If you have thick hair this would probably work well for you.</li>
            <li> got this for my dughter, she loves it, uses it daily and has no complaints. works well and does get very hot. found this product on thier website and am so glad I found it here for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a hair straightener for awhile, but thought a quality one was out of my price range. This is the first one I have ever bought so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, but this one works great for what I need it for. I have very thick hair that has always been a little frizzy, no matter how many different kinds of hair products I used, which drove me crazy. Since using the Herstyler, my hair has looked great without any smoothing hair products and it stays slick throughout the day. It heats up very quickly and is wide enough to get a lot of my hair at a time. The extra long cord is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I love it and worth the money</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the straihhtner to an extent. I was expecting a tempature adjuster i cant stand not having one, also i wish i would get hotter i feel it doesnt get as hot as it says it does.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a teenager and she loved the design but loved the results on her hair even more!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be the same herstyler as my moms, but this one is nothing like hers. The one I have doesn&#x27;t heat up high, and doesn&#x27;t straighten well. I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> oo.This straightener heats up very quickly and works much better then the Conair we own. The Zebra stribes are very hip to.</li>
            <li> she says it is great and &amp;#34;thanks dad&amp;#34; :-) im bald so im going by what she told me. lol</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t come with a temperture control and I&#x27;ve tried other brands that work much better, but OK for $25.00.</li>
            <li> The straighterner heated up fast which I liked so your not standing around waiting for it.  I have had it about a month  so far.</li>
            <li> There is no temperature setting, so the straightener does not get hot enough&lt;br /&gt;to leave hair straightened all day. Also you must spend a lot of time doing your hair if you&lt;br /&gt;want it to look pin straight</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit to small for my hair type,&lt;br /&gt;maybe it be better for people with less&lt;br /&gt;hair and thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;FL., zgonzalez</li>
            <li> I ordered the straightener with benefit of the doubt to the rest of the one stars it has received and boy did I prove myself wrong. I also read the return policy and you only get 1/2 your money back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener but not longer than a year because after awhile there was a burnt smell to it and the plates are coming apart. the print eventually came off</li>
            <li> It gets dirty easily, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works smoothly. But thing is, if you have very curly, curly hair, I suggest to use heat protector and to not straighten when your hair is wet. You will loose your curls. I use to have tight curls and now it is starting to look wavy. But it is temporary since my curls are coming back. But, it is because I haven&#x27;t straighten it out for a long time. Then again, love the straightener!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift but it doesn&#x27;t work good!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my step-daughter who has thick pin curls for hair.  I have a chi and I found myself contemplating giving her the chi and keeping this one!.. Works wonderfully and never had a caught hair or anything!  Her hair seems to stay straighter with this one as well, dont know if thats even possible, but it does!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my niece and so far so good, she loves the zebra print, and the package it came in.</li>
            <li> 200 at mall same exact styler told the hair sales lady at mall she argued that it wasn&#x27;t huh bother us again</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I bought her a herstyler  iron 2 years ago and she was still using it so I thought it was time for a new one. Great buy!! I would highly recommend. they were selling these in the middle of the mall for $160.00.!!</li>
            <li> I was harassed at the mall by a kiosk to spend $180 on this and then another $40 for the additional products. This was the best deal and I have been using this for 2 years with no issue. Heats up fast, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The zebra flat iron worked well but did not last too long.  I had to order another flat iron 4 months later.</li>
            <li> Daughter in Law just loves it but still not hot enuff for her coarse hair but isn&#x27;t leaving hair all frizzy either. Wonderful for black womens hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this straightener.  We have used several brands and this one is a good one.  The only thing I wish it had was a heat dial where you could adjust the temperature.  It heats up super fast and works great.</li>
