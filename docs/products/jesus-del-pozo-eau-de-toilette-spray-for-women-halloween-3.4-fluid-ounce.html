            <li>Love this sent.  </li>
            <li>I love this since ever :)</li>
            <li>This is my primary Eau de Toilette spray!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fragrance that many people know off</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>Brings back so many great memories</li>
            <li>Remember that All Soul&#x27;s Eve was originally in April, and enjoy  this lovely perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is very fresh and people often ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>and I would like a refund or my perfume sent to me right away!</li>
            <li>The overall effect is most suitable for a day in Spring, than Autumn evenings.  </li>
            <li>Halloween ls a lovely modern floral</li>
            <li>It has replaced my former favorite perfume. :-)</li>
            <li>I got it the first time because it is cheaper than other designer brands, but it smells really nice (if you like fresh scents that are not overly floral and sweet).</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>, that gets an initial &#x27;yum!&#x27; reaction from me with it&#x27;s top notes of lime and banana leaf.  </li>
            <li>I did not buy this (yet) but wanted to endorse it because I am currently in the hospital and one of my nurses always had a lovely fragrance, so one day I asked her what she was wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh, with notes of orchid and white flowers, a peppery sense, and notes of resin, sandalwood and incense.  </li>
            <li>Forget this ludicrous name and try the fragrance if you like soft floral scents.</li>
            <li>I heard they are discontinuing it and that really upsets me but at least I will be set for a year or two since I purchased the large bottle.</li>
