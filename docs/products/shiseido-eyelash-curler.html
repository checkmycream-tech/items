    <ol>
            <li>this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>Best curler ever!</li>
            <li>best eyelash curler in the world!!</li>
            <li>Would recommend and great price point.</li>
            <li>The head is wider than most eyelash curlers which is great for monolids.</li>
            <li>and it still gives an excellent curl to my very straight lashes.  </li>
            <li>I used to own.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch and it really gives my eyelashes a perfect curl.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many eye lash curlers and this is the one to own.</li>
            <li>But it arrived at ahead of schedule, works great, and is overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curling my eyelashes for many, many years now, and this one doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Like it even better than Shu Uemura.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably better if I bought from Sephora again.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and the Shiseido is definitely the best eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Anything Shiseido is top of the line.  </li>
            <li>you will be 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>After many years of trying SO MANY eyelash curlers</li>
            <li>If I had more disposable income I would even buy one for my car and school backpack just in case.</li>
            <li>its an ok curler.</li>
            <li>I think it just helps the curl hold better.  </li>
            <li>but so far now good!</li>
            <li>Seems like its a very good product, I only have a week with it</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pinch my lids when I curl my lashes.</li>
            <li>It only did item come in timely manner but great customer service</li>
            <li>I rarely have to curl more than once.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it seems to fit the shape of my eyes (not all do) and they don&#x27;t pinch me when I use them.</li>
            <li>I seriously own 3 of these because I cannot live without them.</li>
            <li>this curler is true.  </li>
            <li>i hope its authentic and real.</li>
            <li>this is a must have for anyone who is serious about wanting to look their best every day!</li>
            <li>Have tried several different Brands of eyelash curlers and this one is perfect and you can order replacement rubber pads.</li>
            <li>I have very straight lashes, which can be harder to curl but had a great outcome with this lash curler.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that it created a more natural curl and that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice lift and curl to my entire lash line.</li>
            <li>and it certainly was not that!  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every eyelash curler out there and am glad to say I finally have found one that works so well.  </li>
            <li>I wrote a review on the product RapidLash, as well, that you may be interested in - it really works!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different curlers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality and will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>Its only benefit that I see is that its curve is shallower than some other brands, which makes if fit more comfortably over almond-shaped eyes.</li>
            <li>I am Native American and have eye lashes that do not curl easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it works fine, the build and finish quality is not the same as \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>She loves it and wants another, so</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t compare to the real one I purchased at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>The curler itself seems to be well made and curls my lashes very well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it really is easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this curler is considered better than the 1/2 or 1/3-priced other name-brand curlers.</li>
            <li>and so many other brands pinch my eyes and make lashes fall out.</li>
            <li>I have long but thin lashes and this curls them wonderfully.</li>
            <li>All their products I can highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every eyelash curler out there, high end and drugstore.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say it was worth my money.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>It looked like the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>I think those are really the key to a decent curl and not losing eyelashes while curling.</li>
            <li>Knock off version that looked like an old Revlon</li>
            <li>The item I received was inferior and completely overpriced.  </li>
            <li>No where near the performance of the compared shu uemura like it was supposed to be, but it works ok, no pinches at least.</li>
            <li>I have short Asian eyelashes and have tried many other eyelashes before.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted--especially as I&#x27;m half-Japanese/half-American and cannot really use conventional American brand eyelash curlers!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t open very wide but my lashes aren&#x27;t that full</li>
            <li>No other brand can match it...</li>
            <li>But then, I read yet another recommendation for the Shiseido curler that said the others just don&#x27;t have the same spring action, so they don&#x27;t curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus, the pads did not have the authentic Shiseido logo, which leads me to believe it was a bootleg version.</li>
            <li>It grabs all of my lashes, not just a few of them, and curls them the first time around.</li>

            <li> and I can never go back to any other eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> This is not the real product, and I would guess it&#x27;s a bootleg.  </li>
            <li> I expected the Sheseido eyelash curler</li>
            <li> It is more of a straight angle, so the lashes are almost baby doll-wide-eyed, and for those of us whose lashes droop, this is like achieving the impossible!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first big disappointment with anything from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also had problems with eyelid pinching with other curlers, but never with this one.</li>
            <li> None of the other brands open as wide and are difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your time comparing others, this allows your to get closest to the lid</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash  curler that make a dramatic difference on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of eyelash curler for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with other curlers, like from Revlon, that pinch my lids like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of buying this product due to some of the bad reviews it got.</li>
            <li> For years I have read make-up artists, beauty editors, random people, RAVE about the Shiseido eyelash curler and what a difference it makes in your make-up routine.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I purchased this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife is Korean and this is the only eyelash curler she can use for her eyes.  She loves it and wants another, so this Christmas...oh darn!  I need to order one now!</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on eyelash curlers and this is the only one that does not pinch my lids and is wide enough to curl all the lashes and not be crimped in the corners.  This is the 2nd one that I have purchased and it will be the only brand that I buy.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product, and I would guess it&#x27;s a bootleg.  I did not open it as I wanted to return it, but the product and packaging are quite different from the one pictured.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this curler is considered better than the 1/2 or 1/3-priced other name-brand curlers. I read reviews that it created a more natural curl and that it lasted longer. Not for me! I&#x27;ve been curling my eyelashes for many, many years now, and this one doesn&#x27;t impress me. Its only benefit that I see is that its curve is shallower than some other brands, which makes if fit more comfortably over almond-shaped eyes. I&#x27;d save your money and buy rubber replacements with it for your current curler-- I think those are really the key to a decent curl and not losing eyelashes while curling.</li>
            <li> I have short Asian eyelashes and have tried many other eyelashes before. This is the only eyelash  curler that make a dramatic difference on my eyelashes. The head is wider than most eyelash curlers which is great for monolids. It&#x27;s great quality and will last me a very long time. I can&#x27;t live without it and I can never go back to any other eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash curler. Like it even better than Shu Uemura.     I am Native American and have eye lashes that do not curl easily. This does the job well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare (Amazon seller) since it looked the same as the one I bought at Sephora. This is actually the Shiseido 213 Eyelash Curler, imported from Japan, not \\&quot;The Makeup\\&quot; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it works fine, the build and finish quality is not the same as \\&quot;The Makeup\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably better if I bought from Sephora again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an eyelash curler this is the one. Dont waste your time comparing others, this allows your to get closest to the lid and it grabs all the hairs from the inner corners all the way out.</li>
            <li> Every woman needs this eye lash curler! I have tried so many eye lash curlers and this is the one to own. I have long but thin lashes and this curls them wonderfully. I also had problems with eyelid pinching with other curlers, but never with this one.</li>
            <li> Was not what I had ordered!!!  I expected the Sheseido eyelash curler and it certainly was not that!  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pinch my lids when I curl my lashes. Also comes with and extra pad replacement.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary of buying this product due to some of the bad reviews it got. But it arrived at ahead of schedule, works great, and is overall a great purchase. I would definitely say it was worth my money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t compare to the real one I purchased at Sephora.  Knock off version that looked like an old Revlon I used to own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and the Shiseido is definitely the best eyelash curler. It doesn&#x27;t pinch and it really gives my eyelashes a perfect curl. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Anything Shiseido is top of the line.  All their products I can highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, but it came in a package not even in English. Plus, the pads did not have the authentic Shiseido logo, which leads me to believe it was a bootleg version. No where near the performance of the compared shu uemura like it was supposed to be, but it works ok, no pinches at least. Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted--especially as I&#x27;m half-Japanese/half-American and cannot really use conventional American brand eyelash curlers! This one curls ALL my lashes, even the outside ones!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler that has worked on my eyelashes with put making them fall out. It only did item come in timely manner but great customer service I recommend this eyelash curler you will be 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research between Shiseido vs Shu Uemura.  I&#x27;m Asian with short, sparse lashes so I opted for Shisheido.  I purchased this through PERFUMEBYDOMINIQUE. It came in the box as pictured so everything looked legit. The curler itself seems to be well made and curls my lashes very well.  However, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shape of my eyelids but it pinches my eyelid.  I am very disappointed I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Have tried several different Brands of eyelash curlers and this one is perfect and you can order replacement rubber pads.</li>
            <li> After many years of trying SO MANY eyelash curlers this is the BEST!!! I have to curl my eyelashes daily and so many other brands pinch my eyes and make lashes fall out. this is a must have for anyone who is serious about wanting to look their best every day! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing the Shiseido eyelash curler on Amazon because chances are you will receive the cheaper drugstore version sold in Asia. What I am reviewing is the more expensive, department store version. Best curler ever! I seriously own 3 of these because I cannot live without them. I have one in my purse, one at home and one for my gym bag. If I had more disposable income I would even buy one for my car and school backpack just in case. I cannot be without this eyelash curler! It makes my eyelashes look longer and my eyes bigger and brighter. I don&#x27;t even wear mascara, or any makeup for that matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler for over 15 years.  No other brand can match it... best eyelash curler in the world!!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of eyelash curler for the past 20 years.  None of the other brands open as wide and are difficult to use.  I have recommended this curler to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes that grow straight and down. I&#x27;ve tried every eyelash curler out there, high end and drugstore. This is the only one that works for my lashes! It is more of a straight angle, so the lashes are almost baby doll-wide-eyed, and for those of us whose lashes droop, this is like achieving the impossible!!!</li>
            <li> Seems like its a very good product, I only have a week with it but so far now good! go for it</li>
            <li> For years I have read make-up artists, beauty editors, random people, RAVE about the Shiseido eyelash curler and what a difference it makes in your make-up routine.  I always thought it couldn&#x27;t be that different from the regular ol&#x27; eyelash curlers.  It looked like the exact same product.  But then, I read yet another recommendation for the Shiseido curler that said the others just don&#x27;t have the same spring action, so they don&#x27;t curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try, and everything you have ever heard abou this curler is true.  It curls your lashes like they&#x27;ve never been curled before.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on  your lid and it really is easier to use.  I recommend it 10 stars, if that were posssible!</li>
            <li> its an ok curler. i hope its authentic and real.</li>
            <li> This is the only curler I&#x27;ll purchase. It grabs all of my lashes, not just a few of them, and curls them the first time around. I rarely have to curl more than once. I also like the fact that it seems to fit the shape of my eyes (not all do) and they don&#x27;t pinch me when I use them. I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with other curlers, like from Revlon, that pinch my lids like crazy. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> The item I received was inferior and completely overpriced.  I returned it immediately.  Not even close to what was pictured.  This is my first big disappointment with anything from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every eyelash curler out there and am glad to say I finally have found one that works so well.  I have had this same curler for over a year now and it still gives an excellent curl to my very straight lashes.  I find it helpful to use waterproof mascara - I think it just helps the curl hold better.  I wrote a review on the product RapidLash, as well, that you may be interested in - it really works!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different curlers. I have very straight lashes, which can be harder to curl but had a great outcome with this lash curler. Would recommend and great price point.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t open very wide but my lashes aren&#x27;t that full so it works out well. Gives a nice lift and curl to my entire lash line.</li>
