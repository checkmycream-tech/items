            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad she did!!</li>
            <li>It is a good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light, pleasant smell and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a year and love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing as always</li>
            <li>but I like the smell and feel better, but both are good.</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on very nicely but doesn&#x27;t do much for frizz.</li>
            <li>and I love it more than Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super shiny after blow drying or straightening and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this treatment oil.  </li>
            <li>and I get comments on my hair all the time since I started using it..... :)</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair and it leaves it smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>It is more gel</li>
            <li>It looks better after use.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a glass bottle (not my favorite) and pump, which is not pictured.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll be pleased :)</li>
            <li>Better than Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells good :) Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying a higher price for a good product</li>
            <li>The best product ever, gets rid of frizzes without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>AVA is light and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I also use it anytime I need to smooth or freshen the style.  </li>
            <li>, it makes my long wavy locks look beautiful</li>
            <li>It really does restore hair and make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>Also, with 2 kids it goes quickly</li>
            <li>you have to work out how much to use to suit your type and length of hair, but once you know that, it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Then I add various curling cream on top!</li>
            <li>so good for frizzy curley hair and smells terrific - very different than Moroccan oil - I like it better</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this is the only oil I can use to make my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>AVA oil is honestly the only haircare product I&#x27;ve ever sworn by, I have never been so pleased with any type of hair product, nor have I stuck to one for so long.</li>
            <li>There is no alcohol in this product so after using it for the last year my hair is so much more healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>gives body to my thick but fine hair &amp; tames frizziness, also adds a nice depth to my blonde hair and makes the layers show more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The amount you use should be adjusted by the amount/length of your hair, as using too much can give you that greasy-heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>it also helps soften and condition my hair because i use curling tongs which are very drying.</li>
            <li>- really gives me a softer look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;AVA has a light scent of gardenias: the smell is fresh but overpowering and will not counteract with perfume or other scented products you may use.</li>
            <li>You definitely need something on top of it to hold the frizz back and define curls.</li>
            <li>Another review commented how it was too heavy and greasy for her hair--be sure to not use any more than a dime-size in your palm at a time and evenly work into wet hair, always starting at the ends.</li>
            <li>The oil also works fantastic as a hair masque-- drench it with AVA (you can use other oils like coconut along with it) and leave on for about 30 minutes before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this product but the sad part is that every time i order it the top is not sealed tight so i never get a full bottle.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and apply it while my hair is dry, I clip my hair back, tidy up the house, and shampoo it out about an hour later.</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>For styling purposes avoid using directly on the roots, as the oil naturally works its way up to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer that if the company dropped their price, it would be in direct competition with Moroccan oil and overtake it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using ava oil for two years and it works very well on my long hair.</li>
            <li>I do think it could cost a few dollars less and be stocked in more beauty supplies</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair with keratin and frequently use a blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Its great on all hair types: my sister who has long, wavy hair that frizzes, my roommate who has thick, curly mixed-African hair, and myself with thin, flat</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The solution lasts for months because it is very concentrated; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not only using it for hair styling/heat-protecting but over all protecting from sun heat, blow dry heat , hair tangling, drying...</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and have to use hair oil to get some moisture into it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago because I have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> , I will put a ton on my dry hair and condition it all day.  </li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair and in between washes to fight the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair that is not too thick but not very thin either.</li>
            <li> No frizz or dry ends!</li>
            <li> I have used other products, such as Moroccan oil and other argan oils, but I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can use this on wet hair after shampooing or on dry hair between washes, it works just as well either way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll repurchase it once it is empty</li>
            <li> Together they create the phenomenal base for my long curly hair that tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, I like to wear it that way, and I color it, so the oil keeps brings out my curls and keeps my hair from looking dry and harsh</li>
            <li> like, I can put a gob on and it does not weight it down.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to keep them moisturized without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> but it does not weigh your hair down AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I was leery about using OIL on my hair as I thought it would be weighed down</li>
            <li> My only reservation is that the price is $40 for a very small bottle which always feels problematic every time I purchase it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have heavily highlighted hair that gets beat up by the sun, ocean and pool all the time.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but will NOT weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about it being too thick</li>
            <li> I have thick course curly hair and needed something like this to tame it.</li>
            <li> What is so special about AVA is that it has no alcohol in the oil which is what&#x27;s mostly bad for your hair!</li>
            <li> and I had serious withdrawals...</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but one bottle lasted me over a year using it 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately instead of making my hair silky it made it sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Not oily or dull!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair with extensions..</li>
            <li> I began using this oil approximately 3-4 months ago</li>
            <li> You wont be sad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so good for frizzy curley hair and smells terrific - very different than Moroccan oil - I like it better</li>
            <li> I love this product! I straighten my hair with keratin and frequently use a blow dryer and flat iron. This is the best hair oil that i have ever used. It leaves my hair soft and silky. No frizz or dry ends! Just great. I use it once a week and apply it while my hair is dry, I clip my hair back, tidy up the house, and shampoo it out about an hour later. Fantastic product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a year and love it! It&#x27;s like Morrocon Oil but I like the smell and feel better, but both are good. Ironically, I was introduced to this oil at Planet Beauty in Manhattan Beach, CA and when I tried to find it when I moved to VA, only place that carries it is on Amazon-from Planet Beauty!  Ava has now introduced a shampoo and conditioner which I&#x27;ve yet to try.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and have to use hair oil to get some moisture into it. All the hair oils I have tried are either heavy and very oily or sticky. AVA is light and not sticky. I do think it could cost a few dollars less and be stocked in more beauty supplies hence I had to order it online. It&#x27;s definitely the underdog so I think they need to drop their price to increase exposure.</li>
            <li> The best product ever, gets rid of frizzes without weighing your hair down. I have fine hair and this is the only oil I can use to make my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> AVA oil is honestly the only haircare product I&#x27;ve ever sworn by, I have never been so pleased with any type of hair product, nor have I stuck to one for so long. I have been using it for over a year and it has helped my hair recover from styling damage and breakage. I have used other products, such as Moroccan oil and other argan oils, but I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair will be softer, shinier, stronger and healthier; it also keeps strands &amp; scalp moist and protect against frizz. Its great on all hair types: my sister who has long, wavy hair that frizzes, my roommate who has thick, curly mixed-African hair, and myself with thin, flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVA has a light scent of gardenias: the smell is fresh but overpowering and will not counteract with perfume or other scented products you may use. The solution lasts for months because it is very concentrated; a little goes a long way. Another review commented how it was too heavy and greasy for her hair--be sure to not use any more than a dime-size in your palm at a time and evenly work into wet hair, always starting at the ends. For styling purposes avoid using directly on the roots, as the oil naturally works its way up to the scalp. The amount you use should be adjusted by the amount/length of your hair, as using too much can give you that greasy-heavy feeling. The oil also works fantastic as a hair masque-- drench it with AVA (you can use other oils like coconut along with it) and leave on for about 30 minutes before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product with permanent and clip-in extensions and it extended the usage I got out of both.</li>
            <li> gives body to my thick but fine hair &amp; tames frizziness, also adds a nice depth to my blonde hair and makes the layers show more. i&#x27;ve been using ava oil for two years and it works very well on my long hair. it also helps soften and condition my hair because i use curling tongs which are very drying. you have to work out how much to use to suit your type and length of hair, but once you know that, it&#x27;s easy to use.  you can use this on wet hair after shampooing or on dry hair between washes, it works just as well either way.</li>
            <li> Love this product. A little goes a long way! Great scent too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product because I have curly haired children and need something for moisture and frizz. It smells great and goes on very nicely but doesn&#x27;t do much for frizz. You definitely need something on top of it to hold the frizz back and define curls. Also, with 2 kids it goes quickly and it&#x27;s not cheap. I don&#x27;t mind paying a higher price for a good product but this one is just meh.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment oil.  My hair is curly, I like to wear it that way, and I color it, so the oil keeps brings out my curls and keeps my hair from looking dry and harsh - really gives me a softer look.  I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing as always and I love it more than Moroccan oil! What is so special about AVA is that it has no alcohol in the oil which is what&#x27;s mostly bad for your hair! I am happy with BeautyPlant as well I have been buying this product from them for 2 years now and I dont plan to stop. You wont be sad you bought AVA ever, it makes my long wavy locks look beautiful and I get comments on my hair all the time since I started using it..... :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago because I have extremely dry hair. I used it as directed and applied it to my damp hair after washing. Unfortunately instead of making my hair silky it made it sticky and heavy. I will be returning it to the store.</li>
            <li> i love this product but the sad part is that every time i order it the top is not sealed tight so i never get a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I bleached my hair and it leaves it smooth and shiny! Not oily or dull! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating and what it does for my hair is extrordinary.  I used to use the Morocan Oil but a girl at Planet Beauty recommended this instead.  It is more gel like, I can put a gob on and it does not weight it down.  I use it after shower, before the beach, I will put a ton on my dry hair and condition it all day.  I wash and it is like silk.  I also use it anytime I need to smooth or freshen the style.  I have heavily highlighted hair that gets beat up by the sun, ocean and pool all the time.  I tried going without this and I had serious withdrawals...plus, you can use on your skin and the smell with make heads turn.</li>
            <li> I bought this haircare product over a year and I still got plenty in the bottle. I&#x27;m not only using it for hair styling/heat-protecting but over all protecting from sun heat, blow dry heat , hair tangling, drying...etc. It is a good stuff.  I&#x27;ll repurchase it once it is empty</li>
            <li> I have thin hair with extensions.. I wanted to keep them moisturized without weighing down my hair. A woman at Planet Beauty recommended this oil and I&#x27;m SO glad she did!! I use it before I blow dry my hair and in between washes to fight the frizzies. I was a little worried about it being too thick but it does not weigh your hair down AT ALL. There is no alcohol in this product so after using it for the last year my hair is so much more healthier and shinier. It is a little expensive but one bottle lasted me over a year using it 4-5 times a week. Plus it smells good :) Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I put this on before a washing my hair (as directed) and it tames my hair.  It looks better after use.  I do not use it for styling.  It comes in a glass bottle (not my favorite) and pump, which is not pictured.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Leaves hair super shiny after blow drying or straightening and it smells so good. I have thick course curly hair and needed something like this to tame it. I also use it before I straighten my hair as a heat protectant. It really does restore hair and make it look healthy. I recieved the bottle with some oil spilling out of it and it was covered in oil so that was the only downside.</li>
            <li> I began using this oil approximately 3-4 months ago and I really like it! It is thick but will NOT weigh down your hair. I have relaxed hair that is not too thick but not very thin either. I was leery about using OIL on my hair as I thought it would be weighed down but I am pleasantly surprised! It has a very light, pleasant smell and it moisturizes well. I use this in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B002UEOBPE Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Repair Rescue Sealed Ends 2.6 oz]] and my hair looks and is healthier and doesn&#x27;t break at the ends. I have also used n conjunction with my deep conditioner. It is pricey but will last you a while. I am halfway through my bottle and I use it all the time, almost every day. Try it and you&#x27;ll be pleased :)</li>
            <li> The only product that works to contour and shine my frizzy curly hair</li>
            <li> Great product.  Better than Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I use it in conjunction with &amp;#34;mixed chicks leave in conditioner&amp;#34;. Together they create the phenomenal base for my long curly hair that tends to dry out. Then I add various curling cream on top! My only reservation is that the price is $40 for a very small bottle which always feels problematic every time I purchase it. I agree with another reviewer that if the company dropped their price, it would be in direct competition with Moroccan oil and overtake it.</li>
