            <li>good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>&amp; I didn&#x27;t feel like having good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>u should start with good quality brushes so that u get good result for yr efforts.  </li>

            <li>My sisters and mother really liked it as well.</li>
            <li>Nice make up brushes, work well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so nice</li>
            <li>Its a nice gift set</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice foundation/bronzer brush, this one isn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li>worth buying, the price is incredible.</li>
            <li>What i loved most about this product is the case it comes in.</li>
            <li>They arent good quality more for play, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Most of them were intact and in good shape.</li>
            <li>I thought theses brushes would be a nice starter set for me.</li>
            <li>They look just as nice as they do in the picture.</li>
            <li>To be honest i picked this brush set for the price and the color.</li>
            <li>The hairs aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; as I would have thought which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I got the brushes and they were really nice</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do good at the time of applying your make up, they retain most of it.</li>
            <li>Nice set, well made.</li>
            <li>It has all the brushes you may need for any kind of make up.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have always liked this brand and continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>One pro to these is that they do wash relatively nice and keep their shape.</li>
            <li>Case is a bit flimsy, but all in all the brushes are nice quality.  </li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it, it&#x27;s still nice to have.</li>
            <li>but if you want quality brushes for good work you&#x27;ll need to drop a bit more money on something nicer.</li>
            <li>It had so many good reviews, but when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and use them every morning.</li>
            <li>this is a nice product..</li>
            <li>Suprisingly nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are of good quality, and I love the variety.  </li>

            <li>The shipping was very fast and it was free (best part!)</li>

            <li>I like to be able to create a nice contour and these are too bendy for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to wait and try them with makeup  to give a relevant review but for first impressions these brushes are great!</li>
            <li>So super happy. &#x3D;)</li>

            <li>As these are only around 20 dollars, you honestly can&#x27;t expect them to be perfect...  </li>
            <li>for someone who is in the beauty industry starting out, finding these brushes that werent cheaply made and at a good price was awesome!</li>
            <li>This is a great set if this is your first set you are purchasing.</li>
            <li>Delivery was great and received exactly what I thought I would.</li>
            <li>They do the job, but seem very cheap.</li>
            <li>But over all super convenient to use with good price, quality matches with its price.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my set and glad I bought them, they are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I liked the make up brushes just fine.  </li>
            <li>Ordered it for myself and loved it so much I ordered one for my sister&#x27;s birthday - she will love it!</li>
            <li>I love the case though and</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t bought this set I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my eyeshadow kit.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t have done any better for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>I was able to notice straying hairs from the brush and some began to fall off a bit.</li>
            <li>If I had noticed these brushes in store, I would have bought better makeup applicators.</li>
            <li>but when i got it, i felt in love with it</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li>They get the job done and are so adorable.</li>
            <li>This is an OK brush set,suitable for beginners.</li>
            <li>but I will need to buy some individual brushes to create a perfect set of brushes.</li>
            <li>, not quite sure if that is suppose to be</li>
            <li>if you by them at like target or something they all come separate and would cost you alot more.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this..</li>
            <li>Brushes lost many bristles before I even used them.</li>
            <li>people say y do you need so many brushes</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and especially for the price, its a deal!!</li>
            <li>The holding case is really adorable, as well.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for beginner makeup enthusiasts out there. :)</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Oh and i LOVE LOVE LOVE that it just snaps close instead of the wrap around strings you have to tie.</li>
            <li>Its O.K  the reason I say its ok is cuz da</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter has been asking for set ever since I got them!  :)</li>
            <li>Once I used them, more and more bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li>But, they are helping me to learn what brush you use with which makeup and come with an extremely cute faux alligator case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash before using because I flicked at the top of them and a powder dust came off of three of them.</li>
            <li>The better to keep them safe my dear.</li>
            <li>I love that the case fits in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li>The case is cute and keeps all my brushes organized.</li>
            <li>love it :)</li>
            <li>(Or the look cuz they are adorable)</li>
            <li>I have had no brush hair loss and the smaller brushes have been excellent for my eye shadow!</li>
            <li>I could have hand made better brushes.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>The actual bristles are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I actually love these brushes they did not shed</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect the most out of them.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m not overwhelmed by too many brushes.</li>
            <li>I told my daughter she better hide them, or I might use them myself.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure that was my mistake since i washed them.</li>
            <li>I love all the pencils, just the case</li>
            <li>The brushes are an ok quality.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes that comes in with the pouch.</li>
            <li>Okay* quality.</li>
            <li>but I love them</li>

            <li>I have like 2 sephora brushes which I love</li>
            <li>Bought this for my granddaughter, pleased with it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not for someone that has a bit more expirience with applying their makeup.</li>
            <li>It was great in delivery, but it did smell too much like plastic.</li>
            <li>I bought these just because I wanted more of a variety of brushes and some uniformity within them.</li>
            <li>I thought they were really cute</li>
            <li>but I can say that I like these a lot more</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>There are too many eyeshadow brushes and none of them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>ARE MORE LIKE MINI FOUNDATIONS BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>The quality is OK but the range of brushes allows for lots of experimentation.</li>
            <li>is better quality</li>

            <li>The set includes all you need if you aren&#x27;t a makeup artist :).</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m satisfied with their usability and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to wear make-up all the time and look cute</li>
            <li>But as a customer im still satisfied and recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s a beginner</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are better than others.</li>

            <li>Pretty good set for the price</li>
            <li>Picks up makeup pretty good.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Being a person who use to use whatever brush came with the makeup palette, to a person who now buys pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush in this set is worth MORE than the set itself which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to roll this case up and take it on the go with you.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived quickly which was nice but the quality is \\&quot;ehh\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Love the case, easy for travel.</li>
            <li>They are a good quality set for the price you pay, and i absolutely love the work it does; the look as well is very girly and has character it will bring some excitement to your collection if your like me</li>
            <li>there is no any good eyeshadow brushes, there is no any crease definer or smudger brush, i dont like eye liner brush,  there is only good blush brushes</li>
            <li>The pink case is okay at best.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a set of good quality, descent, good price brushes and I finally FINALLY!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very easy to clean and the variety of brushes helps me accomplish the look i want.</li>
            <li>they clean very easy...</li>
            <li>They get the job done and they are smooth thus they get a 3 stars, if they had more quality (i.e. brush didn&#x27;t snap off or the brush protectors were intact) would have gotten a 4.</li>
            <li>i am really glad its so cheap...</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, soft, no smell to them when opened.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT ON YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li>Jon Snow, I know nothing, when it comes to this stuff so as long as the recipient liked it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Bought the Pink Set for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it!!</li>
            <li>fantastic brushes love the texture,,, havent used all of them</li>
            <li>So many brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>She loved the brushes so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>Overall, good deal for the price, nice variety of brushes, and a cute case.</li>
            <li>these makeup brushes make me want to get ready :) love love love them.</li>
            <li>I love the portable case, it keeps me organized and the brushes I want handy- no digging through a bag looking for a certain brush, plus it protects them from damages.</li>
            <li>All the brushes from top to bottom had a plastic wrap on them to protect them which I like, keeps them in there original shape.  </li>
            <li>im so excited to use these brushes in all the looks i&#x27;m going to create &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li>and they were as good as new!</li>
            <li>My set came packaged very carefully, and perfectly in tact inside.</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING the brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>the bristles run smoothy together, and can easily pick up eye shadow and evenly apply it.</li>
            <li>easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I gave another brush a try and broke easily too....</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes came apart from the wood, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>its cute and fun and many brushes to use from</li>
            <li>They are cute though, and the case they come in is adorable, I just don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Keeps everything together, although when I opened the package, it smelled strongly like paint.</li>
            <li>I read that some people said it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>I am sure there are better brush sets out there, but the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The foundation brush works perfectly, the shadow brushes are great as well, but the blush and bronzer brushes are a little too soft.</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute and will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I think the problem is that the bristles are too fine</li>
            <li>The brushes was fine.</li>
            <li>They are fine.</li>
            <li>, Pouch is super cute.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super soft and the case is very cute!</li>
            <li>I just order 2 more sets as gifts because I am that positive that the people who will get them are going to love them.  </li>
            <li>Amazing I love the brushes they are soft and easy to clean😍😍😍</li>
            <li>Shipping was all fine, however the brushes seem to be REALLY cheaply made.</li>
            <li>would say that they are user friendly and easy to use when applying your make up.</li>
            <li>When i received them i was so excited to try them, they are very soft, no shedding and a lot of good brushes.</li>
            <li>It catches makeup very well and when applying to my face its nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>so I am huge on makeup, fashion, ect</li>
            <li>I cant stand cheap brushes that irritate my face.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because in reality I had a cheap deal with these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>If you like cheap brushes and don&#x27;t care, this is for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and protects my brushes.</li>
            <li>its not at all cheap</li>
            <li>80% of the brushes are great for people with mid level experience.</li>
            <li>So, in summary i do enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li>It was free and the brushes arrived within two days.</li>
            <li>The case is too flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>Quality of the synthetic brushes are descent and you get a variation of brush sizes which is important when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the brushes and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>Brushes felt cheap...</li>
            <li>It can fit in your purse, tote bag, make-up bag...</li>
            <li>So I was happy that I could use this the next day.</li>
            <li>but they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>use this kit everyday, its awesome!</li>
            <li>the smaller brushes are great.)  </li>
            <li>For the brushes, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I feel like i still got a great deal and plan to use these well into the future.</li>
            <li>It was kind of hark working with these, I really dont like to brisles.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>great for extra brushes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend avoiding them unless you can get them with free returns.</li>
            <li>comes exactly as shown, and the brushes are actually pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>and i know for sure sometime in the future i will be purchasing these for my family and girls ^_^ don&#x27;t miss out on a fair purchase....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t really wear makeup or is just starting out, this set is perfect!</li>
            <li>I honestly use them every now and then, but I&#x27;m stuck on using my old set of brushes until I find another set more to my liking.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are good quality, really soft and picks up a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Just go them and so far so good.</li>
            <li>They might be a good gift for a 12 year old that is just getting into make-up?</li>
            <li>They are soft, wish is good</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the variety is good, so I like this kit for travel.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very good and are very easy to clean; just use cold water and shampoo. :P</li>
            <li>the brushes are good quality and its super compact and fits into almost any normal sized hand bag.</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are and still am surprised on how good quality they are for the price!</li>
            <li>but VERY rare.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought multiple sets from Amazon, and these were very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great for a first make up brush set for a teen.  </li>
            <li>ok they are cheap and pretty so whynot by them ??</li>
            <li>I assume the case is really cheap, but the brushes are just right!</li>
            <li>Normally a lot of brushes I get are \\&quot;pointy\\&quot; to the touch &amp; on the face which I dislike but these are all nice to the face.   </li>
            <li>soooo worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive these brushes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend them I should have just paid for mac full price brushes instead of trying to go cheap &amp; getting these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if she likes it</li>
            <li>I got these brushes in the mail today, and i was really excited about it.</li>
            <li>but any girls would appreciate it than a Walmart makeup brush;):)  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I would like to say first that i love the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>First of all, the case was ok.</li>
            <li>I really was surprised how great these brushes are.</li>
            <li>because you have to sanitize your brushes and keep them clean via washing them, the metal parts will pop off from the handle eventually</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brushes are the best for thin lines and it has every size brush needed for applying blush and highlights my cheeks and the top with translucent powder.</li>
            <li>i loved how many brushes it holds and the pink casing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this got so many positive views, I can&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive review about this product I had to try them my self.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, the pink case does well in protecting the brushes and makes sure that the brushes stay in condition though it does look rather cheap looking.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and the carrying case is positively adorable!</li>
            <li>I would not call them professional but they will do the job for sure!</li>
            <li>these brushes are soft cute and sturdy!</li>
            <li>I also love that they&#x27;re soft and super cute.</li>

            <li>Package arrived in good condition &amp; brushed were packed well.</li>
            <li>a true eyeshadow brush  Pros:  </li>
            <li>These brushes are not as full as they look.  </li>
            <li>So nice, soft and beautifull brushes.</li>
            <li>BUT I don&#x27;t really recommend them for someone who is use to heavier brushes or brushes with more bristles.</li>
            <li>Oh and the lipstick brush is kinda cool</li>
            <li>Brushes for real beginners :-)</li>
            <li>brushes are soft and the color is nice.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t not a bad purchase for the money.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price as well.</li>
            <li>when they came in they did smell but it was not bad</li>
            <li>these brushes fell very soft and stable but had a very strong nail polish sent....</li>
            <li>They are super soft, they come in an amazing case.</li>
            <li>i mean for 19$ these brushes are great!</li>
            <li>handles pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This is very good because they are all in a neat little bag and they are all there!</li>
            <li>other than dat their Great.</li>
            <li>But as said before in other reviews, you get what you pay for lol.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and easy to clean, all of the brushes came with a plastic cover, that keeps them neat and the carrying pouch is easy to pack for going to photo shoots or just putting away in my make-up box.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I love the blush brushes, but I do find that most of the selections are repeats of the same type of brush-</li>
            <li>These brushes did not provide adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>I had to super glue to</li>
            <li>overall i am very impressed this is the second set i have bought from bundle monster !</li>
            <li>They hurt my eyelids and if you swipe them too quick the brush poofs the powder all over your face.</li>
            <li>them pretty quick!</li>
            <li>SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT,BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AS SHE REALLY NEEDED THE BRUSHES &amp; WAS DELIGHTED.</li>
            <li>and I also saw it on amazon for $24 i highly recommend that set better.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft, I haven&#x27;t noticed any fibers/hairs falling out during use, the case is convenient for travel and pretty cute, too!  </li>
            <li>The foundation brush head came off the handle the very first time i used it.</li>
            <li>, I like it very much!</li>
            <li>but i was very pleased to open it</li>
            <li>Best brushes so far, and the pink alligator skin case that came with it!</li>
            <li>Obviously not the most amazing brushes but do well for how much you pay for them.</li>
            <li>They are very soft but still pretty durable, they aren&#x27;t &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, but they are GREAT for beginners.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the ecoTools sets, they are full and soft and wash well and do not shed.</li>
            <li>The case it comes with looks exactly as the picture shows and all the brushes arrived nicely in the clear plastics as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love the color &amp; they are very soft.  </li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE SO SOFT! :)</li>
            <li>and they were exactly as shown!</li>
            <li>i just got these brushes today and i love them so far!</li>
            <li>the brushes weren&#x27;t very put together because they fell apart!!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and I love the case.</li>
            <li>I love the color and magnetic snaps make it so easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>Good package, but not high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes apply my makeup perfectly and they are very soft yet firm to the skin.</li>
            <li>it was pretty clean when I washed them.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and is a great variety for someone who is just starting to use brushes.</li>
            <li>Brushes are good quality and the pink color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The case smelled a little like plastic but is great for keeping brushes together while traveling.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its pink, its my favorite color.</li>
            <li>The case is SOOOO soft and SOOOOO cute</li>
            <li>The brush itself is way too soft to be able to pick up pigments from any make-up.</li>
            <li>Worth a bit over a doller.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the money don&#x27;t hesitate but these.</li>
            <li>Trust me its worth the money....</li>
            <li>worth it....</li>
            <li>it still has a distinct odor of gas to it.</li>
            <li>I bought an E.L.F. makeup case it comes with 11 professional brushes and i love that set</li>
            <li>I have the worlds most sensitive nose</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I have completely fallen in love with them and</li>
            <li>All of the brushes fit nicely in the pouch, which is great for travel, but I think I will end up keeping the brushes in something else for everyday use--maybe I am just in too much of a rush in the mornings to open the case every time I need into it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I just recently built my own Hollywood style Vanity.</li>
            <li>I love how the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>They were entirely soft which can be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But at $18 it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>So far they seem to be working OK.</li>
            <li>so i only liked 4 out of the 15....</li>
            <li>it’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice set of makeup brushes, and before you assume that I ordered what I thought was going to be a great set of brushes at such a cheap price naively, let me say...</li>
            <li>They are long enough to easily hold and do a great job at applying the makeup.</li>
            <li>and i am soooooo happy and well pleased with my final choice, first of all the quantity is amazing and very helpful, also some complained about the bristles breaking or it shedding, but i don&#x27;t have that problem at all..</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews I read on this product the brushes are just ok.</li>
            <li>I would say that these brushes are definitely great for beginners and for practicing, but now that I am moving on from what I believe to be the \\&quot;beginner state\\&quot;, I&#x27;m ready to try something more serious.</li>
            <li>(: other than that they are in good shape.</li>
            <li>and I order them right away.  </li>
            <li>cause boy it smacks ya right in the face.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li>I must say, the reviews on these brushes are right.</li>
            <li>I wash them with mild soap every time I need and they just dry and are as good as new!</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the how soft these brushes are and the fact that they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I am able to get a professional looking finish easily.</li>
            <li>When I took it out of the box it was wrapped in plastic to protect it, very easy to open which I also like.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This will be my first review based on my first impressions!</li>
            <li>wash the brushes with my favorite shampoo than I blow dry light</li>
            <li>They are very soft but you will not be able to do much with them.</li>
            <li>they barely hold eyeshadow and you have to reapply over and over just to be able to see it.</li>
            <li>so shipping was super fast.    </li>
            <li>Very cute hot pink carrying case.</li>
            <li>is perfect dont waste your money buying a lot of brushes that will at the end be the same !&lt;</li>
            <li>so the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made and too soft for any type of use, except for that one brush!</li>
            <li>This is a very economic yet chic option.</li>
            <li>(Even without using the brushes) I&#x27;m sure they work just fine as long as you&#x27;re not some super professional</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these brushes, and purchased simply off others positive reviews, but was also looking for a set that was easy to take with  me when we travel.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are quite soft and fine looking, as advertised.</li>
            <li>It would be a perfect gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art that wants to try out all the different brushes before spending big bucks on Professional brushes.</li>
            <li>I have recommended these brushes to all my girlfriends, they are soft and super!</li>
            <li>But it is a good little brush kit.</li>
            <li>-cute, easy to hold brushes  -Super fluffy powder brushes, so you don&#x27;t look cakey!  </li>
            <li>they lasted me a good while now im going to order another set in pink!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes don&#x27;t spread the makeup out as evenly as I would like, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>because I mostly purchased this for the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>also the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>I, RECIEVED MY BRUSH SET TODAY ALONG SIDE WITH THE REST OF MY FIRST ORDER</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first time i went to use it, it BROKE OFF its stick</li>
            <li>The delivery was FAST!</li>
            <li>and they seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>First, the shipping was supper fast!</li>
            <li>Came the exact date it told me it would.</li>
            <li>and they are all still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li>will probablu buy these kit again since Ive lost pretty much all of them!</li>
            <li>It was like they were hot glued onto the handle.</li>
            <li>However, most of the brushes came unglued from the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>A lot of variety for a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>First time i use one of the brushes and broke...</li>
            <li>The brush heads are made of a cheap but soft synthetic fiber, and distribute powder evenly.</li>
            <li>Its my first set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall ok brushes for beginners.</li>
            <li>but overall they OK.</li>
            <li>This delivery was so fast (I got it today)!</li>
            <li>Soon enough the top part came off altogether.</li>
            <li>Overall i love the brushes just not the smell</li>
            <li>It works the same, but I have more of a choice with this set, with a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>On the brushes when they first arrive there is almost like a powdery substance</li>
            <li>The bag is pretty too although it&#x27;s kinda falling apart</li>
            <li>there are many brushes so it is not really a big deal</li>
            <li>I got this brush set about 4 years ago, when I first started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are exactly how I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheap and  a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>it sorta smells funny, but after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>comments about too many lip brushes as this set only has one lip brush...</li>
            <li>pink case is nice as well.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re very well made!</li>
            <li>But to be fair for the price i got a lot of use of them, still use a few of them after almost a year.</li>
            <li>My colors are black and hot pink, it matched perfectly!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cheap and there isn&#x27;t a variety of different brushes.  </li>
            <li>First I have to say that these brushes really don&#x27;t lose hair very much.  </li>
            <li>I must say I was a little worried because I had seen a lot of negative reviews but for now these brushes are great, I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>Maybe good for a tween or teen just starting to learn how too apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes and NO shedding problems!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it serves its purpose very well :)</li>
            <li>But they are super soft and they look pretty.</li>
            <li>I saw all of the positive feedback for these brushes and they were so afforadable, so I decided to ask for them for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>thanks for fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>but as long as you have a spare blending brush these would be OK- if you wanted them for the price or something.</li>
            <li>the foundation brush is very sturdy but very streaky!</li>
            <li>Dont let everyone tell you how amazing these brushes are, they&#x27;re not a super deal and the quality of the brushes matches its price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and no irritation since I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>The metal handle attaching the brush to the wooden handle is not made well either, I can easily bend it.     </li>
            <li>I did try with them dry and they did ok.</li>
            <li>Super soft and all the brushes you need for any look.  </li>
            <li>the hair is super soft..</li>
            <li>large powder brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love pretty much anything pink</li>
            <li>These brushes are okk the face brushes are pretty great but the angled brush wasn&#x27;t stiff enough for me.</li>
            <li>They took a little longer getting here than I would have liked</li>
            <li>Monster\\&quot; brushes I think I will just take my chances with something a little more worth my while.</li>
            <li>better to  invest a little bit more in a product that will last longer like MAC brushes or BObbi Brown brushes.</li>
            <li>Although I have only used it a few times, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping which I like.   </li>
            <li>It was packaged very well</li>
            <li>The handle is not good quality, I was able to separate the brush from the wooden handle with a nice tug after I first opened and examined the brushes,  I might have to re-glue all 15.</li>
            <li>The outer material seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought this brushes,and the shipping was REALLY</li>
            <li>but that really shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>My coworker absolutely loves this brush set.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and girly-girl.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a clutch-type purse and can easily fit into my regular purse for when i do my makeup on the go.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY STYLISHHHH ...</li>
            <li>They dont hold color very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I thought the product was very well packed</li>
            <li>They came fast and they haven&#x27;t shed or anything.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t pay much attention to the complaints about the plastic smell because I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the brush set.</li>
            <li>its really cute&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and includes several different types.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that their pink, because I love pink.. &amp; for the price ?</li>
            <li>The draw back is the metal piece the fibers fit into,</li>
            <li>I love the wide range of sizes and shapes.  </li>
            <li>Hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very displeasing.</li>
            <li>THANK YALL SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH</li>
            <li>However the cons really outweigh the pros.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use any of the eye makeup brushes expect for the angle brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming cheap glue or not enough glue</li>
            <li>real make up</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Dont really provide the service I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This was actually my first time ordering, so I was worried how long it would take but everything went smoothly and fast.</li>
            <li>They are worth the price (which was reduced)and well packaged, fast shipping, soft to the touch, catches makeup well.  </li>
            <li>I might suggest them for a 16 year old starting out who doesn&#x27;t know any better</li>
            <li>, I would also liked to have a round brush ( thats just me)</li>
            <li>I dont even use the brushes to be honest, I gave a few of them away to my sister in law because the eyeshadow burshes seem like repeats</li>
            <li>Other than that the brushes are amazingly soft &amp; love them!</li>
            <li>they are really nice for everyday use ..</li>
            <li>I was so excited when they finally came through the mail.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I received the package but within a couple times of using a middle size brush, it came apart from the handle.</li>
            <li>i took a risk on buying this because some other reviews were sketchy, but like i said i&#x27;m glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li>This cheap bundle of brushes was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>, it is on the cheap side not good quality  but its cute.</li>
            <li>and after I had my son, I went through kind of a lazy stage... not getting ready for the day, not caring.</li>
            <li>I had boughten these brushes because I had needed new ones and thought the pink handles and bag were cute.</li>
            <li>Most of the eye brushes are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>I looked at other sets of different varieties, but I am very glad</li>
            <li>They are pretty sturdy and the brush hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad set, just don&#x27;t expect the same quality as a MAC brush.</li>
            <li>They seem very high quality and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brushes work a lot better than the larger brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are decent.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft so don&#x27;t really grab all that much color.</li>
            <li>i have purchased one for myself and my older daughter.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent quality.</li>
            <li>I am an entertainer though, and need to be fresh and ready to go for auditions and red carpet events.</li>
            <li>They apply make-up decently for a plastic brush.</li>
            <li>I chalked this up to a fluke, super glued the metal part back onto the wood handle, and continued to use the brushes.</li>
            <li>Over all a &#x27;decent set for the price&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and hold the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the level of quality for the price!</li>
            <li>I liked these brushes at first and actually still have a few in my make up brush drawer</li>
            <li>So soft, not a hair out of place, and are really tightly packed, so it makes spreading the pigment around very easy.</li>
            <li>I expacted a product with high quality</li>
            <li>For the price that I paid for, I was NOT expecting really high quality brushes like mac or sephora one.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMAND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and look forward to upgrading with another of their products.</li>
            <li>I think investing in high quality brushes is the way too go no matter what.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>AND THE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li>a little more $and get</li>
            <li>The smell was a little overwhelming when I received the brushes but just after a couple hours of having them out and cleaned these no plastic smell.</li>
            <li>i did not know how much i was lacking only after this package arrived as an anniversary gift, its very soft and has multiple angles, great for the heavy makeup user like me.</li>
            <li>and their kind of hard idk maybe cuz there</li>
            <li>This set is very chic but also has professional quality.</li>
            <li>they are soft and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>She loves how soft they are and how much easier it is to apply her makeup.</li>
            <li>the only 3 brushes that really work for me are the first 3 to apply blush..</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and love them.</li>
            <li>All of the shadow brushes were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>For the most part they don&#x27;t shed, I&#x27;ve already washed them a few times.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I use them everyday.</li>
            <li>I love the two blush brushes, the angle brush, the foundation brush and the eyebrows and eyelash brush but the rest of the brushes are just redundant.</li>
            <li>they are just what I expected, clearly if you&#x27;re looking for simple and nice brushes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I like the varied shadow brushes because I find the different sizes useful for variation in blending</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes do not pick up the eye makeup that easily, you have to push the brush down kind of hard to get it on the bristles.</li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft and looked/felt high quality.  </li>
            <li>They didnt last at all, and they break off the wooden sticks quite easily after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves, although I have not used them yet, are super soft and don&#x27;t shed one hair and none of the metal things come unglued from the wooden handle</li>
            <li>the brushes themselves were very soft but so soft they didn&#x27;t pick up any product very well.</li>
            <li>I must say all the brushes are really soft on the face, Which is a Plus because my skin is very sensitive, and they look and feel really sturdy.  </li>
            <li>and I like to keep certain brushes with certain colors (no mixing and no washing to use with a different shade needed for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it right back on and it hasn&#x27;t come off since..</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes and they actually were pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The brushes are too soft, and the case is a little cute, but the quality of the brushes are questioned.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to any teenager or new comer who is learning how to do makeup b&#x27;coz</li>
            <li>MUST WASH ALL YOUR NEW</li>
            <li>UNTIL I GET ANOTHER BRAND NEW BRUSH SET .</li>
            <li>Nothing I can&#x27;t live with though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li>However, I am new to correctly applying my make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting new ones now</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>The brushes in the product were fine but the pink case looked a little cheap.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY soft to the touch &amp; VERY soft to the face which I ADORE.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>Bristles haven&#x27;t fallen off and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>these brushes is very soft..</li>
            <li>They are very soft and at this time non have shed.</li>
            <li>Material is very soft and affortable price.</li>
            <li>Very soft, wish it included a blending brush</li>
            <li>They are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Several of the smallest brushes are foreign to me, so I would have loved a little list of what each brush is for, as I normally would use maybe 7-8 as opposed to this large collection.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy and soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li>The pockets held them very well and no slipping out.</li>
            <li>-These brushes are too soft!</li>
            <li>but I have four brushes that ate exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Next, handle in th me brushes are pretty well put in.</li>
            <li>I most likely won&#x27;t use some of them but the big brushes definitely.</li>
            <li>only thing I wish on the brush it would be labeled what type of brush it is like many other brush sets...</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but have a distinctly synthetic feel, but again, for the price I expected as much.</li>
            <li>** ^ THAT WAS MY FIRST REVIEW - THEY JUST RECENTLY BROKE AFTER</li>
            <li>The brushes are supper soft and you can tell that those hairs aren&#x27;t going anywhere!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the case has a smell,  but it is pretty.</li>
            <li>At first the packaging did smell however I opened the package and left it out overnight.</li>
            <li>I love the blush brushes and a few of the eye ones!</li>
            <li>But other than that I love them and would definitely recommend getting them!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice set, but it is not a professional set for long term use.</li>
            <li>I only use them for back-up brushes if I have two girls in a row and not enough time to clean the brushes in between.</li>
            <li>Background on me: this is my first cosmetic brush set, and I had just recently got my makeup professionally done</li>
            <li>when i first received my brushes there was was a smell to them especially the case that it comes in, so i aired mine out for a couple days and the smell went away.</li>
            <li>they are very soft but not to soft...</li>
            <li>Bristles were very soft, some were a bit too soft for what I would think would be the stiffer brushes.  </li>
            <li>some one younger or even a bit older can use these brushes just as well; meaning for someone who doesn&#x27;t experiment with heavy colors and enjoys more of a natural look.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, there is a lot of variety (although there could be less lip brushes and more eye brushes), and they last for the the price.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and would recommend to people who need makeup brushes and are on a tight budget like myself.</li>
            <li>i only use that brush once i would have gave 5 stars but my main brush i use is broke how something new fall apart</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as variable as I would like since there is no fluffy eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>was shedding around the edges and looked like if you threw it in your bag, it would completely unravel.  </li>
            <li>However, the smaller brushes work well as they have much shorter bristles and so are sturdier.</li>
            <li>they are some soft brushes but they are falling apart</li>
            <li>but i fixed it</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product, and when finally received it I found out that the bag was a little broken to be honest I did not care,</li>
            <li>I easily fixed it with some glue</li>
            <li>BRUSHES\\&quot; So after I washed them I was surprised that no hairs came out and</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>i tugged a few times..and they are secure and well in place...</li>
            <li>a 21yr old and  by the fineness of the brushes and how it picks up the eye shadow,</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because I was starting to get really into makeup, and I know that learning brush technique is one of the hardest parts that I&#x27;ve struggled with.</li>
            <li>I actually  feel like you really get a value seeing as one brush can cost anywhere between 20 dollars and up.</li>
            <li>They are soft and I did not see any shedding when I washed them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>These are a cheap set that should not be used as an everyday set.  </li>
            <li>Extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I bought these for Grandma to give to my eleven year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>i bought these for my 11 year old daughter to play/practice makeup</li>
            <li>BRUSHES ARE SOFT ON YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li>calling them pro is far from the truth</li>
            <li>Of course in time brushes get old</li>
            <li>professional use 1 star.</li>
            <li>I really prefer a bigger brush for blending.</li>
            <li>And the are soooo soft</li>
            <li>If I could give these too soft, flimsy brushes a negative rating I would, however the only good thing about this brush set is the eyebrow spooler that I use daily.</li>
            <li>brush r soft...</li>
            <li>the brush hairs are not as soft as i thought they were.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are soft and work well.  </li>
            <li>The bristles in the brush are soft and never fall off.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and seem somewhat durable.</li>
            <li>They are soft andwhen</li>
            <li>Are they too soft?  </li>
            <li>(Update: the face brushes are too soft.)</li>
            <li>The snap seems as though it could be stronger, but so far no problems.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was rather surprised when I received this item.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and work well.</li>
            <li>Bought this as an extra just to play with but shadows don&#x27;t really get on the brushes</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about buying these, because your brushes makes a big difference on how your makeup turns out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the hair is soft and that depends on what you prefer ..</li>
            <li>When I first opened up my brushes they did have &#x27;that odor&#x27;, but properly cleaning them (as you should do before using new brushes) fixed it instantly.</li>
            <li>Many of the brushes are larger or smaller versions of each other.</li>
            <li>When I recieved them they did have a small scent (nothing strong)</li>
            <li>I admit that I use my brushes daily, but I keep them in a special separate area in my make-up case where they are far from abused.&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, if you&#x27;re looking for quantity these are your brushes, if you&#x27;re looking for any type of quality that will last standard use, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I guess this will just be in a make-up kit to go with my other colorful things</li>
            <li>when you first open it is definitely over-whelming</li>
            <li>I give them only 4 stars because when I was cleaning them for the first time, one of the foundation brushes fell off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>i love these brsuhes but sadly 2 of them broke but a little bit of hot glue or super glue fixed them.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit hesitant at first to buy them, just because of the bad reviews they got and worrying if the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone starting out in makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes work really well and would highly recommend to other users.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time and hard earned money with these brushes, I bought this set and one from Coastal Scents and love the latter.</li>
            <li>Pretty in pink~</li>
            <li>The case is a pretty pink and holds all the brushes for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li>They are firm &amp; do not give full coverage.</li>
            <li>There was a strong smell as soon as I opened it, but after literally 2 minutes it was hardly there anymore.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more flimsy than any other brush case I&#x27;ve previously owned.</li>
            <li>but I left it open on my vanity for a week and don&#x27;t notice it much</li>
            <li>I think this product is definitely worth the $20 or less you will pay for it.  </li>
            <li>I honestly was expecting them to be worse than they actually are.</li>
            <li>These brushes were very soft and would probably function well, but since one of the ones I wanted had the brush head fall off, back they went.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is pretty.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the larger brushes are relatively soft.</li>
            <li>I expected a real Mac product.</li>
            <li>They have no fluff to them whatsoever.</li>
            <li>As far as overall function-</li>
            <li>I found the larger brushes too soft to use.</li>
            <li>OLD GRANDDAUGHTERS WISH LIST &amp; HAD BEEN ON THE LIST SINCE LAST YEAR.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it now.</li>
            <li>A lot of these brushes have almost the exact same shape not really creating a variety.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice buy considering brushes are expensive..</li>
            <li>Bundle Monster didn&#x27;t disappointed, these are some pretty good brushes especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>I love that when I ordered them they were pink as opposed to other brush sets which displayed pink brushes but said color may vary.</li>
            <li>they are offering 15 brushed total for less price then the other brands who charge more for one brush.  </li>
            <li>I mean, even the eyeliner brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to apply liner  </li>
            <li>Once I recieved them, I did notice the odor that some other people were talking about, but that went away after I gently washed my brushes and let them air out for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on these were much softer than other sets.</li>
            <li>I was super exicted due to the fact that they are pink.</li>
            <li>Otherwise... they are thin, and practically the same brush in several sizes, pretty cheap quality, and they do have a bit of a strange smell.</li>
            <li>All of them are decent and not too rough on skin.</li>
            <li>After washing the bristles a few came out but overall for the price definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The case it comes in does smell a little funny</li>
            <li>nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>This is my second set buying, because it works with my bare mineral powder make and the quality for price</li>
            <li>I have to hot glue one of the pink handles back on, but that was minor.</li>
            <li>The quality of all these brushes is worth like a few hundred in upper class quality stores, and you only pay like $24!!!!!</li>
            <li>However, with a few replacements and some hot glue, these brushes worked well as a starter kit for me.</li>
            <li>all the smaller brushes are really not good the big fluffy ones like for powder blush and the foundation ones are t he only good ones</li>
            <li>The only thing worng with them is they are all very flat, and soft.</li>
            <li>some of the tops where the black part is would fall off but a little glue fixed that really quick</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed people were saying was that this kit had a heavy plastic smell when you first open it.</li>
            <li>My first impression was like I got few same brushes in different sizes</li>
            <li>but I will super glue that sucker back in tomorrow.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing about them, and I read most other people&#x27;s reviews as well that said the same thing, the case has a very distinct vinyl smell to it</li>
            <li>I really only purchased this product due to the price and pretty pink color</li>

            <li> good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel like having good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> u should start with good quality brushes so that u get good result for yr efforts.  </li>

            <li> BObbi Brown brushes are amazing..</li>
            <li> My sisters and mother really liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Nice make up brushes, work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are so nice</li>
            <li> Its a nice gift set</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice foundation/bronzer brush, this one isn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li> worth buying, the price is incredible.</li>
            <li> What i loved most about this product is the case it comes in.</li>
            <li> They arent good quality more for play, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Most of them were intact and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I thought theses brushes would be a nice starter set for me.</li>
            <li> They look just as nice as they do in the picture.</li>
            <li> To be honest i picked this brush set for the price and the color.</li>
            <li> The hairs aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; as I would have thought which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes and they were really nice</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do good at the time of applying your make up, they retain most of it.</li>
            <li> Nice set, well made.</li>
            <li> It has all the brushes you may need for any kind of make up.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have always liked this brand and continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> One pro to these is that they do wash relatively nice and keep their shape.</li>
            <li> Case is a bit flimsy, but all in all the brushes are nice quality.  </li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it, it&#x27;s still nice to have.</li>
            <li> but if you want quality brushes for good work you&#x27;ll need to drop a bit more money on something nicer.</li>
            <li> It had so many good reviews, but when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and use them every morning.</li>
            <li> this is a nice product..</li>
            <li> Suprisingly nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are of good quality, and I love the variety.  </li>
            <li> ;) im very happy whit this brushes, nice case and lovely colors if you have problems whit the smell</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth the time and purchase if you want a good variety of brushes for a good value.</li>
            <li> Very soft and great quality!</li>
            <li> This set arrived within a week of ordering, when i opened it i found the brushes to be excellent and very soft</li>
            <li> Sexy ,cute , like it !</li>
            <li> Is super nice, love the color, but the bag ain&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my first ever Amazon purchase!</li>
            <li> instead try the jessup brushes much cheaper but also very good in quality (almost a sigma dupe)</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD THANKS I&#x60;ll DO IT</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and it was free (best part!)</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s synthetic hair which makes it all the better to feel nice about brushing your face with it.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to create a nice contour and these are too bendy for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait and try them with makeup  to give a relevant review but for first impressions these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> So super happy. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this brush set!  </li>
            <li> I love love love the case!</li>
            <li> If you are in a pinch or just need a cheap set to travel with these are pretty good and the price is great</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and such a great price!</li>
            <li> As these are only around 20 dollars, you honestly can&#x27;t expect them to be perfect...  </li>
            <li> for someone who is in the beauty industry starting out, finding these brushes that werent cheaply made and at a good price was awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great set if this is your first set you are purchasing.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great and received exactly what I thought I would.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but seem very cheap.</li>
            <li> But over all super convenient to use with good price, quality matches with its price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my set and glad I bought them, they are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I liked the make up brushes just fine.  </li>
            <li> Ordered it for myself and loved it so much I ordered one for my sister&#x27;s birthday - she will love it!</li>
            <li> I love the case though and</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t bought this set I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my eyeshadow kit.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t have done any better for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I was able to notice straying hairs from the brush and some began to fall off a bit.</li>
            <li> If I had noticed these brushes in store, I would have bought better makeup applicators.</li>
            <li> but when i got it, i felt in love with it</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li> They get the job done and are so adorable.</li>
            <li> This is an OK brush set,suitable for beginners.</li>
            <li> but I will need to buy some individual brushes to create a perfect set of brushes.</li>
            <li> , not quite sure if that is suppose to be</li>
            <li> if you by them at like target or something they all come separate and would cost you alot more.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this..</li>
            <li> Brushes lost many bristles before I even used them.</li>
            <li> people say y do you need so many brushes</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and especially for the price, its a deal!!</li>
            <li> The holding case is really adorable, as well.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for beginner makeup enthusiasts out there. :)</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Oh and i LOVE LOVE LOVE that it just snaps close instead of the wrap around strings you have to tie.</li>
            <li> Its O.K  the reason I say its ok is cuz da</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has been asking for set ever since I got them!  :)</li>
            <li> Once I used them, more and more bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> But, they are helping me to learn what brush you use with which makeup and come with an extremely cute faux alligator case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash before using because I flicked at the top of them and a powder dust came off of three of them.</li>
            <li> The better to keep them safe my dear.</li>
            <li> I love that the case fits in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> The case is cute and keeps all my brushes organized.</li>
            <li> love it :)</li>
            <li> (Or the look cuz they are adorable)</li>
            <li> I have had no brush hair loss and the smaller brushes have been excellent for my eye shadow!</li>
            <li> I could have hand made better brushes.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> The actual bristles are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I actually love these brushes they did not shed</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect the most out of them.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m not overwhelmed by too many brushes.</li>
            <li> I told my daughter she better hide them, or I might use them myself.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sure that was my mistake since i washed them.</li>
            <li> I love all the pencils, just the case</li>
            <li> The brushes are an ok quality.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes that comes in with the pouch.</li>
            <li> Okay* quality.</li>
            <li> but I love them</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad my sister love it...</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I have like 2 sephora brushes which I love</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter, pleased with it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not for someone that has a bit more expirience with applying their makeup.</li>
            <li> It was great in delivery, but it did smell too much like plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought these just because I wanted more of a variety of brushes and some uniformity within them.</li>
            <li> I thought they were really cute</li>
            <li> but I can say that I like these a lot more</li>
            <li> love how it feels and look ..</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Totally cute.</li>

            <li> and now I am going to experiment on eye shadows more often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my sister will appreciate it</li>
            <li> ):)</li>
            <li> There are so many choices.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup and they help me to apply the makeup smoothly and it looks so nice.</li>
            <li> this is so much better..</li>
            <li> I WOULD LOVE TO PROMOTE THEM FOR YOU AND YOUR COMPANY</li>
            <li> I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love it and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the color of it and the case rhey came in.</li>
            <li> The purse and color is adorable to look at and share with others.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> There are too many eyeshadow brushes and none of them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> ARE MORE LIKE MINI FOUNDATIONS BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> The quality is OK but the range of brushes allows for lots of experimentation.</li>
            <li> is better quality</li>
            <li> but I love the foundation brush and eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> in all i guess they are ok for their price</li>
            <li> Love it ...</li>

            <li> I got many years ago from Target</li>
            <li> are of much better quality than this set.</li>
            <li> I love it because it sheds no hair</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ll I LOVE MY BRUSHES</li>
            <li> Better then the 32 piece m.a.s.h set I have.</li>
            <li> The set includes all you need if you aren&#x27;t a makeup artist :).</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m satisfied with their usability and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to wear make-up all the time and look cute</li>
            <li> But as a customer im still satisfied and recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s a beginner</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are better than others.</li>
            <li> but so far everything is good!</li>
            <li> This brushes set I really love, are beautiful, the brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> they pouch is very cute and easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Ok, so these brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> The case is super cute too!</li>
            <li> Pretty good set for the price</li>
            <li> Picks up makeup pretty good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Being a person who use to use whatever brush came with the makeup palette, to a person who now buys pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush in this set is worth MORE than the set itself which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to roll this case up and take it on the go with you.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived quickly which was nice but the quality is \\&quot;ehh\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Love the case, easy for travel.</li>
            <li> They are a good quality set for the price you pay, and i absolutely love the work it does; the look as well is very girly and has character it will bring some excitement to your collection if your like me</li>
            <li> there is no any good eyeshadow brushes, there is no any crease definer or smudger brush, i dont like eye liner brush,  there is only good blush brushes</li>
            <li> The pink case is okay at best.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a set of good quality, descent, good price brushes and I finally FINALLY!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very easy to clean and the variety of brushes helps me accomplish the look i want.</li>
            <li> they clean very easy...</li>
            <li> They get the job done and they are smooth thus they get a 3 stars, if they had more quality (i.e. brush didn&#x27;t snap off or the brush protectors were intact) would have gotten a 4.</li>
            <li> i am really glad its so cheap...</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, soft, no smell to them when opened.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT ON YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> Jon Snow, I know nothing, when it comes to this stuff so as long as the recipient liked it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Bought the Pink Set for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it!!</li>
            <li> fantastic brushes love the texture,,, havent used all of them</li>
            <li> So many brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> She loved the brushes so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Overall, good deal for the price, nice variety of brushes, and a cute case.</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes make me want to get ready :) love love love them.</li>
            <li> I love the portable case, it keeps me organized and the brushes I want handy- no digging through a bag looking for a certain brush, plus it protects them from damages.</li>
            <li> All the brushes from top to bottom had a plastic wrap on them to protect them which I like, keeps them in there original shape.  </li>
            <li> im so excited to use these brushes in all the looks i&#x27;m going to create &#x3D;)))</li>
            <li> and they were as good as new!</li>
            <li> My set came packaged very carefully, and perfectly in tact inside.</li>
            <li> It is AMAZING the brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> the bristles run smoothy together, and can easily pick up eye shadow and evenly apply it.</li>
            <li> easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I gave another brush a try and broke easily too....</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came apart from the wood, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> its cute and fun and many brushes to use from</li>
            <li> They are cute though, and the case they come in is adorable, I just don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Keeps everything together, although when I opened the package, it smelled strongly like paint.</li>
            <li> I read that some people said it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> I am sure there are better brush sets out there, but the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The foundation brush works perfectly, the shadow brushes are great as well, but the blush and bronzer brushes are a little too soft.</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute and will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I think the problem is that the bristles are too fine</li>
            <li> The brushes was fine.</li>
            <li> They are fine.</li>
            <li> , Pouch is super cute.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super soft and the case is very cute!</li>
            <li> I just order 2 more sets as gifts because I am that positive that the people who will get them are going to love them.  </li>
            <li> Amazing I love the brushes they are soft and easy to clean😍😍😍</li>
            <li> Shipping was all fine, however the brushes seem to be REALLY cheaply made.</li>
            <li> would say that they are user friendly and easy to use when applying your make up.</li>
            <li> When i received them i was so excited to try them, they are very soft, no shedding and a lot of good brushes.</li>
            <li> It catches makeup very well and when applying to my face its nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> so I am huge on makeup, fashion, ect</li>
            <li> I cant stand cheap brushes that irritate my face.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because in reality I had a cheap deal with these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> If you like cheap brushes and don&#x27;t care, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and protects my brushes.</li>
            <li> its not at all cheap</li>
            <li> 80% of the brushes are great for people with mid level experience.</li>
            <li> So, in summary i do enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li> It was free and the brushes arrived within two days.</li>
            <li> The case is too flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Quality of the synthetic brushes are descent and you get a variation of brush sizes which is important when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the brushes and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Brushes felt cheap...</li>
            <li> It can fit in your purse, tote bag, make-up bag...</li>
            <li> So I was happy that I could use this the next day.</li>
            <li> but they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> use this kit everyday, its awesome!</li>
            <li> the smaller brushes are great.)  </li>
            <li> For the brushes, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I feel like i still got a great deal and plan to use these well into the future.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hark working with these, I really dont like to brisles.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> great for extra brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend avoiding them unless you can get them with free returns.</li>
            <li> comes exactly as shown, and the brushes are actually pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> and i know for sure sometime in the future i will be purchasing these for my family and girls ^_^ don&#x27;t miss out on a fair purchase....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t really wear makeup or is just starting out, this set is perfect!</li>
            <li> I honestly use them every now and then, but I&#x27;m stuck on using my old set of brushes until I find another set more to my liking.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are good quality, really soft and picks up a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Just go them and so far so good.</li>
            <li> They might be a good gift for a 12 year old that is just getting into make-up?</li>
            <li> They are soft, wish is good</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the variety is good, so I like this kit for travel.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good and are very easy to clean; just use cold water and shampoo. :P</li>
            <li> the brushes are good quality and its super compact and fits into almost any normal sized hand bag.</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are and still am surprised on how good quality they are for the price!</li>
            <li> but VERY rare.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple sets from Amazon, and these were very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great for a first make up brush set for a teen.  </li>
            <li> ok they are cheap and pretty so whynot by them ??</li>
            <li> I assume the case is really cheap, but the brushes are just right!</li>
            <li> Normally a lot of brushes I get are \\&quot;pointy\\&quot; to the touch &amp; on the face which I dislike but these are all nice to the face.   </li>
            <li> soooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them I should have just paid for mac full price brushes instead of trying to go cheap &amp; getting these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if she likes it</li>
            <li> I got these brushes in the mail today, and i was really excited about it.</li>
            <li> but any girls would appreciate it than a Walmart makeup brush;):)  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I would like to say first that i love the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> First of all, the case was ok.</li>
            <li> I really was surprised how great these brushes are.</li>
            <li> because you have to sanitize your brushes and keep them clean via washing them, the metal parts will pop off from the handle eventually</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brushes are the best for thin lines and it has every size brush needed for applying blush and highlights my cheeks and the top with translucent powder.</li>
            <li> i loved how many brushes it holds and the pink casing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this got so many positive views, I can&#x27;t understand it.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive review about this product I had to try them my self.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, the pink case does well in protecting the brushes and makes sure that the brushes stay in condition though it does look rather cheap looking.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and the carrying case is positively adorable!</li>
            <li> I would not call them professional but they will do the job for sure!</li>
            <li> these brushes are soft cute and sturdy!</li>
            <li> I also love that they&#x27;re soft and super cute.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY NEW BRUSH SET!!</li>
            <li> Quality seemed good in the materials and I loved the vivid pink color.</li>
            <li> As for the brushes though i couldn&#x27;t be happier :) Very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive today my Bundle Monster brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed, they are super soft, and they are soo cute!</li>
            <li> follow care instructions and you will stay happy for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the amazing quality.</li>
            <li> brushes is nice and soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to really gain an interest in beauty and makeup and these brushes are just ok.</li>
            <li> Absolute the best brush and worth every penny that I spent on them.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in good condition &amp; brushed were packed well.</li>
            <li> a true eyeshadow brush  Pros:  </li>
            <li> These brushes are not as full as they look.  </li>
            <li> So nice, soft and beautifull brushes.</li>
            <li> BUT I don&#x27;t really recommend them for someone who is use to heavier brushes or brushes with more bristles.</li>
            <li> Oh and the lipstick brush is kinda cool</li>
            <li> Brushes for real beginners :-)</li>
            <li> brushes are soft and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t not a bad purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price as well.</li>
            <li> when they came in they did smell but it was not bad</li>
            <li> these brushes fell very soft and stable but had a very strong nail polish sent....</li>
            <li> They are super soft, they come in an amazing case.</li>
            <li> i mean for 19$ these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> handles pretty easily.</li>
            <li> This is very good because they are all in a neat little bag and they are all there!</li>
            <li> other than dat their Great.</li>
            <li> But as said before in other reviews, you get what you pay for lol.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and easy to clean, all of the brushes came with a plastic cover, that keeps them neat and the carrying pouch is easy to pack for going to photo shoots or just putting away in my make-up box.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love the blush brushes, but I do find that most of the selections are repeats of the same type of brush-</li>
            <li> These brushes did not provide adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> I had to super glue to</li>
            <li> overall i am very impressed this is the second set i have bought from bundle monster !</li>
            <li> They hurt my eyelids and if you swipe them too quick the brush poofs the powder all over your face.</li>
            <li> them pretty quick!</li>
            <li> SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT,BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AS SHE REALLY NEEDED THE BRUSHES &amp; WAS DELIGHTED.</li>
            <li> and I also saw it on amazon for $24 i highly recommend that set better.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft, I haven&#x27;t noticed any fibers/hairs falling out during use, the case is convenient for travel and pretty cute, too!  </li>
            <li> The foundation brush head came off the handle the very first time i used it.</li>
            <li> , I like it very much!</li>
            <li> but i was very pleased to open it</li>
            <li> Best brushes so far, and the pink alligator skin case that came with it!</li>
            <li> Obviously not the most amazing brushes but do well for how much you pay for them.</li>
            <li> They are very soft but still pretty durable, they aren&#x27;t &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, but they are GREAT for beginners.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the ecoTools sets, they are full and soft and wash well and do not shed.</li>
            <li> The case it comes with looks exactly as the picture shows and all the brushes arrived nicely in the clear plastics as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I love the color &amp; they are very soft.  </li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE SO SOFT! :)</li>
            <li> and they were exactly as shown!</li>
            <li> i just got these brushes today and i love them so far!</li>
            <li> the brushes weren&#x27;t very put together because they fell apart!!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and I love the case.</li>
            <li> I love the color and magnetic snaps make it so easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> Good package, but not high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes apply my makeup perfectly and they are very soft yet firm to the skin.</li>
            <li> it was pretty clean when I washed them.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and is a great variety for someone who is just starting to use brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good quality and the pink color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> The case smelled a little like plastic but is great for keeping brushes together while traveling.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its pink, its my favorite color.</li>
            <li> The case is SOOOO soft and SOOOOO cute</li>
            <li> The brush itself is way too soft to be able to pick up pigments from any make-up.</li>
            <li> Worth a bit over a doller.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the money don&#x27;t hesitate but these.</li>
            <li> Trust me its worth the money....</li>
            <li> worth it....</li>
            <li> it still has a distinct odor of gas to it.</li>
            <li> I bought an E.L.F. makeup case it comes with 11 professional brushes and i love that set</li>
            <li> I have the worlds most sensitive nose</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I have completely fallen in love with them and</li>
            <li> All of the brushes fit nicely in the pouch, which is great for travel, but I think I will end up keeping the brushes in something else for everyday use--maybe I am just in too much of a rush in the mornings to open the case every time I need into it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I just recently built my own Hollywood style Vanity.</li>
            <li> I love how the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> They were entirely soft which can be good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> But at $18 it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So far they seem to be working OK.</li>
            <li> so i only liked 4 out of the 15....</li>
            <li> it’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice set of makeup brushes, and before you assume that I ordered what I thought was going to be a great set of brushes at such a cheap price naively, let me say...</li>
            <li> They are long enough to easily hold and do a great job at applying the makeup.</li>
            <li> and i am soooooo happy and well pleased with my final choice, first of all the quantity is amazing and very helpful, also some complained about the bristles breaking or it shedding, but i don&#x27;t have that problem at all..</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I read on this product the brushes are just ok.</li>
            <li> I would say that these brushes are definitely great for beginners and for practicing, but now that I am moving on from what I believe to be the \\&quot;beginner state\\&quot;, I&#x27;m ready to try something more serious.</li>
            <li> (: other than that they are in good shape.</li>
            <li> and I order them right away.  </li>
            <li> cause boy it smacks ya right in the face.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li> I must say, the reviews on these brushes are right.</li>
            <li> I wash them with mild soap every time I need and they just dry and are as good as new!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the how soft these brushes are and the fact that they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and I am able to get a professional looking finish easily.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the box it was wrapped in plastic to protect it, very easy to open which I also like.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This will be my first review based on my first impressions!</li>
            <li> wash the brushes with my favorite shampoo than I blow dry light</li>
            <li> They are very soft but you will not be able to do much with them.</li>
            <li> they barely hold eyeshadow and you have to reapply over and over just to be able to see it.</li>
            <li> so shipping was super fast.    </li>
            <li> Very cute hot pink carrying case.</li>
            <li> is perfect dont waste your money buying a lot of brushes that will at the end be the same !&lt;</li>
            <li> so the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and too soft for any type of use, except for that one brush!</li>
            <li> This is a very economic yet chic option.</li>
            <li> (Even without using the brushes) I&#x27;m sure they work just fine as long as you&#x27;re not some super professional</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these brushes, and purchased simply off others positive reviews, but was also looking for a set that was easy to take with  me when we travel.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are quite soft and fine looking, as advertised.</li>
            <li> It would be a perfect gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art that wants to try out all the different brushes before spending big bucks on Professional brushes.</li>
            <li> I have recommended these brushes to all my girlfriends, they are soft and super!</li>
            <li> But it is a good little brush kit.</li>
            <li> -cute, easy to hold brushes  -Super fluffy powder brushes, so you don&#x27;t look cakey!  </li>
            <li> they lasted me a good while now im going to order another set in pink!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes don&#x27;t spread the makeup out as evenly as I would like, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> because I mostly purchased this for the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> also the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> I, RECIEVED MY BRUSH SET TODAY ALONG SIDE WITH THE REST OF MY FIRST ORDER</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> first time i went to use it, it BROKE OFF its stick</li>
            <li> The delivery was FAST!</li>
            <li> and they seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> First, the shipping was supper fast!</li>
            <li> Came the exact date it told me it would.</li>
            <li> and they are all still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> will probablu buy these kit again since Ive lost pretty much all of them!</li>
            <li> It was like they were hot glued onto the handle.</li>
            <li> However, most of the brushes came unglued from the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> A lot of variety for a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> First time i use one of the brushes and broke...</li>
            <li> The brush heads are made of a cheap but soft synthetic fiber, and distribute powder evenly.</li>
            <li> Its my first set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall ok brushes for beginners.</li>
            <li> but overall they OK.</li>
            <li> This delivery was so fast (I got it today)!</li>
            <li> Soon enough the top part came off altogether.</li>
            <li> Overall i love the brushes just not the smell</li>
            <li> It works the same, but I have more of a choice with this set, with a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> On the brushes when they first arrive there is almost like a powdery substance</li>
            <li> The bag is pretty too although it&#x27;s kinda falling apart</li>
            <li> there are many brushes so it is not really a big deal</li>
            <li> I got this brush set about 4 years ago, when I first started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are exactly how I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheap and  a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> it sorta smells funny, but after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> comments about too many lip brushes as this set only has one lip brush...</li>
            <li> pink case is nice as well.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re very well made!</li>
            <li> But to be fair for the price i got a lot of use of them, still use a few of them after almost a year.</li>
            <li> My colors are black and hot pink, it matched perfectly!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cheap and there isn&#x27;t a variety of different brushes.  </li>
            <li> First I have to say that these brushes really don&#x27;t lose hair very much.  </li>
            <li> I must say I was a little worried because I had seen a lot of negative reviews but for now these brushes are great, I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Maybe good for a tween or teen just starting to learn how too apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes and NO shedding problems!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it serves its purpose very well :)</li>
            <li> But they are super soft and they look pretty.</li>
            <li> I saw all of the positive feedback for these brushes and they were so afforadable, so I decided to ask for them for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> thanks for fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> but as long as you have a spare blending brush these would be OK- if you wanted them for the price or something.</li>
            <li> the foundation brush is very sturdy but very streaky!</li>
            <li> Dont let everyone tell you how amazing these brushes are, they&#x27;re not a super deal and the quality of the brushes matches its price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and no irritation since I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> The metal handle attaching the brush to the wooden handle is not made well either, I can easily bend it.     </li>
            <li> I did try with them dry and they did ok.</li>
            <li> Super soft and all the brushes you need for any look.  </li>
            <li> the hair is super soft..</li>
            <li> large powder brush&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love pretty much anything pink</li>
            <li> These brushes are okk the face brushes are pretty great but the angled brush wasn&#x27;t stiff enough for me.</li>
            <li> They took a little longer getting here than I would have liked</li>
            <li> Monster\\&quot; brushes I think I will just take my chances with something a little more worth my while.</li>
            <li> better to  invest a little bit more in a product that will last longer like MAC brushes or BObbi Brown brushes.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used it a few times, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping which I like.   </li>
            <li> It was packaged very well</li>
            <li> The handle is not good quality, I was able to separate the brush from the wooden handle with a nice tug after I first opened and examined the brushes,  I might have to re-glue all 15.</li>
            <li> The outer material seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought this brushes,and the shipping was REALLY</li>
            <li> but that really shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> My coworker absolutely loves this brush set.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and girly-girl.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a clutch-type purse and can easily fit into my regular purse for when i do my makeup on the go.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY STYLISHHHH ...</li>
            <li> They dont hold color very well.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I thought the product was very well packed</li>
            <li> They came fast and they haven&#x27;t shed or anything.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t pay much attention to the complaints about the plastic smell because I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the brush set.</li>
            <li> its really cute&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and includes several different types.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that their pink, because I love pink.. &amp; for the price ?</li>
            <li> The draw back is the metal piece the fibers fit into,</li>
            <li> I love the wide range of sizes and shapes.  </li>
            <li> Hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very displeasing.</li>
            <li> THANK YALL SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH</li>
            <li> However the cons really outweigh the pros.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use any of the eye makeup brushes expect for the angle brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming cheap glue or not enough glue</li>
            <li> real make up</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Dont really provide the service I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This was actually my first time ordering, so I was worried how long it would take but everything went smoothly and fast.</li>
            <li> They are worth the price (which was reduced)and well packaged, fast shipping, soft to the touch, catches makeup well.  </li>
            <li> I might suggest them for a 16 year old starting out who doesn&#x27;t know any better</li>
            <li> , I would also liked to have a round brush ( thats just me)</li>
            <li> I dont even use the brushes to be honest, I gave a few of them away to my sister in law because the eyeshadow burshes seem like repeats</li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes are amazingly soft &amp; love them!</li>
            <li> they are really nice for everyday use ..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when they finally came through the mail.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received the package but within a couple times of using a middle size brush, it came apart from the handle.</li>
            <li> i took a risk on buying this because some other reviews were sketchy, but like i said i&#x27;m glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li> This cheap bundle of brushes was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> , it is on the cheap side not good quality  but its cute.</li>
            <li> and after I had my son, I went through kind of a lazy stage... not getting ready for the day, not caring.</li>
            <li> I had boughten these brushes because I had needed new ones and thought the pink handles and bag were cute.</li>
            <li> Most of the eye brushes are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> I looked at other sets of different varieties, but I am very glad</li>
            <li> They are pretty sturdy and the brush hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad set, just don&#x27;t expect the same quality as a MAC brush.</li>
            <li> They seem very high quality and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brushes work a lot better than the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft so don&#x27;t really grab all that much color.</li>
            <li> i have purchased one for myself and my older daughter.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent quality.</li>
            <li> I am an entertainer though, and need to be fresh and ready to go for auditions and red carpet events.</li>
            <li> They apply make-up decently for a plastic brush.</li>
            <li> I chalked this up to a fluke, super glued the metal part back onto the wood handle, and continued to use the brushes.</li>
            <li> Over all a &#x27;decent set for the price&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and hold the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the level of quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes at first and actually still have a few in my make up brush drawer</li>
            <li> So soft, not a hair out of place, and are really tightly packed, so it makes spreading the pigment around very easy.</li>
            <li> I expacted a product with high quality</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid for, I was NOT expecting really high quality brushes like mac or sephora one.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMAND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and look forward to upgrading with another of their products.</li>
            <li> I think investing in high quality brushes is the way too go no matter what.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> AND THE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li> a little more $and get</li>
            <li> The smell was a little overwhelming when I received the brushes but just after a couple hours of having them out and cleaned these no plastic smell.</li>
            <li> i did not know how much i was lacking only after this package arrived as an anniversary gift, its very soft and has multiple angles, great for the heavy makeup user like me.</li>
            <li> and their kind of hard idk maybe cuz there</li>
            <li> This set is very chic but also has professional quality.</li>
            <li> they are soft and gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> She loves how soft they are and how much easier it is to apply her makeup.</li>
            <li> the only 3 brushes that really work for me are the first 3 to apply blush..</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and love them.</li>
            <li> All of the shadow brushes were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> For the most part they don&#x27;t shed, I&#x27;ve already washed them a few times.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I love the two blush brushes, the angle brush, the foundation brush and the eyebrows and eyelash brush but the rest of the brushes are just redundant.</li>
            <li> they are just what I expected, clearly if you&#x27;re looking for simple and nice brushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I like the varied shadow brushes because I find the different sizes useful for variation in blending</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes do not pick up the eye makeup that easily, you have to push the brush down kind of hard to get it on the bristles.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft and looked/felt high quality.  </li>
            <li> They didnt last at all, and they break off the wooden sticks quite easily after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves, although I have not used them yet, are super soft and don&#x27;t shed one hair and none of the metal things come unglued from the wooden handle</li>
            <li> the brushes themselves were very soft but so soft they didn&#x27;t pick up any product very well.</li>
            <li> I must say all the brushes are really soft on the face, Which is a Plus because my skin is very sensitive, and they look and feel really sturdy.  </li>
            <li> and I like to keep certain brushes with certain colors (no mixing and no washing to use with a different shade needed for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it right back on and it hasn&#x27;t come off since..</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes and they actually were pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft, and the case is a little cute, but the quality of the brushes are questioned.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to any teenager or new comer who is learning how to do makeup b&#x27;coz</li>
            <li> MUST WASH ALL YOUR NEW</li>
            <li> UNTIL I GET ANOTHER BRAND NEW BRUSH SET .</li>
            <li> Nothing I can&#x27;t live with though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li> However, I am new to correctly applying my make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting new ones now</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li> The brushes in the product were fine but the pink case looked a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY soft to the touch &amp; VERY soft to the face which I ADORE.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> Bristles haven&#x27;t fallen off and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> these brushes is very soft..</li>
            <li> They are very soft and at this time non have shed.</li>
            <li> Material is very soft and affortable price.</li>
            <li> Very soft, wish it included a blending brush</li>
            <li> They are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Several of the smallest brushes are foreign to me, so I would have loved a little list of what each brush is for, as I normally would use maybe 7-8 as opposed to this large collection.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li> The pockets held them very well and no slipping out.</li>
            <li> -These brushes are too soft!</li>
            <li> but I have four brushes that ate exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Next, handle in th me brushes are pretty well put in.</li>
            <li> I most likely won&#x27;t use some of them but the big brushes definitely.</li>
            <li> only thing I wish on the brush it would be labeled what type of brush it is like many other brush sets...</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but have a distinctly synthetic feel, but again, for the price I expected as much.</li>
            <li> ** ^ THAT WAS MY FIRST REVIEW - THEY JUST RECENTLY BROKE AFTER</li>
            <li> The brushes are supper soft and you can tell that those hairs aren&#x27;t going anywhere!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the case has a smell,  but it is pretty.</li>
            <li> At first the packaging did smell however I opened the package and left it out overnight.</li>
            <li> I love the blush brushes and a few of the eye ones!</li>
            <li> But other than that I love them and would definitely recommend getting them!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice set, but it is not a professional set for long term use.</li>
            <li> I only use them for back-up brushes if I have two girls in a row and not enough time to clean the brushes in between.</li>
            <li> Background on me: this is my first cosmetic brush set, and I had just recently got my makeup professionally done</li>
            <li> when i first received my brushes there was was a smell to them especially the case that it comes in, so i aired mine out for a couple days and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> they are very soft but not to soft...</li>
            <li> Bristles were very soft, some were a bit too soft for what I would think would be the stiffer brushes.  </li>
            <li> some one younger or even a bit older can use these brushes just as well; meaning for someone who doesn&#x27;t experiment with heavy colors and enjoys more of a natural look.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, there is a lot of variety (although there could be less lip brushes and more eye brushes), and they last for the the price.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and would recommend to people who need makeup brushes and are on a tight budget like myself.</li>
            <li> i only use that brush once i would have gave 5 stars but my main brush i use is broke how something new fall apart</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as variable as I would like since there is no fluffy eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li> was shedding around the edges and looked like if you threw it in your bag, it would completely unravel.  </li>
            <li> However, the smaller brushes work well as they have much shorter bristles and so are sturdier.</li>
            <li> they are some soft brushes but they are falling apart</li>
            <li> but i fixed it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product, and when finally received it I found out that the bag was a little broken to be honest I did not care,</li>
            <li> I easily fixed it with some glue</li>
            <li> BRUSHES\\&quot; So after I washed them I was surprised that no hairs came out and</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> i tugged a few times..and they are secure and well in place...</li>
            <li> a 21yr old and  by the fineness of the brushes and how it picks up the eye shadow,</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was starting to get really into makeup, and I know that learning brush technique is one of the hardest parts that I&#x27;ve struggled with.</li>
            <li> I actually  feel like you really get a value seeing as one brush can cost anywhere between 20 dollars and up.</li>
            <li> They are soft and I did not see any shedding when I washed them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> These are a cheap set that should not be used as an everyday set.  </li>
            <li> Extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I bought these for Grandma to give to my eleven year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> i bought these for my 11 year old daughter to play/practice makeup</li>
            <li> BRUSHES ARE SOFT ON YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> calling them pro is far from the truth</li>
            <li> Of course in time brushes get old</li>
            <li> professional use 1 star.</li>
            <li> I really prefer a bigger brush for blending.</li>
            <li> And the are soooo soft</li>
            <li> If I could give these too soft, flimsy brushes a negative rating I would, however the only good thing about this brush set is the eyebrow spooler that I use daily.</li>
            <li> brush r soft...</li>
            <li> the brush hairs are not as soft as i thought they were.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft and work well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles in the brush are soft and never fall off.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and seem somewhat durable.</li>
            <li> They are soft andwhen</li>
            <li> Are they too soft?  </li>
            <li> (Update: the face brushes are too soft.)</li>
            <li> The snap seems as though it could be stronger, but so far no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was rather surprised when I received this item.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and work well.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an extra just to play with but shadows don&#x27;t really get on the brushes</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about buying these, because your brushes makes a big difference on how your makeup turns out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the hair is soft and that depends on what you prefer ..</li>
            <li> When I first opened up my brushes they did have &#x27;that odor&#x27;, but properly cleaning them (as you should do before using new brushes) fixed it instantly.</li>
            <li> Many of the brushes are larger or smaller versions of each other.</li>
            <li> When I recieved them they did have a small scent (nothing strong)</li>
            <li> I admit that I use my brushes daily, but I keep them in a special separate area in my make-up case where they are far from abused.&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, if you&#x27;re looking for quantity these are your brushes, if you&#x27;re looking for any type of quality that will last standard use, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I guess this will just be in a make-up kit to go with my other colorful things</li>
            <li> when you first open it is definitely over-whelming</li>
            <li> I give them only 4 stars because when I was cleaning them for the first time, one of the foundation brushes fell off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> i love these brsuhes but sadly 2 of them broke but a little bit of hot glue or super glue fixed them.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit hesitant at first to buy them, just because of the bad reviews they got and worrying if the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone starting out in makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well and would highly recommend to other users.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time and hard earned money with these brushes, I bought this set and one from Coastal Scents and love the latter.</li>
            <li> Pretty in pink~</li>
            <li> The case is a pretty pink and holds all the brushes for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li> They are firm &amp; do not give full coverage.</li>
            <li> There was a strong smell as soon as I opened it, but after literally 2 minutes it was hardly there anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more flimsy than any other brush case I&#x27;ve previously owned.</li>
            <li> but I left it open on my vanity for a week and don&#x27;t notice it much</li>
            <li> I think this product is definitely worth the $20 or less you will pay for it.  </li>
            <li> I honestly was expecting them to be worse than they actually are.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very soft and would probably function well, but since one of the ones I wanted had the brush head fall off, back they went.</li>
            <li> But other than that it is pretty.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the larger brushes are relatively soft.</li>
            <li> I expected a real Mac product.</li>
            <li> They have no fluff to them whatsoever.</li>
            <li> As far as overall function-</li>
            <li> I found the larger brushes too soft to use.</li>
            <li> OLD GRANDDAUGHTERS WISH LIST &amp; HAD BEEN ON THE LIST SINCE LAST YEAR.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it now.</li>
            <li> A lot of these brushes have almost the exact same shape not really creating a variety.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice buy considering brushes are expensive..</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster didn&#x27;t disappointed, these are some pretty good brushes especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I love that when I ordered them they were pink as opposed to other brush sets which displayed pink brushes but said color may vary.</li>
            <li> they are offering 15 brushed total for less price then the other brands who charge more for one brush.  </li>
            <li> I mean, even the eyeliner brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to apply liner  </li>
            <li> Once I recieved them, I did notice the odor that some other people were talking about, but that went away after I gently washed my brushes and let them air out for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on these were much softer than other sets.</li>
            <li> I was super exicted due to the fact that they are pink.</li>
            <li> Otherwise... they are thin, and practically the same brush in several sizes, pretty cheap quality, and they do have a bit of a strange smell.</li>
            <li> All of them are decent and not too rough on skin.</li>
            <li> After washing the bristles a few came out but overall for the price definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The case it comes in does smell a little funny</li>
            <li> nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This is my second set buying, because it works with my bare mineral powder make and the quality for price</li>
            <li> I have to hot glue one of the pink handles back on, but that was minor.</li>
            <li> The quality of all these brushes is worth like a few hundred in upper class quality stores, and you only pay like $24!!!!!</li>
            <li> However, with a few replacements and some hot glue, these brushes worked well as a starter kit for me.</li>
            <li> all the smaller brushes are really not good the big fluffy ones like for powder blush and the foundation ones are t he only good ones</li>
            <li> The only thing worng with them is they are all very flat, and soft.</li>
            <li> some of the tops where the black part is would fall off but a little glue fixed that really quick</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed people were saying was that this kit had a heavy plastic smell when you first open it.</li>
            <li> My first impression was like I got few same brushes in different sizes</li>
            <li> but I will super glue that sucker back in tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about them, and I read most other people&#x27;s reviews as well that said the same thing, the case has a very distinct vinyl smell to it</li>
            <li> I really only purchased this product due to the price and pretty pink color</li>
            <li> so u have to be really careful and dont set the blow dry on high</li>
            <li> I hate to say but the main reason I purchased this was becuase of the case because i already own make up brushes</li>
            <li> This kit is not worth the money and investment, spend it on a cheaper brush all natural haired brush set, or save up for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed like other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> They are non labeled, low quality, and very flat brushes.  </li>
            <li> Many of the brushes only have slight differences in length or angle, but they are soo thin.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes January 2nd pretty late at night and received them this morning, January 4th</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it had a VERY soft interior, black.</li>
            <li> I am not a pink fanatic, but when i saw the positive reviews on this product, i instantly forgot they where pink</li>
            <li> These brushes have last a long time and they stand up to wear and washing.  </li>
            <li> Also my brushes didn&#x27;t even come with the flat brush as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it smells so strange when you open the package..</li>
            <li> I was in shock how could something so new BREAK OFF its stick n da little wallet thing</li>
            <li> All of these brushes arrive very flat, and have stayed flat.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use theses brushes anymore, it&#x27;s just a hassle if you&#x27;re trying to do more complex eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes: small and thin, not full to the point where you could get good use with your makeup.</li>
            <li> Definitely not anywhere near professional-style brushes, and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll be okay for a few uses, but are not great.</li>
            <li> but i compare it with what i used before it is less expensive and better or equal in quality</li>
            <li> Brushes are still in great shape, they are not well attached to the base so be careful!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more hair than any other brush I&#x27;ve owned, even really expensive ones, fall out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to keep all your essential brushes but small enough to put in your purse and compact enough for traveling.</li>
            <li> Not too cheap and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I still have to use them for a while to tell the long run effect</li>
            <li> I just am as girly as they come and was instantly drawn to the pink.   </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the ones that need to be firm are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than what I have expected.</li>
            <li> I am currently a MUA in training and saw these brushes and couldn&#x27;t resist buying them because of the pink color and price.</li>
            <li> , Im going to have to get some &#x27;Monkey Glue&#x27; &amp; fix my Daughter&#x27;s brushes</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist.</li>
            <li> My shipment came in 3 days, earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> i mean i cant blame them cause a whole set is 18$ but</li>
            <li> The brushes were soft and stiff when they needed to be.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not easy for a 70+ year old.</li>
            <li> The black velvet is difficult to clean off, but hasn&#x27;t become a major issue.</li>
            <li> They have lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> They was a very strange smell in these brushes and holder.</li>
            <li> I just washed them so I can&#x27;t wait til they dry</li>
            <li> After washing them I reshaped them and let them dry.</li>
            <li> was just hoping for morevariety in them, the smaller brushes are basically all the same and the powder brushes could be bigger/ fluffy.</li>
            <li> I am not new to make-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The case itself is fine, nothing special but nothing horrible either.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ebb use them properly because they&#x27;re so stiff and flat.</li>
            <li> Only one brush had an odd shape to the bristles.</li>
            <li> ---as for the smell all others are complaining about---YES, there is an odd chemical smell when you open the package.</li>
            <li> The dowside is that the eyeshadow brushes are pretty stiff and it&#x27;s hard to apply the shadow evenly.</li>
            <li> It did have a different smell when I opened the case, but nothing strong or pungent, it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell by any means.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes metal black parts came apart from the pink wooden handle</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and nothings gone wrong so far.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit of a makeup connoisseur, but definitely no makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Though the the color of the case is a little bit different than that in the picture.</li>
            <li> I had to leave them open and lay them out for a week to get the smell to go away a little.</li>
            <li> so u only have to use a little on the brushes to put your make-up on...</li>
            <li> Hope they last long :/</li>
            <li> and when i saw a pink case i said i gotta have it.</li>
            <li> Over time I&#x27;ve bought a few eye brushes from Urban Decay that have made this set obsolete.  </li>
            <li> Actually not really any problems with them</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was not properly attach to the handle and fell off in a few days.</li>
            <li> the powder brush is not a big fluffy brush</li>
            <li> I go the pink set and like the color.</li>
            <li> If you do not plan on using them daily I would suggest buying them, but if you are going to use them everyday</li>
            <li> diff kinds and sizes and its pink lil plasticky smell but</li>
            <li> Not the variety of bristles I expected.</li>
            <li> There were a few stray hairs on the larger brushes but nothing that can&#x27;t be plucked.</li>
            <li> Before, I was packing up my brushes in a cosmetic bag and always worried about messing up the brushes, since they were loose and packed with other items.  </li>
            <li> The case does have a little bit of a weird smell when you first open it, but leaving it open to air out for a few days helps with the smell.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes for eye shadow are a bit too stiff and because of that blending can be a hassle.</li>
            <li> They are really soft BUT are THIN &amp; FLAT.</li>
            <li> The only miniscule con is that after a few months of use, some of the black brush ends came loose from the pink handles.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;m gonna actually invest in a MAC make-up brushes or even a sephora brushes, seriously, I have one or two of those brands, and this set does not compare to them.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful with them so that the hais don&#x27;t fell off, just like with any other brushes</li>
            <li> lot of the small brushes are somewhat redundant and too soft and wimpy for eye shadow use.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I looked up videos on youtube to see what other people were saying.</li>
            <li> the other ones..</li>
            <li> might keep them for other uses.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival they were bubble wrapped to the extreme.</li>
            <li> Some of these brushes weren&#x27;t usable due to the glue coming undone and them falling apart.</li>
            <li> The hair don&#x27;t even fall out like other brushes do.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moKL7SOZ4Z0J5Q]]I just had to let you see it other the pictures and comments</li>
            <li> Once I started using these, I threw away my other MAC brushes</li>
            <li> I would agree with other reviewers who say that the plastic pouch has a chemical/plastic smell to it, but I would not say that it is offensive....</li>
            <li> guessing this due to the leather case that they come</li>
            <li> The smell kinda weird though when you first get them.</li>
            <li> I was using the round bristle brush for eyelashes, and it already - after one use! - is speparated from the wooden stick (but it has not fallen off).</li>
            <li> I end up using my finger sometimes or other brushes to apply my shadow.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re softer than any other make-up brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes were more of a disappointment while the smaller ones actually aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT, every tip falls off where the metal base of the brush goes on top of the pink painted handle</li>
            <li> When I received the brushes, the powder brush had loose bristles and a few of the handles came off.</li>
            <li> A little strange but not even enough of a complaint to take it down a star.</li>
            <li> Soft, but felt fake, like if you were to wash them the black dye would come off and they would become coarse.   </li>
            <li> Bottom line, these are average.</li>
            <li> The brushes are average and they have alot of strands that stick out, i had to cut some of the hairs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it is definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect as much from it as I would from the expensive ones..</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I THINK I LOST MY MONEY, NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> All in all, it seems a go for the money for the average</li>
            <li> make up artist that wants really expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> : There is a slightly awkward smell... but its nothing big, I&#x27;m going to just assume its like a \\&quot;new</li>
            <li> I saw these brushes and the price and the price was knocked down.</li>
            <li> the little ones are all flat and stiff and dont blend for nothing!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about makeup artistry please know that these are definitely not for pro use whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality and many repeats of the same brush.</li>
            <li> it did have a slight order when i opened it but has since gone away.</li>
            <li> it comes with a black case</li>
            <li> I found it had a slight odor, but nothing that would knock me out.</li>
            <li> There is no blending/crease brush but the small eye shadow brush works but only for applying a small amount of shadow to the crease for a lighter look.</li>
            <li> and they are about 75% less then</li>
            <li> For anyone who is serious about makeup, especially eyeshadow, this is a must-have.</li>
            <li> For me it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> i purchased these brushes looking long and hard through amazon, judging by the comments, ratings, and price...</li>
            <li> only bad thing is that the eye shadow brushes are the same just in different sizes.</li>
            <li> You do get a lot of brushes, but the hairs on these brushes are not full at all.</li>
            <li> I was pretty much assaulted with this really horrible smell that immediately gave me a headache...</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this set, and really disappointed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> so figured I&#x27;d get her a little something else.</li>
            <li> The case is a little stinky, just let it sit out for a while</li>
            <li> the case is a little flimsy but workable.</li>
            <li> just put a little bit of baby powder, and the smell go away.</li>
            <li> if your little girl is learning her tools or you&#x27;re just entering the business</li>
            <li> Other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past fall apart and leave the bristle parts of the brush on my face during makeup application.</li>
            <li> The set is conveniently organized, but the bristles are a little softer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The little brush bag has every brush you will need to accomplish the look you are trying get.</li>
            <li> the case does smell a little but that can be overlooked.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing and was a little skepitcal but decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE PINK!!!...  </li>
            <li> the brushes aren&#x27;t terrible but they aren&#x27;t amazing either.</li>
            <li> After a few days one of the brushes started to fall apart</li>
            <li> AN NOTHING WAS MISSING .</li>
            <li> I just received this product 2 days ago and used it a few time and the handles on the brushes fell off and the brush bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a waste if money.</li>
            <li> One thing i didnt like though is that one or two of the brush handles had the dried glue coming out and</li>
            <li> These brushes dont work well and absorb the makeup and spreads the makeup unevenly.</li>
            <li> not purchase if you want/are used to round tipped brushes.</li>
            <li> While reading reviews I noticed that a few people were complaining about the smell.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for something firm I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The brushes come wrapped in a thin plastic and the three larger brushes also have a sturdier plastic cover on them to re use if so desired.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a few days now</li>
            <li> so I cannot be too harsh on the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> After that, I took a few brushes out of the case provided and added them to my make-up bag</li>
            <li> if you dap onto your eye shadows it will create so much waste on your eye shadow, because the hairs don&#x27;t hold the powders and it literally digs into the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few weeks ago, and have not used all of the brushes yet.</li>
            <li> I received my brush set a few days ago.</li>
            <li> they dried the nexts day.</li>
            <li> so you do have choices they are a little stiff though</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present and after using it everyday for the past 3 months, two brushes have broken, as is</li>
            <li> They did come with a weird smell almost like a factory smell but nothing major the smell went away.</li>
            <li> You can see they are very poorly made because once looking at them after they have fallen apart it is apparent that they were stuck together with a little glue or something like that.</li>
            <li> They also smelled pretty bad.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m buy sum crazy glue to see if that fix the problem now i&#x27;m looking for a new brush set ......waste of money</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was in desperate need of new ones.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the effects are to that.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about buying these with the amount of mixed reviews it had.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical about this product b&#x27;coz</li>
            <li> and I was a bit anxious.</li>
            <li> The blush/powder brushes are a bit small</li>
            <li> and I personally think they are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> And the face brushes are small.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was, but did not want the brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> small fan brush</li>
            <li> The brushes look decent in the video but the quality is really bad.</li>
            <li> Also, a lot of the brush protectors in my set were broken (the tops broken open)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very stiff</li>
            <li> The black base detaches from the pink handle constantly which is irritating, and they are all a bit small.</li>
            <li> but it was hardly noticeable to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a hard case</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little confused by another reviewers</li>
            <li> The case: looked so cheap and awful...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few bristles fall out, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Ill start by saying i got them buy expected delivery.</li>
            <li> At least not mine.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the handles come off.</li>
            <li> at least mine did.</li>
            <li> and I mean within a few weeks!!</li>
            <li> Once receiving them there was a very weird product smell especially on the bag and as a result I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I wish the eyeshadow brushes we&#x27;re thicker because it&#x27;s next to impossible to blend with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give low ratings, but I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I got these brushes about a year ago when I was just beginning to get into serious make up.</li>
            <li> Ughhh way too stiff!!</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that it smells like paint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are not good quality.</li>
            <li> This was not a good purchase and I would not recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li> was a tad RIPPED but other den dat after i CRAZY CLUED a COUPLE of them</li>
            <li> one downfall was that one of the brushes had glue in the hairs and was hard to get off!</li>
            <li> i was so excited for these brushes but was sadly and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Brushes are all the same..... thin, ugly.</li>
            <li> Truth is, when I began to use the brushes I notice how weak they were.</li>
            <li> the brush would come off of the wooden base.</li>
            <li> and I get confused on what they are used for.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with that.</li>
            <li> Its a simple fix but still annoying.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this product...</li>
            <li> The brushes are \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but not great, but hey you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It does shed a little bit but not so bad.</li>
            <li> I HATED these brushes and I immediately sent it back as soon as I got them.</li>
            <li> they are soft but the brushes break and are just horrible with make up...</li>
            <li> From the entire set i have 5 that are now broken horrible.</li>
            <li> bought these base on other reviews however i am not impressed with them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and then when u buy each one it will be expensive....</li>
            <li> So I bought this brush set after i searched Sigma Brushes, but i learned that Sigma was to expensive</li>
            <li> BUT I WAS WRONG BESIDES ALL</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the handle sizing.</li>
            <li> but I failed to look up the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars because of the terrible smell (like burning plastic) that clung to the brushes and carrying case until 3 washings in baby shampoo finally made it bearable.  </li>
            <li> There was NO smell or anything weird.</li>
            <li> but these aren&#x27;t much worse, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> is that they have a terrible smell to them when you open the package&lt;</li>
            <li> These brushes are VERY thin</li>
            <li> This product is awful and not worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and was told the brushes literally fell apart with-in a few weeks very disappointed</li>
            <li> I just trimmed it myself with some hair cutting scissors.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The packaging really stinks when they arrive</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and cannot go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> the brushes can be very expensive.     </li>
            <li> Another con is that the handles keep breaking off making them impossible to use.</li>
            <li> the one bad thing is it doesnt have a blending brush</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this item.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes on the 22nd of Feb. and got it today, the shipping to me wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it for three times, and I just got so frustrated by it.</li>
            <li> and i recommend it to any one who is just tired of spending money for theses brushes at outrageous Prices!!</li>
            <li> but it dosent have a blendig brush :(</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been nothing but disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was still disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> but....... i hate the fact that there is no crease brush.</li>
            <li> ANNOYING.</li>
            <li> Base, Blush, eye shadow, and even color to the lip.</li>
            <li> The color of the brushes is very ugly and the brush variety is crap.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> These are the worst brushes i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I was especially disappointed with the angled brush used for bronzers and blushes.  </li>

            <li> Smelled like poison sooo gross returned them</li>
            <li> brushes is nice and soft</li>
            <li> I cant stand cheap brushes that irritate my face.  The brushes are super soft and no irritation since I&#x27;ve used them. Pretty good set for the price</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these!! for someone who is in the beauty industry starting out, finding these brushes that werent cheaply made and at a good price was awesome!</li>
            <li> I did not know anything about brushes, but wanted to try them out.  These brushes have last a long time and they stand up to wear and washing.  No shedding.  I have to hot glue one of the pink handles back on, but that was minor.</li>
            <li> These look great for some travel brushes maybe not the highest quality.  They aren&#x27;t as variable as I would like since there is no fluffy eyeshadow brush.  I love the case though and for the price it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this make up brush set for my best friend for her birthday. She loved the brushes so much that I bought one for myself. Brushes are good quality. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have received the item and the case looks gorgeous! The brushes are quite soft and fine looking, as advertised. I still have to use them for a while to tell the long run effect but so far everything is good!</li>
            <li> I saw these brushes and the price and the price was knocked down. I thought it was a great deal it had brushes that I use. I ordered it about 3 days ago and just got it in the mail today, 11/7/2011, Fast shipping which I like.   It was packaged very well, it was in a brown box that covered the entire bag. When I took it out of the box it was wrapped in plastic to protect it, very easy to open which I also like.  When I took it out the front of it was in very good condition, its silky smooth, no damages.  When I opened it, it had a VERY soft interior, black. All the brushes from top to bottom had a plastic wrap on them to protect them which I like, keeps them in there original shape.  They are VERY soft to the touch &amp; VERY soft to the face which I ADORE. Normally a lot of brushes I get are \\&quot;pointy\\&quot; to the touch &amp; on the face which I dislike but these are all nice to the face.   It catches makeup very well and when applying to my face its nice &amp; smooth. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so I&#x27;m not sure what the effects are to that. But putting makeup on my face there hasn&#x27;t been anything falling out maybe here &amp; there but VERY rare.   Overall I love these brushes. They are worth the price (which was reduced)and well packaged, fast shipping, soft to the touch, catches makeup well.  Everyone elses brushes will be different from how mine are but I do recommend them. Hope this helps. Xoxox</li>
            <li> Great Item, just what i needed to teach my daughter how to care for her face and make-up. Good quality for the price, Pouch is super cute.</li>
            <li> great shipping time. I love the fact that its pink, its my favorite color. Great price for 15 brushes but they are not the greatest quality BUT it&#x27;ll do just great :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice set of makeup brushes, and before you assume that I ordered what I thought was going to be a great set of brushes at such a cheap price naively, let me say... I LOVE the ecoTools sets, they are full and soft and wash well and do not shed. I just am as girly as they come and was instantly drawn to the pink.   The case: looked so cheap and awful... was shedding around the edges and looked like if you threw it in your bag, it would completely unravel.  The brushes: small and thin, not full to the point where you could get good use with your makeup. They were already shedding. Soft, but felt fake, like if you were to wash them the black dye would come off and they would become coarse.   All-in-all I was really excited for this set, and really disappointed when it arrived. Save your money and go with the ecoTool sets if you&#x27;re looking for really good, quality, affordable brushes. (I&#x27;ve seen them on here, but I got mine at walgreens, I&#x27;ve also heard walmart sells them).</li>
            <li> This is a great set for beginners! I love it! The brushes are sturdy and soft! I love the face brushes!! I reccommend this for beginners not for pros though... But 18.00? YEAH!</li>
            <li> I HATED these brushes and I immediately sent it back as soon as I got them. The color of the brushes is very ugly and the brush variety is crap. It&#x27;s basically the same brush in varying sizes. I can&#x27;t believe this got so many positive views, I can&#x27;t understand it. If you&#x27;re serious about makeup artistry please know that these are definitely not for pro use whatsoever. I might suggest them for a 16 year old starting out who doesn&#x27;t know any better but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a photographer and I needed a make-up set to use for my models. I bought a 120 color eyeshadow kit here on amazon and I thought I might as well buy a brush set too. I extremely happy I did. This set is very chic but also has professional quality. The bristles are soft and easy to clean, all of the brushes came with a plastic cover, that keeps them neat and the carrying pouch is easy to pack for going to photo shoots or just putting away in my make-up box. If I hadn&#x27;t bought this set I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use my eyeshadow kit. Great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT! IT WORKED PERFECTLY!! AND THE BRUSHES ARE SO SOFT!! AND THEY ARE SO SOFT! :)</li>
            <li> It looks GREAT!   Background on me: this is my first cosmetic brush set, and I had just recently got my makeup professionally done so I wanted to try and do the same techniques at home..  About the Product: There is a slightly awkward smell... but its nothing big, I&#x27;m going to just assume its like a \\&quot;new car\\&quot; smell for the faux croc case. The brushes didn&#x27;t shed a lot for me, I had read for another poster they had. The case is SOOOO soft and SOOOOO cute I love it! I love pretty much anything pink but I really love this! I just washed them so I can&#x27;t wait til they dry so I can try them out!</li>
            <li> After a month with these brushes the brushes themselves started to fall apart. From the entire set i have 5 that are now broken horrible.</li>
            <li> These are the worst brushes i have ever purchased. The foundation brush head came off the handle the very first time i used it. The rest do not work well either, save yourself the money and order something else.</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster always has the best deals! I love my cosmetic brush set! I love how easy it is to roll this case up and take it on the go with you. The case is cute too! Though the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t the best brushes I have used they are still good, esp. for the price. You couldn&#x27;t have done any better for the price you pay. The smaller brushes work a lot better than the larger brushes. The larger brushes don&#x27;t spread the makeup out as evenly as I would like, but that&#x27;s okay because I mostly purchased this for the smaller brushes. Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The brush itself is way too soft to be able to pick up pigments from any make-up. I know because I kept trying. Next time, I&#x27;m gonna actually invest in a MAC make-up brushes or even a sephora brushes, seriously, I have one or two of those brands, and this set does not compare to them. I tried to use it for three times, and I just got so frustrated by it. I hate this product.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay 15 brushes for close to $19, which makes each brush a bit over a doller, you get what you paid for. The brushes are too soft, and the case is a little cute, but the quality of the brushes are questioned. I was able to notice straying hairs from the brush and some began to fall off a bit. The handle is not good quality, I was able to separate the brush from the wooden handle with a nice tug after I first opened and examined the brushes,  I might have to re-glue all 15. The metal handle attaching the brush to the wooden handle is not made well either, I can easily bend it.     If I had noticed these brushes in store, I would have bought better makeup applicators. But I don&#x27;t regret the purchase because in reality I had a cheap deal with these makeup brushes. In wal-mart and drugstores the brushes can be very expensive.     If you like cheap brushes and don&#x27;t care, this is for you. I&#x27;ve started to really gain an interest in beauty and makeup and these brushes are just ok. I also had amazon prime so shipping was super fast.    Dont let everyone tell you how amazing these brushes are, they&#x27;re not a super deal and the quality of the brushes matches its price. Worth a bit over a doller.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the larger brushes are relatively soft. This did not work for me. However, the smaller brushes work well as they have much shorter bristles and so are sturdier. Good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> i received my set a week before christmas 2011 and i waited until christmas day to use my brushes and my foundation brush is fall apart now i have to buy another brush i only use that brush once i would have gave 5 stars but my main brush i use is broke how something new fall apart they are some soft brushes but they are falling apart i&#x27;m buy sum crazy glue to see if that fix the problem now i&#x27;m looking for a new brush set ......waste of money</li>
            <li> I had already purchased my girlfriends present before christmas so figured I&#x27;d get her a little something else. Got this and a 88 color make-up thing. She loved both of them. My sisters and mother really liked it as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nice make up brushes, work well. The case is a little stinky, just let it sit out for a while and it goes away. I would recommend these especially as a starter kit or travel brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this 15pc Make up brush set for my girlfriend&#x27;s bday but when i got it, i felt in love with it so I kept it! After a few days one of the brushes started to fall apart but i fixed it, I would also liked to have a round brush ( thats just me) Other than that, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> CASE&lt;br /&gt;The case it great for travel! The black velvet is difficult to clean off, but hasn&#x27;t become a major issue. It&#x27;s light and protects my brushes. (I insert another brand of brushes--not the ones that come with the case--and they fit perfectly.) The outer material seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSHES&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are not good quality. They&#x27;ll be okay for a few uses, but are not great.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about buying these with the amount of mixed reviews it had. I looked up videos on youtube to see what other people were saying. One thing I noticed people were saying was that this kit had a heavy plastic smell when you first open it. I, however, did not experience that when I opened mine.  I&#x27;d recommend deep conditioning them before use. When I did, some extra dye came out of the bristles. I&#x27;ve only had a few bristles fall out, but nothing too bad. Only one brush had an odd shape to the bristles. It seemed like they weren&#x27;t set properly before they sealed them with the glue and ferrule. I just trimmed it myself with some hair cutting scissors.  It&#x27;s not a bad set, just don&#x27;t expect the same quality as a MAC brush.</li>
            <li> I just bought this brushes,and the shipping was REALLY FAST!&lt;br /&gt;They are so nice but it dosent have a blendig brush :( and their kind of hard idk maybe cuz there new&lt;br /&gt;I wash the brushes with my favorite shampoo than I blow dry light but I burn one brush lol so u have to be really careful and dont set the blow dry on high like I did lol!  other than dat their Great. Hope they last long :/</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of powder makeup i.e. pigments, mineral foundation, eyeshadow, blush/bronzer, synthetic brushes are not the way to go. I received this as a Christmas present and after using it everyday for the past 3 months, two brushes have broken, as is the brush would come off of the wooden base. This kit is not worth the money and investment, spend it on a cheaper brush all natural haired brush set, or save up for a more expensive one. If all you wear are creamy products, then this set is for you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and was told the brushes literally fell apart with-in a few weeks very disappointed</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft! i mean for 19$ these brushes are great! The case it comes in does smell a little funny but it is adorable! also the shipping was so fast! the one bad thing is it doesnt have a blending brush so i did have to get a mac 217 brush but its all good(:</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the amazing quality. I really love these brushes. They get the job done and are so adorable. They&#x27;re great for traveling and save on space. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! .-_-</li>
            <li> When I first opened up my brushes they did have &#x27;that odor&#x27;, but properly cleaning them (as you should do before using new brushes) fixed it instantly. They are very soft but still pretty durable, they aren&#x27;t &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes, but they are GREAT for beginners. I highly recommend these to anyone starting out in makeup.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product, and when finally received it I found out that the bag was a little broken to be honest I did not care, the only 3 brushes that really work for me are the first 3 to apply blush..the other ones..no comments they are supposed to be eye shadow brushes but they are almost the same thing and does not hold well the shadows...I still using my eco brushes after all...</li>
            <li> This is an OK brush set,suitable for beginners. The brushes are soft and the ones that need to be firm are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just hoping for morevariety in them, the smaller brushes are basically all the same and the powder brushes could be bigger/ fluffy. Its a nice gift set but I will need to buy some individual brushes to create a perfect set of brushes.</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes! They are very soft and apply makeup well. I was very surprised at the level of quality for the price! If you are considering buying brushes, look no further. I looked at other sets of different varieties, but I am very glad I got this set. They are really soft and the carrying case is positively adorable! Of course, there are always those who write &#x27;not-so-good&#x27; reviews, but don&#x27;t believe it for this product. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a great deal. For beginners into make up (like me) or for people looking for a back up, i would definitely recommend this product. But for those who are in daily use of these... ehhhhh I wouldn&#x27;t buy these unless you are on a budget. I have used mine for a week or so and one of the brush tops popped off. I easily fixed it with some glue but that really shouldn&#x27;t happen. Also, a lot of the brush protectors in my set were broken (the tops broken open), not quite sure if that is suppose to be so bu yeah.  Bottom line, these are average. They get the job done and they are smooth thus they get a 3 stars, if they had more quality (i.e. brush didn&#x27;t snap off or the brush protectors were intact) would have gotten a 4. Still though, great beginner set :D!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t not a bad purchase for the money. I would not call them professional but they will do the job for sure!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, I love them. they are soft and gentle to the skin. Totally recommended. This is a very economic yet chic option.</li>
            <li> bought these base on other reviews however i am not impressed with them. they barely hold eyeshadow and you have to reapply over and over just to be able to see it. might keep them for other uses.</li>
            <li> comes exactly as shown, and the brushes are actually pretty good quality. i was scared that they were going to be like walmart brushes or something. but i was very pleased to open it and they were exactly as shown! good quality for the price. if you by them at like target or something they all come separate and would cost you alot more. thanks for fast shipping as well! &lt;3</li>
            <li> Absolute the best brush and worth every penny that I spent on them. You will not be disappointed and cannot go wrong for the price. Order today.Pretty in pink~</li>
            <li> The brushes in the product were fine but the pink case looked a little cheap.  I would buy it again if they came in a different case.</li>
            <li> This is really great i always read reviews about products before i but them and when i say this product is amazing... It is AMAZING the brushes are nice and soft. Defiantly worth the money don&#x27;t hesitate but these.I love everything about this.. My make up is ON-POINT!!!</li>
            <li> i did not know how much i was lacking only after this package arrived as an anniversary gift, its very soft and has multiple angles, great for the heavy makeup user like me.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived quickly which was nice but the quality is \\&quot;ehh\\&quot;... I am a little bit of a makeup connoisseur, but definitely no makeup artist. The bigger brushes were more of a disappointment while the smaller ones actually aren&#x27;t bad. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice foundation/bronzer brush, this one isn&#x27;t it... of course it&#x27;s a great price but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality and many repeats of the same brush. Brushes lost many bristles before I even used them. They were promptly returned.</li>
            <li> I expected a real Mac product. I was disappointed!! I expacted a product with high quality and i didn&#x27;t got it. I got a product i will not use!!!!! Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Daughter LOVES these brushes for all her makeup styling.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive review about this product I had to try them my self. Initially I was skeptical about this product b&#x27;coz they are offering 15 brushed total for less price then the other brands who charge more for one brush.  Package arrived in good condition &amp; brushed were packed well. My first impression was like I got few same brushes in different sizes &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel like having good quality brushes. For the price that I paid for, I was NOT expecting really high quality brushes like mac or sephora one.  Now about the brushes themselves. They are really soft BUT are THIN &amp; FLAT. Instead of blending color they just spread them. That&#x27;s all they can do.  They are marketing them as \\&quot;pro makeup brush\\&quot; but definitely it is not pro quality. I would not recommend it to any teenager or new comer who is learning how to do makeup b&#x27;coz I believe that when u learn doing makeup u should start with good quality brushes so that u get good result for yr efforts.  So it&#x27;s a big NO product.</li>
            <li> Trust me its worth the money....people say y do you need so many brushes but you would use it some point of time in ur life and then when u buy each one it will be expensive....also the quality is amazing its not at all cheap i am really glad its so cheap...worth it....</li>
            <li> This brushes set I really love, are beautiful, the brushes are so soft. worth buying, the price is incredible. Very happy!</li>
            <li> So I bought this item 3 months ago; I felt a good review would be me using them and observing how well they put make make up on. I say its great for a beginner in make up. When I recieved them they did have a small scent (nothing strong) but like all make up users \\&quot;YOU MUST WASH ALL YOUR NEW BRUSHES\\&quot; So after I washed them I was surprised that no hairs came out and it was pretty clean when I washed them. I am very happy with this purchase and especially for the price, its a deal!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and such a great price! They don&#x27;t shed, they are super soft, and they are soo cute! The holding case is really adorable, as well. I recommended these to my cousin who is a makeup guru. I just can&#x27;t believe how amazing these brushes are!</li>
            <li> So I bought this brush set after i searched Sigma Brushes, but i learned that Sigma was to expensive so i bought bundle monster. When it arrived in the mail i noticed immediately the smell of the purse (case to store brushes) had a stench of gasoline on it i had to wash my brushes and the purse!! it still has a distinct odor of gas to it.</li>
            <li> This is very good because they are all in a neat little bag and they are all there! Some of the brushes Seemed the same to me and I get confused on what they are used for. But it is a good little brush kit.</li>
            <li> My coworker absolutely loves this brush set. She loves how soft they are and how much easier it is to apply her makeup. So she is one happy camper. Again thank you for having it availbale.</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes. Picks up makeup pretty good. One head as fallen off but nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix. Very cute hot pink carrying case.</li>
            <li> I, RECIEVED MY BRUSH SET TODAY ALONG SIDE WITH THE REST OF MY FIRST ORDER BUT THE MINUTE I TOUCHED TO SEE HOW IT FEELS , THE HAIRS STARTED FALLING OFF I DIDNT LIKE THAT BUT I DECIDED TO KEEP THEM FOR NOW UNTIL I GET ANOTHER BRAND NEW BRUSH SET . I THOUGHT AFTER THE THREE GOOD REVIEWS I READ ABOUT THIS ITEM THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERNT BUT I WAS WRONG BESIDES ALL THAT THE PACKAGEING WAS GREAT NONE OF THE BRUSHES WERE THERE AN NOTHING WAS MISSING .</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes.  they are just as the pic. the case is a little flimsy but workable.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than what I have expected. The case smells like synthetic chemical or something like that. Other than that, the brushes are so soft! Great quality for a cheap price! Recommended for beginner makeup enthusiasts out there. :)</li>
            <li> Love the case, easy for travel. 80% of the brushes are great for people with mid level experience. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great set if this is your first set you are purchasing. The brushes are great, soft, no smell to them when opened. I use them everyday and love them. Will purchase from this seller again. They had speedy shipping and the product was awesome. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with a makeup set. I loved the color and its look. Very sleek and girly-girl.  The brushes were very soft and looked/felt high quality.  The pockets held them very well and no slipping out. My niece was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love the case! The brushes are very nice some of them I do not use.  The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> i purchased these brushes looking long and hard through amazon, judging by the comments, ratings, and price... and i am soooooo happy and well pleased with my final choice, first of all the quantity is amazing and very helpful, also some complained about the bristles breaking or it shedding, but i don&#x27;t have that problem at all.. i tugged a few times..and they are secure and well in place...the bristles run smoothy together, and can easily pick up eye shadow and evenly apply it. They are a good quality set for the price you pay, and i absolutely love the work it does; the look as well is very girly and has character it will bring some excitement to your collection if your like me &#x3D;) im so excited to use these brushes in all the looks i&#x27;m going to create &#x3D;)))) and i know for sure sometime in the future i will be purchasing these for my family and girls ^_^ don&#x27;t miss out on a fair purchase....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also im a 21yr old and  by the fineness of the brushes and how it picks up the eye shadow, some one younger or even a bit older can use these brushes just as well; meaning for someone who doesn&#x27;t experiment with heavy colors and enjoys more of a natural look. These brushes are magical for that as well!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^_^LOVE.EM!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product 2 days ago and used it a few time and the handles on the brushes fell off and the brush bristles are falling out. This product is awful and not worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> Many of the brushes begin to fall apart!!! I am not happy with that. I bought them because the video review. The brushes look decent in the video but the quality is really bad. Don&#x27;t buy, or you will regret!!!</li>
            <li> I was in the search of a brush holder that would hold a bunch of my brushes and not cost an arm and a leg. I was about to purchase the MAC brush holder which only holds 8 and looks like a pain to close...when i came across this holder. i loved how many brushes it holds and the pink casing. When i recieved it in the mail i was very happy with the product. it did have a slight order when i opened it but has since gone away. i didnt need any of the brushes but thought it was still a good deal just for case itself. i would recommend this for anyone who needs just the case or the brushes as well. Oh and i LOVE LOVE LOVE that it just snaps close instead of the wrap around strings you have to tie.</li>
            <li> there is no any good eyeshadow brushes, there is no any crease definer or smudger brush, i dont like eye liner brush,  there is only good blush brushes</li>
            <li> Its O.K  the reason I say its ok is cuz da first time i went to use it, it BROKE OFF its stick I was in shock how could something so new BREAK OFF its stick n da little wallet thing was a tad RIPPED but other den dat after i CRAZY CLUED a COUPLE of them it was all good</li>
            <li> What i loved most about this product is the case it comes in. It looks like a clutch-type purse and can easily fit into my regular purse for when i do my makeup on the go. The brushes are very easy to clean and the variety of brushes helps me accomplish the look i want.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these brushes, and purchased simply off others positive reviews, but was also looking for a set that was easy to take with  me when we travel.  Before, I was packing up my brushes in a cosmetic bag and always worried about messing up the brushes, since they were loose and packed with other items.  I must say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase!  The brushes are super soft, I haven&#x27;t noticed any fibers/hairs falling out during use, the case is convenient for travel and pretty cute, too!  My oldest daughter has been asking for set ever since I got them!  :)</li>
            <li> Let me start off my saying- I have tried every brush out there. As these are only around 20 dollars, you honestly can&#x27;t expect them to be perfect...  Cons:  -These brushes are too soft! I mean, even the eyeliner brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to apply liner  -Makeup case is too floppy  -No crease brush, and too many lip/ concealer brushes!  -Not a true eyeshadow brush  Pros:  -Haven&#x27;t seen any hair fall off of them!  -cute, easy to hold brushes  -Super fluffy powder brushes, so you don&#x27;t look cakey!  I have to admit I love the blush brushes, but I do find that most of the selections are repeats of the same type of brush- theyre just slighty different sizes.  So, in summary i do enjoy these brushes. But, unfortunatly I will have to go buy myself more expensive eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Love my  Bundle Monster 15pc Studio Pro Makeup Make Up Cosmetic Brush Set Kit!!! The delivery was FAST! I will be ordering again! Thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT. THE BRUSHES ARE VERYYYYYYY SOFT AND FEEL GREAT ON YOUR SKIN. THE BAG IS ALSO GREAT AND LOOKS VERY CUTE. I HIGHLY RECOMAND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. ITS A GREAT PRICE FOR THE VALUE. THEY ALL WORKED GREAT AND THE HOLDERS ARE STRONG AND WONT BREAK. IT IS VERY STYLISHHHH ...I LOVEDDD ITTTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> I love the color &amp; they are very soft.  I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone.  They were not bubble wrapped but only covered with plastic wrapping.  I would suggest that if ordered alone be mindful of that.</li>
            <li> I saw all of the positive feedback for these brushes and they were so afforadable, so I decided to ask for them for Christmas.  Once I recieved them, I did notice the odor that some other people were talking about, but that went away after I gently washed my brushes and let them air out for 24 hours.  I am giving this product one star because before I began using them, I noticed that some bristles were beginning to fall out.  Once I used them, more and more bristles fell out.  These brushes are not as full as they look.  I was especially disappointed with the angled brush used for bronzers and blushes.  I think the problem is that the bristles are too fine so the powder does not stick to the brushes. These brushes did not provide adequate coverage. This was not a good purchase and I would not recommend them to anyone.  I guess my search for quality, affordable brushes continues...</li>
            <li> These brushes were a waste if money. They&#x27;re super cheap and there isn&#x27;t a variety of different brushes.  It maybe 15 pieces but I have four brushes that ate exactly the same. You can&#x27;t ebb use them properly because they&#x27;re so stiff and flat. The day I hit them I had two brushes fall apart from the wooden handle. The only brushes I use are the tiny angled brush, which I use for eyeliner and the brow brush</li>
            <li> I like the colors and the bag does have a smell to it, it smells like permanent marker but I like the brushes a lot and they seem to work pretty well. It does shed a little bit but not so bad. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This will be my first review based on my first impressions! I must say I was a little worried because I had seen a lot of negative reviews but for now these brushes are great, I LOVE THEM! First, the shipping was supper fast! It was free and the brushes arrived within two days. Next, handle in th me brushes are pretty well put in. Bristles haven&#x27;t fallen off and they are very soft. One thing i didnt like though is that one or two of the brush handles had the dried glue coming out and when I peeled it off the painting came off as well. Nothing I can&#x27;t live with though. I&#x27;ll have to wait and try them with makeup  to give a relevant review but for first impressions these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> These are very cute brushes. The only thing worng with them is they are all very flat, and soft. They dont hold color very well.</li>
            <li> These brushes dont work well and absorb the makeup and spreads the makeup unevenly. They arent good quality more for play, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was starting to get really into makeup, and I know that learning brush technique is one of the hardest parts that I&#x27;ve struggled with. This cheap bundle of brushes was exactly what I expected.  They are non labeled, low quality, and very flat brushes.  But, they are helping me to learn what brush you use with which makeup and come with an extremely cute faux alligator case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good for education and tutorials on yourself.  The faux alligator case is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Do not purchase if you want/are used to round tipped brushes. All of these brushes arrive very flat, and have stayed flat.  I have had and used them daily for 3 months.</li>
            <li> The brushes came faster than the estimated time of arrival. Most of them were intact and in good shape. There were two brushes that had some dented and stray hairs but I just cut or pulled them off. The pink case is okay at best. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and would recommend to people who need makeup brushes and are on a tight budget like myself.</li>
            <li> So nice, soft and beautifull brushes. ;) im very happy whit this brushes, nice case and lovely colors if you have problems whit the smell just put a little bit of baby powder, and the smell go away.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive today my Bundle Monster brushes. They are super soft and is a great variety for someone who is just starting to use brushes. I most likely won&#x27;t use some of them but the big brushes definitely. The case smelled a little like plastic but is great for keeping brushes together while traveling. I give these two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I received these brushes yesterday. I would not recommend for anyone else to buy. All of the shadow brushes were pretty much the same. They were all just smaller versions of the Foundation brush. They have no fluff to them whatsoever. Also my brushes didn&#x27;t even come with the flat brush as advertised. Im not trying to criticize the company at all. Just want to help out anyone thinking of buying these. They are very soft but you will not be able to do much with them.</li>
            <li> I just recieved these brushes. I actually  feel like you really get a value seeing as one brush can cost anywhere between 20 dollars and up. However, I wish either on the brush or on the bag it listed what the brushes uses are for. I&#x27;m new to makeup so this would&#x27;ve been a helpful feature.</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes!! I have been looking for a set of good quality, descent, good price brushes and I finally FINALLY! found some :D I was so excited when they finally came through the mail. Best brushes so far, and the pink alligator skin case that came with it! Couldn&#x27;t get any better. This seller gets an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> I love it! Brushes come in two days earlier, when I opened the package then fell in love with these brushes! Very soft and great quality! Handbag so beautiful! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t the greatest quality. They are soft and I did not see any shedding when I washed them. Make sure you wash before using because I flicked at the top of them and a powder dust came off of three of them. Most of the eye brushes are pretty stiff. I do like the case though. I subtracted one star for the quality and one star for the stiffness. Overall, good deal for the price, nice variety of brushes, and a cute case. Just dont expect MAC-like brushes.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I read on this product the brushes are just ok. I hate to say but the main reason I purchased this was becuase of the case because i already own make up brushes but i dont have a case for them and when i saw a pink case i said i gotta have it. BUT the make up case is flimsy and the holders are already coming apart. The brushes are average and they have alot of strands that stick out, i had to cut some of the hairs so it wouldnt feel pokey on my skin. I dont even use the brushes to be honest, I gave a few of them away to my sister in law because the eyeshadow burshes seem like repeats and i already own good makeup brushes. I bought an E.L.F. makeup case it comes with 11 professional brushes and i love that set it comes with a black case and I also saw it on amazon for $24 i highly recommend that set better.</li>
            <li> I am not new to make-up. Being 30 I&#x27;ve been around the block. However, I am new to correctly applying my make-up. I thought theses brushes would be a nice starter set for me. Not too cheap and not too expensive. They took a little longer getting here than I would have liked but, I&#x27;ll chalk that up to impatience. Upon arrival they were bubble wrapped to the extreme. The better to keep them safe my dear. When I opened them I was overwhelmed with all these different brushes as I have no clue how to use them. While reading reviews I noticed that a few people were complaining about the smell. I have the worlds most sensitive nose and I was a bit anxious. I found it had a slight odor, but nothing that would knock me out. As a matter of fact, the smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The brushes were soft and stiff when they needed to be. I love that the case fits in my make-up bag. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and look forward to upgrading with another of their products. (As soon as I figure out mines! Lol)</li>
            <li> Very good product, excellent</li>
            <li> This product is a good one. The problem with this one is the bag! It has folds on the side. I tried to straighten it out but it doesn&#x27;t work. The brushes was fine.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes for a good price.  I don&#x27;t use all of them but like them for eyeshadow and concealer.  The blush/powder brushes are a bit small so instead I use them for blending.  The carrying case initially had an overpowering chemical odor but I left it open on my vanity for a week and don&#x27;t notice it much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addend: I bought these as a starter kit.  Over time I&#x27;ve bought a few eye brushes from Urban Decay that have made this set obsolete.  Getting to compare the two side to side was a learning experience.  Didn&#x27;t realize what a difference good brushes can make.</li>
            <li> Came the exact date it told me it would. Love it!! The case is cute and keeps all my brushes organized. All of them are decent and not too rough on skin. love it :)</li>
            <li> Ill start by saying i got them buy expected delivery. They look just as nice as they do in the picture. they are very soft but not to soft...only thing I wish on the brush it would be labeled what type of brush it is like many other brush sets...its a great starter brush set....</li>
            <li> i just got these brushes today and i love them so far! soooo worth it! they&#x27;re super soft and the case is very cute!</li>
            <li> I was super exicted due to the fact that they are pink. Not impressed with the handle sizing.I thougt they would be fatter I feel like I&#x27;m going to snap them. The case did not smell like others say. At least not mine. No shedding yet.. They are fine. I&#x27;d recomend for the price.</li>
            <li> have all the brushes anybody would need for makeups. easy to carry. Though the the color of the case is a little bit different than that in the picture. But over all super convenient to use with good price, quality matches with its price.</li>
            <li> the brushes aren&#x27;t terrible but they aren&#x27;t amazing either. I wish the eyeshadow brushes we&#x27;re thicker because it&#x27;s next to impossible to blend with them. but as long as you have a spare blending brush these would be OK- if you wanted them for the price or something. (Or the look cuz they are adorable)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this item. I love it and use it everyday. The brushes are very good and are very easy to clean; just use cold water and shampoo. :P</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes and they actually were pretty decent. I am not a make up artist but the largest brush worked well with my mineral foundation. I love that when I ordered them they were pink as opposed to other brush sets which displayed pink brushes but said color may vary. I have had no brush hair loss and the smaller brushes have been excellent for my eye shadow! Would recommend to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated as of 10/10/2015: I bought these in 2/2012 and they are all still holding up pretty well. Actually not really any problems with them and I have washed and used multiple times!</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes and NO shedding problems! I really like these brushes. Will definitely be purchasing more of these. They make great gifts!</li>
            <li> I would recomend this, it has almost everything the only thing I would add to this kit is the smokey eye brush!&lt;br /&gt; the smell goes away if you leave it open or just with time.. nothing special&lt;br /&gt;15pc is perfect dont waste your money buying a lot of brushes that will at the end be the same !&lt;br /&gt;I will probablu buy these kit again since Ive lost pretty much all of them! haha</li>
            <li> I bought these because I felt they were a good value, but I guess you get what you pay for. Three of these brushes broke within a day. It was like they were hot glued onto the handle. I could have hand made better brushes. I still have some of the eye make-up brushes I do use from time to time, but as for my future in buying anymore \\&quot;Bundle Monster\\&quot; brushes I think I will just take my chances with something a little more worth my while.</li>
            <li> if your little girl is learning her tools or you&#x27;re just entering the business it&#x27;s a good preview to learn what you need/want. if you&#x27;re looking for something firm I&#x27;d look elsewhere. They don&#x27;t shed but the head do come off the wood handles pretty easily. the brushes held up to shampooing and the case can be washed.</li>
            <li> I received these on 3/28/2012 as a birthday gift from my best friend. (im going to be 23...yay!!) They were shipped to my home. I thought the product was very well packed and it is just beautiful. The brushes come wrapped in a thin plastic and the three larger brushes also have a sturdier plastic cover on them to re use if so desired. The brushes I received were in perfect condition. The bristles are soft and picked up makeup well when I wet them (I like the darker, matte looking style) I did try with them dry and they did ok. Just not my preference. It folds back up well and I just love it. It would be a perfect gift for a teenager or someone interested in make up art that wants to try out all the different brushes before spending big bucks on Professional brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent. The actual bristles are wonderful. they dont shed and apply makeup wonderfully. My complaint is that the handles come off. I have had to reglue several brushes back to the handle. Its a simple fix but still annoying.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t fall out. I&#x27;ve washed the brushes twice now and they hold up. However, most of the brushes came unglued from the wooden handle. I had to super glue to and one I had to throw away. I would not get this again and I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Loooove this brush set! I really was surprised how great these brushes are. I am currently a MUA in training and saw these brushes and couldn&#x27;t resist buying them because of the pink color and price. I was a little bit hesitant at first to buy them, just because of the bad reviews they got and worrying if the price was too good to be true. I honestly was expecting them to be worse than they actually are. My set came packaged very carefully, and perfectly in tact inside. It did have a different smell when I opened the case, but nothing strong or pungent, it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell by any means. Just wash them and you&#x27;re good to go. I love how soft they are and still am surprised on how good quality they are for the price! I am very satisfied with my set and glad I bought them, they are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I actually love these brushes they did not shed I&#x27;ve washed them like 10 times now there are a lot of them so you do have choices they are a little stiff though but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> To be honest i picked this brush set for the price and the color.When i received them i was so excited to try them, they are very soft, no shedding and a lot of good brushes. But i must say that i am sorry i did not do some more research on them, they don&#x27;t have a blending, crease or smudge brush (had to buy separate ones). One of the brushes was not properly attach to the handle and fell off in a few days. The case is too flimsy and cheap. But to be fair for the price i got a lot of use of them, still use a few of them after almost a year. But don&#x27;t expect the most out of them.</li>
            <li> Do  not wast your money.  These are a cheap set that should not be used as an everyday set.  Pack them in your luggage if you don&#x27;t mind parting with it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes but I failed to look up the reviews.  They are firm &amp; do not give full coverage. I don&#x27;t recommend them I should have just paid for mac full price brushes instead of trying to go cheap &amp; getting these.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my sister. She loved the color and texture of the case and also liked the range and quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Jon Snow, I know nothing, when it comes to this stuff so as long as the recipient liked it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Well it is a great kit with mostly everything you need</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a while now. Brushes are still in great shape, they are not well attached to the base so be careful! I glued them back together with superglue and they work just as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Other brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past fall apart and leave the bristle parts of the brush on my face during makeup application. A lot of variety for a very affordable price! Absolutely love the product!</li>
            <li> The brushes are what you would expect for the price. The hairs aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; as I would have thought which was a nice surprise. I am giving 4 stars because of the terrible smell (like burning plastic) that clung to the brushes and carrying case until 3 washings in baby shampoo finally made it bearable.  As far as overall function- the powder brush is not a big fluffy brush like I like. Several of the smallest brushes are foreign to me, so I would have loved a little list of what each brush is for, as I normally would use maybe 7-8 as opposed to this large collection. The bristles are soft, but have a distinctly synthetic feel, but again, for the price I expected as much.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes and they were really nice but they and the case they come in smelled like paint thinner. I had to leave them open and lay them out for a week to get the smell to go away a little.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the how soft these brushes are and the fact that they don&#x27;t shed. And i&#x27;m not overwhelmed by too many brushes. Perfect amount!!</li>
            <li> Case is nice and brushes are great.  There are a lot, more than I will use, happy with this purchase.  Delivery was great and received exactly what I thought I would.</li>
            <li> There was NO smell or anything weird. They came fast and they haven&#x27;t shed or anything. They are super soft and I love the case. One of the brushes metal black parts came apart from the pink wooden handle but I will super glue that sucker back in tomorrow. I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> ok they are cheap and pretty so whynot by them ?? they are soft but the brushes break and are just horrible with make up...i recomend getting elf brushes instead</li>
            <li> Some of these brushes weren&#x27;t usable due to the glue coming undone and them falling apart. The brushes are soft so don&#x27;t really grab all that much color.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush set and this set is great!  Brushes are good quality and the pink color is very pretty.  I like that there is also a matching case to store everything.  Great Buy. I recommend this product to anyone needing makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for my GF she loves the case . quality brushes. Extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I bought these for Grandma to give to my eleven year old daughter for Christmas.  They seem very high quality and the bristles are very soft.  I told my daughter she better hide them, or I might use them myself.  Case is perfect for keeping the brushes organized.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t pay much attention to the complaints about the plastic smell because I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and has no complaints.  Great selection of brushes, too.</li>
            <li> I go the pink set and like the color. Great starter makeup brush kit. Quality of the synthetic brushes are descent and you get a variation of brush sizes which is important when applying makeup. The handle is sturdy, however I do not like the plastic case, it&#x27;s flimsy and not as sturdy as I thought. Otherwise the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush set. I think its really cute&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice and includes several different types.</li>
            <li> Loved these. They have lasted me a long time! The hair don&#x27;t even fall out like other brushes do. Although i did have to glue like 3 back together but i&#x27;m sure that was my mistake since i washed them.</li>
            <li> these are awesome! i bought these for my 11 year old daughter to play/practice makeup and i purchased another different set! this one blows mine out of the water! i have purchased one for myself and my older daughter. these are great. follow care instructions and you will stay happy for a long time!!! i would recommend these and would if i needed to buy them again</li>
            <li> First time i use one of the brushes and broke... I gave another brush a try and broke easily too.... Not happy at all with this product...</li>
            <li> I fyou know about makeup you dont want this set. This not &amp;#34;pro makeup!</li>
            <li> I love all the pencils, just the case it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it serves its purpose very well :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are an ok quality. You definitely get what you pay for! If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t really wear makeup or is just starting out, this set is perfect! If you&#x27;re in need of brushes thst can create a specific look, these may or may not work for you.</li>
            <li> they arrived in a timely manner very sleek looking good quality great starter kit I would recommend these to any starting out on there beauty regime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just the looks.. it also serves its purpose well! I love these brushes that comes in with the pouch. Always on-the-go&lt;br /&gt;and the brushes are great! ilove it</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE THE BEST .... GOOD VALUE, GOOD QUALITY, GREAT CASE, &amp; THEY ARE PINK!!!...  WASHED THEM TWICE AND THEY HAVNT CAME APART!!... BRUSHES ARE SOFT ON YOUR SKIN AS WELL!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush set to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, and ended up keeping it! The kit has a great array of brushes, that are of an *Okay* quality. The brush heads are made of a cheap but soft synthetic fiber, and distribute powder evenly. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really great brushes, LOVE how many there are, and provides pretty great coverage.  Would def. recommend! The case is super cute too!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moKL7SOZ4Z0J5Q]]I just had to let you see it other the pictures and comments but I love them and I know you all will too</li>
            <li> this product is great! these brushes are soft cute and sturdy! the bag it comes in is also to cute! SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS!</li>
            <li> Amazing starter or addition to your collection!  Super soft and all the brushes you need for any look.  Makes a awesome gift.  You can not beat the price!!!!</li>
            <li> these brushes is very soft.. i&#x27;m glad my sister love it... it doesnt shed off when i had try pulling on it. but I wouldnt know how it is after being washed before used...</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great for a first make up brush set for a teen.  I&#x27;m excited to see if she likes it and I think the number of brushes it comes with will impress her.</li>
            <li> After a month a couple of the brushes started falling apart. They&#x27;re decent quality. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
            <li> I give these a 3/5 because i like the powder brushes but the shadow brushes suck. They barley pick up any color and just dont work, i mean i cant blame them cause a whole set is 18$ but calling them pro is far from the truth</li>
            <li> got this bcause of Britbrat... I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she loved it ..... there was no smell</li>
            <li> The set is conveniently organized, but the bristles are a little softer than I&#x27;m used to. The foundation brush works perfectly, the shadow brushes are great as well, but the blush and bronzer brushes are a little too soft. The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; falls out of the blush/bronzer brushes too. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the brushes and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I just got these last week. Its my first set of brushes. For the most part they don&#x27;t shed, I&#x27;ve already washed them a few times.  The blush brushes are good. the foundation brush is very sturdy but very streaky! There is no blending/crease brush but the small eye shadow brush works but only for applying a small amount of shadow to the crease for a lighter look. Prepare to buy a foundation brush and a crease brush. The case is very cute and great for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this set. The smell when you first open it is definitely over-whelming but it&#x27;s not unbearable and it&#x27;s still worth getting for the great price! The brushes are very soft and hold the makeup very well. I have like 2 sephora brushes which I love but these aren&#x27;t much worse, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> i was so excited for these brushes but was sadly and very disappointed. when i first received my brushes there was was a smell to them especially the case that it comes in, so i aired mine out for a couple days and the smell went away. the brushes themselves were very soft but so soft they didn&#x27;t pick up any product very well. shedding was another issue. the brushes weren&#x27;t very put together because they fell apart!! SO disappointed! Don&#x27;t buy this, it is definitely not worth the money. instead try the jessup brushes much cheaper but also very good in quality (almost a sigma dupe)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter, pleased with it. I would recommend it to others. Very nice price for 15 pieces.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes on the 22nd of Feb. and got it today, the shipping to me wasnt bad. I love the case, but it has a weird smell of plastic. one downfall was that one of the brushes had glue in the hairs and was hard to get off! But overall i would refer this product to friends!</li>
            <li> These brushes are GREAT! EXCEPT, every tip falls off where the metal base of the brush goes on top of the pink painted handle, Im going to have to get some &#x27;Monkey Glue&#x27; &amp; fix my Daughter&#x27;s brushes I got her for Christmas. Other than that the brushes are amazingly soft &amp; love them!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2JVFGP9YAS7UN]]Bundle Monster 15 peice brush set</li>
            <li> These brushes are not for someone that has a bit more expirience with applying their makeup. Maybe good for a tween or teen just starting to learn how too apply makeup.I personaly did not like the case and yes it does smell like gasoline, strong smell lol. I kept the bigger brushes those I could use but the smaller ones I dont have a use for them. Overall ok brushes for beginners.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice, good quality for the price... no complaints at all, would definitely buy for a friend as a gift in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple sets from Amazon, and these were very nice. Some of the brushes came apart from the wood, but that is an easy fix. The bristles on these were much softer than other sets.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Of course in time brushes get old so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m re purchasing this product.xoxo great for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It was great in delivery, but it did smell too much like plastic. I had to leave it in the open for a day before I could wrap it up for my friend. Quality seemed good in the materials and I loved the vivid pink color. If I ever need to buy another set of Make Up brushes I&#x27;ll definitely pick this one.</li>
            <li> I have been into makeup for quite some years now &amp; I wanted to see how my makeup would look if I used brushes and such, I didn&#x27;t want to go and spend a million dollars on mac or sonya kashuk brushes so I just ordered regular brushes. I love the fact that their pink, because I love pink.. &amp; for the price ? It&#x27;s a really nice buy considering brushes are expensive.. I currently have NO problems with this product. I&#x27;m currently happy about my purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought the Pink Set for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it!! The price is great, (per my sister) the brushes are good quality and its super compact and fits into almost any normal sized hand bag. Most def a great stocking stuffer and/or gift for any girl who is just a beginner with make-up or who considers herself a pro. I think I will be purchasing another for myself soon!</li>
            <li> I bought these just because I wanted more of a variety of brushes and some uniformity within them. I thought they were really cute and I do like the bag (but it is cheap :P) BUT I don&#x27;t really recommend them for someone who is use to heavier brushes or brushes with more bristles. These brushes are VERY thin and I personally think they are difficult to use. Many of the brushes only have slight differences in length or angle, but they are soo thin. I honestly use them every now and then, but I&#x27;m stuck on using my old set of brushes until I find another set more to my liking. But as said before in other reviews, you get what you pay for lol.</li>
            <li> If anyone tells you these were the &amp;#34;bomb&amp;#34; brushes I would question their expertise as a MUA. These brushes at best offer nice fibers in the brushes. The smaller brushes for eye shadow are a bit too stiff and because of that blending can be a hassle. The foundation and blush brushes are wonderful. The draw back is the metal piece the fibers fit into, because you have to sanitize your brushes and keep them clean via washing them, the metal parts will pop off from the handle eventually and I mean within a few weeks!! Disappointing. If you want to practice with these brushes and not spend an arm and a leg I would get them. But I would not use them on clients. I think investing in high quality brushes is the way too go no matter what. Personally use 5 stars.. professional use 1 star. So they got 3 if for nothing else than the fibers for the brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do good at the time of applying your make up, they retain most of it. With time they fall out</li>
            <li> Nice set, well made. The pouch is very nice and keeps the brushes neat. The dowside is that the eyeshadow brushes are pretty stiff and it&#x27;s hard to apply the shadow evenly. All of them have a &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for Christmas because she is starting cosmetology school and I got to open them before giving them to her.  They are pretty sturdy and the brush hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes felt cheap...i wouldnt recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> !!First I have to say that these brushes really don&#x27;t lose hair very much.  I am not a pink fanatic, but when i saw the positive reviews on this product, i instantly forgot they where pink and I order them right away.  I must say all the brushes are really soft on the face, Which is a Plus because my skin is very sensitive, and they look and feel really sturdy.  I have been using them for a few days now and I have completely fallen in love with them and the price is awesome.  I just order 2 more sets as gifts because I am that positive that the people who will get them are going to love them.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Yes there not MAC or SEPHORA, but I can say that I like these a lot more and they are about 75% less then what they sell them  at the name brand stores.  I am very satisfied with this product and i recommend it to any one who is just tired of spending money for theses brushes at outrageous Prices!!</li>
            <li> i just received my brushes today &amp; i love it! love how it feels and look ..no shedding &amp; it doesnt stink at all!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes in the mail today, and i was really excited about it. The packaging is super cute and will be easy to travel with. The brushes themselves are good quality, really soft and picks up a lot of product. Only thing is, one of the brushes were damaged, so i gave it only 4 stars. That doesnt ruin it for me though, I still think its a good product and i&#x27;m happy with my purchase!  ********* ^ THAT WAS MY FIRST REVIEW - THEY JUST RECENTLY BROKE AFTER ABOUT A MONTH.. DONT BUY</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist. I am an entertainer though, and need to be fresh and ready to go for auditions and red carpet events. I love these brushes. Totally cute. Very soft bristles and nothings gone wrong so far. Had them now for over two weeks. Love them.</li>
            <li> Just go them and so far so good. They are very soft and at this time non have shed. Not bad for the price as well. the case isint great. a lil cheep but not the reason i got this. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> They are good to be so cheap!!! Some of them they just broke bcz they were just with glue but overall they OK.</li>
            <li> I think this set of brushes are good for the price that I got them for. I&#x27;ve been using them for about three months now and I would recommend them to anyone. The case it comes with looks exactly as the picture shows and all the brushes arrived nicely in the clear plastics as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! They are super soft, they come in an amazing case. And it has a great variety of brushes. I love it, I use them everyday. I highly recommend it. And it arrived on time. So super happy. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These fell apart and after a year of use! If you do not plan on using them daily I would suggest buying them, but if you are going to use them everyday I would recommend buying a more expensive set.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes. I&#x27;ve been using it for around 3 years and they are perfect. Material is very soft and affortable price.</li>
            <li> I really only purchased this product due to the price and pretty pink color so I cannot be too harsh on the quality of the brushes. The black base detaches from the pink handle constantly which is irritating, and they are all a bit small. I really prefer a bigger brush for blending.</li>
            <li> This is the best Cosmetic Brush Set!</li>
            <li> Amazing I love the brushes they are soft and easy to clean😍😍😍</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was in desperate need of new ones. I love them! They pick up the makeup so well and I have had not one bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 5 days a go! This delivery was so fast (I got it today)! The quality of all these brushes is worth like a few hundred in upper class quality stores, and you only pay like $24!!!!! I showed it to my mom and she just had to have one too, so I just ordered one for her!!! The brushes are supper soft and you can tell that those hairs aren&#x27;t going anywhere! I would 100% Recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very soft, wish it included a blending brush but the price is great for the item. So can&#x27;t complain it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pretty.  I love the wide range of sizes and shapes.  You&#x27;re sure to find the perfect one for you.</li>
            <li> Great brushes I&#x27;m in love whit this is a good quality And the are soooo soft</li>
            <li> This set is just great. It has all the brushes you may need for any kind of make up. I wash them with mild soap every time I need and they just dry and are as good as new!</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes one for everything you could need! I bought these almost a year ago and most of them are still around! some of the tops where the black part is would fall off but a little glue fixed that really quick and they were as good as new! I LOVE MY BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price.  Hold up very well.  Have even washed them and they are still in great shape.</li>
            <li> these are just what I needed.  I like all the different sizes and shapes and now I am going to experiment on eye shadows more often</li>
            <li> If I could give these too soft, flimsy brushes a negative rating I would, however the only good thing about this brush set is the eyebrow spooler that I use daily. That is the only brush. Please do not waste your time and hard earned money with these brushes, I bought this set and one from Coastal Scents and love the latter. These are cheaply made and too soft for any type of use, except for that one brush!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because of the reviews and the price point. However, I&#x27;ve been nothing but disappointed. The brushes arrived and they smelled like plastic and chemicals for days. I had to let them air out before I could even attempt to use them. After that, I took a few brushes out of the case provided and added them to my make-up bag so I could have them with me daily. They apply make-up decently for a plastic brush. The problem came only a month or so after owning these when the metal part below the brush started to loosen. Soon enough the top part came off altogether. I chalked this up to a fluke, super glued the metal part back onto the wood handle, and continued to use the brushes. This continued to happen with all of my brushes. I admit that I use my brushes daily, but I keep them in a special separate area in my make-up case where they are far from abused.&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, if you&#x27;re looking for quantity these are your brushes, if you&#x27;re looking for any type of quality that will last standard use, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> fantastic brushes love the texture,,, havent used all of them but they have been washed and no shedding has occurred so i think i made a good decision on getting these.</li>
            <li> Is super nice, love the color, but the bag ain&#x27;t that great. I like the brushes and arrive on time i already recommended it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Brush is great I&#x27;m sure my sister will appreciate it it&#x27;s not a Mac brush that would be perfect but any girls would appreciate it than a Walmart makeup brush;):)  diff kinds and sizes and its pink lil plasticky smell but brush r soft...I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it of u only have this budget :):)</li>
            <li> Girls need all of the brushes in this case.  There are so many choices.  The brushes are of good quaility.</li>
            <li> The kit came on time no hassels at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that they are user friendly and easy to use when applying your make up.</li>
            <li> these brushes fell very soft and stable but had a very strong nail polish sent.... very displeasing. Overall i love the brushes just not the smell</li>
            <li> I have never had makeup brushes that were quality brushes. I love these. I use mineral makeup and they help me to apply the makeup smoothly and it looks so nice. That&#x27;s not easy for a 70+ year old. I would recomend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> doller store quality. only use about 2 of the big brush. the little ones are all flat and stiff and dont blend for nothing!</li>
            <li> Not the variety of bristles I expected. Many of the brushes are larger or smaller versions of each other.</li>
            <li> Bought this set as a gift for my daughter at her request.  She said she loves the brushes and uses them all the time.  It does have every possible brush one could want/need.  Very nice set.</li>
            <li> Got a good quantity of brushes for the money.&lt;br /&gt;but the brush hairs are not as soft as i thought they were.&lt;br /&gt;they are acrylic hairs if you dap onto your eye shadows it will create so much waste on your eye shadow, because the hairs don&#x27;t hold the powders and it literally digs into the eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Other then eye shadow, concealer,liquid fundation and cheek brushes are good.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes!! i ordered one for myself and also a friend and she loved it! will buy again</li>
            <li> I got this set because I needed brushes and didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ at Clinique or MAC for 1, when I could get this set for $15.. I didn&#x27;t expect as much from it as I would from the expensive ones.. Once I started using these, I threw away my other MAC brushes bc this is so much better.. It works the same, but I have more of a choice with this set, with a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few weeks ago, and have not used all of the brushes yet. I would agree with other reviewers who say that the plastic pouch has a chemical/plastic smell to it, but I would not say that it is offensive....and I am guessing the smell will fade over time.  All of the brushes fit nicely in the pouch, which is great for travel, but I think I will end up keeping the brushes in something else for everyday use--maybe I am just in too much of a rush in the mornings to open the case every time I need into it.  The brushes themselves are soft and work well.  I am sure there are better brush sets out there, but the price was right.  I think this product is definitely worth the $20 or less you will pay for it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the set is that every brush has the product name \\&quot;Bundle Monster\\&quot; written on it.  A little strange but not even enough of a complaint to take it down a star.</li>
            <li> THANK YALL SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH I LOVE MY NEW BRUSH SET!! I USE THEM IN MY YOUTUBE MAKEUP TUTORIAL VIDS!! I WOULD LOVE TO PROMOTE THEM FOR YOU AND YOUR COMPANY I WILL BE CONTACTING YOU SOON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES! I am so happy with my first ever Amazon purchase! The shipping was very fast and it was free (best part!) The bristles in the brush are soft and never fall off. I have recommended these brushes to all my girlfriends, they are soft and super!</li>
            <li> I received this item today. I love the brushes. They are very soft and easy on the skin. The only thing is that the case has a smell,  but it is pretty. Additionally, there is no blending brush. That is the only disadvantage. Otherwise I love it and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The brushes are \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but not great, but hey you get what you pay for. I found the larger brushes too soft to use. They also smelled pretty bad. Over all a &#x27;decent set for the price&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The little brush bag has every brush you will need to accomplish the look you are trying get. I recommended these brushes.</li>
            <li> This set arrived within a week of ordering, when i opened it i found the brushes to be excellent and very soft the case does smell a little but that can be overlooked. overall i am very impressed this is the second set i have bought from bundle monster !</li>
            <li> Great product and good customer service. I have always liked this brand and continue to buy it. Will do business gain...</li>
            <li> I had boughten these brushes because I had needed new ones and thought the pink handles and bag were cute. Once receiving them there was a very weird product smell especially on the bag and as a result I didn&#x27;t use it. On the brushes when they first arrive there is almost like a powdery substance and you definitely need to wash them (of course with any brush set purchased online you should). After washing them I reshaped them and let them dry. One pro to these is that they do wash relatively nice and keep their shape.However the cons really outweigh the pros. These brushes are very stiff so I don&#x27;t really use any of the eye makeup brushes expect for the angle brush. A lot of these brushes have almost the exact same shape not really creating a variety. Another con is that the handles keep breaking off making them impossible to use. You can see they are very poorly made because once looking at them after they have fallen apart it is apparent that they were stuck together with a little glue or something like that. Overall I regret purchasing these and would recommend saving your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a while...I would like to say they do pick up alot...so u only have to use a little on the brushes to put your make-up on...they clean very easy...they pouch is very cute and easy to clean...It can fit in your purse, tote bag, make-up bag...any where,,,I recommand this produce to anyone...</li>
            <li> I received my brush set a few days ago. Although I have only used it a few times, I&#x27;m happy with the product. The brushes are really soft and seem somewhat durable. They are long enough to easily hold and do a great job at applying the makeup. I bought this because I just recently built my own Hollywood style Vanity. My colors are black and hot pink, it matched perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I love the color of it and the case rhey came in. I love how the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great.  The purse and color is adorable to look at and share with others. The brushes seem to be of good quality because they will be used alot. Thanks.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a travel brush set that just makes you look like you have a lot of brushes, these are for you. Otherwise... they are thin, and practically the same brush in several sizes, pretty cheap quality, and they do have a bit of a strange smell. They might be a good gift for a 12 year old that is just getting into make-up? Definitely not anywhere near professional-style brushes, and a waste of money. I only use them for back-up brushes if I have two girls in a row and not enough time to clean the brushes in between.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product after I ordered it. The shipping was extremely fast. So I was happy that I could use this the next day. Truth is, when I began to use the brushes I notice how weak they were. They were entirely soft which can be good for sensitive skin but it does apply make up like it should. I guess this will just be in a make-up kit to go with my other colorful things but I cannot use these brushes and I do not think they are usable in anyway.</li>
            <li> My shipment came in 3 days, earlier than expected. They work great and I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Case is a bit flimsy, but all in all the brushes are nice quality.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I would like to say first that i love the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;the only negative i have to say is that they have a terrible smell to them when you open the package&lt;br /&gt;im guessing this due to the leather case that they come in.&lt;br /&gt;im hoping that the smell subsides. cause boy it smacks ya right in the face.&lt;br /&gt;other than that.. great product for an amazing price. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend buying to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this product for me, but ended up giving the brush set to my cousin for a Christmas present and she likes them,</li>
            <li> I love the two blush brushes, the angle brush, the foundation brush and the eyebrows and eyelash brush but the rest of the brushes are just redundant. Oh and the lipstick brush is kinda cool although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it, it&#x27;s still nice to have. There are too many eyeshadow brushes and none of them have an explanation of their purpose. But they are super soft and they look pretty. I appreciate that it&#x27;s synthetic hair which makes it all the better to feel nice about brushing your face with it. The bag is pretty too although it&#x27;s kinda falling apart which I&#x27;ll probably have to glue in some areas. But at $18 it&#x27;s worth a shot. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received the package but within a couple times of using a middle size brush, it came apart from the handle. there are many brushes so it is not really a big deal -but I was still disappointed</li>
            <li> i was debating on these for months....when they came in they did smell but it was not bad it was the case. All and all I like them alot. They are soft andwhen i washed them they dried the nexts day.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD THANKS I&#x60;ll DO IT AGAIN THESE WERE VERY GOOD BRUSHES FOR MY SISTER THANKS AND THERE ARE SO GOOD</li>
            <li> For anyone who is serious about makeup, especially eyeshadow, this is a must-have. Keeps everything together, although when I opened the package, it smelled strongly like paint. I assume the case is really cheap, but the brushes are just right!</li>
            <li> These brushes came apart instantly. As if they were glued with school glue</li>
            <li> Great brushes! The smell kinda weird though when you first get them. After you condition them, the smell goes away. Love them, great buy!</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes at first and actually still have a few in my make up brush drawer but they are cheaply made. The ends with the brush comes off from the handle I&#x27;m assuming cheap glue or not enough glue is the problem here. If you are in a pinch or just need a cheap set to travel with these are pretty good and the price is great but if you want quality brushes for good work you&#x27;ll need to drop a bit more money on something nicer.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, soo many choices but it smells so strange when you open the package.. Smell fades after awhile though...</li>
            <li> Everyday!&lt;br /&gt;Compares to none!&lt;br /&gt;They should buy it because its a convenient kit!&lt;br /&gt;Love everything!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I use this kit everyday, its awesome!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE BRUSHES AND I DEFINETELY REGRET IT, IT&#x27;S ONLY PLASTIC BRUSHES, THEY DON&#x27;T EVEN KEEP THE PIGMENTS, ARE MORE LIKE MINI FOUNDATIONS BRUSHES.  I THINK I LOST MY MONEY, NOT WORTH IT. NOT EVEN FOR STARTERS.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okk the face brushes are pretty great but the angled brush wasn&#x27;t stiff enough for me. I like to be able to create a nice contour and these are too bendy for me. The eyeshadow brushes seem like they are made of plastic or something synthetic. Ughhh way too stiff!! They hurt my eyelids and if you swipe them too quick the brush poofs the powder all over your face. Still looking for a good set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked the make up brushes just fine.  They are very soft.  Are they too soft?  I don&#x27;t know, yet.  We&#x27;ll see. (Update: the face brushes are too soft.) I was using the round bristle brush for eyelashes, and it already - after one use! - is speparated from the wooden stick (but it has not fallen off). (Update:  it fell off!)  Oh, well.  So far they seem to be working OK. (only used several times and some are falling off) You get a lot of brushes for the money.  They aren&#x27;t brushes valued at $15 each, so for the money they are a great deal. (\\&quot;OK\\&quot; deal... the smaller brushes are great.)  The case is a pretty pink and holds all the brushes for travel purposes.  The snap seems as though it could be stronger, but so far no problems.  All in all, it seems a go for the money for the average make up wearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, the pink case does well in protecting the brushes and makes sure that the brushes stay in condition though it does look rather cheap looking. As for the brushes though i couldn&#x27;t be happier :) Very soft and easy to use. i took a risk on buying this because some other reviews were sketchy, but like i said i&#x27;m glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li> they lasted me a good while now im going to order another set in pink!!! its cute and fun and many brushes to use from</li>
            <li> At first the packaging did smell however I opened the package and left it out overnight. The brushes work really well and would highly recommend to other users. After washing the bristles a few came out but overall for the price definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush set about 4 years ago, when I first started wearing makeup. When I received the brushes, the powder brush had loose bristles and a few of the handles came off. However, with a few replacements and some hot glue, these brushes worked well as a starter kit for me. The quality is OK but the range of brushes allows for lots of experimentation. I&#x27;m getting new ones now but I recommend this set for a fairly short-term intro to beauty application!</li>
            <li> I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;They are exactly how I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome quality.&lt;br /&gt;They also work great, and are super cute!&lt;br /&gt;Got them pretty quick!</li>
            <li> Brushes are all the same..... thin, ugly. same as using a sponge brush...I can;t return because i use 2 already..&lt;br /&gt;spend  a little more $and get real make up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use my all brush elf. is better quality and i paid $1 in grocery store</li>
            <li> Its a good product...just i was looking for!!! I like it!!! No problems with it...You can trust in this brand!!!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes only bad thing is that the eye shadow brushes are the same just in different sizes. And the face brushes are small. I won&#x27;t be using them for powder to use all over my face. I&#x27;ll be using them to contour, blush and highlight. As for the bag. I really like it, it is on the cheap side not good quality  but its cute.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! Yes, the case does smell when you take it out of the packaging. Once you let it sit out, after about 15 minutes, the smell is 100% gone so don&#x27;t let that be the reason that you don&#x27;t order these. I am a Makeup Artist and these are great brushes. There were a few stray hairs on the larger brushes but nothing that can&#x27;t be plucked. The foundation brush in this set is worth MORE than the set itself which is amazing. All the brushes are great but I love the foundation brush and eyeshadow brushes. Great set for Makeup Artist and even beginners.</li>
            <li> Well i got this brushes in feb of this year and i like them but....... i hate the fact that there is no crease brush. all the smaller brushes are really not good the big fluffy ones like for powder blush and the foundation ones are t he only good ones so i only liked 4 out of the 15.... in all i guess they are ok for their price but i still had to go to the store to look for some brushes that actually worked</li>
            <li> Obviously not the most amazing brushes but do well for how much you pay for them. I would recommend them!</li>
            <li> Get product!!! Could not be any happier with the service and product I was given!! I would refer this product to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Save your money,  Bristles have been falling out from the moment I opened the package. better to  invest a little bit more in a product that will last longer like MAC brushes or BObbi Brown brushes. BObbi Brown brushes are amazing.. but this ones  naah... cheap and  a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> Shipping was all fine, however the brushes seem to be REALLY cheaply made. Good package, but not high quality. Dont really provide the service I was looking for. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It has a gift and my nniece loved it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, excellent time... the presentation is awesome. Brushes for real beginners :-) they are just what I expected, clearly if you&#x27;re looking for simple and nice brushes this is your option for a very good price!</li>
            <li> I have to say I was rather surprised when I received this item. It had so many good reviews, but when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled. They do the job, but seem very cheap. The metal part with the bristles is not attached to the stick, it fell off as i was opening them and sometimes falls off while I&#x27;m using them. ANNOYING. They are cute though, and the case they come in is adorable, I just don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it ... Sexy ,cute , like it ! U can buy it for anyone love one they will love it</li>
            <li> Ordered it for myself and loved it so much I ordered one for my sister&#x27;s birthday - she will love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give low ratings, but I was a bit disappointed.  You do get a lot of brushes, but the hairs on these brushes are not full at all. The photos make the brushes look a lot fuller than they actually are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the small brushes are somewhat redundant and too soft and wimpy for eye shadow use. So there lacks a compact &amp; dense short-haired eye powder brush in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Sonia Kashuk brushes I got many years ago from Target are of much better quality than this set. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. They don&#x27;t look like they would last, either.</li>
            <li> i love these brsuhes but sadly 2 of them broke but a little bit of hot glue or super glue fixed them. these brushes are pretty awesome for the price</li>
            <li> The brushes worked greatt... I love it because it sheds no hair n the hair is super soft.. Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> First of all, the case was ok. It is not a premium case, but it does the job and is also helpful to keep the brushed protected. For the brushes, they are fantastic. You still have to be careful with them so that the hais don&#x27;t fell off, just like with any other brushes and I suggest you to, as soon as you finish with them, put them back in the case. They are soft, wish is good cuz you don&#x27;t feel any scratch while applying make up and to me, that is a pro. I did not felt any smell in from the case, so that gives it another point in my scale. I gave it 5stars cuz I am not a Pro and they do the job :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty good. I used them for the first time yesterday.  They arrived on time. They did come with a weird smell almost like a factory smell but nothing major the smell went away. And it&#x27;s not an unbearable smell. All and I&#x27;ll I LOVE MY BRUSHES</li>
            <li> The brushes are great. The bristles are soft and I am able to get a professional looking finish easily. The only miniscule con is that after a few months of use, some of the black brush ends came loose from the pink handles. This did not affect the bristles, so I just glued them back in. I feel like i still got a great deal and plan to use these well into the future. I love the portable case, it keeps me organized and the brushes I want handy- no digging through a bag looking for a certain brush, plus it protects them from damages. I recommend this item overall.</li>
            <li> They was a very strange smell in these brushes and holder. Not sure what it was, but did not want the brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hark working with these, I really dont like to brisles. I will say I some brushes for concealer, applying highlight and glitter</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes in the mail and they are wonderful! So soft, not a hair out of place, and are really tightly packed, so it makes spreading the pigment around very easy. There was a strong smell as soon as I opened it, but after literally 2 minutes it was hardly there anymore. Great product!</li>
            <li> The packaging really stinks when they arrive so I was nervous to use them but after two days of keeping the holder out the smell went away.  The brushes are nice and use them every morning.</li>
            <li> this is a nice product..brushes are soft and the color is nice. I just received the package today, and when I opened it I was pretty much assaulted with this really horrible smell that immediately gave me a headache...it smelled like a combination of nail polish remover and something else that I can&#x27;t quite put my hand on...and some of the paint on one of the brushes was chipping off. Anyway, if not for the smell this probably would have gotten 4 or 5 stars</li>
            <li> Bristles were very soft, some were a bit too soft for what I would think would be the stiffer brushes.  Overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS ON MY 22 YR. OLD GRANDDAUGHTERS WISH LIST &amp; HAD BEEN ON THE LIST SINCE LAST YEAR. SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT,BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AS SHE REALLY NEEDED THE BRUSHES &amp; WAS DELIGHTED.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly nice for the price.  I read that some people said it has a strong smell but it was hardly noticeable to me and I didn&#x27;t find it offensive. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed like other cheaper brands. Better then the 32 piece m.a.s.h set I have. It has all I need for my smokey eye look. The eyeliner brushes are the best for thin lines and it has every size brush needed for applying blush and highlights my cheeks and the top with translucent powder. I love the color and magnetic snaps make it so easy to open and close. I definitely would recommend this to my friends and anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this brush set!  Brushes are of good quality, and I love the variety.  The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing is the case.....it sorta smells funny, but after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Ok, so these brushes are pretty good. They get the job done. I love the blush brushes and a few of the eye ones! Some of the eye brushes just don&#x27;t cut it though. I end up using my finger sometimes or other brushes to apply my shadow. I also love that they&#x27;re soft and super cute. (: other than that they are in good shape. Get Emmm!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set. The set includes all you need if you aren&#x27;t a makeup artist :). The brushes are soft and work well. I haven&#x27;t had any more hair than any other brush I&#x27;ve owned, even really expensive ones, fall out. So I&#x27;m satisfied with their usability and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little confused by another reviewers comments about too many lip brushes as this set only has one lip brush...at least mine did. The set includes:&lt;br /&gt;1 large powder brush&lt;br /&gt;1 medium powder brush&lt;br /&gt;1 angle powder brush&lt;br /&gt;1 foundation brush&lt;br /&gt;6 different sizes/styles of shadow brushes&lt;br /&gt;1 eyeliner brush&lt;br /&gt;1 lip brush&lt;br /&gt;1 small fan brush&lt;br /&gt;1 mascara/brow brush&lt;br /&gt;1 dual eyebrow/lash comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like the varied shadow brushes because I find the different sizes useful for variation in blending and I like to keep certain brushes with certain colors (no mixing and no washing to use with a different shade needed for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now---as for the smell all others are complaining about---YES, there is an odd chemical smell when you open the package. This seems to be from the case itself, not the brushes. Leaving it out and open to air out has helped alleviate that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is fine, nothing special but nothing horrible either. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more flimsy than any other brush case I&#x27;ve previously owned. I don&#x27;t need a hard case and I do like the ability to roll the brushes up for storage. For me it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> Looks just like it. Only bad thing is that it smells like paint. But other than that it is pretty.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes about a year ago when I was just beginning to get into serious make up. I&#x27;ll start off by saying, these are good brushes. The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, there is a lot of variety (although there could be less lip brushes and more eye brushes), and they last for the the price. I have had these since about June of 2012 and just now one of the heads of the brushes has fallen off (blush brush). I still use the brush, but just the head. I would say that these brushes are definitely great for beginners and for practicing, but now that I am moving on from what I believe to be the \\&quot;beginner state\\&quot;, I&#x27;m ready to try something more serious.</li>
            <li> This is my second set buying, because it works with my bare mineral powder make and the quality for price it’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an extra just to play with but shadows don&#x27;t really get on the brushes it more throws the shadow on the sides of the eyes!! Shader works great!!</li>
            <li> very nice brushes i carry them in my purse for my own use. pink case is nice as well. great for extra brushes</li>
            <li> So many brushes for a cheap price. The case does have a little bit of a weird smell when you first open it, but leaving it open to air out for a few days helps with the smell. I can barely smell it now. The brushes are soft and the variety is good, so I like this kit for travel.</li>
            <li> my sister says this is great and each brush is sold separately for about 8 bucks. so you will save a lot.</li>
            <li> They didnt last at all, and they break off the wooden sticks quite easily after 2-3 uses. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes !!!! They&#x27;re softer than any other make-up brush I&#x27;ve used. I used to wear make-up all the time and look cute and after I had my son, I went through kind of a lazy stage... not getting ready for the day, not caring. these makeup brushes make me want to get ready :) love love love them. I give them only 4 stars because when I was cleaning them for the first time, one of the foundation brushes fell off the wooden handle. I put it right back on and it hasn&#x27;t come off since..</li>
            <li> I am a model so I am huge on makeup, fashion, ect&lt;br /&gt;The brushes apply my makeup perfectly and they are very soft yet firm to the skin. No shedding. I literally use  to apply everything. Base, Blush, eye shadow, and even color to the lip.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes all of the different brushes and tools you would need to create a great makeup look is here and they work great!</li>
            <li> For the money this is a great buy. I read all the reviews before purchasing and was a little skepitcal but decided to take a chance. The smell was a little overwhelming when I received the brushes but just after a couple hours of having them out and cleaned these no plastic smell. It&#x27;s worth the time and purchase if you want a good variety of brushes for a good value.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes January 2nd pretty late at night and received them this morning, January 4th so the shipping was super fast. I love love love the case! It&#x27;s big enough to keep all your essential brushes but small enough to put in your purse and compact enough for traveling. The brushes themselves, although I have not used them yet, are super soft and don&#x27;t shed one hair and none of the metal things come unglued from the wooden handle so they&#x27;re very well made! The only bad thing about them, and I read most other people&#x27;s reviews as well that said the same thing, the case has a very distinct vinyl smell to it that&#x27;s really gross but I think it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s brand new, I&#x27;m assuming the smell will eventually go away. But other than that I love them and would definitely recommend getting them! (Even without using the brushes) I&#x27;m sure they work just fine as long as you&#x27;re not some super professional make up artist that wants really expensive brushes. These are perfect for beginners and are definitely a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I love it ! Thank you so much. This was actually my first time ordering, so I was worried how long it would take but everything went smoothly and fast. I&#x27;m really happy with my product even though it has a lil funky smell to it like what everyone said. But as a customer im still satisfied and recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s a beginner</li>
            <li> Being a person who use to use whatever brush came with the makeup palette, to a person who now buys pretty good brushes. I was very sceptical about buying these, because your brushes makes a big difference on how your makeup turns out! I must say, the reviews on these brushes are right. Bundle Monster didn&#x27;t disappointed, these are some pretty good brushes especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I like this set and the case it comes with for some things. Some of the brushes are better than others. The eyeshadow brushes do not pick up the eye makeup that easily, you have to push the brush down kind of hard to get it on the bristles. I hardly use theses brushes anymore, it&#x27;s just a hassle if you&#x27;re trying to do more complex eye makeup. Overall this is a nice set, but it is not a professional set for long term use.</li>
            <li> These brushes were very soft and would probably function well, but since one of the ones I wanted had the brush head fall off, back they went. I&#x27;d recommend avoiding them unless you can get them with free returns.</li>
            <li> they are really nice for everyday use ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no hair fall .. wash it without worry,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hair is soft and that depends on what you prefer .. but i compare it with what i used before it is less expensive and better or equal in quality</li>
