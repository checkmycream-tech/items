            <li>I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>So many brushes for good price</li>
            <li>The brush heads are shaped nicely, too--no errant hairs sticking up out of place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handles are nicely finished:</li>
            <li>each brush has its own compartment.  </li>
            <li>manufacturer sent me these in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say that these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;m a 47-year-old who has been looking for quality (at a good price) for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better brushes out there, certainly at much higher price points, but if you are looking for a great starter set to cover most applications then this seems a great way to start out.</li>

            <li>They are also very soft and the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As noted, the brushes in this set are made from synthetic material that can easily be washed with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Love it, haven&#x27;t washed them yet</li>
            <li>With these brushes, I now have that same porcelain look--the perfect finish--the smokey, well-blended eyes.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with these brushes.</li>
            <li>For the cost I think it&#x27;s an excellent set, especially for a starter set.</li>
            <li>So once you know which ones you use the most you can find them in EcoTools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>love the carry case, helps keep my brushes together on the go.</li>
            <li>The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions.</li>
            <li>I would say the quality is more than what you would expect in this price range.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great brushes ACEVIVI.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>mother works for Clinique and her favorite Clinique brushes</li>
            <li>I never had a set with so many brushes</li>
            <li>I never had a set with so many brushes</li>
            <li>brush handles are a nice light wood, and the bristles are synthetic.</li>
            <li>One of the eye-shadow brushes wood was just a slightly different finish/shade/grain of wood, otherwise they are all perfectly matched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the variety of brushes and they&#x27;re all attractive and professional looking.</li>
            <li>This 24 piece cosmetics application set from ACEVIVI is very good for the current sale price, and provides you with just about everything you might need in an affordable package.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a high quality, beautiful brush set!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are a very nice quality: So soft!</li>
            <li>they are absolutely amazing and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to spread on a desk and easy to wrap when you are done.  </li>
            <li>included case is a welcomed addition, allowing you to easily take the brushes with you in a protected fashion.  </li>
            <li>So, they are easy to grip and well-balanced.</li>
            <li>They bristles are synthetic and easy to wash.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is one of the best set of brushes I&#x27;ve bought and the price is outstanding, I was not expecting them to be this high quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>only issue we experienced with this set was a strong odor upon opening the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen such great quality brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It has a protective flap for the brushes and straps to secure it when rolled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In comparison to the brushes she likes, these are designed to fit your budget while providing the basics for almost any type of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free sample received  in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The case holds all the brushes securely and ties closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>for it.e with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive these brushes, they are soft, gorgeous and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Amazon listing also notes that the seller provides a very intriguing guarantee:</li>
            <li>Nice and quick when you are always ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But you better buy one for yourself first.....</li>
            <li>This set is perfect for both professional and personal use.</li>
            <li>There are 2 fan shaped blending brushes, face, 2 blush brushes, concealer brush (I like this one - use with some mineral powder to cover about any blemish quickly and well!),several eye shadow brushes- a Nice slant tip brush that draws a very straight line - I like to use those for applying shadow right at the lash line for a smoky look, about 3 lip brushes - one of them is just awesome, a liner brush that has a round tip and very few nice straight bristles, 2 sponge tipped applicators, a eyebrow comb/brush, and a wiretip brush that is good for separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This professional brush set is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This set does not have abbreviated handles--they are full length.</li>
            <li>I am impressed lately with all the varieties of plastic silicone.</li>
            <li>and I would like to take full advantage of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would like to take full advantage of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are cheaper than one MAC brush, or even some Ulta Professional brushes, but they&#x27;re pretty good for this price.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the case we did note a fairly strong odor, possibly from the lacquer coating protecting the brush handles or from the case itself, but that began to dissipate nicely after the case had been allowed to air out for a day or three.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing to come in mind is the huge number of brushes in this collection.</li>
            <li>After several days of use, she is very pleased with the set.</li>
            <li>You also receive a roll-up style carry case that highly resembles soft leather, but seems to be made from a synthetic material too (that&#x27;s good, as the makeup and moisture will not hurt the case).</li>
            <li>It is an affordable set that will not break your piggy bank, and is currently priced just right to get a five star rating based on its good price-to-sales ratio right now.</li>

            <li>These brush heads pick up powder easily, yet readily release it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Designed for the professional, these are easily stowed in the case, and securely tied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review.</li>
            <li>you are looking for an extensive set of budget-minded cosmetics applications items (mostly brushes for varying uses), for use as I have described above, then this affordable set from ACEVIVI should be able to handle most of your needs and I would recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This would make a really nice gift for any teen or lady that likes makeup.</li>
            <li>I have quite a large Sephora brush collection, but I was in need of some more face brushes in particular.</li>
            <li>Would make a very nice gift too, especially for a young lady just exploring cosmetic options and applications.</li>
            <li>Would make a very nice gift too, especially for a young lady just exploring cosmetic options and applications.</li>
            <li>This ensure you always have the right brush for the job.  </li>
            <li>People are right about the plastic smell but after washing and a couple of days it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Acevivi makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes that you always have the right brush for a specific need.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is that this is an large set of brushes that can actually be rolled up and carried in your luggage if you want to take with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Acevivi brushes for awhile now, and they are stellar in quality.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having second thoughts, these will not disappoint. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>overall okay profuct.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li>When I unrolled the case there were so many different brushes</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There’s no look you can’t accomplish with the large set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Each of the 24 makeup brushes has it&#x27;s own little holder.</li>
            <li>No chemical smell, and no broken bristles.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel compelled to remark on the case, as I really appreciate it:</li>
            <li>The all original handle gives it such a sleek look, and each brush has found it&#x27;s place in my collection.</li>
            <li>The case is supposed to be leather, but it looks more like the imitation leather to me and doesn&#x27;t have the leather smell</li>
            <li>found out recently that using professional brushes gives you that gorgeous makeup that you see on other women but can&#x27;t master</li>
            <li>Their shape helps promote a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>Seeing all those brushes, lined up in a nice looking sectioned envelope, well, I could hardly wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>Real wood coated in a nice, clear, thick lacquer.</li>
            <li>only criticism is a small one: I wish the set came with a little brochure to explain the best use for each brush, and any tips for using them.</li>
            <li>In natural bamboo handle brushes EcoTools is by far my favorite, but those brushes are more expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft yet durable and they do not shed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Each brush has a very nice quality, long wooden handle, and firmly affixed, soft synthetic hair bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed so easily as other cheap brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and the case they come in keeps them clean and protected so your brushes don&#x27;t get bent or broken while traveling.</li>
            <li>Also available in 32-pc Black.</li>
            <li>I can use them for big full face make-ups and for smaller detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is obvious that much attention was paid to the actual crimping and the amount of &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; used, as there are several brushes with unique shapes.</li>
            <li>Having the right selection of brushes makes a huge difference when applying makeup and it would be difficult not to find exactly what you are looking for in this</li>
            <li>Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and did my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The synthetic bristles are soft, hygienic, and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have used the powder brush and eye shadow blender brush</li>
            <li>even though these brushes have synthetic fiber bristles, they are soft on the face and they haven&#x27;t shed any since I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>I am amazed how soft and pliable it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are regular powder and blush brushes, eye shadow brushes, straight and angled brushes, lip brushes, a couple of fan brushes, even a mascara wand and an eyebrow/lash combo brush.</li>
            <li>The covers for the larger brush heads are sturdy enough to last quite a while; they are even strong enough to be</li>
            <li>Each brush is so different and unique, and extremely dense.</li>
            <li>This set is available in 24-pc Black, Apricot and Red.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically ever leave reviews, but these brushes are worth the money, I bought a set of professional make up brushes around Christmas time for 100$</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wooden handles have a clean, natural finish and black metal ferrules.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, professional quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This professional assortment has two dozen different brushes for applying everything from lipstick to eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>do shed a little as expected but not a lot like cheap brushes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> each brush has its own compartment.  </li>
            <li> manufacturer sent me these in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say that these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;m a 47-year-old who has been looking for quality (at a good price) for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are better brushes out there, certainly at much higher price points, but if you are looking for a great starter set to cover most applications then this seems a great way to start out.</li>

            <li> They are also very soft and the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As noted, the brushes in this set are made from synthetic material that can easily be washed with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> Love it, haven&#x27;t washed them yet</li>
            <li> With these brushes, I now have that same porcelain look--the perfect finish--the smokey, well-blended eyes.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes.</li>
            <li> For the cost I think it&#x27;s an excellent set, especially for a starter set.</li>
            <li> So once you know which ones you use the most you can find them in EcoTools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> love the carry case, helps keep my brushes together on the go.</li>
            <li> The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions.</li>
            <li> I would say the quality is more than what you would expect in this price range.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are okay.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great brushes ACEVIVI.</li>

            <li> I never had a set with so many brushes</li>
            <li> brush handles are a nice light wood, and the bristles are synthetic.</li>
            <li> One of the eye-shadow brushes wood was just a slightly different finish/shade/grain of wood, otherwise they are all perfectly matched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes and they&#x27;re all attractive and professional looking.</li>
            <li> This 24 piece cosmetics application set from ACEVIVI is very good for the current sale price, and provides you with just about everything you might need in an affordable package.</li>

            <li> Overall this is one of the best set of brushes I&#x27;ve bought and the price is outstanding, I was not expecting them to be this high quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> only issue we experienced with this set was a strong odor upon opening the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It has a protective flap for the brushes and straps to secure it when rolled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In comparison to the brushes she likes, these are designed to fit your budget while providing the basics for almost any type of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free sample received  in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The case holds all the brushes securely and ties closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> for it.e with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes, they are soft, gorgeous and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Amazon listing also notes that the seller provides a very intriguing guarantee:</li>
            <li> Nice and quick when you are always ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But you better buy one for yourself first.....</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for both professional and personal use.</li>
            <li> There are 2 fan shaped blending brushes, face, 2 blush brushes, concealer brush (I like this one - use with some mineral powder to cover about any blemish quickly and well!),several eye shadow brushes- a Nice slant tip brush that draws a very straight line - I like to use those for applying shadow right at the lash line for a smoky look, about 3 lip brushes - one of them is just awesome, a liner brush that has a round tip and very few nice straight bristles, 2 sponge tipped applicators, a eyebrow comb/brush, and a wiretip brush that is good for separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This professional brush set is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This set does not have abbreviated handles--they are full length.</li>
            <li> I am impressed lately with all the varieties of plastic silicone.</li>
            <li> and I would like to take full advantage of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would like to take full advantage of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than one MAC brush, or even some Ulta Professional brushes, but they&#x27;re pretty good for this price.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the case we did note a fairly strong odor, possibly from the lacquer coating protecting the brush handles or from the case itself, but that began to dissipate nicely after the case had been allowed to air out for a day or three.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing to come in mind is the huge number of brushes in this collection.</li>
            <li> After several days of use, she is very pleased with the set.</li>
            <li> You also receive a roll-up style carry case that highly resembles soft leather, but seems to be made from a synthetic material too (that&#x27;s good, as the makeup and moisture will not hurt the case).</li>
            <li> It is an affordable set that will not break your piggy bank, and is currently priced just right to get a five star rating based on its good price-to-sales ratio right now.</li>

            <li> These brush heads pick up powder easily, yet readily release it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Designed for the professional, these are easily stowed in the case, and securely tied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review.</li>
            <li> you are looking for an extensive set of budget-minded cosmetics applications items (mostly brushes for varying uses), for use as I have described above, then this affordable set from ACEVIVI should be able to handle most of your needs and I would recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This would make a really nice gift for any teen or lady that likes makeup.</li>
            <li> I have quite a large Sephora brush collection, but I was in need of some more face brushes in particular.</li>
            <li> Would make a very nice gift too, especially for a young lady just exploring cosmetic options and applications.</li>
            <li> Would make a very nice gift too, especially for a young lady just exploring cosmetic options and applications.</li>
            <li> This ensure you always have the right brush for the job.  </li>
            <li> People are right about the plastic smell but after washing and a couple of days it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Acevivi makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes that you always have the right brush for a specific need.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is that this is an large set of brushes that can actually be rolled up and carried in your luggage if you want to take with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Acevivi brushes for awhile now, and they are stellar in quality.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having second thoughts, these will not disappoint. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li> overall okay profuct.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li> When I unrolled the case there were so many different brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There’s no look you can’t accomplish with the large set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Each of the 24 makeup brushes has it&#x27;s own little holder.</li>
            <li> No chemical smell, and no broken bristles.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel compelled to remark on the case, as I really appreciate it:</li>
            <li> The all original handle gives it such a sleek look, and each brush has found it&#x27;s place in my collection.</li>
            <li> The case is supposed to be leather, but it looks more like the imitation leather to me and doesn&#x27;t have the leather smell</li>
            <li> found out recently that using professional brushes gives you that gorgeous makeup that you see on other women but can&#x27;t master</li>
            <li> Their shape helps promote a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> Seeing all those brushes, lined up in a nice looking sectioned envelope, well, I could hardly wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> Real wood coated in a nice, clear, thick lacquer.</li>
            <li> only criticism is a small one: I wish the set came with a little brochure to explain the best use for each brush, and any tips for using them.</li>
            <li> In natural bamboo handle brushes EcoTools is by far my favorite, but those brushes are more expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft yet durable and they do not shed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Each brush has a very nice quality, long wooden handle, and firmly affixed, soft synthetic hair bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed so easily as other cheap brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and the case they come in keeps them clean and protected so your brushes don&#x27;t get bent or broken while traveling.</li>
            <li> Also available in 32-pc Black.</li>
            <li> I can use them for big full face make-ups and for smaller detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is obvious that much attention was paid to the actual crimping and the amount of &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; used, as there are several brushes with unique shapes.</li>
            <li> Having the right selection of brushes makes a huge difference when applying makeup and it would be difficult not to find exactly what you are looking for in this</li>
            <li> Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient.</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and did my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The synthetic bristles are soft, hygienic, and cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have used the powder brush and eye shadow blender brush</li>
            <li> even though these brushes have synthetic fiber bristles, they are soft on the face and they haven&#x27;t shed any since I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how soft and pliable it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are regular powder and blush brushes, eye shadow brushes, straight and angled brushes, lip brushes, a couple of fan brushes, even a mascara wand and an eyebrow/lash combo brush.</li>
            <li> The covers for the larger brush heads are sturdy enough to last quite a while; they are even strong enough to be</li>
            <li> Each brush is so different and unique, and extremely dense.</li>
            <li> This set is available in 24-pc Black, Apricot and Red.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically ever leave reviews, but these brushes are worth the money, I bought a set of professional make up brushes around Christmas time for 100$</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wooden handles have a clean, natural finish and black metal ferrules.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, professional quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This professional assortment has two dozen different brushes for applying everything from lipstick to eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> do shed a little as expected but not a lot like cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes arrived individually incased in small plastic slips and the larger brushes came with reusable plastic covers to keep the bristles straight.</li>
            <li> After washing I rinse,  reshape the brush, then store upright or flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got natural wooden handles and synthetic bristles that can be washed and dried as brushes need to be cleaned often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as of the date that I wrote this review, this entire set can be had for less than the cost of one of her more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> long when unrolled.  </li>
            <li> It is made of heavy but soft synthetic leather with an embossed grain.  </li>
            <li> brushes are all well made, the bristles don’t shed, and they are long, well balanced and a pleasure to</li>
            <li> Lying wide open, the case measures 22.5” long.</li>
            <li> I feel they&#x27;re not full enough buy</li>
            <li> When closed, the case measures 6” x 9”.</li>
            <li> only negative about the set was very, very minor.  </li>
            <li> There’s also a large flap above the brushes that help the bristles from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> In terms of quality, I rate them as average.</li>
            <li> They are tapered down to a rounded bottom.</li>
            <li> There’s a flap that comes down that keeps them all in place.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The handles are apricot and the ferrule is black.</li>

            <li> They are anchored firmly in place by the well-manufactured metal crimp band.</li>
            <li> brush comes with a thin plastic sleeve, and the larger brush heads also come with a sturdy plastic open-at-the-top sliding sleeve.</li>
            <li> ...at least that&#x27;s how I felt.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve become addicted to contouring like I have, you&#x27;ll die for the contour brushes included in the set.</li>
            <li> , I may be wrong since I am not an expert on leather goods.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First thing to come in mind is the huge number of brushes in this collection. It includes a variety of brushes including a fan brush and those tiny brush for your eyelashes.  I love the way it is organized, using a roll/wrap pseudo-leather case that is super compact - excellent in portability.  Easy to spread on a desk and easy to wrap when you are done.  Nice and quick when you are always ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are of good quality and construction.  The bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed so easily as other cheap brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.</li>
            <li> SOME OF THE BRUSHES HAVE COME DETACHED FROM THE WOOD HANDLE</li>
            <li> Love it, haven&#x27;t washed them yet but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d flip over makeup brushes, but I have over these. they are absolutely amazing and fun to use. Trust me, get this set and you will flip too.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Acevivi brushes for awhile now, and they are stellar in quality.  This set is everything you&#x27;ll ever need in makeup brushes!  Designed for the professional, these are easily stowed in the case, and securely tied.  If you are looking for the kit that has &amp;#34;it all&amp;#34;, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out recently that using professional brushes gives you that gorgeous makeup that you see on other women but can&#x27;t master...at least that&#x27;s how I felt.

            <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes. I have quite a large Sephora brush collection, but I was in need of some more face brushes in particular. Each brush is so different and unique, and extremely dense. I&#x27;ve never seen such great quality brushes. No chemical smell, and no broken bristles. I&#x27;ve used these for about one weeks now and I&#x27;ve fallen in love!! The all original handle gives it such a sleek look, and each brush has found it&#x27;s place in my collection. If you&#x27;ve become addicted to contouring like I have, you&#x27;ll die for the contour brushes included in the set. Thank you so much for a high quality, beautiful brush set! If you&#x27;re having second thoughts, these will not disappoint. :)</li>
            <li> I am a brush hoarder and buy a lot of makeup brushes. For the cost I think it&#x27;s an excellent set, especially for a starter set. It&#x27;s got natural wooden handles and synthetic bristles that can be washed and dried as brushes need to be cleaned often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do shed a little as expected but not a lot like cheap brushes. They cover all types from eyeshadow to foundation to concealer and powder brushes. In terms of quality, I rate them as average. In natural bamboo handle brushes EcoTools is by far my favorite, but those brushes are more expensive. So once you know which ones you use the most you can find them in EcoTools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good set for a beginner or someone who is looking for a lot of brushes for a good price. They are cheaper than one MAC brush, or even some Ulta Professional brushes, but they&#x27;re pretty good for this price. So recommended, especially as a starter set.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I have had this set for a couple of months and I have yet to have a bristle fall out of a brush. I recommend this to my friends. It would make a great Christmas gift</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a7ee416655c54b944c7ca4990901a894]] This is a terrific set. I do children&#x27;s theater and have to use my own supplies for shows. This is a great set with nice variety of brushes. I can use them for big full face make-ups and for smaller detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the carry case, helps keep my brushes together on the go. I am delighted to add these to my theatre kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are care and cleaning instructions here with the product description, however, I would like to see something with the brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

            <li> For the money, this is a very nice set of brushes.  You definitely get the sense that you have something the pros use.  There are so many brushes that you always have the right brush for a specific need.  The wife loves these brushes. After several days of use, she is very pleased with the set. Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set contains brushes of a variety of sizes.  This ensure you always have the right brush for the job.  The brushes are well made. Build quality is solid.  I would say the quality is more than what you would expect in this price range.  I don&#x27;t get the sense that these brushes will wear out anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included case is a welcomed addition, allowing you to easily take the brushes with you in a protected fashion.  It looks like leather but it&#x27;s synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue we experienced with this set was a strong odor upon opening the package. It could have been the brush case or it could have been the environment within the product was packaged. In either case, this in no way affect the quality or use of the brushes.  Of note, we received a sample product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an impressive set of makeup brushes for the money. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughters have been trying to convert me from foam makeup applicators and powder puffs to makeup brushes for several years, and just recently I decided to give them a try. I have to admit that brushes make application easier and blending smoother, and that brushes last a lot longer too. It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Acevivi makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen! It contains 32 different types of brushes - everything from lipliner brushes to eyeshadow and powder brushes, two sponge applicators, and even a mascara brush and eyebrow/eyelash comb. Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient. Each brush has a very nice quality, long wooden handle, and firmly affixed, soft synthetic hair bristles. I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and did my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a vinyl roll-up case that keeps everything neat, protected and organized. It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer. I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, professional quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I just got the samples from ACEVIVI. The brushes came and they are so amazing. I was so excited to receive these brushes, they are soft, gorgeous and luxurious. I love the variety of brushes and they&#x27;re all attractive and professional looking. There is truly one for everything! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This professional brush set is truly amazing. There are 24 makeup brushes which will help you accomplish any look. This set is perfect for both professional and personal use. They will provide you with a flawless look. Each makeup brush is made with wooden handles. The handles are apricot and the ferrule is black. The bristles are synthetic hairs and have no animal hair at all. These brushes are cruelty free. The bristles are very soft yet durable and they do not shed. The brushes range from 7” to 8”. Lying wide open, the case measures 22.5” long. There are two ties at the end that you can use to roll up the case and tie together. When closed, the case measures 6” x 9”. There’s also a large flap above the brushes that help the bristles from getting dirty. There’s no look you can’t accomplish with the large set of brushes. I’m highly impressed with this stunning makeup brush set. This set is available in 24-pc Black, Apricot and Red. Also available in 32-pc Black. The 24-pc set includes: 2 Fan Brushes, Powder Brush, Angled Contour Brush, Blush Brush, Foundation Brush, Eyeliner Brush, Mascara Brush, and a series of Eye Brushes. Each brush comes wrapped in its individual cover and the larger brushes have a plastic protective cover. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This would make an exceptional gift for any woman! Achieve all your makeup looks with this amazing set.</li>
            <li> This professional assortment has two dozen different brushes for applying everything from lipstick to eyeshadow.  Having the right selection of brushes makes a huge difference when applying makeup and it would be difficult not to find exactly what you are looking for in this collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are plush, don&#x27;t shed, and wash well.  The synthetic bristles are soft, hygienic, and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wooden handles have a clean, natural finish and black metal ferrules.  Overall length varies from about 7 1/8 to  8 1/2 in.  Each brush is packaged in a plastic sleeve to protect the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case is about 22 in. long when unrolled.  It is made of heavy but soft synthetic leather with an embossed grain.  It has a protective flap for the brushes and straps to secure it when rolled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acevivi provided brushes for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Quality goes hand in hand with price.</li>
            <li> The case it comes in is sort of low quality. The brushes are okay. I feel they&#x27;re not full enough buy overall okay profuct. So many brushes for good price</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding and no eye irritation. I have very sensitive skin. People are right about the plastic smell but after washing and a couple of days it&#x27;s gone. The makeup distribution is even and don&#x27;t appear to hold extra product during application. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Sample product for impartial review courtesy of ACEVIVI.  I got these brushes about a week ago and they are amazing!  So far I have used the powder brush and eye shadow blender brush and they work great. They are also very soft and the quality is excellent.  Needless to say, I am extremely impressed.  Thanks for the great brushes ACEVIVI. :)</li>
            <li> This 24 piece cosmetics application set from ACEVIVI is very good for the current sale price, and provides you with just about everything you might need in an affordable package. The brushes in this set have synthetic bristles that seem well made and stay in place, and the handles are longer and shaped to do their best to help keep your hand from fatiguing quickly. If you are in the market for an affordable set like this, give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother works for Clinique and her favorite Clinique brushes cost $16 to $30 each... as of the date that I wrote this review, this entire set can be had for less than the cost of one of her more expensive brushes. In comparison to the brushes she likes, these are designed to fit your budget while providing the basics for almost any type of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted, the brushes in this set are made from synthetic material that can easily be washed with soap and warm water. You also receive a roll-up style carry case that highly resembles soft leather, but seems to be made from a synthetic material too (that&#x27;s good, as the makeup and moisture will not hurt the case). Upon opening the case we did note a fairly strong odor, possibly from the lacquer coating protecting the brush handles or from the case itself, but that began to dissipate nicely after the case had been allowed to air out for a day or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon listing also notes that the seller provides a very intriguing guarantee: \\&quot;We guarantee your 100% satisfaction! If you decide, for any reason, to return your order, you&#x27;ll be entitled to a prompt refund or exchange - whichever you prefer!\\&quot; That seems like an excellent commitment to customer satisfaction, and if an issue ever occurs with this set we will return to update the review to let you know what it was and how resolution was handled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is an large set of brushes that can actually be rolled up and carried in your luggage if you want to take with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.  It is an affordable set that will not break your piggy bank, and is currently priced just right to get a five star rating based on its good price-to-sales ratio right now. I did receive this set gratis from the seller and have put it to use objectively find out how well the brushes performed. My statements here reflect this testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an extensive set of budget-minded cosmetics applications items (mostly brushes for varying uses), for use as I have described above, then this affordable set from ACEVIVI should be able to handle most of your needs and I would recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better brushes out there, certainly at much higher price points, but if you are looking for a great starter set to cover most applications then this seems a great way to start out. Would make a very nice gift too, especially for a young lady just exploring cosmetic options and applications. This set seems to be a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.e with you on a trip, and the soft pouch does a good job of protecting the utensils inside.

            <li> I don&#x27;t typically ever leave reviews, but these brushes are worth the money, I bought a set of professional make up brushes around Christmas time for 100$ and they don&#x27;t even compare to these brushes, even though these brushes have synthetic fiber bristles, they are soft on the face and they haven&#x27;t shed any since I&#x27;ve used them. I apply make up at my work and this set of brushes is all I could ask for. They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and the case they come in keeps them clean and protected so your brushes don&#x27;t get bent or broken while traveling. All of the brushes arrived individually incased in small plastic slips and the larger brushes came with reusable plastic covers to keep the bristles straight. Overall this is one of the best set of brushes I&#x27;ve bought and the price is outstanding, I was not expecting them to be this high quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> When I unrolled this pouch of brushes, I actually squealed in delight. (Which makes me think this would make a great gift.) It surely made an impression on me! Seeing all those brushes, lined up in a nice looking sectioned envelope, well, I could hardly wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are made of synthetic &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34;. They are anchored firmly in place by the well-manufactured metal crimp band. It is obvious that much attention was paid to the actual crimping and the amount of &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; used, as there are several brushes with unique shapes. The brush heads are shaped nicely, too--no errant hairs sticking up out of place. The &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are a very nice quality: So soft! Yet sturdy, resilient, buoyant, and pliable--all at the same time. These brush heads pick up powder easily, yet readily release it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are nicely finished: Real wood coated in a nice, clear, thick lacquer. They are tapered down to a rounded bottom. This set does not have abbreviated handles--they are full length. So, they are easy to grip and well-balanced. Their shape helps promote a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush comes with a thin plastic sleeve, and the larger brush heads also come with a sturdy plastic open-at-the-top sliding sleeve. The covers for the larger brush heads are sturdy enough to last quite a while; they are even strong enough to be washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel compelled to remark on the case, as I really appreciate it: I am impressed lately with all the varieties of plastic silicone. This case has a leatherette look to it. I am amazed how soft and pliable it is. It is very pleasant to hold, feel and unroll--kind of an experience in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this is a quality set--especially for the price. Great value, I think! It really would make a wonderful, impressive gift.....But you better buy one for yourself first.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is a small one: I wish the set came with a little brochure to explain the best use for each brush, and any tips for using them. I never had a set with so many brushes and I would like to take full advantage of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from ACEVIVI.re to explain the best use for each brush, and any tips for using them.

            <li> Free sample received  in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed when I opened up this makeup brush set and saw the quality of these brushes! Each of the 24 makeup brushes has it&#x27;s own little holder. When I unrolled the case there were so many different brushes I didn&#x27;t know which one to choose first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are regular powder and blush brushes, eye shadow brushes, straight and angled brushes, lip brushes, a couple of fan brushes, even a mascara wand and an eyebrow/lash combo brush. This brush kit will meet all your makeup needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handles are a nice light wood, and the bristles are synthetic. These brushes are super soft! The case is supposed to be leather, but it looks more like the imitation leather to me and doesn&#x27;t have the leather smell, I may be wrong since I am not an expert on leather goods. The case holds all the brushes securely and ties closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning  is simple.,...I just wipe with a tissue after use. For a deeper cleaning I use baby shampoo.  After washing I rinse,  reshape the brush, then store upright or flat so they keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup brush kit is perfect for anyone that loves makeup, it would make a very nice gift!</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simply beautiful set of brushes.  The case is black PVC and each brush has its own compartment.  There’s a flap that comes down that keeps them all in place.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are great.  There are 2 fan shaped blending brushes, face, 2 blush brushes, concealer brush (I like this one - use with some mineral powder to cover about any blemish quickly and well!),several eye shadow brushes- a Nice slant tip brush that draws a very straight line - I like to use those for applying shadow right at the lash line for a smoky look, about 3 lip brushes - one of them is just awesome, a liner brush that has a round tip and very few nice straight bristles, 2 sponge tipped applicators, a eyebrow comb/brush, and a wiretip brush that is good for separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are all well made, the bristles don’t shed, and they are long, well balanced and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about the set was very, very minor.  One of the eye-shadow brushes wood was just a slightly different finish/shade/grain of wood, otherwise they are all perfectly matched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a great set.  They bristles are synthetic and easy to wash.  This would make a really nice gift for any teen or lady that likes makeup.</li>
