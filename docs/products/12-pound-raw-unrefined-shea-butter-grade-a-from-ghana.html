    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use this all the time and it  makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li>This is some GREAT stuff!</li>
            <li>but it turned out great!!!</li>
            <li>(LOL)</li>
            <li>and I know how great it is.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>I good moisturizer for skin, hair, deodorants.  </li>
            <li>and it ddnt stink which i loved</li>
            <li>I wish this had worked, because the shea butter itself is very creamy, smells earthy and has great reviews of being a wonderful moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I found it&#x27;s best to apply it before bed, so you can put a lot on, and by morning it&#x27;s all absorbed, and you don&#x27;t have to be all greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing for all skin types and doesnt clog pores .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t mind the fact that she needed to find her own container</li>
            <li>Ordering more (pounds) to confirm these good results.</li>
            <li>From what I understand/read shea butter will always be an effective moisturizer but the vitamins and everything fade over time.</li>
            <li>since i use it to make my own hair products...</li>
            <li>raw unrefined shea butter is the best shea butter i have ever used, i love it!!!</li>
            <li>I still give a high rating because the shea was just as wonderful a product as I keep hearing about.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very rich and creamy, which I liked.</li>
            <li>This product has turned out to be my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>and all it always comes out on top for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is better then anything you can get from the store.  </li>
            <li>It also gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is better at sealing moisture better than any product on the market I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love amazon and their customer service.</li>
            <li>This was actually pretty good</li>
            <li>Also they ship very quickly. :)</li>
            <li>She was happy to recieve a larger quantity of butter, so she could use it more liberally.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, melted well, and is supremely soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is not Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I suggest using this product at night right after your shower.</li>
            <li>The smell is not really super pleasant.</li>
            <li>Also, shea butter is FAR SUPERIOR to cocoa butter in every category except for the scent (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I ordered this shea butter while I was deployed to the Middle East (HOT) and, of course, it exploded and leaked all in the package.</li>
            <li>First the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I moisturize with a water-based product (or even water) first then melt the sheal butter and use it as a sealant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I were more familiar with other sources of shea butter, but I am not.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to be pulling bugs out of my hot melted shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I have never felt so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Shea butter and after much research on the product itself I ordered.  </li>
            <li>but not so much for your nose.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>It gives so much moisture and definition to my hair.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my eczema and it really helps.</li>
            <li>but i still need the real shea butter</li>
            <li>Most products \\&quot;containing shea\\&quot; have only a tiny bit of shea in it - this is the REAL DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use it in the winter and cooler months.</li>
            <li>Very rich and blended well with my other oils!</li>
            <li>I used two other shea butters since and haven&#x27;t noticed as effective \\&quot;fade treatment.\\&quot; The others being the yellow tub often sold in beauty stores and a kinda old one my roomie gave me.</li>
            <li>It melted down to be molded easily and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>However it dissipates over night and you are left with only a light hint of old nuts on your skin</li>
            <li>Just try small samples on your skin over a period of time before committing to more of any product than you can use if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get grossed out too easily, but seeing dead flying insects that I&#x27;ve never seen before</li>
            <li>I use it for my natural hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have nut allergies, yet my skin is sensitive and some things break me out in an itchy rash.  </li>
            <li>My experience so far can&#x27;t dispute.</li>
            <li>because this is super raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ignorant me tried to moisturize my natural hair with just shea butter and that was a big mistake.</li>
            <li>Similar to old cooking grease.  </li>
            <li>I whipped this butter into a blend with organic extra virgin coconut oil, essential oils and extra virgin olive oil (not purchase from this site) and it whipped up into a light fluffy butter.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter was a deep yellow and smelled old when unwrapped.  </li>
            <li>I informed Amazon of this upon receipt and they immediately shipped me a new one with minimal questions.</li>

            <li> She had previously purchased a tiny pot of Shea Butter from the store at a high price.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are like me and have extremely sensitive skin that has been irritated in the past from new things you put on, then buy a small amount first and try it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this seller sent a bag full of ants, I could not even open the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> My normally dry flaky skin problem was solved in 3 days. .</li>
            <li> Takes away dry skin, even on the feet.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews where some ladies put this in their hair and it did wonders, so i tried the same and it took me several days to get it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> the fact that the product is a deep yellow shows that it has been heavily dyed.</li>
            <li> Good to use as a base to mix with other oils, or use it by itself.</li>
            <li> I use it plain at night before bed and it hydrates my skin like NO other product on the market</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Black Soap, daily.</li>
            <li> Which made it a bit hard to get the butter completely out.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered I was afraid because the shea butter was yellow,</li>
            <li> and I mix it with other oils (olive oil, jojoba oil, etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally I use this shea butter on my face after my nightly cleansing routine and this does not clog my pores or give me zits like other oils do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pure at all!</li>
            <li> My hair felt baby-soft initially, but became a crunchy mess within a few minutes!</li>
            <li> So overall, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Or use it plain on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this is raw you may find shells in your butter. . .</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if it came in a small plastic tub</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this, as I&#x27;ve used Shea butter in the past</li>
            <li> It took only a couple of days using this on my skin to make me break out in a rash and itch horribly.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this online...</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin protected from the cold and winds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product, but my skin did.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was TERRIBLE, I wish there was a way to give no stars...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels amazing. I have been using this in combination with the Salux Bath Towel (you can it find on Amazon) I have never felt so clean and soft! I whipped this butter into a blend with organic extra virgin coconut oil, essential oils and extra virgin olive oil (not purchase from this site) and it whipped up into a light fluffy butter. My normally dry flaky skin problem was solved in 3 days. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in a double plastic baggie. . . Which made it a bit hard to get the butter completely out. The seller may have stated this. . . but I do not recall. It would be helpful if it came in a small plastic tub instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell. . . because this is super raw shea butter. The smell is not really super pleasant. However it dissipates over night and you are left with only a light hint of old nuts on your skin (LOL) You will need a lot of essential oil to drown it out but the shea smell will still linger. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is raw you may find shells in your butter. . . So do not just rub it on your skin without filtering those out or you may scratch yourself like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Great for your skin. . . but not so much for your nose. Definitely worth the purchase. Next time I may get the refined just so I do not have to deal with the smell though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is not Shea butter. I was expecting the white butter and when I received it, it was yellow. I was very disappointed. I decided to use it anyway though, because I heard that even though it&#x27;s not shea butter it still has benefits. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s very moisturizing and I haven&#x27;t seen any benefits yet. So overall, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this, as I&#x27;ve used Shea butter in the past and I know how great it is. Unfortunately this seller sent a bag full of ants, I could not even open the plastic bag. I hope I&#x27;ll  get a refund</li>
            <li> Purchased this Shea Butter for my Grandmother.  She had previously purchased a tiny pot of Shea Butter from the store at a high price.  She was happy to recieve a larger quantity of butter, so she could use it more liberally.  Didn&#x27;t mind the fact that she needed to find her own container, she has plenty of those lying around!</li>
            <li> This product has turned out to be my favorite ever. I use it for my natural hair and I mix it with other oils (olive oil, jojoba oil, etc.) It gives so much moisture and definition to my hair. The first time I ordered I was afraid because the shea butter was yellow, but after trying others brands white shea butter and all it always comes out on top for my hair. Also they ship very quickly. :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Shea butter and after much research on the product itself I ordered.  The shipment was on time, big plus.  It took only a couple of days using this on my skin to make me break out in a rash and itch horribly.  I don&#x27;t have nut allergies, yet my skin is sensitive and some things break me out in an itchy rash.  So, if you are like me and have extremely sensitive skin that has been irritated in the past from new things you put on, then buy a small amount first and try it.  The product itself is very rich and creamy, which I liked. I read a few reviews where some ladies put this in their hair and it did wonders, so i tried the same and it took me several days to get it out of my hair. I don&#x27;t hate this product, but my skin did.  I wish this had worked, because the shea butter itself is very creamy, smells earthy and has great reviews of being a wonderful moisturizer.  Just try small samples on your skin over a period of time before committing to more of any product than you can use if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is better then anything you can get from the store.  I use this all the time and it  makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a very long way! It keeps my skin protected from the cold and winds. I don&#x27;t have to worry about being ashy later in the day. I am moisturized all day. My skin tone has evened out since using this product as well. I suggest using this product at night right after your shower. I use this in combination with Black Soap, daily.</li>
            <li> This is some GREAT stuff! I use it in my hair and on my body. I also use it on my eczema and it really helps. Takes away dry skin, even on the feet. It also gives my skin a healthy glow. I mainly use it in the winter and cooler months.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I needed it for bath melts that I made as a Christmas present. It melted down to be molded easily and was just what I needed. I have been using the leftover as a lotion. It makes my hands nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> raw unrefined shea butter is the best shea butter i have ever used, i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I good moisturizer for skin, hair, deodorants.  Good to use as a base to mix with other oils, or use it by itself.</li>
            <li> I use it for some sort of eczema on my feet.  Nothing has helped me like this Shea Butter.  My skin literally transformed when I started using it. I found it&#x27;s best to apply it before bed, so you can put a lot on, and by morning it&#x27;s all absorbed, and you don&#x27;t have to be all greasy.</li>
            <li> This was actually pretty good and it ddnt stink which i loved but i still need the real shea butter this stuff works but it is not unrefined from ghana</li>
            <li> Ordering more (pounds) to confirm these good results. I used two other shea butters since and haven&#x27;t noticed as effective \\&quot;fade treatment.\\&quot; The others being the yellow tub often sold in beauty stores and a kinda old one my roomie gave me. From what I understand/read shea butter will always be an effective moisturizer but the vitamins and everything fade over time. My experience so far can&#x27;t dispute.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is better at sealing moisture better than any product on the market I&#x27;ve used. Most products \\&quot;containing shea\\&quot; have only a tiny bit of shea in it - this is the REAL DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this when I get out of the shower on moist skin, and this keeps me moisturized and un-ashy all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally I use this shea butter on my face after my nightly cleansing routine and this does not clog my pores or give me zits like other oils do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignorant me tried to moisturize my natural hair with just shea butter and that was a big mistake. My hair felt baby-soft initially, but became a crunchy mess within a few minutes! Oils do not moisturize, they seal in moisture. (Lesson learned)Since this experience, I moisturize with a water-based product (or even water) first then melt the sheal butter and use it as a sealant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of websites that tell you the benefits of shea butter - read up! Also, shea butter is FAR SUPERIOR to cocoa butter in every category except for the scent (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I ordered this shea butter while I was deployed to the Middle East (HOT) and, of course, it exploded and leaked all in the package. I informed Amazon of this upon receipt and they immediately shipped me a new one with minimal questions. I love amazon and their customer service.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this online...since i use it to make my own hair products...but it turned out great!!! Very rich and blended well with my other oils! I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was a deep yellow and smelled old when unwrapped.  Similar to old cooking grease.  I order the same product elsewhere and it was a creamy white and didn&#x27;t have the smell.  I won&#x27;t be ordering from this source again.</li>
            <li> Great value. Make all kinds of beauty products.  Or use it plain on the skin. Its amazing for all skin types and doesnt clog pores . I use it plain at night before bed and it hydrates my skin like NO other product on the market</li>
            <li> This was TERRIBLE, I wish there was a way to give no stars...It smells there and the fact that the product is a deep yellow shows that it has been heavily dyed. No pure at all!</li>
            <li> My rating would probably be quite different (5 stars or 1 star) if I were more familiar with other sources of shea butter, but I am not.  I used this shea in some lotion bars and chapstick that I made for Christmas gifts.  It worked great, melted well, and is supremely soft and smooth.  However, since it&#x27;s unrefined (I&#x27;m assuming), there were bugs in the product.  I don&#x27;t get grossed out too easily, but seeing dead flying insects that I&#x27;ve never seen before (they looked like a type of mosquito?) was disconcerting.  I know it&#x27;s unrefined, so I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t get filtered at all, but still.  I didn&#x27;t expect to be pulling bugs out of my hot melted shea butter.  I still give a high rating because the shea was just as wonderful a product as I keep hearing about.</li>
