            <li>Perfect texture.</li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>i got the product in about two weeks, which was very pleasant surprise to see it in my mailbox so soon.</li>
            <li>This is a cosmetically beautiful sunscreen- truly invisible, lightweight, and matte.</li>
            <li>(plus it has a very lovely citrus scent!)</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, and fades as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Marvelous product and even more marvelous seller.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>The shipment was also fast and pleasant, there was also a candy included which was awesome of the seller!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>so your skin feels amazing after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I really liked this sunscreen because it sets in nicely and everything.</li>
            <li>Compared to sunscreens easily found in the US, this is amazing!</li>
            <li>Goes on beautifully and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited and happy</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and can say this is the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and silky.</li>
            <li>Best facial sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you SHAKE IT</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I LOVE It.</li>
            <li>Light smell goes on smooth and good under make up.</li>
            <li>However, I think the Biore Sarasara SPF50 PA++++ is a much better product.</li>
            <li>Super lightweight and super effective!</li>
            <li>the product is super nice.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, this would probably be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Wow, this sunblock is great.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant fresh scent (though I know this is subjective) - it smells clean and light to me.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and dries matte.</li>
            <li>I will easily use this container in a month.  </li>
            <li>i doubt i&#x27;ll run out of it soon, because it&#x27;s so milky and easy to spread around.</li>
            <li>goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and feels like wearing nothing at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and even with having to put on the obligatory 1/4 teaspoon for adequate protection</li>
            <li>It smells just fine and is easy to carry around (even in my pocket).</li>
            <li>I like how smooth and milky the texture is and how easy it is to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>but it really works amazingly</li>
            <li>Combined with my Aquamoist facewash and toner, this sunscreen always applies lightly and never clogs my pores.</li>
            <li>It is SO light, I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face at all.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>However, I think this sunscreen is still better than most, and it would probably be my second favorite.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get great of dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>No new blemishes which is great.</li>
            <li>No weird smell, no white cast, applies super nicely (has a nice silky feil to it) and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>Nice seller and pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Finally, after lots of research it appears that Korean/Japanese sunscreen care is more advanced than most US based products.  </li>
            <li>Feels good especially in my t-zone because it seems to reduce my T-Zone oil.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this website with more in depth information (including list of ingredients) on this product if anyone wants to check it out&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like silk in your hands and absorbs so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel ultra soft, not greasy like many sunscreens can feel.  </li>
            <li>Even my bf is willing to use this which is very good since he hates to wear sunscreen because of previous sticky experiences.</li>
            <li>But, the great parts are: no white cast, no eye stinging, pleasant and not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>It is very liquidy and light.</li>
            <li>It is an opaque fluid liquid which is very easy to massage on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and high SPF.</li>
            <li>Compared to other Japanese sunscreens, it&#x27;s good, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was previously using Neutrogena&#x27;s Pure and Free Liquid Sunscreen but this has officially become my favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it rinses off easily if you get it wet, which is great for washing it off, but not so much if you&#x27;re at the beach or pool.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good sunscreen, the only criticism that I would have is that it somewhat drying, but this can easily be fixed by Cerave Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Really fast, just take one week from Japan!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many American brands and none of them hold a candle to Senka&#x27;s coverage, effectiveness, and price.  </li>
            <li>Best of all this sunscreen DOES NOT clog my pores or leave a weird layer on product on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought my first ones while I was in Japan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched over to Japanese made sunscreens as they have better ingredients than what US suppliers have.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>I love it, no white cast, no smell..</li>
            <li>a PA+++ rating.&lt;br /&gt;-NO white cast I get from most zinc oxide sunscreens</li>
            <li>The finish goes on pretty greasy</li>
            <li>As long as  you let it dry there shouldn&#x27;t be any interference with your makeup, I wear both foundation and BB cream both of which sit on on top of this nicely.</li>
            <li>you want a sunscreen that is light but offers a high SPF</li>
            <li>Smells like pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I discovered this product from /r/skincareaddiction and there are many other positive experiences on this product.</li>
            <li>l thought I couldn&#x27;t wear any chemical-based sunscreens because they make my face sting too much.</li>
            <li>This is going to make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>cause it really helps the skin.</li>
            <li>It feels really smooth, almost like a powder finish (but not actually powder).</li>
            <li>You have to shake it up very well before applying.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use much of it in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, as it spreads very evenly.  </li>
            <li>It wears very well over my moisturizer and under any makeup I put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I definitely LOVE this sunscreen, it makes my skin happy, while American sunscreens made it angry</li>
            <li>Smooth on the skin with no left residue!</li>
            <li>goes nice on my body but made my face feeling greasy after few hours apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on light (which is probably why they call it a mineral water UV Gel) and it works perfectly under makeup as it evens out my skin providing a base layer.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is amazing because it does not leave me teary, it is also very liquidy and small</li>
            <li>I chose this one because alcohol was the 5th ingredient instead of the 2nd or 3rd, like most sunscreens sold on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen unless I&#x27;m going to the beach because with the heat and humidity over here it would feel like wearing a mask that makes you even hotter.</li>
            <li>Plus, most sunscreens are so heavy that they clog my pores and cause break outs.</li>
            <li>It  soaks in easily and there is not white sheen left on the skin.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, this is a fantastic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And every single one is gritty in my skin and leaves it feeling like I stuck my head over a grease fryer after a while.i have dry combo skin and have been looking for a great lite facial sunscreen forever.</li>
            <li>makes my skin very soft, too.</li>
            <li>It dries velvety and  feels very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>All I can say is: WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is by far the lightest among the others i&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>As far as sun protection goes I haven&#x27;t had any burns while using it even though I&#x27;m on RetinA.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got any sunburn from several hiking events,  highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It does not leave a white cast behind and it goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>Even though the shipping is long, both times I&#x27;ve ordered the sender  sends a lovely personal note and even a little gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try Asian sunscreens, because a LOT of them are filled with alcohol, and I try to avoid putting alcohol on my face because it can be very drying and irritating.</li>
            <li>The Biore feels much lighter and sinks in faster.</li>

            <li> As long as you use this daily, it probably won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> The alcohol in this product has aged my face 5 years in only 5 months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Not irritating in the least bit, although the smell might lead you to believe otherwise.</li>
            <li> I am never, EVER, going back to traditional heavy western sunscreen after this.</li>
            <li> for 40 milliliters is not much, if I use 1/4 tsp every day, this bottle only lasts 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Japanese sunscreens and this is my favourite-</li>
            <li> it might dry you out depending on your skin</li>
            <li> but if you wait 5 minutes it will dry to a matte finish.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the package were larger and not quite so small.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll start wearing a little extra moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but goes a long way (mine lasted about 5 months with daily application).  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal but wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> With traditional US sunscreens they are rather thick and take some time to blend in and dry on your face, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> Please note as with other chemical sunscreens, you need to apply it 20 minutes before exposure.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin, so the initial powdery finish eventually ends up feeling a little heavy.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy and is a nice base to protect your skin before you put on makeup.  </li>
            <li> Goes on a little greasy but sinks in to the skin well.</li>
            <li> It might be slightly drying, however.</li>
            <li> product is a little pricey, and contains talc.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, it appears to work.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells heavily of alcohol but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin.</li>
            <li> A Plus, a UVA blocker not available in</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight sticky/greasy feeling when I apply the recommended 1/4tsp, though when applied thickly it still absorbs well.</li>
            <li> The downside is there is that the bottle is small and it is fragranced.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with awful white pasty mineral sunscreens my whole life.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a little bit too thin.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate when your face feels greasy and slimy, then I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> It has a VERY matte finish and a silicone base texture</li>
            <li> It is a tad bit expensive for the size</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kinda small  and contains alcohol!!!!</li>

            <li> Goes on easily and dries matte. The downside is there is that the bottle is small and it is fragranced.</li>
            <li> Tiny ass bottle but the product is super nice.</li>
            <li> l thought I couldn&#x27;t wear any chemical-based sunscreens because they make my face sting too much. I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with awful white pasty mineral sunscreens my whole life. Someone suggested I try out a sunscreen without Avobenzone, so I tried this one. All I can say is: WOW! It doesn&#x27;t sting! Amazing! Also they are not kidding about the no white cast. There is NO WHITE CAST. This is a cosmetically beautiful sunscreen- truly invisible, lightweight, and matte. It might be slightly drying, however. I think I&#x27;ll start wearing a little extra moisturizer with it. But other than that, this is a fantastic sunscreen. I&#x27;m so excited and happy I bought it! This is going to make my life so much easier. (Shout out to /r/skincareaddiction for the recommendation!)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen which can protect against UVB &amp; UVA. Finally, after lots of research it appears that Korean/Japanese sunscreen care is more advanced than most US based products.  It provides both physical and chemical protection against sun damage.  My only wish is that the package were larger and not quite so small. I will easily use this container in a month.  It is an opaque fluid liquid which is very easy to massage on the skin. It  soaks in easily and there is not white sheen left on the skin.  After a few uses, it appears to work. No new blemishes which is great. Even my bf is willing to use this which is very good since he hates to wear sunscreen because of previous sticky experiences.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. It&#x27;s not greasy or stinky, and protects my lily-white skin from igniting in the Caribbean sun. The only drawback is that it rinses off easily if you get it wet, which is great for washing it off, but not so much if you&#x27;re at the beach or pool. Just remember to reapply often, which you should probably be doing anyway if you&#x27;re as white as Casper, like I am.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Really fast, just take one week from Japan! But it&#x27;s a little bit too thin. Still I wil buy it again cause it really helps the skin.</li>
            <li> It is very liquidy and light. It smells just fine and is easy to carry around (even in my pocket).</li>
            <li> yoooo this was great! i got the product in about two weeks, which was very pleasant surprise to see it in my mailbox so soon. i also got two bottles! i doubt i&#x27;ll run out of it soon, because it&#x27;s so milky and easy to spread around. makes my skin very soft, too.</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully and absorbs really quickly. It feels really smooth, almost like a powder finish (but not actually powder). If you are like me and hate when your face feels greasy and slimy, then I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight sticky/greasy feeling when I apply the recommended 1/4tsp, though when applied thickly it still absorbs well. But, the great parts are: no white cast, no eye stinging, pleasant and not overwhelming scent. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little greasy but sinks in to the skin well. You have to shake it up very well before applying. As far as sun protection goes I haven&#x27;t had any burns while using it even though I&#x27;m on RetinA. It does not seem to flare my skin up either.</li>
            <li> Not recommended.  Smells like pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and can say this is the best sunscreen I have ever used. Normally I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen unless I&#x27;m going to the beach because with the heat and humidity over here it would feel like wearing a mask that makes you even hotter. Plus, most sunscreens are so heavy that they clog my pores and cause break outs. This is the opposite, It leaves my oily skin matte and silky feeling but still keeps me protected from the blazing Caribbean sun without a problem. It is a tad bit expensive for the size but it really works amazingly and I only use on my face so it should last a month or two.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My #1 criteria for sunscreens is that they should not be greasy. This one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for a year now and just ordered my second bottle! Combined with my Aquamoist facewash and toner, this sunscreen always applies lightly and never clogs my pores. (plus it has a very lovely citrus scent!) I&#x27;ve even started my fiancee on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marvelous product and even more marvelous seller. Even though the shipping is long, both times I&#x27;ve ordered the sender  sends a lovely personal note and even a little gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again and again!!</li>
            <li> Super lightweight and super effective! I wear this every day over CeraVe moisturizer - no clumping! Not irritating in the least bit, although the smell might lead you to believe otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have never used such a mattifying sunscreen. This sunscreen is amazing because it does not leave me teary, it is also very liquidy and small so it fits well into any backpack or purse. You do not need to use much of it in order for it to work. I discovered this product from /r/skincareaddiction and there are many other positive experiences on this product. The shipment was also fast and pleasant, there was also a candy included which was awesome of the seller! Definite props.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good sunscreen, the only criticism that I would have is that it somewhat drying, but this can easily be fixed by Cerave Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product 9/10.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve used many American brands and none of them hold a candle to Senka&#x27;s coverage, effectiveness, and price.  It&#x27;s a small bottle but goes a long way (mine lasted about 5 months with daily application).  You don&#x27;t need to use much, as it spreads very evenly.  It&#x27;s like silk in your hands and absorbs so quickly.  It definitely does not feel like I&#x27;m wearing sunblock.  It also has a pleasant fresh scent (though I know this is subjective) - it smells clean and light to me. Note: Make sure you SHAKE IT (there is a ball in there so you know if it&#x27;s mixing), as ANY product will settle if you let it sit.  This may be a reason for one reviewer&#x27;s &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; experience.  It does not feel heavy and is a nice base to protect your skin before you put on makeup.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am in love with this sunscreen! It goes on light (which is probably why they call it a mineral water UV Gel) and it works perfectly under makeup as it evens out my skin providing a base layer. Best of all this sunscreen DOES NOT clog my pores or leave a weird layer on product on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a sunscreen that is light but offers a high SPF this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> very good product! will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Bought my first ones while I was in Japan. Feels good especially in my t-zone because it seems to reduce my T-Zone oil.</li>
            <li> Ladies, beware!  The alcohol in this product has aged my face 5 years in only 5 months of daily use.  Please, find another sunscreen before your face starts to look like a smoker&#x27;s (one who never \\&quot;smoked\\&quot; till using this sunscreen).</li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells heavily of alcohol but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin. It has a VERY matte finish and a silicone base texture so your skin feels amazing after you put it on.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. I&#x27;ve since switched over to Japanese made sunscreens as they have better ingredients than what US suppliers have. I like how smooth and milky the texture is and how easy it is to apply to my face. With traditional US sunscreens they are rather thick and take some time to blend in and dry on your face, but not with this one. It also leaves my face feeling moisturized with the added bonus of feeling lightweight on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback with this product is how small the package is and how fast you can go through a bottle. Not a huge deal but wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> I LOVE It. It is light weight and high SPF. Happy Customer! Fast shipping ! Everything is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not break me out, is lightweight, and has almost no fragrance.  It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel ultra soft, not greasy like many sunscreens can feel.  The two downsides: product is a little pricey, and contains talc.  I will probably try a different product, but would consider buying this again.</li>
            <li> I am never, EVER, going back to traditional heavy western sunscreen after this. It is SO light, I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face at all. The smell is very nice, and fades as soon as you put it on. It wears very well over my moisturizer and under any makeup I put on.</li>
            <li> I love it, no white cast, no smell..but it&#x27;s kinda small  and contains alcohol!!!! that&#x27;s a big minus.&lt;br /&gt;shipping took 31 days to Europe.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try Asian sunscreens, because a LOT of them are filled with alcohol, and I try to avoid putting alcohol on my face because it can be very drying and irritating. I chose this one because alcohol was the 5th ingredient instead of the 2nd or 3rd, like most sunscreens sold on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-avobenzone-free&lt;br /&gt;-contains zinc oxide&lt;br /&gt;-has a PA+++ rating.&lt;br /&gt;-NO white cast I get from most zinc oxide sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;-non-greasy finish&lt;br /&gt;-Contains Uvinal A Plus, a UVA blocker not available in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-$8 for 40 milliliters is not much, if I use 1/4 tsp every day, this bottle only lasts 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;-No expiration date!!! As long as you use this daily, it probably won&#x27;t be a problem. But I like comfort in knowing that my sunscreen isn&#x27;t expired, and this doesn&#x27;t give me that. Theres also no way to look up the expiration date online... if someone knows a way please tell me!&lt;br /&gt;-If you don&#x27;t use enough moisturizer underneath this it might dry you out depending on your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;-If it gets in your eyes, you&#x27;re screwed, so apply carefully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely LOVE this sunscreen, it makes my skin happy, while American sunscreens made it angry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this website with more in depth information (including list of ingredients) on this product if anyone wants to check it out&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/shiseido-senka-mineral-water-uv-gel/</li>
            <li> Wow, this sunblock is great. It&#x27;s very light and silky. I have tried Vichy, Anthielos, neutrogenia etc.. And every single one is gritty in my skin and leaves it feeling like I stuck my head over a grease fryer after a while.i have dry combo skin and have been looking for a great lite facial sunscreen forever. It goes on very smooth and even with having to put on the obligatory 1/4 teaspoon for adequate protection it doesn&#x27;t get great of dry out my skin.  It dries velvety and  feels very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to sunscreens easily found in the US, this is amazing! Lightweight, and not greasy, smelly, or chalky. Compared to other Japanese sunscreens, it&#x27;s good, but not my favorite. I have somewhat oily skin, so the initial powdery finish eventually ends up feeling a little heavy. If you have dry skin, this would probably be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> It is a great product! Smooth on the skin with no left residue!</li>
            <li> a bit oily and smells like there is a lot alcohol in it. goes nice on my body but made my face feeling greasy after few hours apply.Nice seller and pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome! It does not leave a white cast behind and it goes on super smooth. I was previously using Neutrogena&#x27;s Pure and Free Liquid Sunscreen but this has officially become my favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Perfect texture. Light. Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. Isn&#x27;t oily at all</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is by far the lightest among the others i&#x27;ve used! Leave no white cast and not sticky. Light smell goes on smooth and good under make up. Haven&#x27;t got any sunburn from several hiking events,  highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from seeing all the rave about it. I really liked this sunscreen because it sets in nicely and everything. However, I think the Biore Sarasara SPF50 PA++++ is a much better product. The Biore feels much lighter and sinks in faster. However, I think this sunscreen is still better than most, and it would probably be my second favorite.</li>
            <li> We have some English packaging here and it is marketed as water resistant. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Japanese sunscreens and this is my favourite- goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and feels like wearing nothing at all. Please note as with other chemical sunscreens, you need to apply it 20 minutes before exposure. Here&#x27;s the difference between physical and chemical sunscreens http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/physical-vs-chemical-sunscreen.html#.VS9Q7ZSUeMU</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and out of all of the sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (Biore, LaRoche Posay, Elta MD) this one has yet to break me out. The finish goes on pretty greasy but if you wait 5 minutes it will dry to a matte finish. As long as  you let it dry there shouldn&#x27;t be any interference with your makeup, I wear both foundation and BB cream both of which sit on on top of this nicely. The only thing I wish would be this could be PA ++++ and not PA+++.</li>
            <li> No weird smell, no white cast, applies super nicely (has a nice silky feil to it) and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Will definitely buy again!</li>
