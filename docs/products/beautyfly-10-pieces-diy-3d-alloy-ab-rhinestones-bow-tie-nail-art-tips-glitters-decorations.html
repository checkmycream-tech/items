            <li> I normally attach them to the nail with clear acrylic</li>
            <li> so if you get your nails done get them a bit long so they can accommodate the bow tie.</li>

            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t careful they could get caught on to things.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so heavy and her caught on lots of things.</li>
            <li> I applied mine with small ball of acrylic.</li>
            <li> and they stay on for at least 2 week.</li>
