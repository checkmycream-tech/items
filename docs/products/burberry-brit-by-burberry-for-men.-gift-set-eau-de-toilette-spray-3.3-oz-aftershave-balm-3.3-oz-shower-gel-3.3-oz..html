            <li>Burberry fragrance is awesome and it stays quite long.</li>
            <li>He is charming and this suits him soo very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear at the office, but I would stick to more formal events/outings and evening wear with this one unless you have a fairly formal office setting.</li>
            <li>but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste.</li>
            <li>He loves the scent and so do I.The price on this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I originally tested this at a Dillard&#x27;s store, just browsing around.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the younger man with a mature attitude.</li>
            <li>There are other scents that are more appropriate IMO for the most formal occasions.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave a great deal compared with any other websites.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave a great deal compared with any other websites.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering or nauseating, it has a fresh clean scent that always gets compliments.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended you check it out in a Macys before buying to make sure you like this type of smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great everyday cologne for either night or day.</li>
            <li>and it got here SUPER FAST!  </li>
            <li>Burberry Brit creates a modern twist on a more classic scent.</li>
            <li>The items arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>BTW: this Burberry Brit cologne gift-set was not fake.</li>
            <li>I should buy more for the future.</li>
            <li>Later, I attempted to purchase online at the Dillard&#x27;s website, the body wash wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very misleading.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband a few years ago and loved the way he smelled so much that I continue to buy it when he runs low.</li>
            <li>I also like the smell and the classic burberry design on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this fragrance from this particular vendor BECAUSE the bag was included with the purchase, and the purchase was a gift.  </li>
            <li>I currently have Ed Hardy, Lacoste Essential, Tommy Bahama(Signature,Very Cool, and Set Sail South Seas), Burberry, Weekend by Burberry.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and I would purchase from this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li>not overly powerful and not the typical \\&quot;male\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how long it has lasted.</li>

            <li> I originally tested this at a Dillard&#x27;s store, just browsing around. Later, I attempted to purchase online at the Dillard&#x27;s website, the body wash wasn&#x27;t available.  I checked out Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe the value of this set!  My boyfriend loves the scent and it lingers all day long.  It isn&#x27;t overbearing or musky.  Very refreshing and sensuous! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> ...Unless you want to smell great! This is my favorite cologne. Not overpowering or nauseating, it has a fresh clean scent that always gets compliments. Don&#x27;t let the lightness of it&#x27;s bouquet fool you though, a little bit lasts a long time, so don&#x27;t waste it by overdoing it.</li>
            <li> Amazon gave a great deal compared with any other websites. This product is super with a very nice woody scent. You wont get headache, which usually happens with other perfumes. Try it &amp; you will love it.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit for men is great     BUT amazon&#x27;s photo does not reflect what is shipped to you    the burberry bag is not included when I received my order. The reason I ordered this product was to have this whole awesome set and if you are like me and were expecting the bag it does not come.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for a friend of mine, and he loves it.  It&#x27;s his favorite scent and he&#x27;s very happy to have the shower gel and aftershave to accompany the cologne.  The picture is a little deceiving in that there was no toiletry bag included, but hardly anything to fuss over.  Still a great value for what you&#x27;re getting, and Burberry Brit is one of the greatest smelling colognes(and perfumes) out there, with its wonderfully clean scent.  Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> great fragrance. not overly powerful and not the typical \\&quot;male\\&quot; scent. Highly recommended you check it out in a Macys before buying to make sure you like this type of smell. Havnt tried the body wash or after shave yet that comes in the package. Also the gift box is very nice and the whole set up is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume cauz its truly awesome ..I made sure that my boyfriend makes the most out of it ;) He is charming and this suits him soo very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated the fact that the order was shipped with billing details in spite of mentioning  that this is a gift order .&lt;br /&gt;They even missed my gift message for the order .</li>

            <li> I am so happy with this purchase, its really a steal deal. Burberry fragrance is awesome and it stays quite long. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great perfume at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband -- we both love this fragrance.  However, I was extremely disappointed to discover that this particular purchase DID NOT include the toiletry bag as is pictured.  There are multiple vendors that sell Burberry Brit on Amazon -- some with the toiletry bag and some without.  I chose to buy this fragrance from this particular vendor BECAUSE the bag was included with the purchase, and the purchase was a gift.  There&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t use an image of the product without the toiletry bag included -- other vendors do.  It&#x27;s very misleading.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, good price, with fast delivery. Would highly recommend and I would purchase from this seller again in the future. Thanks!  BTW: this Burberry Brit cologne gift-set was not fake.</li>
            <li> Got the entire gift set for FORTY-FIVE BUCKS and it got here SUPER FAST!  Thoroughly pleased with my purchase &#x3D;)  If you&#x27;re a fan of Burberry, this was an unbeatable deal and you should get it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit to me is the best of the Burberry Men&#x27;s fragrances thus far.  It is my favorite fragrance to buy my husband.  It is not too strong and it really smells great.</li>
            <li> Great smelling fragrance. Perfect for the younger man with a mature attitude. Burberry Brit creates a modern twist on a more classic scent. It is light enough to wear at the office, but I would stick to more formal events/outings and evening wear with this one unless you have a fairly formal office setting. There are other scents that are more appropriate IMO for the most formal occasions. Definitely one for my rotation. I currently have Ed Hardy, Lacoste Essential, Tommy Bahama(Signature,Very Cool, and Set Sail South Seas), Burberry, Weekend by Burberry. I also have Armani Code and Aqua Di Gio but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son for Christmas. What a nice gift set. He loves the scent and so do I.The price on this is fantastic. You just can&#x27;t beat it.Burberry Brit for Men has a really nice scent. I think you&#x27;ll love it.Don&#x27;t go to the department stores......come to Amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li> Great compliments overtime I wear this.  Have used this fragrance for the past 10 years.  Nothing else comes close to it.</li>
            <li> This looks to be one of the best buys for purchasing the cologne. I like the face cream and the shower gel too.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Great service!! The items arrived right on time.Will definitely buy from you again!!! Very good value for money.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. I am surprised at how long it has lasted. They must have done something with the sprayer because this has lasted me forever!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  Nowhere else could i find this products together at this price.  I should buy more for the future.</li>
