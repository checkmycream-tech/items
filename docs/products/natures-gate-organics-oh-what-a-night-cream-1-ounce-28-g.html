    <ol>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t the best product.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>A 2 oz size would be perfect.</li>
            <li>skin Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>it is organic and cruelty free..win win..</li>
            <li>I have also used it during the day and is good under makeup or alone.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and my skin looks incredible.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not that moisturizing, in my opinion, so I have to use a fair amount)</li>
            <li>Another Nature&#x27;s Gate product that I am very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>(In fact, I rather liked it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>I find it works better than any high-priced department store moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - and I&#x27;ve used more than my fair share.</li>
            <li>and they are the best in natural skincare for the price.</li>
            <li>And it smells nice in a unique kind of way.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this facial cream, it is by far the most moisturizing, I have ever used &amp; I have tried a lot of creams, this smells fantastic, very exotic, &amp; quite fancy, the consistency is perfect, perfectly creamy, I wake up &amp;</li>
            <li>in the winter I may need a bit more moisture, but I use organic oils as well so that should help...</li>
            <li>I am 56 and people always think I&#x27;m closer to 40 :)</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and light, does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>Love it-</li>
            <li>After one use of this product my skin is more hydrated than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer and just looks better.</li>
            <li>Nothing better out there on the market.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth, absorbs nicely and a noticeable difference when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>LoVE*, NATALIE*</li>
            <li>Every since doing my skin care regimen, I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my skin than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think my skin is all that great...</li>
            <li>Great product ,I&#x27;m using it for the last 2 years ,actually, i love every product of nature&#x27;s gate,this one especially because i could see results immediately ,feels wonderful on a thirsty skin.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable, feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes - which most moisturizes do because of the volatile fragrance additives.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, feels nice, but I definitely needed more than the ”pea sized” amount they recommend to feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with fine lines, but it does keep the sky moist.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really fit the bill in winter.</li>
            <li>This cream fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent to it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not heavy, and makes my skin look smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>This cream manages to feel simultaneously rich and light but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived on time (as usual) and was the perfect compact size to store on my restroom counter.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of Nature&#x27;s Gate Organic skin care.</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>However, I feel like it goes quickly</li>
            <li>I love it because the price point decent.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, thick moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Open opening the product I noticed its light smell and instantly knew that this product would be great for me.</li>
            <li>or so I am thrilled with the way my facial skin has responded to this cream.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so anything that has a strong scent was destined to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have the same or better results with a St. Ives night cream.&lt;br /&gt;The product description way overstates actual results, hence the price is too high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
            <li>This does not make me break out at all and makes my skin feel silky smooth after all the drying natural products I use for acne.</li>
            <li>I first tried this about a year ago and immediately put it on auto-delivery.</li>
            <li>I have tried several night creams and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is light, yet deeply moisturizing, and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more natural skin care products after I broke out in adult acne and found this.</li>
            <li>My face really does feel and look noticeably \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; and moisturized in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The combination has really improved the texture of my 50+ complextion.</li>
            <li>I alternate,  at night I use this product and my skin is dewy healthy and glowing and during the day I use Derma e peptide double action wrinkle reverse to smooth and relax any wrinkles</li>
            <li>My skin is very hydrated in the morning and feels like velvet.</li>
            <li>This night cream is nice and thick, but not greasy with a light natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>I still love this cream but the last container I received seemed to be an old product</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m taking a star off for the high price for just one ounce of cream.</li>
            <li>I recomment it highly -</li>
            <li>A jar lasts a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>My only minor gripe is that the company could have perhaps used more efficient/hygienic packaging, i.e., a pump or tube instead of a finger-dipping jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off course, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and this night cream</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive rosacea prone skin</li>
            <li>As with all face products, I would recommend checking out the ingredients, if possible on Amazon or another site, prior to buying, especially if a person has known allergies or sensitivities. :)</li>
            <li>Not crazy expensive but not crazy cheap.</li>
            <li>as a new user of Nature&#x27;s Gate, I will say so far</li>
            <li>The moisture is very nice and leave your skin soft but be careful because it is very little only 1 ounce !!</li>
            <li>I have bought hundreds of beauty products over the years trying to get my sensitive, acne prone skin to behave.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always surprised when I receive a compliment.</li>
            <li>But heavy enough that its better to put on at night.</li>
            <li>(I would describe my early 40s skin as fairly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; to medium dry, especially in winter, with a small oil t-zone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it and other people notice, not just me, so I know it is making a positive difference.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about it is that it does not burn or make my sensitive skin turn fire engine red like the super expensive dermatologist recommended products I was previously using.</li>
            <li>Feels clean and hydrating and the smell is mild enough for me as I sometimes get migraines from artificial smells.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and was looking for a moisturizing cream that didn&#x27;t feel too oily or too tacky and was light enough to use during the summer but heavy enough to last me through a dry winter.</li>
            <li>I will probably wear this more in the summer and not winter as it tends to be a little thick</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this (small jar) - it&#x27;s hard to believe I&#x27;ll find something better for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a very specific skin care regimen which includes an at home facial every other week with very specific products.</li>
            <li> The other cream is more expensive</li>
            <li> I will use this every morning and every night all year long.</li>
            <li> Only wish the jar was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> If the morning and night creams are used on the same day slight acne could occur.</li>
            <li> This will last me about half a year.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that actually made my skin look clearer and less red.  </li>
            <li> A single jar lasted me quite a while because this cream did NOT need to be slathered on like some other creams or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I will give credit where credit is due...not genetics but partially to this cream.</li>
            <li> No resulting burning, redness, bumps or other sensitive skin negative reactions.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy but heavy enough to moisturize well overnight.</li>
            <li> But I found that a few well-placed small dabs (forehead, each cheek, chin, etc.) worked well enough.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an odd perfume that might take a bit of getting used to, but I now equate the scent with softness.</li>
            <li> no problems or negatives...love the texture and slight scent....</li>
            <li> Just wanted to save a little $$.</li>
            <li> (I can count on a few fingers the number of times a skin product has followed through on promises.)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the small size for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for about the past 5-6 months and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after I got tired of the stench of an otherwise-okay Alpha Hydrox night cream.</li>
            <li> Seemed the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the worst product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am really happy with this purchase.  It is very affordable, feels good on the skin.  Nice scent.  I alternate this cream with another cream at night.  The other cream is more expensive and I do like it.  Just wanted to save a little $$.</li>

            <li> Nice cream. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I have also used it during the day and is good under makeup or alone.</li>
            <li> as a new user of Nature&#x27;s Gate, I will say so far I like this night cream..in the winter I may need a bit more moisture, but I use organic oils as well so that should help...I use the cleanser and the daytime moisture as well.  no problems or negatives...love the texture and slight scent....</li>
            <li> I like it. The smell is pleasant and light. It is not too heavy but heavy enough to moisturize well overnight.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of Nature&#x27;s Gate Organic skin care. This night cream is nice and thick, but not greasy with a light natural fragrance. It has even helped to reduce the appearance of wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice, but I definitely needed more than the ”pea sized” amount they recommend to feel moisturized. I have super dry skin and this night cream didn&#x27;t really fit the bill in winter.</li>
            <li> I first tried this about a year ago and immediately put it on auto-delivery. It smells fantastic, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes - which most moisturizes do because of the volatile fragrance additives. I love that it is organic and my skin looks incredible. I am 56 and people always think I&#x27;m closer to 40 :) A jar lasts a little more than a month. I find it works better than any high-priced department store moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - and I&#x27;ve used more than my fair share.</li>
            <li> I use this with Nature&#x27;s Gate C for Yourself serum. The combination has really improved the texture of my 50+ complextion.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have the same or better results with a St. Ives night cream.&lt;br /&gt;The product description way overstates actual results, hence the price is too high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
            <li> I will probably wear this more in the summer and not winter as it tends to be a little thick but it helps to hydrate my skin well.</li>
            <li> The moisture is very nice and leave your skin soft but be careful because it is very little only 1 ounce !!</li>
            <li> I alternate,  at night I use this product and my skin is dewy healthy and glowing and during the day I use Derma e peptide double action wrinkle reverse to smooth and relax any wrinkles and they are the best in natural skincare for the price.</li>
            <li> Feels clean and hydrating and the smell is mild enough for me as I sometimes get migraines from artificial smells.</li>
            <li> This is the only night cream I&#x27;ve ever used that seems to make a visible difference on my skin. I use it and other people notice, not just me, so I know it is making a positive difference. It goes on nice and light, does not feel oily. But heavy enough that its better to put on at night.</li>
            <li> Love it- I have VERY sensitive rosacea prone skin and this is one of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that actually made my skin look clearer and less red.  However, I feel like it goes quickly (it&#x27;s not that moisturizing, in my opinion, so I have to use a fair amount) and so I&#x27;m taking a star off for the high price for just one ounce of cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add to my Natures Gate lite Switch and Have a Vine Day. The package arrived on time (as usual) and was the perfect compact size to store on my restroom counter. Open opening the product I noticed its light smell and instantly knew that this product would be great for me. I have very sensitive skin so anything that has a strong scent was destined to irritate my skin. After one use of this product my skin is more hydrated than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Use:&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this product along with a night cream, I suggest switching off day to day on the morning and night creams. If the morning and night creams are used on the same day slight acne could occur.</li>
            <li> I was looking for more natural skin care products after I broke out in adult acne and found this. The toner enhances the result. Works well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I got tired of the stench of an otherwise-okay Alpha Hydrox night cream. Oh What a Night does everything a night cream is supposed to do - moisturize overnight without leaving a greasy residue on my pillow. And it smells nice in a unique kind of way. I&#x27;ll keep buying this (small jar) - it&#x27;s hard to believe I&#x27;ll find something better for the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. My skin is noticeably softer and just looks better. I recomment it highly - I just wish it came in a larger size. A 2 oz size would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I have tried several night creams and this one is my favorite. It is light, yet deeply moisturizing, and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Enough said.  Nothing better out there on the market.  My skin is very hydrated in the morning and feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, absorbs nicely and a noticeable difference when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Really love this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is organic and cruelty free..win win..</li>
            <li> I am in love with this facial cream, it is by far the most moisturizing, I have ever used &amp; I have tried a lot of creams, this smells fantastic, very exotic, &amp; quite fancy, the consistency is perfect, perfectly creamy, I wake up &amp; my face is glowing~! LoVE*, NATALIE*</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and was looking for a moisturizing cream that didn&#x27;t feel too oily or too tacky and was light enough to use during the summer but heavy enough to last me through a dry winter. This cream fit the bill. This is my HG. I will use this every morning and every night all year long. I have a very specific skin care regimen which includes an at home facial every other week with very specific products. But during the interim, this is my go to cream every day. Every since doing my skin care regimen, I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my skin than I care to admit. I really don&#x27;t think my skin is all that great...that&#x27;s why I use skin care products. So I&#x27;m always surprised when I receive a compliment. I will give credit where credit is due...not genetics but partially to this cream. I love it because the price point decent. Not crazy expensive but not crazy cheap. This will last me about half a year. It has a light scent to it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not heavy, and makes my skin look smoother and more even. Another Nature&#x27;s Gate product that I am very satisfied with. Only wish the jar was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> I need to update my review I still love this cream but the last container I received seemed to be an old product No fragrance. Seemed the wrong color. Maybe it had expired but I did not check box before I threw away So if you order check immediately for dates I have been using this for a month or so I am thrilled with the way my facial skin has responded to this cream. And I have 59+ skin Love it!!!</li>
