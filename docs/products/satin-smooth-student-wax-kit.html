            <li>The pre-cleanse is great for use before (i also apply it after i am done waxing).  </li>

            <li>Great product if you want to start waxing</li>

            <li>For a starter kit, it&#x27;s great, it has everything you need.</li>
            <li>It is a great product at a great deal!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this waxer and it works great!</li>
            <li>It is so nice to heat use and cap!</li>
            <li>Both my Grand Daughter and my self both have found it perfect for all our waxing needs!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a beginner, I love all that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>The after care products are wonderful, I particularly love that they have included a soothing aloe vera gel and lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I have loved it.</li>
            <li>With the exception of that, this is a good kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good product and it does the job.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>The Gigi didn&#x27;t fair as well in reviews</li>
            <li>This kit is FABULOUS, the best home kit I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>All the items together make for a good waxing.</li>
            <li>It is an oil and it feels really great on the skin after you are done waxing, and it takes the wax off skin very easily.   </li>
            <li>This is a great kit, the wax removes everything in one go, and the non-fabric strips have always worked better for me (in drugstore waxing kits).  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, 100% great, 5 stars, love it.    </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all the products that were included with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I could not be more happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>and im very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Comes with very cute bag where you can store them after waxing.</li>
            <li>the wax strips are excellent, and the 4 lotions and gels are fun to use and remind me of being at a salon.</li>
            <li>i was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brands great value</li>
            <li>Needs more strips and stix but very worth the purchase and great delivery time!</li>
            <li>I noticed that with the SS warmer the wax is heated at a perfect temperature, as apposed to the gigi which always got too hot.  </li>
            <li>I love this system!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this starter kit!</li>
            <li>(They pick up more than you think!)</li>
            <li>I love this wax kit!</li>
            <li>I even waxed the top part of my brows!</li>
            <li>Better than the stuff they use at the waxing place!</li>
            <li>The wax works great, everything is fine.</li>
            <li>And it comes perfectly packaged in a large plastic bag - which makes storing a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Even the after feel is great, it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>but kind of borring to go every 20 minutes to warm it again.</li>
            <li>The wax itself is incredibly effective</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a \\&quot;collar\\&quot; around the wax container</li>
            <li>its a nice experience.</li>
            <li>I am a hairdresser kind of work</li>
            <li>Shaving does more damage than good.</li>
            <li>I liked that strips and sticks</li>
            <li>you want a nice after wax soothing lotion, Try RICA.</li>
            <li>it so happen I had an accident of my own</li>
            <li>She was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I did take off a smidge of skin, but it was my own fault.</li>
            <li>I wish I had the option of choosing what kind of wax I wanted in the kit.</li>
            <li>those of you who have written good reviews, I sure wish I knew your secret.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>and I am still loving it.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t warm in the microwave as the tin is metal.  </li>
            <li>And the kit has been ship very fast and the packaging: worth the money!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got this for mothers day!!</li>
            <li>As it dries out, the smell is not that strong anymore, but quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I like this kit and it made it easy to do at-home waxing (which is great since I love anything DIY)</li>
            <li>used one of theses at my cosmetology school &amp; had to get one for myself, I love it, heats up in a good amount of time. :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very strong smelling</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and heats up within about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>the easiest and most effective waxing kid</li>
            <li>Then once she used it, she was even more thrilled.</li>
            <li>I found if you use a cotton ball to remove the excess wax it conserves the oil and is most effective in being sticky free!   </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about buying a waxing system as I&#x27;ve never waxed my eyebrows on my own, but it was so easy</li>
            <li>The lotion, pre-wax cleanse and post-wax remover are just fantastic, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this kit!</li>
            <li>Just have to know what your doing. :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love it, because I don&#x27;t have to take time to go to the salon, or work around the kids&#x27; schedules.</li>
            <li>Also, it more than pays for itself in money saved from paying for the service and tipping the technician at the salon :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It comes with non woven strips (so much better than the musiln strips.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit after reading tons of reviews from amazon, folica, and more..</li>
            <li>when you go to a salon, you are paying much more.  </li>
            <li>when you go to a salon, you have to spend more time and money just to go there.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product but like anything else you must follow the directions for safe use.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the wax remover.</li>
            <li>I love that they include the smallers ones for eye brows, and largers ones for legs.   </li>
            <li>and i love the wax that this kit comes with.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than Gigi wax.     </li>
            <li>I also love that this wax pot holds basically</li>
            <li>I was able to do my bikini line and armpits with no problem.</li>
            <li>after that you have to buy more applicators and waxing strips.</li>
            <li>im glad i got it.</li>
            <li>But eventually you have to buy more anyway.</li>
            <li>I figured anything recommended by Folica HAD to be better - though just about anything would be an improvement.  </li>
            <li>This system was just how what I hoped it would be and more.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the applicators (which were basically just popsicle sticks) were more rounded and pointed for better definition.  </li>
            <li>I am not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li>The wax leaves the skin so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>The extra bottles it came with work great also!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give you many applicators.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t go more than a week with mega hairy legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hundred percent satisfied</li>
            <li>And the two top reasons people say they don&#x27;t wax are 1)</li>
            <li>Considering this would have cost me more than $1000 at salons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting with more experience</li>
            <li>Love the kit.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will have to purchase more applicators, doesn&#x27;t come with too many.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to others for sure.</li>
            <li>Inspite of taking many precautions a drop or two spilled over the floor</li>
            <li>i have never come back online to rate something i have bought, but i have to share that this waxing kit is the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to learn to twirl the applicator better.</li>
            <li>I like this because it gives you, the consumer, better control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Love the warmer</li>
            <li>I wish there were more sticks and strips in the kit, but then again it is a STARTER kit.</li>
            <li>Most of the oil and lotion stuff leaked out..</li>
            <li>Also be sure to remove ALL excess wax before bathing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described, easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>I have only used the cleanser and the wax remover (which is very handy!).</li>
            <li>We were very excited to get this</li>
            <li>You get a nice number of remover strips, but I went through most of the applicator sticks just doing my underarms, so be advised, order extras right away!  </li>
            <li>Unlike the instructions, I keep the wax temperature set to High and have great results.</li>
            <li>Its not wax, it should be called super glue or some kind of glue used for carpentary work.</li>
            <li>The wax quality was awesome, easy to use, easy to clean up and even though I have sensitive skin, I did not have any burning or excess redness.</li>
            <li>Best $36 Ive spent and it beats spending $15 or more at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Also, the lotion and aloe and pre cleanser are great, i don&#x27;t use them nearly as often as i use the wax remover though!  </li>
            <li>it hold gigi, suddeny smooth, satin smooth, all of it!</li>
            <li>Those that say it isnt are only saying that because they don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly, it works great and perfect for your personal use!</li>
            <li>[Yeah, okay, I use cheap pros instead of spa pros.]</li>
            <li>It worked just as the instructions directed and for the first time waxing my underarms, I had great success.  </li>
            <li>The wax is very easy to work with, the strips are excellent, and if you read and follow the instructions carefully you will have no problems removing hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>It was easy and quick (1 hour) to heat the wax and the best temperature for the actual waxing</li>
            <li>I brought this little gem that has everything included and did a very good job waxing my own eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>First time ever attempting in-home waxing, and I love it!</li>
            <li>The wax lasts a loooong time as I have now waxed 2xs since purchasing and still have almost a full tub of wax!</li>
            <li>Also, the wax is so easy to remove (when you get it on yourself or an unwanted surface).  </li>
            <li>The plastic bag that comes with the package makes the kit easy and neat to store.    </li>
            <li>it doesnt come off fabrics or countertops easily</li>
            <li>WAX ON EASILY CLEANABLE SURFACES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this after trying out many different wax products.</li>
            <li>But it has a smell to it, which is really strong when you are applying the gel.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t use (because of my sensitive skin) is the moisturizer, I used Vitamin E instead but very impressed and will buy more of this product!</li>
            <li>The quality of the products is pretty good-really liked the almond oil to remove stubborn wax and aloe gel for cooling.</li>
            <li>Apart from that, the oils and creams provided are more than adequate</li>
            <li>Cleaner, neater, and it really did remove even my most stubborn hair!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect wax for any part of the body and does not cause a sticky mess.</li>
            <li>a note: the little bottles that come with it are great!</li>
            <li>I had a huge burn in my thigh for days.  </li>
            <li>The power light came on but the wax didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this kit to anyone, it is well worth the money. :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap; add a pack to your order.</li>
            <li>The skin care products are also nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>They are the white ones , and not the muslin ones, which is GREAT.</li>
            <li>3)the wax remover only works on your skin but you must use a wash cloth and a great amount of the wax remover.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to shave anyway to be smooth.</li>
            <li>The wax strips provided are great, especially since i have bought woven ones as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to attempt waxing my fuzzy-bear legs with my own hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But as it dries out, it ain&#x27;t sticky anymore plus your skin does feel smooth.</li>
            <li>This product works great and would definitely butymore of.</li>
            <li>So happy I got this - and finally used it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a great present for my wife.</li>
            <li>This kit is really cheap.</li>
            <li>and I was completely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>When you run out of the starter kit&#x27;s muslin strips, you can buy muslin at a fabric store and cut it yourself for a much more reasonable price than buying more strips online.  </li>
            <li>At first, the smell is indeed strong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 3:41 right now :-)</li>
            <li>I accidentally missed a spot and hot water and wax DO NOT mix!!</li>
            <li>it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>However mild or strong, I just can&#x27;t bear smells!&lt;br /&gt;Rest</li>
            <li>Okay I bought this as a first wax warmer for myself.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get the waxing kit, as soon as I received it today I followed the directions and was waxing within an hour.  </li>
            <li>I did the first strip, which seemed ok at the time.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my sister to use on another wax oit kit I bought her.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a wax kit that has varying temperatures and is relatively small size for home use, and this kit is perfect!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a super detailed instruction booklet.</li>
            <li>I do suggest to stock up on strips and the wax can collars will help keep the warmer clean from any drips.</li>
            <li>I feel like I used 1/4 of my wax remover solution (given in kit) to clean my hands and my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Make sure after you dip the wooden stick into the wax to twirl the wax around the stick like you would with warm caramel.</li>
            <li>It took forever to clean up.</li>
            <li>and I was so ticked, two days passed before I tried to clean it.</li>
            <li>Some more positive points about this for me are that:  </li>
            <li>Also, the warmer has a handle that makes it so easy to move around as i do each leg, so instead of moving my whole body and position, i just easily move the warmer.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was easy and not-so-scary - and I can only get better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way tooo great as compared to this minus the smell.</li>
            <li>[Note: \\&quot;as red\\&quot; - still leaves it red for a bit, but not as bright nor as long.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like majority of people: decided to wax myself because of the excessif prices out there, and between you and me, they are not that good: hair come back after 2 weeks when it should be minimum 3!    </li>
            <li>This is a good kit for someone whose just starting as it has everything you need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go have my face waxed by a professional before I&#x27;ll do it on my own again.  </li>
            <li>Nothing tooo cool...</li>
            <li>Plssssssssss donot read the good reviews and buy dis product , I did the same thing</li>
            <li>Or it was too cool</li>
            <li>I love the results and how much money I&#x27;m saving.</li>
            <li>This kit had everything I needed to properly do wax my leg and bikini area, and at a good price.</li>
            <li>It took some practice to get good at at-home waxing, but now it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li>The pre-wax skin cleanser, wax remover, and lotion work really well, but be sure to keep the bottles upright.</li>
            <li>The warmer melts the wax quickly if you follow the instructions to first set it on high for 30 minutes, and then cools the wax to the perfect temp when you (again, following instructions!) reduce heat to medium for another 25-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to set up, is used just like at the salon, cleans up easily with the wax-remover (included), and surprisingly, works just as well as waxing at the salon, with less pain.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great deal for what you get.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I followed the instructions to a T, and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>loved the bottles they gave for before/after waxing and while the appliers (aka big Popsicle sticks) and paper strips run out fast, they can be easily found at dollar stores.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling effect, which is however, relatively mild.</li>
            <li>The wax remover that comes w/the kit smells amazing, but tends to only work with light residue.</li>
            <li>w/this kit, but definitely need more practice :)</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is easy to move around.</li>
            <li>I must admit that this is the best beauty investment I have made lately!</li>
            <li>It was one great mess.</li>
            <li>(that comes with the kit), made sure the entire waxed are was covered, used a towel with some elbow grease and it came right out, if I had known it was that easy</li>
            <li>Satin smooth had a great hard wax with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good and everything was as expected when I got the kit.  </li>
            <li>It took me only 30 minutes including set up and cleanup, excluding time to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients in the extra bottles are great - the wax remover is made up of natural oils AND removes wax that dripped on the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the money if you continue to use over time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: Totally worth the $40.</li>
            <li>It was well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a lot of useful things.</li>
            <li>and this product comes with more (as far as lotions/gels).  </li>
            <li>The warmer doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but works just fine on high.</li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail today and used it right away.</li>
            <li>The price it right too.</li>
            <li>I think the non woven strips are the right way to go.  </li>
            <li>I would have cleaned it right away.</li>
            <li>So, as long as you are fast, you are good to go.   </li>
            <li>The warmer heats up quickly (just put it on high and leave it for 20 - 30 minutes, depending on how full the can is).</li>
            <li>the wax warmer heats up the wax in 15 mins and cool fast when finished.</li>
            <li>That is kind of a hassle since I really only use it for my upper lip! :)</li>
            <li>The warmer is genius, although it may take about 20 mins to heat up all the way through, the warmer keeps it at your own personal temperature the whole time, saving time and A LOT of wax.</li>
            <li>Gave 4 stars because would have preferred products with less toxins in them but loved the intention of it coming with prep oil, post oil, aloe and lotion.</li>
            <li>This kit is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and then if it&#x27;s too hot for the person to lower it from there.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d prefer to just wash the area first.</li>
            <li>, I got rid of my old gigi and decided to give Satin Smooth a try.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Go watch a pro waxer first to see how its done.</li>
            <li>This is my first home waxing kit</li>
            <li>and it was definately too hot.</li>
            <li>:) A month later that spot on her belly is darker than everywhere else.</li>
            <li>so make sure you buy an eyebrow razor because you arent suppose to continually wax the same area over and over.</li>
            <li>it comes with EVERYTHING you need for your first three waxes.</li>
            <li>youll have more than enough wax.</li>
            <li>As a first time waxer, it did not hurt a bit as portrayed in the movies.</li>
            <li>Did the second strip which seemed ok.  </li>
            <li>Then I did the 3rd strip, and it took most of the top layer of skin off my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>AND make sure you have enough time to do all of this.. DO NOT be in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of 99% of the hair on the first try.</li>
            <li>First at home wax kit I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still glad I bought the kit, if you buy this kit just know that you may want to get a different wax.</li>
            <li>upper lip came out better than the \\&quot;pros\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>after first waxing:&lt;br /&gt;*For</li>
            <li>Aloe (which I bought separately), go higher than medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;*Wash</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>also, gave myself a brazi for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I wanted it to work, I really did!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this kit because of all of all of the 5 stars reviews; however, when this kit (Jheri Redding Satin Smooth Wax Warmer) arrived, the only items that were intact was the wax, strips, and the Satin Cool Soother Gel.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase for a home waxing kit.</li>
            <li>This is the first wax warmer I&#x27;ve used, but I like it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than being hairy but not by much - all that time trying to get the temp right only to spend the rest of the afternoon waxing and rewaxing, then cleaning up spilt wax (and often cleaning the microwave and/or plate too!).</li>
            <li>This helped a lot, and I had no mess and perfectly smooth underarms when I finished.</li>
            <li>I have used other products before to do my own bikini area and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>For my first time use I I used something for my sensitive skin (which would be even more sensitive after ripping hair from my flesh).  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love all of the other little bottles of lotions and a primer.</li>
            <li>Took longer than expected to ship but the machine is great has a handle that gives it an A+ if you need to move your warmer you won&#x27;t get burned didn&#x27;t come with enough sticks or strips.</li>
            <li>The ones used on me in salons (pink) don&#x27;t stick nearly as much at all and clean up so easily.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has been a nightmare for me to find a good salon in the City during the past 3 years I have been living here.  </li>
            <li>(I stocked up on more papers at Sally&#x27;s, as many other beauty supply vendors only sell muslin).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all so its very economical and in my opinion barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li>It is a time commitment, because the wax takes about an hour to get to the right temperature (when the container is full), but it&#x27;s something you can plan ahead, so again, no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After buying more applicators and a hard wax (also available on amazon) I am happier with this product.</li>
            <li>Waxing with the Gigi would take forever and the experience was never short of a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the price is amazing, as I am only now buying a second pot of wax (for $15) after seven months of using this wax every 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Note, someone mentioned (in another review) turning it on in the morning and being ready to wax by afternoon.  </li>
            <li>it was ready to go, so</li>
            <li>It is a very compact warmer which I find very helpful.  </li>
            <li>If you are a novice or an expert at this waxing thing definitely give Satin Smooth</li>
            <li>and it seemed ready to use).</li>
            <li>It was very sunburned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using exclusively Gigi wax for years now, but decided to give this a try since the set costs almost as much as a Gigi warmer alone.</li>
            <li>its also very compact and effienct.</li>
            <li>While the wax is warming, take a relaxing shower and when your all done, the wax is ready to use.</li>
            <li>I went straight to the bathroom and set it up.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very girly person but someone told me waxing was better for your skin than shaving</li>
            <li>It works really well and even if you have never waxed before (like me)</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing the gloves because it is a real headache trying to get all the wax off of your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yeah, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I searched out different waxes and settled with SATIN SMOOTH TEA TREE WAX 14oz.</li>
            <li>Workd very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li>I cut the strips into smaller strips to fit the areas I was waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li>The kit comes in with a really neat package that would be presentable as a gift.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend purchasing the warmer collars (they have saved my warmer on numerous occasions and serve as a great resting place for the applicators) as well as additional cloth strips to save you the trip to the store later.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer is a compact size - smaller than I expected but in a good way.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does not include those covers for the warmers that would make the warmer much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better then the other wax products.</li>
            <li>when you go to a salon, you are left sticky even though they might give you some oil or whatsoever to clean yourself up, but still you have to spend some time to get to your home and take a shower, which is not the case when you do it yourself as you can jump into the shower immediately.    </li>
            <li>and I was left with 15-20% of the wax, most of the extra bottles coming with it, no strips and of course the warmer which made it a reasonably prices experience.</li>
            <li>so be sure to lay something down.     </li>
            <li>Somehow I stumbled upon reading something that said waxing was better for your skin and caused less irritation.  </li>
            <li>Last night I decided to give it one more try, and this time I only turned it on medium heat and waited for it to heat up.  </li>
            <li>This product is too difficult to use and produces moderate results at best.  </li>
            <li>Even without the collar I was able to avoid much mess by scraping off the applicator each time on the edge of the can.</li>
            <li>The directions say to heat on high for 30 minutes then lower to medium for another 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I bought it with high hopes, but here&#x27;s what i found.</li>
            <li>did as the directions said, heat at high for 30, then medium for 20-ish, but I think the aloe needs to be warmer than the medium heat.</li>
            <li>It was little to no pain and was also my first time doing it to myself!!!</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the only useful item regarding the lotions is the wax residue removing oil.</li>
            <li>Folica normally recommends good products and I was tired of buying iffy wax kits.  </li>
            <li>People more impatient than me would probably just grab a razor out of frustration.</li>
            <li>I am a professional, and this is the same stuff we use at the salon, the only difference is that it&#x27;s smaller, so it&#x27;s great for personal use.</li>
            <li>The wax takes at least an hour to warm up to a usable heat.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair on my legs, right up until my ankles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to tame the sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to at home waxing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I only test a small spot.</li>
            <li>The wax leaves your skin soft and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive enough for waxing eye brows, and strong enough to wax out under arms.</li>
            <li>The Gigi line has worked fine as far as removal of the hair,  but for some reason I find the gigi honey wax to be very hard to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I had my eyebrows waxed for the first time @ age 57 last week.  </li>
            <li>The second time I tried it, I also followed the instructions to a T, but for whatever reason the wax was too hot this time</li>
            <li>i am a first time at home waxer and although i need some practice with waxing, will never go back to shaving!</li>
            <li>Even though it was only my first time waxing I will never shave again.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely hesitant buying a product like this, sight unseen, but the reviews were positive, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>so the wax can warm properly and it can be very messy.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions, turned the warmer on high for about 30-40 minutes and left it on high while I waxed.</li>
            <li>Seller did send out replacement bottle but the pads are hard to find and only last for one good body waxing.</li>
            <li>I also want to warn people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It met my expectations completely.</li>
            <li>I have been getting professional waxes for over fifteen years.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I decided to give the old waxing at home a try in an effort to save money on this monthly costly expense.  </li>
            <li>It is by far</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never had waxing done even professionally</li>
            <li>i wouldnt be surprised if they used this kit in salons.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard about it from friends who frequent Folica (the site that gave the award seen on this product&#x27;s page).  </li>
            <li>It took along time to heat up, the starter kit left out some things you should really have before you start.</li>
            <li>I really like the bottle of oil because it really does help with any extra left over wax.</li>
            <li>I now recommend purchasing &amp;#34;waxing gloves,&amp;#34; and use any old towels to cover your bathroom sink and floor.</li>
            <li>I really like the paper strips that are provided, as I can cut them into smaller strips.</li>
            <li>the wax pulls of my skin and having nice eyebrows or a bikini wax with scarred skin around it is not attractive.</li>
            <li>You also have to be very careful because wax gets very hot and can sometimes burn sensitive areas like brow.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, after using it, I think I made the right choice even though it was more expensive.   </li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t twirl the wax around stick as much as I should, the wax ended up getting onto my bathroom sink, floor, toilet, hands, fingers, bottles, and bathroom rugs.</li>
            <li>tried several different techniques, less wax, more wax, shorter hair, longer hair, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The wax that comes with it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; if that makes sense... when I dip the applicator in, the wax seems to string (like a hot glue gun), so it gets a bit messy.</li>
            <li>takes forever to hit up and the whole process takes long.  </li>
            <li>This is my first waxing kit, but it worked as expected.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 tries, I did manage to pull a bit of skin off</li>
            <li>Can get really messy if not careful but is easy to clean with some goo gone and hard work.  </li>
            <li>The wax removes both dark leg hair and the fine blonde hairs on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>kit comes with some pre and post waxing creams, oils and antiseptic - major plus.  </li>
            <li>One of the major pluses: you get to use all the wax.</li>
            <li>The wax can be super messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>and I also purchased SATIN SMOOTH Calendula Gold Hard Wax with Tea Tree Oil, that I haven&#x27;t used yet.  </li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re a professional, this kit is too much work and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>They make cleanup much easier as nothing can drip on the warming unit and it makes it easier to lift the empty wax can out of the unit.</li>
            <li>Before using this product I was a complete novice to facial waxing.  </li>
            <li>No issues with the wax taking too long to heat up, and reasonable directions are included, so long as you have been waxed professionally before, so you know the general gist of how it works.</li>
            <li>but this product barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li>After just one leg waxing, I have enough wax to last me at least 20 more.</li>
            <li>I did this, and then just mirrored what they had done as far as the amount if wax to put on an applicator, and how to use the same strip to pick up leftover wax and stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to have red bumps directly after waxing, but the cooling gel and lotion help with that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only drawbacks are the normal drawbacks of waxing, and not specific to this product.  </li>
            <li>It kind of worked but left enough hair behind</li>
            <li>The correct use of this is to first heat up the can of wax at the highest temperature for 30 minutes, then turn it down to the lowest temperature for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>However, I have used other products such as GiGI that work just as good and make less of a mess.</li>
            <li>But if any wax is left over, good lluck removing it, the waaxremoving oil kinda works but not great, get ready to scrub HARD</li>
            <li>However, wax itself is VERY messy and you only need a little to warm up</li>
            <li>However, I would much rather use this kit than the other kit I had ( GiGi) .</li>
            <li>first time was a mess.</li>
            <li>If you plan on bringing this abroad, I would consider looking into other wax kits that don&#x27;t weigh as much.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to clean up, but if you know how to wax it should not be a problem.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a little messy, ITS WAX.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;professional waxer\\&quot; would use baby powder, which I&#x27;ll use next time to see if it&#x27;s any different.</li>
            <li>Well sad to say, I tried it twice and followed the instructions which stated to warm for 30 mins prior to using.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the wax is really sticky, so watch out when you first open it.</li>
            <li>only real problem I had was the \\&quot;strings\\&quot; that would hang down off the applicator.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs, maybe my hair was not long enough</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is an absolutely excellent, salon quality product!  </li>
            <li> This wax works great!!</li>
            <li> best things about this kit are the price and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great wax product!</li>
            <li> this kit is just perfect!</li>

            <li> Very good price too.</li>
            <li> This is a very good starter kit for waxing.</li>
            <li> Really great value and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Yes, i know its a gel, so ideally it shouldnt be oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this company before but noticed all the reviews were excellent, and for a good reason.</li>
            <li> This is a well-organized kit, with great instructions, and great storage system, so it&#x27;s not out on the bathroom counter all the time.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Great wax pot.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hairless and happy.  </li>
            <li> The extras that come with this kit are great as well.   </li>
            <li> The pre-cleanse is great for use before (i also apply it after i am done waxing).  </li>
            <li> This was a great deal.  </li>
            <li> The wax is a great consistency.</li>
            <li> Great wax kit.</li>
            <li> All the products work great that come with kit.</li>
            <li> She still raves about what a great waxing kit it is.</li>
            <li> This kit is great for at home waxing.</li>
            <li> REALLY happy with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I use this for eyebrows and legs and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want to start waxing</li>
            <li> Altima Beauty&#x27;s shipping is great.</li>
            <li> For a starter kit, it&#x27;s great, it has everything you need.</li>
            <li> It is a great product at a great deal!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this waxer and it works great!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to heat use and cap!</li>
            <li> Both my Grand Daughter and my self both have found it perfect for all our waxing needs!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a beginner, I love all that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> The after care products are wonderful, I particularly love that they have included a soothing aloe vera gel and lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I have loved it.</li>
            <li> With the exception of that, this is a good kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good product and it does the job.</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> The Gigi didn&#x27;t fair as well in reviews</li>
            <li> This kit is FABULOUS, the best home kit I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> All the items together make for a good waxing.</li>
            <li> It is an oil and it feels really great on the skin after you are done waxing, and it takes the wax off skin very easily.   </li>
            <li> This is a great kit, the wax removes everything in one go, and the non-fabric strips have always worked better for me (in drugstore waxing kits).  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, 100% great, 5 stars, love it.    </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all the products that were included with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not be more happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> and im very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Comes with very cute bag where you can store them after waxing.</li>
            <li> the wax strips are excellent, and the 4 lotions and gels are fun to use and remind me of being at a salon.</li>
            <li> i was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brands great value</li>
            <li> Needs more strips and stix but very worth the purchase and great delivery time!</li>
            <li> I noticed that with the SS warmer the wax is heated at a perfect temperature, as apposed to the gigi which always got too hot.  </li>
            <li> I love this system!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this starter kit!</li>
            <li> (They pick up more than you think!)</li>
            <li> I love this wax kit!</li>
            <li> I even waxed the top part of my brows!</li>
            <li> Better than the stuff they use at the waxing place!</li>
            <li> The wax works great, everything is fine.</li>
            <li> And it comes perfectly packaged in a large plastic bag - which makes storing a breeze.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Even the after feel is great, it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> but kind of borring to go every 20 minutes to warm it again.</li>
            <li> The wax itself is incredibly effective</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a \\&quot;collar\\&quot; around the wax container</li>
            <li> its a nice experience.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser kind of work</li>
            <li> Shaving does more damage than good.</li>
            <li> I liked that strips and sticks</li>
            <li> you want a nice after wax soothing lotion, Try RICA.</li>
            <li> it so happen I had an accident of my own</li>
            <li> She was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I did take off a smidge of skin, but it was my own fault.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the option of choosing what kind of wax I wanted in the kit.</li>
            <li> those of you who have written good reviews, I sure wish I knew your secret.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> and I am still loving it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t warm in the microwave as the tin is metal.  </li>
            <li> And the kit has been ship very fast and the packaging: worth the money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this for mothers day!!</li>
            <li> As it dries out, the smell is not that strong anymore, but quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like this kit and it made it easy to do at-home waxing (which is great since I love anything DIY)</li>
            <li> used one of theses at my cosmetology school &amp; had to get one for myself, I love it, heats up in a good amount of time. :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very strong smelling</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and heats up within about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> the easiest and most effective waxing kid</li>
            <li> Then once she used it, she was even more thrilled.</li>
            <li> I found if you use a cotton ball to remove the excess wax it conserves the oil and is most effective in being sticky free!   </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about buying a waxing system as I&#x27;ve never waxed my eyebrows on my own, but it was so easy</li>
            <li> The lotion, pre-wax cleanse and post-wax remover are just fantastic, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this kit!</li>
            <li> Just have to know what your doing. :)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love it, because I don&#x27;t have to take time to go to the salon, or work around the kids&#x27; schedules.</li>
            <li> Also, it more than pays for itself in money saved from paying for the service and tipping the technician at the salon :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It comes with non woven strips (so much better than the musiln strips.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit after reading tons of reviews from amazon, folica, and more..</li>
            <li> when you go to a salon, you are paying much more.  </li>
            <li> when you go to a salon, you have to spend more time and money just to go there.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but like anything else you must follow the directions for safe use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the wax remover.</li>
            <li> I love that they include the smallers ones for eye brows, and largers ones for legs.   </li>
            <li> and i love the wax that this kit comes with.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than Gigi wax.     </li>
            <li> I also love that this wax pot holds basically</li>
            <li> I was able to do my bikini line and armpits with no problem.</li>
            <li> after that you have to buy more applicators and waxing strips.</li>
            <li> im glad i got it.</li>
            <li> But eventually you have to buy more anyway.</li>
            <li> I figured anything recommended by Folica HAD to be better - though just about anything would be an improvement.  </li>
            <li> This system was just how what I hoped it would be and more.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the applicators (which were basically just popsicle sticks) were more rounded and pointed for better definition.  </li>
            <li> I am not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li> The wax leaves the skin so silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> The extra bottles it came with work great also!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give you many applicators.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t go more than a week with mega hairy legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hundred percent satisfied</li>
            <li> And the two top reasons people say they don&#x27;t wax are 1)</li>
            <li> Considering this would have cost me more than $1000 at salons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting with more experience</li>
            <li> Love the kit.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will have to purchase more applicators, doesn&#x27;t come with too many.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to others for sure.</li>
            <li> Inspite of taking many precautions a drop or two spilled over the floor</li>
            <li> i have never come back online to rate something i have bought, but i have to share that this waxing kit is the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to learn to twirl the applicator better.</li>
            <li> I like this because it gives you, the consumer, better control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> Love the warmer</li>
            <li> I wish there were more sticks and strips in the kit, but then again it is a STARTER kit.</li>
            <li> Most of the oil and lotion stuff leaked out..</li>
            <li> Also be sure to remove ALL excess wax before bathing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described, easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I have only used the cleanser and the wax remover (which is very handy!).</li>
            <li> We were very excited to get this</li>
            <li> You get a nice number of remover strips, but I went through most of the applicator sticks just doing my underarms, so be advised, order extras right away!  </li>
            <li> Unlike the instructions, I keep the wax temperature set to High and have great results.</li>
            <li> Its not wax, it should be called super glue or some kind of glue used for carpentary work.</li>
            <li> The wax quality was awesome, easy to use, easy to clean up and even though I have sensitive skin, I did not have any burning or excess redness.</li>
            <li> Best $36 Ive spent and it beats spending $15 or more at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Also, the lotion and aloe and pre cleanser are great, i don&#x27;t use them nearly as often as i use the wax remover though!  </li>
            <li> it hold gigi, suddeny smooth, satin smooth, all of it!</li>
            <li> Those that say it isnt are only saying that because they don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly, it works great and perfect for your personal use!</li>
            <li> [Yeah, okay, I use cheap pros instead of spa pros.]</li>
            <li> It worked just as the instructions directed and for the first time waxing my underarms, I had great success.  </li>
            <li> The wax is very easy to work with, the strips are excellent, and if you read and follow the instructions carefully you will have no problems removing hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> It was easy and quick (1 hour) to heat the wax and the best temperature for the actual waxing</li>
            <li> I brought this little gem that has everything included and did a very good job waxing my own eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> First time ever attempting in-home waxing, and I love it!</li>
            <li> The wax lasts a loooong time as I have now waxed 2xs since purchasing and still have almost a full tub of wax!</li>
            <li> Also, the wax is so easy to remove (when you get it on yourself or an unwanted surface).  </li>
            <li> The plastic bag that comes with the package makes the kit easy and neat to store.    </li>
            <li> it doesnt come off fabrics or countertops easily</li>
            <li> WAX ON EASILY CLEANABLE SURFACES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this after trying out many different wax products.</li>
            <li> But it has a smell to it, which is really strong when you are applying the gel.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t use (because of my sensitive skin) is the moisturizer, I used Vitamin E instead but very impressed and will buy more of this product!</li>
            <li> The quality of the products is pretty good-really liked the almond oil to remove stubborn wax and aloe gel for cooling.</li>
            <li> Apart from that, the oils and creams provided are more than adequate</li>
            <li> Cleaner, neater, and it really did remove even my most stubborn hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect wax for any part of the body and does not cause a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> a note: the little bottles that come with it are great!</li>
            <li> I had a huge burn in my thigh for days.  </li>
            <li> The power light came on but the wax didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit to anyone, it is well worth the money. :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap; add a pack to your order.</li>
            <li> The skin care products are also nice and gentle.</li>
            <li> They are the white ones , and not the muslin ones, which is GREAT.</li>
            <li> 3)the wax remover only works on your skin but you must use a wash cloth and a great amount of the wax remover.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to shave anyway to be smooth.</li>
            <li> The wax strips provided are great, especially since i have bought woven ones as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to attempt waxing my fuzzy-bear legs with my own hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as it dries out, it ain&#x27;t sticky anymore plus your skin does feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works great and would definitely butymore of.</li>
            <li> So happy I got this - and finally used it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a great present for my wife.</li>
            <li> This kit is really cheap.</li>
            <li> and I was completely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> When you run out of the starter kit&#x27;s muslin strips, you can buy muslin at a fabric store and cut it yourself for a much more reasonable price than buying more strips online.  </li>
            <li> At first, the smell is indeed strong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 3:41 right now :-)</li>
            <li> I accidentally missed a spot and hot water and wax DO NOT mix!!</li>
            <li> it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> However mild or strong, I just can&#x27;t bear smells!&lt;br /&gt;Rest</li>
            <li> Okay I bought this as a first wax warmer for myself.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the waxing kit, as soon as I received it today I followed the directions and was waxing within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I did the first strip, which seemed ok at the time.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my sister to use on another wax oit kit I bought her.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wax kit that has varying temperatures and is relatively small size for home use, and this kit is perfect!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a super detailed instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> I do suggest to stock up on strips and the wax can collars will help keep the warmer clean from any drips.</li>
            <li> I feel like I used 1/4 of my wax remover solution (given in kit) to clean my hands and my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Make sure after you dip the wooden stick into the wax to twirl the wax around the stick like you would with warm caramel.</li>
            <li> It took forever to clean up.</li>
            <li> and I was so ticked, two days passed before I tried to clean it.</li>
            <li> Some more positive points about this for me are that:  </li>
            <li> Also, the warmer has a handle that makes it so easy to move around as i do each leg, so instead of moving my whole body and position, i just easily move the warmer.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was easy and not-so-scary - and I can only get better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way tooo great as compared to this minus the smell.</li>
            <li> [Note: \\&quot;as red\\&quot; - still leaves it red for a bit, but not as bright nor as long.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like majority of people: decided to wax myself because of the excessif prices out there, and between you and me, they are not that good: hair come back after 2 weeks when it should be minimum 3!    </li>
            <li> This is a good kit for someone whose just starting as it has everything you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go have my face waxed by a professional before I&#x27;ll do it on my own again.  </li>
            <li> Nothing tooo cool...</li>
            <li> Plssssssssss donot read the good reviews and buy dis product , I did the same thing</li>
            <li> Or it was too cool</li>
            <li> I love the results and how much money I&#x27;m saving.</li>
            <li> This kit had everything I needed to properly do wax my leg and bikini area, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> It took some practice to get good at at-home waxing, but now it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li> The pre-wax skin cleanser, wax remover, and lotion work really well, but be sure to keep the bottles upright.</li>
            <li> The warmer melts the wax quickly if you follow the instructions to first set it on high for 30 minutes, and then cools the wax to the perfect temp when you (again, following instructions!) reduce heat to medium for another 25-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to set up, is used just like at the salon, cleans up easily with the wax-remover (included), and surprisingly, works just as well as waxing at the salon, with less pain.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great deal for what you get.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I followed the instructions to a T, and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> loved the bottles they gave for before/after waxing and while the appliers (aka big Popsicle sticks) and paper strips run out fast, they can be easily found at dollar stores.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling effect, which is however, relatively mild.</li>
            <li> The wax remover that comes w/the kit smells amazing, but tends to only work with light residue.</li>
            <li> w/this kit, but definitely need more practice :)</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and is easy to move around.</li>
            <li> I must admit that this is the best beauty investment I have made lately!</li>
            <li> It was one great mess.</li>
            <li> (that comes with the kit), made sure the entire waxed are was covered, used a towel with some elbow grease and it came right out, if I had known it was that easy</li>
            <li> Satin smooth had a great hard wax with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good and everything was as expected when I got the kit.  </li>
            <li> It took me only 30 minutes including set up and cleanup, excluding time to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients in the extra bottles are great - the wax remover is made up of natural oils AND removes wax that dripped on the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth the money if you continue to use over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Totally worth the $40.</li>
            <li> It was well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with a lot of useful things.</li>
            <li> and this product comes with more (as far as lotions/gels).  </li>
            <li> The warmer doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but works just fine on high.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today and used it right away.</li>
            <li> The price it right too.</li>
            <li> I think the non woven strips are the right way to go.  </li>
            <li> I would have cleaned it right away.</li>
            <li> So, as long as you are fast, you are good to go.   </li>
            <li> The warmer heats up quickly (just put it on high and leave it for 20 - 30 minutes, depending on how full the can is).</li>
            <li> the wax warmer heats up the wax in 15 mins and cool fast when finished.</li>
            <li> That is kind of a hassle since I really only use it for my upper lip! :)</li>
            <li> The warmer is genius, although it may take about 20 mins to heat up all the way through, the warmer keeps it at your own personal temperature the whole time, saving time and A LOT of wax.</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars because would have preferred products with less toxins in them but loved the intention of it coming with prep oil, post oil, aloe and lotion.</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and then if it&#x27;s too hot for the person to lower it from there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d prefer to just wash the area first.</li>
            <li> , I got rid of my old gigi and decided to give Satin Smooth a try.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Go watch a pro waxer first to see how its done.</li>
            <li> This is my first home waxing kit</li>
            <li> and it was definately too hot.</li>
            <li> :) A month later that spot on her belly is darker than everywhere else.</li>
            <li> so make sure you buy an eyebrow razor because you arent suppose to continually wax the same area over and over.</li>
            <li> it comes with EVERYTHING you need for your first three waxes.</li>
            <li> youll have more than enough wax.</li>
            <li> As a first time waxer, it did not hurt a bit as portrayed in the movies.</li>
            <li> Did the second strip which seemed ok.  </li>
            <li> Then I did the 3rd strip, and it took most of the top layer of skin off my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> AND make sure you have enough time to do all of this.. DO NOT be in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of 99% of the hair on the first try.</li>
            <li> First at home wax kit I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still glad I bought the kit, if you buy this kit just know that you may want to get a different wax.</li>
            <li> upper lip came out better than the \\&quot;pros\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> after first waxing:&lt;br /&gt;*For</li>
            <li> Aloe (which I bought separately), go higher than medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;*Wash</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> also, gave myself a brazi for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to work, I really did!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this kit because of all of all of the 5 stars reviews; however, when this kit (Jheri Redding Satin Smooth Wax Warmer) arrived, the only items that were intact was the wax, strips, and the Satin Cool Soother Gel.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase for a home waxing kit.</li>
            <li> This is the first wax warmer I&#x27;ve used, but I like it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better than being hairy but not by much - all that time trying to get the temp right only to spend the rest of the afternoon waxing and rewaxing, then cleaning up spilt wax (and often cleaning the microwave and/or plate too!).</li>
            <li> This helped a lot, and I had no mess and perfectly smooth underarms when I finished.</li>
            <li> I have used other products before to do my own bikini area and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> For my first time use I I used something for my sensitive skin (which would be even more sensitive after ripping hair from my flesh).  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love all of the other little bottles of lotions and a primer.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to ship but the machine is great has a handle that gives it an A+ if you need to move your warmer you won&#x27;t get burned didn&#x27;t come with enough sticks or strips.</li>
            <li> The ones used on me in salons (pink) don&#x27;t stick nearly as much at all and clean up so easily.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has been a nightmare for me to find a good salon in the City during the past 3 years I have been living here.  </li>
            <li> (I stocked up on more papers at Sally&#x27;s, as many other beauty supply vendors only sell muslin).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all so its very economical and in my opinion barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li> It is a time commitment, because the wax takes about an hour to get to the right temperature (when the container is full), but it&#x27;s something you can plan ahead, so again, no big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After buying more applicators and a hard wax (also available on amazon) I am happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Waxing with the Gigi would take forever and the experience was never short of a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the price is amazing, as I am only now buying a second pot of wax (for $15) after seven months of using this wax every 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Note, someone mentioned (in another review) turning it on in the morning and being ready to wax by afternoon.  </li>
            <li> it was ready to go, so</li>
            <li> It is a very compact warmer which I find very helpful.  </li>
            <li> If you are a novice or an expert at this waxing thing definitely give Satin Smooth</li>
            <li> and it seemed ready to use).</li>
            <li> It was very sunburned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exclusively Gigi wax for years now, but decided to give this a try since the set costs almost as much as a Gigi warmer alone.</li>
            <li> its also very compact and effienct.</li>
            <li> While the wax is warming, take a relaxing shower and when your all done, the wax is ready to use.</li>
            <li> I went straight to the bathroom and set it up.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very girly person but someone told me waxing was better for your skin than shaving</li>
            <li> It works really well and even if you have never waxed before (like me)</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing the gloves because it is a real headache trying to get all the wax off of your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yeah, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I searched out different waxes and settled with SATIN SMOOTH TEA TREE WAX 14oz.</li>
            <li> Workd very well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li> I cut the strips into smaller strips to fit the areas I was waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> After that it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li> The kit comes in with a really neat package that would be presentable as a gift.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend purchasing the warmer collars (they have saved my warmer on numerous occasions and serve as a great resting place for the applicators) as well as additional cloth strips to save you the trip to the store later.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer is a compact size - smaller than I expected but in a good way.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does not include those covers for the warmers that would make the warmer much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better then the other wax products.</li>
            <li> when you go to a salon, you are left sticky even though they might give you some oil or whatsoever to clean yourself up, but still you have to spend some time to get to your home and take a shower, which is not the case when you do it yourself as you can jump into the shower immediately.    </li>
            <li> and I was left with 15-20% of the wax, most of the extra bottles coming with it, no strips and of course the warmer which made it a reasonably prices experience.</li>
            <li> so be sure to lay something down.     </li>
            <li> Somehow I stumbled upon reading something that said waxing was better for your skin and caused less irritation.  </li>
            <li> Last night I decided to give it one more try, and this time I only turned it on medium heat and waited for it to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This product is too difficult to use and produces moderate results at best.  </li>
            <li> Even without the collar I was able to avoid much mess by scraping off the applicator each time on the edge of the can.</li>
            <li> The directions say to heat on high for 30 minutes then lower to medium for another 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I bought it with high hopes, but here&#x27;s what i found.</li>
            <li> did as the directions said, heat at high for 30, then medium for 20-ish, but I think the aloe needs to be warmer than the medium heat.</li>
            <li> It was little to no pain and was also my first time doing it to myself!!!</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the only useful item regarding the lotions is the wax residue removing oil.</li>
            <li> Folica normally recommends good products and I was tired of buying iffy wax kits.  </li>
            <li> People more impatient than me would probably just grab a razor out of frustration.</li>
            <li> I am a professional, and this is the same stuff we use at the salon, the only difference is that it&#x27;s smaller, so it&#x27;s great for personal use.</li>
            <li> The wax takes at least an hour to warm up to a usable heat.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair on my legs, right up until my ankles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to tame the sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to at home waxing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I only test a small spot.</li>
            <li> The wax leaves your skin soft and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive enough for waxing eye brows, and strong enough to wax out under arms.</li>
            <li> The Gigi line has worked fine as far as removal of the hair,  but for some reason I find the gigi honey wax to be very hard to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I had my eyebrows waxed for the first time @ age 57 last week.  </li>
            <li> The second time I tried it, I also followed the instructions to a T, but for whatever reason the wax was too hot this time</li>
            <li> i am a first time at home waxer and although i need some practice with waxing, will never go back to shaving!</li>
            <li> Even though it was only my first time waxing I will never shave again.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely hesitant buying a product like this, sight unseen, but the reviews were positive, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> so the wax can warm properly and it can be very messy.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions, turned the warmer on high for about 30-40 minutes and left it on high while I waxed.</li>
            <li> Seller did send out replacement bottle but the pads are hard to find and only last for one good body waxing.</li>
            <li> I also want to warn people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It met my expectations completely.</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional waxes for over fifteen years.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I decided to give the old waxing at home a try in an effort to save money on this monthly costly expense.  </li>
            <li> It is by far</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had waxing done even professionally</li>
            <li> i wouldnt be surprised if they used this kit in salons.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard about it from friends who frequent Folica (the site that gave the award seen on this product&#x27;s page).  </li>
            <li> It took along time to heat up, the starter kit left out some things you should really have before you start.</li>
            <li> I really like the bottle of oil because it really does help with any extra left over wax.</li>
            <li> I now recommend purchasing &amp;#34;waxing gloves,&amp;#34; and use any old towels to cover your bathroom sink and floor.</li>
            <li> I really like the paper strips that are provided, as I can cut them into smaller strips.</li>
            <li> the wax pulls of my skin and having nice eyebrows or a bikini wax with scarred skin around it is not attractive.</li>
            <li> You also have to be very careful because wax gets very hot and can sometimes burn sensitive areas like brow.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, after using it, I think I made the right choice even though it was more expensive.   </li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t twirl the wax around stick as much as I should, the wax ended up getting onto my bathroom sink, floor, toilet, hands, fingers, bottles, and bathroom rugs.</li>
            <li> tried several different techniques, less wax, more wax, shorter hair, longer hair, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; if that makes sense... when I dip the applicator in, the wax seems to string (like a hot glue gun), so it gets a bit messy.</li>
            <li> takes forever to hit up and the whole process takes long.  </li>
            <li> This is my first waxing kit, but it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 tries, I did manage to pull a bit of skin off</li>
            <li> Can get really messy if not careful but is easy to clean with some goo gone and hard work.  </li>
            <li> The wax removes both dark leg hair and the fine blonde hairs on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> kit comes with some pre and post waxing creams, oils and antiseptic - major plus.  </li>
            <li> One of the major pluses: you get to use all the wax.</li>
            <li> The wax can be super messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> and I also purchased SATIN SMOOTH Calendula Gold Hard Wax with Tea Tree Oil, that I haven&#x27;t used yet.  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re a professional, this kit is too much work and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> They make cleanup much easier as nothing can drip on the warming unit and it makes it easier to lift the empty wax can out of the unit.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I was a complete novice to facial waxing.  </li>
            <li> No issues with the wax taking too long to heat up, and reasonable directions are included, so long as you have been waxed professionally before, so you know the general gist of how it works.</li>
            <li> but this product barely hurts at all.</li>
            <li> After just one leg waxing, I have enough wax to last me at least 20 more.</li>
            <li> I did this, and then just mirrored what they had done as far as the amount if wax to put on an applicator, and how to use the same strip to pick up leftover wax and stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to have red bumps directly after waxing, but the cooling gel and lotion help with that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only drawbacks are the normal drawbacks of waxing, and not specific to this product.  </li>
            <li> It kind of worked but left enough hair behind</li>
            <li> The correct use of this is to first heat up the can of wax at the highest temperature for 30 minutes, then turn it down to the lowest temperature for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> However, I have used other products such as GiGI that work just as good and make less of a mess.</li>
            <li> But if any wax is left over, good lluck removing it, the waaxremoving oil kinda works but not great, get ready to scrub HARD</li>
            <li> However, wax itself is VERY messy and you only need a little to warm up</li>
            <li> However, I would much rather use this kit than the other kit I had ( GiGi) .</li>
            <li> first time was a mess.</li>
            <li> If you plan on bringing this abroad, I would consider looking into other wax kits that don&#x27;t weigh as much.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to clean up, but if you know how to wax it should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a little messy, ITS WAX.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;professional waxer\\&quot; would use baby powder, which I&#x27;ll use next time to see if it&#x27;s any different.</li>
            <li> Well sad to say, I tried it twice and followed the instructions which stated to warm for 30 mins prior to using.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the wax is really sticky, so watch out when you first open it.</li>
            <li> only real problem I had was the \\&quot;strings\\&quot; that would hang down off the applicator.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs, maybe my hair was not long enough</li>
            <li> It is so simple and easy, however, can be a little messy which is understandable!</li>
            <li> The Aloe I discovered at my last waxing place - it is for sensitive skin and would not leave my face as red as when they used other waxes.</li>
            <li> the warmer, takes a little while to get your wax to where you need it, i leave it on high (I can take the heat).  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to heat up...30 minutes on high</li>
            <li> Also i&#x27;ve found the wax residue removing oil to not be brlliant, but as I have some of a different brand its not a major issue.</li>
            <li> this kit also comes with some large and small (for eye brows, etc.) strips.</li>
            <li> I actually did my eyebrows first, which I was afraid to do as a first time self-waxer.</li>
            <li> do not use the aloe cooling gel, it burned my skin and left a dry patch.</li>
            <li> The bottles of product are larger than I expected, and actually work well.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that they really do not include enough applicator sticks, even for a starter kit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it took long for them to send it.</li>
            <li> But after multiple tries we give up!&lt;br /&gt;The strips did not remove the hair or the wax.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that annoyed me was that the wax took about an hour to heat up (the first time)</li>
            <li> when you go to a salon, at least those NOT very expensive ones that I have tried in NYC</li>
            <li> I might try other waxes from this brand for my next wax or I might stick to this one as it worked well, so why bother?</li>
            <li> i would totally reccommend it and will never buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Plus, it takes time to dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me to go through waiting to have the skin grow back on my face.</li>
            <li> I typically go to a salon, but the kit is fairly simple to use.</li>
            <li> and OMG it made a big mess.</li>
            <li> Armpit hair doesn&#x27;t always grow the same direction so has to be waxed one little area after another.</li>
            <li> I read all the directions carefully and did not have any problems.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few complaints.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred the All Purpose pink wax instead.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t careful once, and the oil leaked everywhere because it was on it&#x27;s side</li>
            <li> I recommend letting the hair grow out as much as you can stand as it tends to leave behind patches (which I chalk-up to my inexperience).</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t ever supposed to double-dip them or you can build up nasty bacteria in your wax, but Amazon has good prices on big boxes of applicators.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- then it&#x27;s coarse, black, and dense!  </li>
            <li> A little went a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product takes the hair right off and it is far less painful.</li>
            <li> Even though it worked ok I was frustrated with the mess (wax on the plate, counters, getting it off my face, etc).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry - the machine and can of wax are inside a separate plastic bag in the shipment, so they didn&#x27;t get oily, but all the other bottles of stuff, and the packet with the strips and applicators, were greasy.  </li>
            <li> WAX EXTREMELY STICKY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But some of them are such, that I have found them to be oily in the past.</li>
            <li> Fave it a four star because when I received it one of the bottles of liquid had spilt all over the bag and other products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try their other waxes too.</li>
            <li> experience, after several months of exclusively waxing, is that my hair grows in very very slowly and much less coarse.  </li>
            <li> (it had been securely closed and screwed tight).</li>
            <li> Be careful where you store it though as I accidentally had it tilt a little and</li>
            <li> After going to a beauty salon for facial waxing a few times over the past year I quickly realized this could get very expensive over time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s faster as the amount of wax goes down overtime.</li>
            <li> and it can get messy when you are trying to figure out how to wax other parts of the body besides your face.</li>
            <li> May be cream waxes are less sticky,</li>
            <li> They are black.</li>
            <li> the less</li>
            <li> (I read online that this is typical with waxing, but found that using cornstarch on my skin before applying the wax, prevents this).</li>
            <li> The price is less than one waxing appointment at a salon (depending on the salon of course).  </li>
            <li> Now I never need to go to the waxing salons, and can trash all my previous waxing products.</li>
            <li> The house was a mess after using the product.  </li>
            <li> It cuts out having to cut strips and cuts out the mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too sticky and makes a mess with its sticky fly-aways.</li>
            <li> So for those of you complaining about the mess, you all didn&#x27;t do your research.</li>
            <li> was a little warmer than the medium setting.  </li>
            <li> You have to plan ahead a little</li>
            <li> Even if it was painful, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> Did it for a few years with microwave wax, worked</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is so messy with the muslin strips (woven), at times the wax seeps out a bit and onto your hands when you rub the strip before hair removal.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t done this before, or if you&#x27;re used to the ready-to-use wax strips like Sally Hansen&#x27;s, you&#x27;re in for a messy surprise.</li>
            <li> but one bottle was missing, 2 were leaking and got over everything.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> applicators\\&quot; -- they&#x27;re Popsicle sticks, for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, that hair doesn&#x27;t even grow anymore, or just a few hairs at a time.  </li>
            <li> I already knew that wax was messy and knew how to handle it.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very little and light-colored - not at all what&#x27;s been happening to me the past few years at the waxing place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am a little clumsy at it.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s very little I can complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, the small bottles do help along the way.</li>
            <li> I usually shave and not often because my skin get&#x27;s so irritated and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re using it for something like JUST brows or a small area I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you do what the instruction book says, you will have no issues with poor hair removal, burns, or any of the other issues people whine about.  </li>
            <li> It can be a serious serious mess</li>
            <li> this one that comes with this kit is a hard wax.</li>
            <li> One point about it though, was that as soon as I put it on my skin, I had to put the strip and do the rest, if not, then it would have gotten really hard.</li>
            <li> mention the wax is hard to get off of surfaces, but I purchased it anyway ...</li>
            <li> It was painful and left a sticky, hairy mess</li>
            <li> It was a little red but not anything too bad.</li>
            <li> Yeah, you&#x27;d think that was common sense, but I forgot and still had my make-up on when I did this before bed.&lt;br /&gt;*Do</li>
            <li> Also, the gel feels sticky and thick as you put it.</li>
            <li> but it made me break out like crazy wherever I used it, ever single time.</li>
            <li> Waxing oneself can be hard to do because some spots are just tough to get.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit wary about trying it again, so I waited for a few months.  </li>
            <li> The wax that came with it (honey) sucks sucks sucks!!</li>
            <li> Amazon did reply to my complaint but the seller, Nada!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had if for approximately a month now and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I just received this in today&#x27;s UPS and rushed upstairs to plug it in since I am about a week behind on my waxing maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Tired of spending $60+ each month at the salon for waxing I thought i&#x27;d try at home.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I now need to learn how to put on false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> With that said, it has been a little difficult to get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> As a student, waxing at a salon can be unreasonably expensive and shaving quite frankly gives me annoying morning itches, leaving me only to shave my darkened and bumpy skin once again.</li>
            <li> and if it gets on your counter it sucks!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say,</li>
            <li> Dont&#x27; know if this issue was because I did something wrong, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO WRONG.</li>
            <li> Sorry to keep harping on &amp;#34;follow the instructions,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> : Apply very thin layers of warm/hot wax.</li>
            <li> Packing was very poor.</li>
            <li> Also, use VERY thin layers of wax b/c removing the excess is a pain.</li>
            <li> This wax is so messy and hurts terribly.</li>
            <li> ; but I can&#x27;t stand when people get on here and write ridiculous bad reviews because they haven&#x27;t bothered to, you guessed it, read the instructions!  </li>
            <li> The skin cleaner prep isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> And the removal of the hair wasn&#x27;t as painful as with the gigi.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is sick.</li>
            <li> all the wax poured out into the kit. :(</li>
            <li> You need to let your hair grow out to wax it, so if you don&#x27;t like having stubbly legs or whatnot, it will be annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The wax itself is awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It had everything in the skit.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> For a starter kit, this is all you need! First time ever attempting in-home waxing, and I love it! Sure it&#x27;s a little messy, ITS WAX. Just have to know what your doing. :)</li>
            <li> Like majority of people: decided to wax myself because of the excessif prices out there, and between you and me, they are not that good: hair come back after 2 weeks when it should be minimum 3!    Did it for a few years with microwave wax, worked okay but kind of borring to go every 20 minutes to warm it again. Now I can just controle it!!! And the kit has been ship very fast and the packaging: worth the money!!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I ordered this to replace my Gigi that has served me well. I&#x27;ve had if for approximately a month now and decided to try it. Well sad to say, I tried it twice and followed the instructions which stated to warm for 30 mins prior to using. Like I said tried it twice and the wax still hasn&#x27;t melted. The power light came on but the wax didn&#x27;t budge. I even left it on for an hour and still nothing.  Maybe I got a defected product, but I will return.</li>
            <li> I was definitely hesitant buying a product like this, sight unseen, but the reviews were positive, so I gave it a try. This is a well-organized kit, with great instructions, and great storage system, so it&#x27;s not out on the bathroom counter all the time. I love it, because I don&#x27;t have to take time to go to the salon, or work around the kids&#x27; schedules. It&#x27;s quick and easy to set up, is used just like at the salon, cleans up easily with the wax-remover (included), and surprisingly, works just as well as waxing at the salon, with less pain. Also, it more than pays for itself in money saved from paying for the service and tipping the technician at the salon :)</li>
            <li> I just received this in today&#x27;s UPS and rushed upstairs to plug it in since I am about a week behind on my waxing maintenance.  This is a great kit, the wax removes everything in one go, and the non-fabric strips have always worked better for me (in drugstore waxing kits).  However, the bottle of Wax Residue Remover (oil) leaked inside the shipping box, and got all over everything.  Don&#x27;t worry - the machine and can of wax are inside a separate plastic bag in the shipment, so they didn&#x27;t get oily, but all the other bottles of stuff, and the packet with the strips and applicators, were greasy.  The problem was that the seal inside the lid of the bottle was not sealed properly.  Otherwise, 100% great, 5 stars, love it.    Note, someone mentioned (in another review) turning it on in the morning and being ready to wax by afternoon.  I plugged mine in at 3PM and by 3:30 it was ready to go, so I don&#x27;t know what that person&#x27;s talking about.  It&#x27;s 3:41 right now :-)</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what I needed. The wax works great, everything is fine. The directions say to heat on high for 30 minutes then lower to medium for another 30 minutes and then if it&#x27;s too hot for the person to lower it from there. Aside from that, the only useful item regarding the lotions is the wax residue removing oil. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. The skin cleaner prep isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s very strong smelling and I&#x27;d prefer to just wash the area first. I also want to warn people with sensitive skin do not use the aloe cooling gel, it burned my skin and left a dry patch. I&#x27;m very glad I only test a small spot. It&#x27;s still sore now and I will not be using that again. Other than that, great deal for what you get.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I just got it in the mail today and used it right away. I have used other products before to do my own bikini area and eyebrows. This product takes the hair right off and it is far less painful. I am very satisfied with all the products that were included with this purchase. The only negative is that the wax is really sticky, so watch out when you first open it. However, I would much rather use this kit than the other kit I had ( GiGi) . Even the after feel is great, it leaves your skin feeling smooth. I would recommend this kit to anyone, it is well worth the money. :)</li>
            <li> Great wax pot. Needs more strips and stix but very worth the purchase and great delivery time! It met my expectations completely. I would go ahead and purchase wax strips and stix when you buy it though.</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional waxes for over fifteen years.  Eventually, I decided to give the old waxing at home a try in an effort to save money on this monthly costly expense.  I have owned two gigi waxing warmers and have used their line of products faithfully.  The Gigi line has worked fine as far as removal of the hair,  but for some reason I find the gigi honey wax to be very hard to clean up.  Not to mention it is so messy with the muslin strips (woven), at times the wax seeps out a bit and onto your hands when you rub the strip before hair removal.  Waxing with the Gigi would take forever and the experience was never short of a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got rid of my old gigi and decided to give Satin Smooth a try.  I am so glad I did.  It is by far the easiest and most effective waxing kid I have ever come across.  It is a very compact warmer which I find very helpful.  The wax itself is incredibly effective It removes all the hair with one peel.  Amazing. It comes with non woven strips (so much better than the musiln strips. Also, the wax is so easy to remove (when you get it on yourself or an unwanted surface).  I noticed that with the SS warmer the wax is heated at a perfect temperature, as apposed to the gigi which always got too hot.  And the removal of the hair wasn&#x27;t as painful as with the gigi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with some pre and post waxing creams, oils and antiseptic - major plus.  And it comes perfectly packaged in a large plastic bag - which makes storing a breeze.  If you are a novice or an expert at this waxing thing definitely give Satin Smooth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hairless and happy.  ;)</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on salon waxing, I wanted to try doing it myself. This setup worked perfectly for me. The warmer heats up quickly (just put it on high and leave it for 20 - 30 minutes, depending on how full the can is). The wax removes both dark leg hair and the fine blonde hairs on the back of my hands. The strips can be reused multiple times and don&#x27;t leave lint residue like muslin strips. The bottles of product are larger than I expected, and actually work well. Only thing I&#x27;d change is to include paper collars for the wax pot. They make cleanup much easier as nothing can drip on the warming unit and it makes it easier to lift the empty wax can out of the unit. They&#x27;re cheap; add a pack to your order.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit after reading tons of reviews from amazon, folica, and more..so, I decided to give it a chance.  The packaging was good and everything was as expected when I got the kit.  Before I buy it, I was thinking may be I could buy a wax and waxing strips separately and use the microwave to heat it up, but I thought it is going to be a hassle trying to keep its temperature and going back and forth to the microwave when you are all sticky and probably a bit nervous because you are doing it yourself. Anyhow, after using it, I think I made the right choice even though it was more expensive.   I had read reviews saying that the wax is too sticky that you cannot use it, but I had no issue with that. I just covered the floor with newspapers, warmed the wax (started using it after 1 hour of warming it up, but I checked it sooner as well and it seemed ready to use). May be cream waxes are less sticky, this one that comes with this kit is a hard wax. One point about it though, was that as soon as I put it on my skin, I had to put the strip and do the rest, if not, then it would have gotten really hard. So, as long as you are fast, you are good to go.   For me, it was a very good experience. My boyfriend helped me with it, but I think I can do it my self from now on as well. Some more positive points about this for me are that:  1. when you go to a salon, you are paying much more.  2. when you go to a salon, you have to spend more time and money just to go there.  3. when you go to a salon, there is a risk that they don&#x27;t comply with the rules that they should and even if you refuse to continue with them, then you have lost your time and money for going there. Plus, it has been a nightmare for me to find a good salon in the City during the past 3 years I have been living here.  4. when you go to a salon, at least those NOT very expensive ones that I have tried in NYC, they don&#x27;t take care of your skin as you do yourself. Like they don&#x27;t necessarily use the pre/post lotions on your skin.  5. when you go to a salon, you are left sticky even though they might give you some oil or whatsoever to clean yourself up, but still you have to spend some time to get to your home and take a shower, which is not the case when you do it yourself as you can jump into the shower immediately.    The oils and all the bottles that come with it all worked well as well. The plastic bag that comes with the package makes the kit easy and neat to store.    I did my legs, bikini line,  belly, underarms and arms and I was left with 15-20% of the wax, most of the extra bottles coming with it, no strips and of course the warmer which made it a reasonably prices experience. I might try other waxes from this brand for my next wax or I might stick to this one as it worked well, so why bother?</li>
            <li> Tired of spending $60+ each month at the salon for waxing I thought i&#x27;d try at home. This is a good kit for someone whose just starting as it has everything you need. The wax warmer is a compact size - smaller than I expected but in a good way. The wax would be useable after 30 mins of warming up. My only complaints are that this kit did not come with the muslin fabric waxing strips as advertised, but instead with disposable cottony feeling ones. I would have prefered the reusable muslin strips. Also i&#x27;ve found the wax residue removing oil to not be brlliant, but as I have some of a different brand its not a major issue. Don&#x27;t expect a super detailed instruction booklet. There are no pictures/drawings and no fancy DVD. If you&#x27;ve never had waxing done even professionally I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this kit. Go watch a pro waxer first to see how its done.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I was a complete novice to facial waxing.  After going to a beauty salon for facial waxing a few times over the past year I quickly realized this could get very expensive over time. That is why I purchased this product.  I read all the directions carefully and did not have any problems.  I would have liked to have a \\&quot;collar\\&quot; around the wax container and that&#x27;s the only thing I would add to this starter kit.  Even without the collar I was able to avoid much mess by scraping off the applicator each time on the edge of the can. It was easy and quick (1 hour) to heat the wax and the best temperature for the actual waxing was a little warmer than the medium setting.  The wax works perfectly.  The skin care products are also nice and gentle. It took me only 30 minutes including set up and cleanup, excluding time to warm the wax.  I would recommend this product but like anything else you must follow the directions for safe use.</li>
            <li> Okay I bought this as a first wax warmer for myself. The wax pot i got looks different than pictured though. The wax warmer is PERFECT for me, it warms up the wax evenly, and has a dial to adjust the temp. Also, the warmer has a handle that makes it so easy to move around as i do each leg, so instead of moving my whole body and position, i just easily move the warmer.     The extras that come with this kit are great as well.   *I LOVE the wax remover. It is an oil and it feels really great on the skin after you are done waxing, and it takes the wax off skin very easily.   *The pre-cleanse is great for use before (i also apply it after i am done waxing).  *the aloe is alright, its just aloe, but i do use it every time i wax.   *The lotion this kit comes with is alright, i prefer to use the aloe, but sometimes i will allpy this the day after i wax my legs.   * this kit also comes with some large and small (for eye brows, etc.) strips. They are the white ones , and not the muslin ones, which is GREAT. i prefer these strips over the muslin ones.   *This kit ALSO comes with sticks! I love that they include the smallers ones for eye brows, and largers ones for legs.   * and i love the wax that this kit comes with. I like it much better than Gigi wax.     I also love that this wax pot holds basically any type of wax can. it hold gigi, suddeny smooth, satin smooth, all of it! its great!    *DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO A BIKINI WAX WITH IS WAX!!!!*</li>
            <li> This was a great deal.  It is comparable to salons but you have the comfort of doing it at home.  The price it right too.</li>
            <li> This is my first home waxing kit and I have loved it.I have used it multiple times and it works so well. I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a great product at a great deal!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter (who is 20) and she uses it regularly. Everything she could possibly need for waxing.  I have a story to go with this though.  She tried it on her stomach one evening and it was definately too hot. It was a little red but not anything too bad. The next day she went tanning.  She got home and whinned that where she waxed hurt.  She showed me her belly and were the wax had been was very red. It was very sunburned.  She suffered for a couple days but lesson learned don&#x27;t go tanning a day after waxing. :) A month later that spot on her belly is darker than everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exclusively Gigi wax for years now, but decided to give this a try since the set costs almost as much as a Gigi warmer alone. The wax is a great consistency. The warmer doesn&#x27;t get super hot, but works just fine on high. I was able to do my bikini line and armpits with no problem. Also, the ingredients in the extra bottles are great - the wax remover is made up of natural oils AND removes wax that dripped on the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> I only have a few complaints. 1) the wax pulls of my skin and having nice eyebrows or a bikini wax with scarred skin around it is not attractive. 2)it doesnt come with nearly enough waxing strips or applicators so you must buy additional accesories to go along with the kit. 3)the wax remover only works on your skin but you must use a wash cloth and a great amount of the wax remover. it doesnt come off fabrics or countertops easily if at all. and 4)it doesnt always pull of the hair so make sure you buy an eyebrow razor because you arent suppose to continually wax the same area over and over. With the exception of that, this is a good kit. i wouldnt be surprised if they used this kit in salons. it comes with EVERYTHING you need for your first three waxes. after that you have to buy more applicators and waxing strips. the wax warmer heats up the wax in 15 mins and cool fast when finished. its also very compact and effienct. youll have more than enough wax. worth the money if you continue to use over time. im glad i got it. its a nice experience.</li>
            <li> This is the best kit. I use it every 2 weeks and it saves me lots of money....</li>
            <li> I had my eyebrows waxed for the first time @ age 57 last week.  I paid $10.00 for the procedure and knew I could do this myself.  I brought this little gem that has everything included and did a very good job waxing my own eyebrows.  I could not be more happy with this purchase.  I am going to a second one for back-up.    You wil not be dissappointed with this kit.  I now need to learn how to put on false eyelashes.  I need Help.  Please send your videos and suggestions.</li>
            <li> Great wax kit. Took longer than expected to ship but the machine is great has a handle that gives it an A+ if you need to move your warmer you won&#x27;t get burned didn&#x27;t come with enough sticks or strips. But eventually you have to buy more anyway.</li>
            <li> It is a great product! Those that say it isnt are only saying that because they don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly, it works great and perfect for your personal use!</li>
            <li> I used microwave kits for years. Why?  They&#x27;re better than being hairy but not by much - all that time trying to get the temp right only to spend the rest of the afternoon waxing and rewaxing, then cleaning up spilt wax (and often cleaning the microwave and/or plate too!). I bought this because I heard about it from friends who frequent Folica (the site that gave the award seen on this product&#x27;s page).  Folica normally recommends good products and I was tired of buying iffy wax kits.  I figured anything recommended by Folica HAD to be better - though just about anything would be an improvement.  Oh. My. God.  Cleaner, neater, and it really did remove even my most stubborn hair!  In one try!  I will never, ever use another microwave wax kit!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the waxing kit, as soon as I received it today I followed the directions and was waxing within an hour.  I love this system! Best $36 Ive spent and it beats spending $15 or more at the salon.  Now I can wax at home and dont have to worry about covering the redness on my eyes after I wax.  This system was just how what I hoped it would be and more.  I do wish the applicators (which were basically just popsicle sticks) were more rounded and pointed for better definition.  I was apprehensive about buying a waxing system as I&#x27;ve never waxed my eyebrows on my own, but it was so easy and im very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t done this before, or if you&#x27;re used to the ready-to-use wax strips like Sally Hansen&#x27;s, you&#x27;re in for a messy surprise. It can be a serious serious mess so be sure to lay something down.     You don&#x27;t need much at all so its very economical and in my opinion barely hurts at all. Very happy with the product and do not regret purchasing it. It IS a lot of work though. (Legs and Bikini took me well over two hours)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Used it once and NEVER using it again.  I had a huge burn in my thigh for days.  The house was a mess after using the product.  takes forever to hit up and the whole process takes long.  I am not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li> I must admit that this is the best beauty investment I have made lately! It is very simple to use. While the wax is warming, take a relaxing shower and when your all done, the wax is ready to use. The wax leaves the skin so silky and smooth! I love it! As a first time waxer, it did not hurt a bit as portrayed in the movies. I do suggest to stock up on strips and the wax can collars will help keep the warmer clean from any drips. I recommend this simple product. GREAT!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this for mothers day!! I went straight to the bathroom and set it up. It is very easy to use. The wax it came with I used for my legs, eyebrows, and mustache. It was little to no pain and was also my first time doing it to myself!!! The extra bottles it came with work great also! I would highly recomend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> For a couple of years now I had been waxing my face using the box kits where you put the wax in the microwave to heat it up.  Even though it worked ok I was frustrated with the mess (wax on the plate, counters, getting it off my face, etc).  So I decided to try this kit.  The first time I used it I followed the instructions to a T, and it worked fine.  The second time I tried it, I also followed the instructions to a T, but for whatever reason the wax was too hot this time and I ended up having burned spots on my face.  Needless to say, but I was a bit wary about trying it again, so I waited for a few months.  Last night I decided to give it one more try, and this time I only turned it on medium heat and waited for it to heat up.  It never did heat up enough to entirely melt all the wax, so I decided to give it a go anyway.  I did the first strip, which seemed ok at the time.  I realized later it got on my lip and took some of the skin off my lip.  Did the second strip which seemed ok.  Then I did the 3rd strip, and it took most of the top layer of skin off my upper lip.  So today I&#x27;m walking around with big red blotchy patches on my face where the skin was taken off. Never again will I use this product.  Dont&#x27; know if this issue was because I did something wrong, but I&#x27;ll go have my face waxed by a professional before I&#x27;ll do it on my own again.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me to go through waiting to have the skin grow back on my face.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this kit. This is my first waxing kit, but it worked as expected. No issues with the wax taking too long to heat up, and reasonable directions are included, so long as you have been waxed professionally before, so you know the general gist of how it works. I used this for facial waxing, but will likely give my legs a try soon.</li>
            <li> This waxing kit is the perfect size. It also came the next day! It&#x27;s worth it. No need for anything else. You would have to purchase extra spatulas and waxing strips.</li>
            <li> It took along time to heat up, the starter kit left out some things you should really have before you start. It also doesn&#x27;t give you many applicators. The honey wax it comes with did not impress me. I used it on my legs, maybe my hair was not long enough but I couldn&#x27;t go more than a week with mega hairy legs. It kind of worked but left enough hair behind I ended up having to shave anyway to be smooth. After buying more applicators and a hard wax (also available on amazon) I am happier with this product.</li>
            <li> The kit has everything you need to wax...period! i am a first time at home waxer and although i need some practice with waxing, will never go back to shaving! the warmer, takes a little while to get your wax to where you need it, i leave it on high (I can take the heat).  The wax strips provided are great, especially since i have bought woven ones as a replacement.  I think the non woven strips are the right way to go.  Also, the lotion and aloe and pre cleanser are great, i don&#x27;t use them nearly as often as i use the wax remover though!  I found if you use a cotton ball to remove the excess wax it conserves the oil and is most effective in being sticky free!   If you are looking to start a DIY at home wax regime this is the kit to get you on your way!</li>
            <li> This is definitely better then the other wax products. It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin as much so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. It is still sticky though. Just have to becareful is all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very girly person but someone told me waxing was better for your skin than shaving so I wanted to try it. I had never heard of this company before but noticed all the reviews were excellent, and for a good reason. The warmer is genius, although it may take about 20 mins to heat up all the way through, the warmer keeps it at your own personal temperature the whole time, saving time and A LOT of wax. One of the major pluses: you get to use all the wax. The lotion, pre-wax cleanse and post-wax remover are just fantastic, I&#x27;m so glad I bought this kit!</li>
            <li> I love this starter kit! It works really well and even if you have never waxed before (like me) it is super easy to use. The wax leaves your skin soft and smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does not include those covers for the warmers that would make the warmer much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser kind of work I use this all the time. now that I&#x27;m a stay home mom I have no time to be waxed. So ordering this product was the best thing I ever did. I&#x27;m a hundred percent satisfied</li>
            <li> Best wax kit. Comes with very cute bag where you can store them after waxing.</li>
            <li> As a student, waxing at a salon can be unreasonably expensive and shaving quite frankly gives me annoying morning itches, leaving me only to shave my darkened and bumpy skin once again. I was done with it all. I was ready to attempt waxing my fuzzy-bear legs with my own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could tell everyone in middle school to buy this starter kit and rid them of the years they were about to spend growing multiple hairs from one follicle and putting band-aids after that occasional rushed shaving. Let&#x27;s face it. Shaving does more damage than good. And the two top reasons people say they don&#x27;t wax are 1) It hurts a lot and 2) It&#x27;s expensive. THEY ARE SO WRONG. Yeah, it&#x27;s not as painless as shaving but this product barely hurts at all. Even if it was painful, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the bottles they gave for before/after waxing and while the appliers (aka big Popsicle sticks) and paper strips run out fast, they can be easily found at dollar stores. The only thing that annoyed me was that the wax took about an hour to heat up (the first time) but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s faster as the amount of wax goes down overtime. After just one leg waxing, I have enough wax to last me at least 20 more. Considering this would have cost me more than $1000 at salons, there&#x27;s very little I can complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY 4 STAR, NOT 5?&lt;br /&gt;My first time was a mess. This wax is stickier than anything I&#x27;ve put on my skin!! The ones used on me in salons (pink) don&#x27;t stick nearly as much at all and clean up so easily. I feel like I used 1/4 of my wax remover solution (given in kit) to clean my hands and my bathroom floor. People more impatient than me would probably just grab a razor out of frustration. I&#x27;m betting with more experience I&#x27;ll be able to tame the sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Apply very thin layers of warm/hot wax. Use the paper strips 3-5 times on different areas on leg. (They pick up more than you think!) Definitely recommend a friend/parent/sig.other to help you get areas you can&#x27;t reach, esp. the armpit. Armpit hair doesn&#x27;t always grow the same direction so has to be waxed one little area after another. WAX ON EASILY CLEANABLE SURFACES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: WAX EXTREMELY STICKY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Totally worth the $40. Salon-quality results.</li>
            <li> Pros: It does the job for any area of the body. I like the kit because it has all the essentials. Plus, the small bottles do help along the way. I really like the bottle of oil because it really does help with any extra left over wax. I liked that strips and sticks it came with too, but I eventually had to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It weighs a lot. The can of wax weighs a lot. If you plan on bringing this abroad, I would consider looking into other wax kits that don&#x27;t weigh as much. Also, I wish the kit came with &amp;#34;special waxing gloves&amp;#34; that you see salon owners use. They are black. I plan on purchasing the gloves because it is a real headache trying to get all the wax off of your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product and it does the job. I&#x27;m a newbie at this and it can get messy when you are trying to figure out how to wax other parts of the body besides your face. It takes practice and patience. Make sure after you dip the wooden stick into the wax to twirl the wax around the stick like you would with warm caramel. Because I didn&#x27;t twirl the wax around stick as much as I should, the wax ended up getting onto my bathroom sink, floor, toilet, hands, fingers, bottles, and bathroom rugs. XD I now recommend purchasing &amp;#34;waxing gloves,&amp;#34; and use any old towels to cover your bathroom sink and floor. AND make sure you have enough time to do all of this.. DO NOT be in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Love the kit.  Its compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It gets rid of 99% of the hair on the first try. However, I have used other products such as GiGI that work just as good and make less of a mess. This product is hard to clean up, but if you know how to wax it should not be a problem. I would recommend this product for people who want a quality product and have experience in body waxing.</li>
            <li> Really great value and works perfectly. Pays for itself in no time</li>
            <li> I love this wax kit! It is so simple and easy, however, can be a little messy which is understandable! It takes a little while to heat up...30 minutes on high and then another 30 minutes on medium heat. That is kind of a hassle since I really only use it for my upper lip! :) Be careful where you store it though as I accidentally had it tilt a little and all the wax poured out into the kit. :( It took forever to clean up. I have only used the cleanser and the wax remover (which is very handy!).</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps someone who do not like smelling products! If you don&#x27;t want smells, DO NOT BUY THIS. But still, read through for the entire review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I don&#x27;t have this kit but I ordered from an external seller - this satin smooth aloe smoother - the dark green bottle that you see in the kit! I bought it with high hopes, but here&#x27;s what i found. For one it&#x27;s not oily. Yes, i know its a gel, so ideally it shouldnt be oily. But some of them are such, that I have found them to be oily in the past. This one&#x27;s not. But it has a smell to it, which is really strong when you are applying the gel. Plus, it takes time to dry out. As it dries out, the smell is not that strong anymore, but quite pleasant. But I personally, still don&#x27;t like the smell.  Also, the gel feels sticky and thick as you put it. But as it dries out, it ain&#x27;t sticky anymore plus your skin does feel smooth. It has a cooling effect, which is however, relatively mild. Nothing tooo cool...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s alright, but nothing extra-ordinary. I gave it 3 stars bcoz I can&#x27;t stand any smell in products like this. At first, the smell is indeed strong! But it lessens as the gel dries. However mild or strong, I just can&#x27;t bear smells!&lt;br /&gt;Rest this product is OK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a nice after wax soothing lotion, Try RICA. I have been using it for a long time and I am hooked. It&#x27;s way tooo great as compared to this minus the smell. However, I don&#x27;t think they have it on amazon, so check out their site or google.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described, easy to use and works great. Don&#x27;t look any further for anything else as this is the one.</li>
            <li> First at home wax kit I&#x27;ve bought and I love it. Very easy to use. All the products work great that come with kit. I will have to purchase more applicators, doesn&#x27;t come with too many. Would recommend to others for sure.</li>
            <li> Wanted to learn how to wax myself. The quality of the products is pretty good-really liked the almond oil to remove stubborn wax and aloe gel for cooling. However, wax itself is VERY messy and you only need a little to warm up (I only used for brow and lip). You also have to be very careful because wax gets very hot and can sometimes burn sensitive areas like brow. I had a lot of difficulty try to remove stubborn hair. Unless you&#x27;re a professional, this kit is too much work and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Pls DONOT use this product. Its not wax, it should be called super glue or some kind of glue used for carpentary work. Inspite of taking many precautions a drop or two spilled over the floor and OMG it made a big mess. Even Bleach and Lizol together couldnot get it off the floor. Plssssssssss donot read the good reviews and buy dis product , I did the same thing and now I regret my decision. Forget the floor it wouldnt get off my skin. The residue doesnot come off even after scrubbing. It was all over my fingers. This product is sick.</li>
            <li> Love this waxer and it works great! Fave it a four star because when I received it one of the bottles of liquid had spilt all over the bag and other products. Just need to find a way to send the products so that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> perfect! if you are a licensed cosmetologist like me this is great!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to heat use and cap! Both my Grand Daughter and my self both have found it perfect for all our waxing needs!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, I was hesitant to purchase this product when I read one of the reviews mention the wax is hard to get off of surfaces, but I purchased it anyway ... it so happen I had an accident of my own, it got on my bathroom sink and I was so ticked, two days passed before I tried to clean it. I put some of the wax residue remover oil (that comes with the kit), made sure the entire waxed are was covered, used a towel with some elbow grease and it came right out, if I had known it was that easy I would have cleaned it right away. I would recommend this product to anyone, it works. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> i have never come back online to rate something i have bought, but i have to share that this waxing kit is the best i have ever used. i would totally reccommend it and will never buy any other brand. the wax strips are excellent, and the 4 lotions and gels are fun to use and remind me of being at a salon. i was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a professional, and this is the same stuff we use at the salon, the only difference is that it&#x27;s smaller, so it&#x27;s great for personal use.</li>
            <li> Great product! Supet speedy shipping!</li>
            <li> used one of theses at my cosmetology school &amp; had to get one for myself, I love it, heats up in a good amount of time. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my daughter last year for Christmas.  She was thrilled.  Then once she used it, she was even more thrilled. She still raves about what a great waxing kit it is. She loves the extra oils and stuff that came with it.  It was well worth what I paid. It pays for itself in 3 uses. She hasn&#x27;t needed any replacement items yet except for the applicator sticks and strips for removing the wax.  I am very pleased with the purchase. I hope to get a kit for myself soon.</li>
            <li> The kit itself is excellent. Perfect for a beginner, I love all that&#x27;s included. The wax itself is awful! I&#x27;m new to at home waxing so I am a little clumsy at it. This wax is so messy and hurts terribly. I&#x27;m still glad I bought the kit, if you buy this kit just know that you may want to get a different wax. Satin smooth had a great hard wax with tea tree oil. It cuts out having to cut strips and cuts out the mess.</li>
            <li> This product works great and would definitely butymore of. I would definitely do business with this company again.  Very Happy.</li>
            <li> This kit is great for at home waxing. Heats up fast and is easy to move around. The kit comes with a lot of useful things.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter kit.  Very good price too.</li>
            <li> I got this around Christmas and just finally used it last night. I&#x27;ve been scared because when I get waxed by \\&quot;professionals\\&quot;, some of my upper lip gets ripped off, then scabs over for a week! Yeah, really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought extra stuff, like the Aloe wax along with some extra strips and applicators. The Aloe I discovered at my last waxing place - it is for sensitive skin and would not leave my face as red as when they used other waxes. [Note: \\&quot;as red\\&quot; - still leaves it red for a bit, but not as bright nor as long.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as the directions said, heat at high for 30, then medium for 20-ish, but I think the aloe needs to be warmer than the medium heat. Next time, I&#x27;m going med-high when I apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real problem I had was the \\&quot;strings\\&quot; that would hang down off the applicator. I was worried they would cling to my eyebrows and pull off hair I didn&#x27;t want removed. No such deal - whew! I&#x27;ll have to learn to twirl the applicator better. Or it was too cool and that&#x27;s why I had strings. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use cornstarch on my upper lip after using the before-wax cleanser. My \\&quot;professional waxer\\&quot; would use baby powder, which I&#x27;ll use next time to see if it&#x27;s any different. It helps lift the hair, supposedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a nutshell - this was great! I actually did my eyebrows first, which I was afraid to do as a first time self-waxer. I even waxed the top part of my brows! Came out clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My upper lip came out better than the \\&quot;pros\\&quot;. [Yeah, okay, I use cheap pros instead of spa pros.] I did take off a smidge of skin, but it was my own fault. I missed a hunk of hair and even though I know not to do it twice because it will rip, I did it anyway. However, it&#x27;s very little and light-colored - not at all what&#x27;s been happening to me the past few years at the waxing place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was easy and not-so-scary - and I can only get better! So happy I got this - and finally used it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons after first waxing:&lt;br /&gt;*For Aloe (which I bought separately), go higher than medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;*Wash face when you plug in waxer. [Still over 30 mins before you wax] Yeah, you&#x27;d think that was common sense, but I forgot and still had my make-up on when I did this before bed.&lt;br /&gt;*Do not repeat waxing if you miss a spot. Wait another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: the little bottles that come with it are great! Better than the stuff they use at the waxing place! REALLY happy with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This product is too difficult to use and produces moderate results at best.  Would not buy this again at any price.</li>
            <li> This was a great present for my wife. She loved it. Easy to use. I will buy this again whenever she needs it.</li>
            <li> This kit is really cheap. I originally bought it for my sister to use on another wax oit kit I bought her. I didn&#x27;t know this had a wax lot. Non the less it&#x27;s awesome and for the price I highlynsuggest it</li>
            <li> I have never waxed before.  I usually shave and not often because my skin get&#x27;s so irritated and itchy.  Somehow I stumbled upon reading something that said waxing was better for your skin and caused less irritation.  I have never given waxing a consideration.  I searched some Youtube \\&quot;how to&#x27;s\\&quot; and noticed the two different brands used.  Then I hopped onto Amazon to check out some prices and reviews.  The Gigi didn&#x27;t fair as well in reviews and this product comes with more (as far as lotions/gels).  The warmer also has different levels for heating.  I like this because it gives you, the consumer, better control.  I followed the directions exactly and it worked great.  I also bought two additional waxes.  For my first time use I I used something for my sensitive skin (which would be even more sensitive after ripping hair from my flesh).  So, I searched out different waxes and settled with SATIN SMOOTH TEA TREE WAX 14oz. Some of the videos I watched on youtube slabbed the wax on.  I found that I didn&#x27;t need to do that with the tea tree one.  A little went a long way.  I haven&#x27;t used the wax that it came with yet and I also purchased SATIN SMOOTH Calendula Gold Hard Wax with Tea Tree Oil, that I haven&#x27;t used yet.  Even though it was only my first time waxing I will never shave again.  It was liberating to not have to worry the next day about my under arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also, gave myself a brazi for the first time.  OUCH!  Never again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK. We were very excited to get this but one bottle was missing, 2 were leaking and got over everything. Seller did send out replacement bottle but the pads are hard to find and only last for one good body waxing. Unless you&#x27;re using it for something like JUST brows or a small area I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. It is very easy to use and heats up within about 30 minutes. I really like the paper strips that are provided, as I can cut them into smaller strips. (I stocked up on more papers at Sally&#x27;s, as many other beauty supply vendors only sell muslin). Unlike the instructions, I keep the wax temperature set to High and have great results. Within the first 2 tries, I did manage to pull a bit of skin off (I read online that this is typical with waxing, but found that using cornstarch on my skin before applying the wax, prevents this). I love the results and how much money I&#x27;m saving.</li>
            <li> Love the warmer I didn&#x27;t try the wax that comes with it. I gave it 4 stars because it took long for them to send it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good starter kit for waxing. I wish there were more sticks and strips in the kit, but then again it is a STARTER kit. I wish I had the option of choosing what kind of wax I wanted in the kit. The wax that came with it (honey) sucks sucks sucks!! It&#x27;s way too sticky and makes a mess with its sticky fly-aways. I would have preferred the All Purpose pink wax instead. It&#x27;s the perfect wax for any part of the body and does not cause a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> You have to plan ahead a little so the wax can warm properly and it can be very messy. It does an excellent job of removing hair. Waxing oneself can be hard to do because some spots are just tough to get. Backs of legs for instance. This kit does have everything you need to get started. Strips can be reused a couple of times. I used the kit a few times before refilling strips and applicators (getting a varity of sizes of both much like what comes in the Starter Kit). I am very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely excellent, salon quality product!  The warmer melts the wax quickly if you follow the instructions to first set it on high for 30 minutes, and then cools the wax to the perfect temp when you (again, following instructions!) reduce heat to medium for another 25-30 minutes.  The wax is very easy to work with, the strips are excellent, and if you read and follow the instructions carefully you will have no problems removing hair quickly and easily.  Sorry to keep harping on &amp;#34;follow the instructions,&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t stand when people get on here and write ridiculous bad reviews because they haven&#x27;t bothered to, you guessed it, read the instructions!  If you do what the instruction book says, you will have no issues with poor hair removal, burns, or any of the other issues people whine about.  This kit is FABULOUS, the best home kit I have ever tried.  The after care products are wonderful, I particularly love that they have included a soothing aloe vera gel and lotion.  I used both after applying the wax remover oil, and they immediately took away the sting and I was completely comfortable.  The only drawback is that they really do not include enough applicator sticks, even for a starter kit.  You get a nice number of remover strips, but I went through most of the applicator sticks just doing my underarms, so be advised, order extras right away!  You aren&#x27;t ever supposed to double-dip them or you can build up nasty bacteria in your wax, but Amazon has good prices on big boxes of applicators.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t ever waxed before with this type of kit, you may want to get it done at a salon one time, just to see the technique they use.  I did this, and then just mirrored what they had done as far as the amount if wax to put on an applicator, and how to use the same strip to pick up leftover wax and stray hairs.  This helped a lot, and I had no mess and perfectly smooth underarms when I finished.</li>
            <li> Workd very well. All the items together make for a good waxing.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work, I really did!  But after multiple tries we give up!&lt;br /&gt;The strips did not remove the hair or the wax.  It was painful and left a sticky, hairy mess behind.&lt;br /&gt;We tried several different techniques, less wax, more wax, shorter hair, longer hair, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have written good reviews, I sure wish I knew your secret.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to those who decide to buy this product.  Ours is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This wax works great!! Removes all the hair with one rip! But if any wax is left over, good lluck removing it, the waaxremoving oil kinda works but not great, get ready to scrub HARD and if it gets on your counter it sucks!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit because of all of all of the 5 stars reviews; however, when this kit (Jheri Redding Satin Smooth Wax Warmer) arrived, the only items that were intact was the wax, strips, and the Satin Cool Soother Gel. It was one great mess. I wasted my money. Poor packaging. NOTE: Amazon did reply to my complaint but the seller, Nada!</li>
            <li> I use this for eyebrows and legs and it&#x27;s great. Can get really messy if not careful but is easy to clean with some goo gone and hard work.  Great product if you want to start waxing and it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase for a home waxing kit. I read the instructions, turned the warmer on high for about 30-40 minutes and left it on high while I waxed. I cut the strips into smaller strips to fit the areas I was waxing. The wax quality was awesome, easy to use, easy to clean up and even though I have sensitive skin, I did not have any burning or excess redness. The only thing I didn&#x27;t use (because of my sensitive skin) is the moisturizer, I used Vitamin E instead but very impressed and will buy more of this product!</li>
            <li> This kit had everything I needed to properly do wax my leg and bikini area, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter kit in June 2012 and now it is January 2013 and I am still loving it.  It took some practice to get good at at-home waxing, but now it&#x27;s no big deal.  It is a time commitment, because the wax takes about an hour to get to the right temperature (when the container is full), but it&#x27;s something you can plan ahead, so again, no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best things about this kit are the price and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that I ONLY wax now, the price is amazing, as I am only now buying a second pot of wax (for $15) after seven months of using this wax every 2-3 weeks.  The price is less than one waxing appointment at a salon (depending on the salon of course).  When you run out of the starter kit&#x27;s muslin strips, you can buy muslin at a fabric store and cut it yourself for a much more reasonable price than buying more strips online.  Same goes for the \\&quot;wax applicators\\&quot; -- they&#x27;re Popsicle sticks, for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience, after several months of exclusively waxing, is that my hair grows in very very slowly and much less coarse.  I have blonde hair on my legs, right up until my ankles -- then it&#x27;s coarse, black, and dense!  I hated it.  Now, that hair doesn&#x27;t even grow anymore, or just a few hairs at a time.  It&#x27;s really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are the normal drawbacks of waxing, and not specific to this product.  You need to let your hair grow out to wax it, so if you don&#x27;t like having stubbly legs or whatnot, it will be annoying.  You&#x27;re going to have red bumps directly after waxing, but the cooling gel and lotion help with that.  If you drip the wax, it is a pain to get off, but the residue-removing oil helps with that (to a degree / depending on the surface).</li>
            <li> Great wax product! It worked just as the instructions directed and for the first time waxing my underarms, I had great success.  Gave 4 stars because would have preferred products with less toxins in them but loved the intention of it coming with prep oil, post oil, aloe and lotion.</li>
            <li> this kit is just perfect!</li>
            <li> I like this kit and it made it easy to do at-home waxing (which is great since I love anything DIY) but it made me break out like crazy wherever I used it, ever single time. I might try to pick up the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; wax at my local sally beauty, but buyer beware if your skin tends to be fickle.</li>
            <li> This is the first wax warmer I&#x27;ve used, but I like it. The pre-wax skin cleanser, wax remover, and lotion work really well, but be sure to keep the bottles upright. I wasn&#x27;t careful once, and the oil leaked everywhere because it was on it&#x27;s side (it had been securely closed and screwed tight). The wax that comes with it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; if that makes sense... when I dip the applicator in, the wax seems to string (like a hot glue gun), so it gets a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Packing was very poor. Most of the oil and lotion stuff leaked out.. Very disappointed. Yet to use the product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wax kit that has varying temperatures and is relatively small size for home use, and this kit is perfect! It&#x27;s sensitive enough for waxing eye brows, and strong enough to wax out under arms. The correct use of this is to first heat up the can of wax at the highest temperature for 30 minutes, then turn it down to the lowest temperature for another 30 minutes. After that it&#x27;s ready for use. You would definitely need the post wax cleansing oil, as water alone will NOT wash the wax residue away. I am so happy to have found this after trying out many different wax products. Now I never need to go to the waxing salons, and can trash all my previous waxing products. The kit comes in with a really neat package that would be presentable as a gift. Altima Beauty&#x27;s shipping is great.</li>
            <li> The wax takes at least an hour to warm up to a usable heat.  You can&#x27;t warm in the microwave as the tin is metal.  Apart from that, the oils and creams provided are more than adequate</li>
            <li> For a starter kit, it&#x27;s great, it has everything you need. I already knew that wax was messy and knew how to handle it. So for those of you complaining about the mess, you all didn&#x27;t do your research.</li>
            <li> As a first-timer waxing myself I was hesitant...I typically go to a salon, but the kit is fairly simple to use. With that said, it has been a little difficult to get the hang of it! The wax can be super messy if you&#x27;re not careful. I really only use it for my legs. I recommend letting the hair grow out as much as you can stand as it tends to leave behind patches (which I chalk-up to my inexperience). I would definitely recommend purchasing the warmer collars (they have saved my warmer on numerous occasions and serve as a great resting place for the applicators) as well as additional cloth strips to save you the trip to the store later. The wax lasts a loooong time as I have now waxed 2xs since purchasing and still have almost a full tub of wax! Also, use VERY thin layers of wax b/c removing the excess is a pain. The wax remover that comes w/the kit smells amazing, but tends to only work with light residue. Also be sure to remove ALL excess wax before bathing. I accidentally missed a spot and hot water and wax DO NOT mix!! Love, love, love all of the other little bottles of lotions and a primer. All in all, I was very happy w/this kit, but definitely need more practice :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brands great value</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other waxes too.</li>
