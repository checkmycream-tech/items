            <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Soon, those who were looking for the best of the best were stuck between Oral-B and Philips.</li>
            <li>A years ago, I was under the impression that Philips made the best electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My results were not as impressive as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>and I find it the best for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>battery life on this model for me has been excellent and I do not keep this on the charger.</li>

            <li>we are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently though I had heard wonderful things about the Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li>Perfect brush everytime</li>
            <li>and it still works great!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best money can buy with tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush ever.!</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush!</li>

            <li>They are remarkable!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleaning is remarkable!</li>
            <li>its feels great and cleans awesome.  </li>
            <li>That is the biggest feature i feel that I could not replicate with my manual brush - the incredible power to stimulate the gums.  </li>
            <li>This thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Great Product - works great!</li>
            <li>However, my Daughter-in-Law loved it!  </li>
            <li>Good product, Philips!</li>
            <li>Good recommendation!  </li>
            <li>Item just as described and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports did a comparison and found the best models from Philips and Oral-B to be fairly equivalent: the both do a great job of getting your teeth</li>
            <li>So you are stuck with a great piece of hardware that you have to throw it away because the batteries are non-replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is one great brush.</li>
            <li>The massage mode feels great on my gums too.</li>
            <li>I think this is great, you can use your sonicare for one week, without worrying about charging.</li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>I know my great dental health is because of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>and it also has a bunch of great things about it.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to see for myself what was so great about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>This product is great for all ages....</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush and great</li>
            <li>Great valued one.  </li>
            <li>(I experienced the mold problem with the Elite brush heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34;, and my Flexcare+ was always treated with great care, so I attribute the cause of this problem to an inherent defect in the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years - with great results.</li>
            <li>Great brush.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I was using my Oral-B at the time, I thought it was the best toothbrush I had ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Tooth brush is great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>brush has a two- minute timer, which I find very handy, Dentists recommend brushing for two minutes at a time and with the built- in timer, the guess work is removed.</li>
            <li>I also like the slim design, very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and works fine!  </li>
            <li>still feel amazing at almost noon!</li>
            <li>eSeries are great brushes at a good price.</li>
            <li>I am more than happy with this product!</li>
            <li>many models to count with some a bit gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;Still the best prophylaxis one can get in a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The Oral B electric toothbrush was my choice for many years, and it is very good.  </li>
            <li>Amazing battery life makes great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good \\&quot;mouth</li>
            <li>Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good \\&quot;mouth</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re buying this toothbrush it&#x27;s probably a good idea to order another set of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me that experience just speaks for how valuable it is to use a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I like the sonicare because it is good at getting in between your teeth even if you don&#x27;t floss every day.</li>
            <li>Amazon always has good deals, so I ordered two FlexCare</li>
            <li>This is a good investment for your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seems good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Skip the HX6921 unless you find a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush and sanitizer with light.  </li>
            <li>good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so good after every bushing.</li>
            <li>We have been using a Sonicare Pro Results toothbrush for about three years and have loved it, so I jumped at the chance to try this newer model.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>It fits my hand nicely and the timer in it is very handy.</li>
            <li>The best clean teeth without the dentist.</li>
            <li>many GREAT settings like an additional minute or refresh cycle</li>
            <li>in all, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Work real good  ,powerful and lightweight .</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>number).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>So far, it works great and does a very good job of maintaining good dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>they also love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out -they are awesome.</li>
            <li>Love it, works like a charm!  </li>
            <li>Love the timer!</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; when it is time to switch sides, making sure you get the perfect clean every time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine from a utility standpoint - it does a great job cleaning my teeth - but the design could use a refresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this model certainly ranks as one of the best.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing to me</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>think I will start returning mine every time when it is a week inside warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, cheaply</li>
            <li>I want to congratulate folks at Phillips/Sonicare on hiring the most talented engineers money can buy.</li>
            <li>both are great toothbrushes, but unless you are ok shelling out $150 every 2-3 years, Oral-B is a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is effective and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a battery level indicator too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t feel the handle vibrating anymore, which is nice.</li>
            <li>(others like Oral B have the circular ones that rotate, they&#x27;re not as nice).</li>
            <li>deluxe charger and cord wrap option.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel the difference from the brushes that I used to buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Now, what I liked about that model was the UV sanitizer that could hold two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vibrations from this brush are very fast and it makes you feel like you are, indeed, getting a very good level of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent batteries life which is great for long trips.</li>
            <li>cleaning capabilities are great too, but I find I need longer to brush just to get the surface clean</li>
            <li>Great clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Very happy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is awesome, and even better than our older one.</li>
            <li>This does an excellent job--even on the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>One excellent option lets you continue brushing after the two minutes are up, just like my old Oral B did.</li>
            <li>the timer to ensure I got the recommended full 2-minute brush, and of course 3) the especially clean feeling after each brush.  </li>
            <li>That aside this  is a great looking, professional-quality brush and a great value overall.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and does a much better job than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>They have been working great with proven results as I have been consistently getting flying colors on my gum reports in dental</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare handle feel more ergonomic than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare</li>
            <li>In addition, it has a nice LED light on the toothbrush itself showing you if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare-</li>
            <li>After using mine, I bought three more for my grown childrem..</li>
            <li>Compared to those in the former category, this has much more power (yes, the brush does revolve faster, 31,000 RPM), has a wonderfully lightweight, ergonomic handle</li>
            <li>Like many models these days</li>
            <li>but after many weeks of using I still am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.  </li>
            <li>love it -</li>
            <li>Love it, leaves teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried oral b and love sonicare so much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li>I love sonicares.</li>
            <li>I think this is much better for my gum health than the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>It also seems to produce much more liquid in my mouth than with Oral B.  </li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t many-</li>
            <li>No cavities, gums were healthy.</li>
            <li>only).&lt;br /&gt;-I must say, for a top branded product like this one, and having to have replaced the toothbrush three times now, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>The handling is easier because of its shape, and love the options.</li>
            <li>I love the timer, and</li>
            <li>(that being said, my dentist seems perfectly satisfied with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the FlexCare Plus and FlexCare models over the HealthyWhite or DiamondClean models because the FlexCare models have more mode options (and are easier to switch between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My latest, just gave out Sunday, and I went online looking for an alternative to try out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with that.</li>
            <li>The different settings are awesome.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I used a Phillips Elite electric toothbrush for many years so when I decided to replace it I upgraded to</li>
            <li>My Oral-B lasted me more than 5 year</li>
            <li>This Sonicare feels more refined, it feels like its works better because it just doesnt make a bunch of foam on your mouth.</li>
            <li>Everything was better.</li>
            <li>: This is my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>This brush feels a lot more like the cleaning tools that dentists use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although each style has its strengths, many believe \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; is better than \\&quot;oscillating\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li>Still, oscillating ones are still better than manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>In regards to overall dental health, this is THE BEST purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>The timer keeps me focused on brushing for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>In the dentist office, you just see the box on top of a shelve with &amp;</li>
            <li>I love the improvements</li>
            <li>I had more faith in Amazon then what was demonstrated in this transaction.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>our check ups have never been better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare before and have had it for more than two years</li>
            <li>so I wanted something newer and better :)</li>
            <li>I have used Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years &amp; never want to be without one.  </li>
            <li>But these vibrations back and forth do an excellent job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li>on....somebody make a reasonably priced electric tooth brush that does a great job.</li>
            <li>The brush heads themselves seem to make the most difference to me,  </li>
            <li>This model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>And, as always with Sonicare, the brushing/cleaning quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li>I have this toothbrush and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  </li>
            <li>And, I love the carrying case for the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Recharging glass cup is kinda goofy thought.</li>
            <li>I love the updated interface on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Just seems like a gadgety way to charge quite a lot more for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We love the sonicare dental products.</li>
            <li>It is a good price and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love this model.</li>
            <li>Love the selections and options.</li>
            <li>Need I say more</li>
            <li>Now on to reviewing the latest unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean feeling after every brush, and I have noticed better gums!</li>
            <li>This is what she had asked for Christmas and she was very excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>It attacks your teeth one tooth at a time and it makes your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>When the world first heard that philips was getting into the electric toothbrush category, everyone laughed, including myself.</li>
            <li>After using the Sonicare, my teeth (which felt good before with the Oral-B) felt SO MUCH CLEANER!  </li>
            <li>I like to feel my teeth after brushing because they feel so clean!  </li>
            <li>Clean teeth again!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of the Sonicare toothbrush heads and like the Diamond Clean version the best because they get my teeth the cleanest and whitest.  </li>
            <li>Since I have tried both styles, I can say with honesty that \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; does clean better and more.</li>
            <li>and I think a very good value for the money...would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent electric toothbrush priced between the better budget models (S40-$75) and the higher-end complete bells-and-whistles, retractable cord, auto-sanitizing, warning if you&#x27;re using too much pressure, etc.</li>
            <li>most importantly, well balanced.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to check out my detailed Youtube review by searching on Youtube for:  </li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush and really noticed the difference (as did my dentist).</li>
            <li>If you buy a good quality electric toothbrush you can really improve your teeth and gum health.  </li>
            <li>My preference is for the Phillips Sonicare unit due to the superior reach of the brush, greater flexibility of the brushhead, and what feels like superior cleaning capability of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I had an the original versión, and i thought it couldnt get any better, but it did.</li>
            <li>(for example, it&#x27;s slimmer, with a longer reach to easily access all parts of your mouth), holds a charge for weeks and weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Slim design and easy to manipulate around the mouth</li>
            <li>I am back to Oral B and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a carrying case that is compact and easy to pack up.  </li>
            <li>I have used manual toothbrushes, and I have used the Braun Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is still going strong and the battery hasn&#x27;t degrade yet.</li>
            <li>I tested it fully charged and it runs strong even after one week of continuous usage without recharging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The prosthodontist strongly recommended this device.</li>
            <li>It is strong yet won&#x27;t hurt your teeth or mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a Sonicare toothbrush and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I can&#x27;t really seem to tell the difference between the settings!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has money to spend and wants a clean that feels superior to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>It still worked fine up until I replaced it</li>
            <li>it brushes fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine, then just stopped turning on.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>5 different functions, perfect for sensitive or normal teeth, great travel case, and thin beautiful design for great counter appeal.</li>
            <li>Hubby loved this upgrade from his old Sonic!</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow, the timing/speeds are very useful.  </li>
            <li>five modes include a clean mode for an outstanding clean in two minutes.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t currently have or have never used a sonicare toothbrush, the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature is a great idea.</li>
            <li>I like strong cleaning and more than two minutes worth.</li>
            <li>; written in huge letters.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that my whole family, we are all devoted to this product because it done a nice job for us.</li>
            <li>So just saying, this model electric toothbrush is fantastic... but doesn&#x27;t have the UV.  </li>
            <li>Again, this is quite useful because most people, like me, tend to concentrate the bulk of their brushing minutes on the front teeth, since these are the teeth everyone sees each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare brushes for years and this is the most solid and most effective</li>
            <li>Using this toothbrush, it now focuses my effort on the real job of flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done, this was a great recommendation and purchase that will definitely support my best possible oral health!</li>
            <li>Depends on your need, you can select one of the options available.</li>
            <li>It is light and comes with travel</li>
            <li>I researched some of the Sonicare toothbrushes and found this one to fit in my budget</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is sleek, sturdy, the materials do not feel flimsy or cheap.  </li>
            <li>and they are all fantastic.  </li>
            <li>vibrations feel more intense, Oral-B feels more mechanical&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare</li>
            <li>I have only had this a couple months, but I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>After so many years, Sonicare should have it right.</li>
            <li>It feels much different than a spin brush, and the handling of it took some getting used to, but it gives you a great noticeably clean feeling.</li>
            <li>this one is easily the best for several reasons that become obvious the more you use it.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job at brushing and getting one&#x27;s teeth exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted, worked perfectly, and arrived ahead of the expected shipping schedule.</li>
            <li>But more importantly, the brush itself is shaped more like a standard toothbrush and has even greater flexibility.</li>
            <li>brush head is smaller and seems to actually work better, my teeth always feel perfectly</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to pay more, I say get an Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I think the Philips has corrected every flaw from the original Sonicare.</li>
            <li>After significant reworking of past dental work, my dentist assured me that this would be the best investment for me to care for the magnitude of work he performed in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I owned an original Sonicare model for 8+ years.</li>
            <li>, it does not stand the test of time like the original model.</li>
            <li>And now they insist on dating the warranty from the date of purchase of the ORIGINAL TOOTHBRUSH, rather than from the date of use or from the DATE OF THE REPLACEMENT HANDLE, and won&#x27;t send another.  </li>
            <li>This is a top of the line model that is pretty affordable and does it&#x27;s intended job day in and day out.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this toothbrush for my husband, but I couldn&#x27;t resist giving it a try</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like the Oral-B cleans better because it rotates in a circular motion, but after examining my teeth, I think the Sonicare actually does a better job!</li>
            <li>It feels like 10,000 Riverdancers tapping away on my teeth except THIS time their shoes are made of Christmas morning and the original TGIF lineup.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$!</li>
            <li>with teeth masterfully repaired and prepared for anything, this little dynamo toothbrush is powerful in getting done the job of brushing and maintaining oral health.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product based on its ease of use, long battery life, and excellent cleaning actions</li>
            <li>Nice you still get a cover for each new brush.</li>
            <li>A variety of clean modes which suit well for all cleaning purposes</li>
            <li>Who knew an electric toothbrush could make my mouth feel so clean?  </li>
            <li>I feel you can get your teeth just as clean with a manual brush</li>
            <li>So get one of the sonicare toothbrush and clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I use the clean option twice a day and refresh at noon.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel after-the-dentist clean after I brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as when leaving the dentist office after a 6 months check-up.  </li>
            <li>It does get into hard-to-reach places and clean it well.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses the clean  and  massage settings.</li>
            <li>And I love how much quieter this brush is and how it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are brushing your teeth with a freight train.</li>
            <li>I bought a Diamond clean (as I didn&#x27;t find this one in the CVS by</li>
            <li>my teeth are still clean but with Flexcare it was no built up, nothing.</li>
            <li>Dentist-fresh clean every time.</li>
            <li>They have greatly improved our oral health and limited the number of cavities we&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that this was a smart buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a special \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; mode (not that I ever felt a need for that).</li>
            <li>I love the sparkling clean feeling I get from the very thorough job of brushing the Flexcare+</li>
            <li>If price is really important, the Philips is ok, and you can search for other brush heads to see if one is more appealing to you.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easy to use, gentle on my teeth and gums and my mouth feels so fresh and so clean, clean all day!</li>
            <li>The proof of how good it is will be when I visit my dentist and see if he notices anything different.  </li>
            <li>, the toothbrush breaks the 2-minute timed brushing into fourths by basically stopping every 30 seconds and immediately accelerating to full speed.</li>
            <li>Also times so that you always take the full (recommended) 2 minutes to brush.  </li>
            <li>the full 2minutes</li>
            <li>With the gentle setting, along with a concerted effort to brush my teeth more than my gums, I have eliminated this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was never quite sure it was really cleaning as well as the bulkier models</li>
            <li>I went through the testing, and proceeded to full out a replacement form.</li>
            <li>Then purchased this Sonicare and was pleased to find it was much quieter.  </li>
            <li>or so you will come to love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this toothbrush initially because I was used to the Oral-B, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare also massages the gum line and really helps to reduce plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty good - I can&#x27;t say for sure how long it takes for one charge - but it is a while before you have to re-charge.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty loud but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>This model allows for three minutes and the gum setting is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>, my experiences with customer service were pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The different settings that are available are great (clean, refresh, gum care, sensitive, massage).  </li>
            <li>A refresh mode for those quick one minute touch-ups.</li>
            <li>but the basic design is good and you pay for features if they are worth it for you.</li>
            <li>My gums are pink and healthy, and, with the exception of the two pockets, are nice and smug around each tooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Back in the 90&#x27;s philips established a well name for themselves when it came to electric products like tape, CD players, and many more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for a few years, and have been very happy with them on the whole.</li>
            <li>And it appears to be doing a better job of keeping water out of the unit, which was a problem with the older one.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li>The refresh setting is a shorter amount of time just for those quick tooth/breath freshen ups when you have to dash.  </li>
            <li>The refresh setting is a shorter amount of time just for those quick tooth/breath freshen ups when you have to dash.  </li>
            <li>I have used sonicare products for many years and recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice balance of price/gizmos and after using it for two weeks I find it comparable to my other Sonicare (the Healthy White).are</li>
            <li>More powerful and love the different modes.  </li>
            <li>Also, the sound it makes is a much higher frequency than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I would not be able to live with this if it were.  </li>
            <li>If I ever do need to purchase a new one, it sure isn&#x27;t going to be a philips.</li>
            <li>After months of hesitation, research, product and price comparison reviews, I purchased the Philips Sonicare Flexcare + and was pleased with the prompt delivery and brand new item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>) Attractive design and small footprint keep you bathroom counter-top clutter free</li>
            <li>My recent checkup was one of the best in long time.</li>
            <li>new device appears to work fine although it is noisier than my original unit.</li>
            <li>FlexCare Plus, used on Gum Care mode, put me back on track for more pleasant dentist visits in the future.</li>
            <li>still felt amazing, brushed after breakfast at 6am and teeth</li>
            <li>They are not cheap but they do a great job of taking care of teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The vibration makes it a bit interesting to get used to, but it makes your teeth feel like you just got them professionally cleaned every time you brush.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s nice in theory (equal attention to all areas of the mouth)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy this for these useful features:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy this for these useful features:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Its works just like my old one but with a couple more settings.</li>
            <li>bought as gift so far ok</li>
            <li>This combination keeps my teeth nice and white.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t so loud, I&#x27;d like it a lot more.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, because it delivers 31,000 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, the toothbrush was worth every cent.</li>
            <li>To be candid, I began to form yellow plaque around the gum line of my teeth.</li>
            <li>great electric toothbrush for sensitive gums and daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t make a recommendation there since I don&#x27;t own the current model for that design.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans better than my old Braun one.  </li>
            <li>but this is clearly the more powerful unit of the 3.</li>
            <li>you can spare the cost, this toothbrush is well worth</li>
            <li>you can spare the cost, this toothbrush is well worth</li>
            <li>The clean feeling of freshness after brushing is amazing and very noticeable compared to a standard brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the timer that lets me know when to move to the next area to clean.  </li>
            <li>options are nice, particularly for anyone who has sensitive gums or in my case pain caused by my braces.</li>
            <li>With a precision of a swiss time piece they manage to estimate the life cycle of the battery to die right after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, ASK YOUR DENTIST or trusted HYGIENIST if this is the right brush for you.l am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, ASK YOUR DENTIST or trusted HYGIENIST if this is the right brush for you.</li>
            <li>Wife was right about buying online.</li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to find a new replacement that is pretty much the same as the old unit.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I really like how clean our teeth feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare toothbrushes have a distinctly high pitched sound and feel whilst brushing and the Flexcare Plus is no exception.</li>
            <li>I generally like sonicare more.</li>
            <li>, I understand a little more fully why so many consumers rave about them the way they do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>GumCare adds 1 minute to the end of the regular 2 minute brush to clean the gums, Refresh is a 1 minute timed cleaning, Sensitive is a 2 minute cleaning with lighter vibration, and Massage is a nice setting that I sometimes use after \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to brush my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have all my Oral-B wands that are many years old and work very well still.</li>
            <li>The sensitive setting is more gentle.  </li>
            <li>a nice plus if you have limited room on your sink or wherever you keep your brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mid-range electric toothbrush, perfect for those looking for cleaner, healthier teeth but without having to shell out for unnecessary extras in more expensive brushes&lt;br /&gt;(+) Space on the charger to hold two brush heads (not all Sonicare brushes have this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clean setting is what I normally use.  </li>
            <li>overall feeling is Oral-B is more of a no nonsense get the job done type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first couple of times using it, I believe I was so used to the manual brush</li>
            <li>I do get canker sores at times and after my first week of switching over to the Sonicare, did get one (not on gumline) --</li>
            <li>In any event it had stopped holding a charge so this was my replacement option not as many extra stuff as origional but things I never used save the optional longer brush time option.</li>
            <li>But it is her first</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews here first before ordering, but who thought the Sonicare site would be screwed up?  </li>
            <li>Guess I was in too big of hurry to order in time for Christmas :)</li>
            <li>When I used this for the first time, I allowed the vibrating brush to move itself all along my teeth and gums in rapid fire motion, and the result was quite a bit of bleeding.</li>
            <li>This device really does an effective job removing plaque and stains and it seems like it is built very well and made to last.</li>
            <li>This device really does an effective job removing plaque and stains and it seems like it is built very well and made to last.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s second Sonicare toothbrush and we love them.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the first electric I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another off brand, with 40,000 cycles per minute, hoping this one will last more than one year.</li>
            <li>like how Sonicare has more universal brushes.</li>
            <li>But with this brush, a pulse every 30 seconds prompts you to switch to a different region of the mouth (front of top teeth, back of top teeth, etc.).</li>
            <li>The funny thing, is that my model is nowhere on that list.</li>
            <li>Make sure you learn how to use the toothbrush before you start; it&#x27;s not the same as using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re finished you&#x27;ll definitely feel like most (if not all) of the surfaces of your teeth are clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric tooth brush for the last 15 years or more.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many different styles, models, and companies.  </li>
            <li>So for $150 I had a grand total of 8 months use.  </li>
            <li>, the Sonicare seems to me to achieve a smoother feeling result overall, but the Oral-B seems to sometimes achieve more removal of hardening plaque.</li>
            <li>The first was an Elite, and the two most recent were the Flexcare+</li>
            <li>The charge lasts for several weeks (or more).  </li>
            <li>My 2nd one,  I love the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first time it broke, it just quit charging.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it,  I noticed some sore gums</li>
            <li>do feel the unit does a better job on my teeth than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>But, for the most part it works and feels the exact same.</li>
            <li>thought it would be interesting to look at the differences between the various models, but for the life of me couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter because she knew how the creators were first involved in developing her clarisonic face cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love the four different setting.</li>
            <li>I feel like my back teeth are cleaned better with this brush because of it&#x27;s design.  </li>
            <li>Planning to contact support, so I may give a higher (or lower) rating afterward.</li>
            <li>Purchased  this to replace my first that lasted almost 8 years.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that the feeling is akin to what you might feel like when ascending to the top of the Agro crag on the show GUTS.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>This one has a nice balance of price/gizmos and after using it for two weeks I find it comparable to my other Sonicare (the Healthy White).</li>
            <li>love the fact the Flexcare includes a UV sanitizer compartment since anyone who puts their toothbrush in a bathroom should be aware that studies have shown microscopic fecal particles get spread all over the bathroom when the toilet is flushed.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone who wants new clean teeth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery of the Sonicare lasts longer than the Oral-B&#x27;s, more than two weeks versus about one week, though both last plenty long for most uses.</li>
            <li>I have tried all 5 but normally use the refresh for a quick clean, and sensitive for my am/pm cleanings.</li>
            <li>For instance to switch from &#x27;Clean&#x27; to &#x27;Massage&#x27; would require pressing the power button and then pressing the selector button (directly beneath power button) until the desired option is highlighted and then pressing the power button again.</li>
            <li>It has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare has 5 settings (clean, sensitive, massage, gum care and refresh).  </li>
            <li>Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it tells you how much power is left on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The gum care setting adds an extra minute to the time as it switches to a more gentle brushing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three years later, I thought for sure there would be some new model that struck the right balance between performance and design.</li>
            <li>brush looks very high tech and pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Powerful cleaning: When I first used the brush, the vibration was a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I find this a nice feature to keep the brush head clean and dry between brushings, especially overnight.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>: better cleaning, convenient, long battery life, improves dental hygiene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>If I go the whole two minutes while paying attention my teeth feel like they do when I first get them cleaned by my hygienist.</li>
            <li>I use Oral B Pro Floss Action brush heads and find that they do a better job cleaning, especially with my braces, and leave my teeth/mouth feeling better overall.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is somewhat pricey compared other basic electric toothbrushes, but it is clearly better.</li>
            <li>For me, I find that the gentle cleaning is a good option due to my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Bought this brand new at best buy the first one only lasted about 4 months, the metal piece that vibrates was loose and not connected internally anymore.</li>
            <li>Easy to use after proper instruction by dentist and/or dental assistant for thorough cleaning of teeth and massage of gums.  </li>
            <li>This new &amp; improved version is just the whip !!</li>
            <li>These batteries do not have an unlimited number of charge-discharge cycles and letting the battery run down before recharging may allow the battery to last longer (that has been my experience with most battery operated devices using the latest battery technology).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t match the quiet hum of my very old Sonicare, but I console myself with the thought that it&#x27;s probably doing a better job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure how the latest models compares to the original model I had which was bullet proof, so</li>
            <li>I must say that the price on this electric toothbrush is very high.</li>
            <li>I now clean my  teeth for 7 minutes or more instead of typical time most Americans do of less than one minute.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently bought and returned 2 different Sonicare&#x27;s this month (Diamond Clean, and the Elite) and nothing compares to the power and fresh clean feeling</li>
            <li>The cheap, stiff cord won&#x27;t wrap easily and kept its kinks permanently.</li>
            <li>The travel case seems to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li>Very well made and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It even lets you know how much time to spend brushing each quadrant.</li>
            <li>Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design is pleasing and doesn&#x27;t take up much real estate on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>but this makes it so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in the trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Once I started with this it ready changed things for me, I stop having much dental work done.</li>
            <li>That sonic vibration is really knocking things looseý in your month.</li>
            <li>my teeth produced way to much plaque, i could brush my teeth and</li>
            <li>I did not find as much of a difference between the settings as I do with Oral B&#x27;s electric</li>
            <li>I was very relieved</li>
            <li>I have always been skeptical about electronic toothbrushes, especially for the price, but a friend convinced me to try it, and I could not be more happy.</li>
            <li>And, really, that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li>Fantastic I always wanted to get a sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big price.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter and it feels like my teeth are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth very well, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause the enamel wear</li>
            <li>The timing feature makes it much easier for me to give the correct amount of attention to all of my</li>
            <li>It comes with battery meter where you can see how much battery life is left.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>If the price is not an issue, then I highly recommend this Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I put off purchasing a Sonicare brush for almost a year and will never use anything else - this is an absolute game-changer.</li>
            <li>Indoors you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>I did not have this issue using my Oral-B. Second issue, about a month ago, the battery light on my wand started to flash amber even though it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare also did not put too much pressure on my gums.</li>
            <li>Do you really need to save about 2 ounces?</li>
            <li>Who needs a &amp;#34;Bluetooth&amp;#34; capable toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;Come</li>
            <li>The handle has multiple settings and the sensitive setting is gentle and effective in cleaning my teeth without aggravating my already sensitive (I&#x27;m in the Sensodyne stage in my life) teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li>I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li>The first sign your Sonicare has a problem will be the motor seems louder than normal or the motor will seem to rattle inside the handle.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to avoid it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>When it works, it does work really</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth very well and the Dentist has commented on how well it works.  </li>
            <li>After much research, I decided the wife and I would go with sonicare.</li>
            <li>For the most part, there&#x27;s not much difference in fact.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare&#x27;s battery has a longer running time and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged as much.</li>
            <li>I cannot get over how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with the sonicare flexcare toothbrush versus the manual brushing</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of weeks, I really started to appreciate the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Really gets in between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Loud and more jarring brushing experience when compared to my very quiet Oral B&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush has a low battery indicator, which is definitely a nice feature that my last brush didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush, this was a replacement for my old one that finally wore out after 5 years,</li>
            <li>When not in use, the front is completely gray and only comes on when you pick the brush up; it looks a lot more sleek.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough to buy another one, same model.</li>
            <li>I bought 2nd left to right and got 4 or 5 settings more than I will ever use.</li>
            <li>Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless you brush your teeth less than twice a day at minimum, you won&#x27;t be able to get more than 1.5 weeks from a single charge.</li>
            <li>various Sonicares all clean very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime Oral B user and originally started using electric toothbrushes after my dentist recommended I make the switch back in 2005.</li>
            <li>This is my second Philips Sonicare Felxcare Plus, my first one lasted for more than 5 years and I had to get the same model after reading the comparison with the newer model.</li>
            <li>hope to see significant difference from the prior version</li>
            <li>Compared to other electric toothbrushes I have used, Sonicare is clearly better in cleaning.</li>
            <li>After 8 months my dentist is excited about the overall condition of my gum tissue!</li>
            <li>So I used the same original Soniccare model for 8+ years and could have gone on using it longer, but none of the Flexcare models I&#x27;ve owned have lasted longer than 2.5 years.</li>
            <li>though the Sonicare and the Oral-B work on different mechanical principles, the results are pretty similar, with the Sonicare perhaps leaving teeth feeling smoother and the Oral-B perhaps working a bit better on hardening plaque.</li>

            <li>My dentist told me at my last visit the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; around my gumline have shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li>think this is a very high price for just the main unit, one head and travel</li>
            <li>I am hoping with continued use the trend continues beyond what appears to be an initial phases of white, clean and a fresh stimulated mouth!  </li>
            <li>I like the new style (and the smaller head) much better than the old twist on style.  </li>
            <li>This new design is lighter, sleeker, and the charge lasts much longer (after a week away it kept is charge strong.)It has a nice smaller charging unit than my older unit, a time 2minute runnign time, and various speed options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally do store the brush on its stand after every use, but I was able to go on a couple of week-long trips recently for which I didn&#x27;t even bring the charger, and the brush worked well throughout.  </li>
            <li>Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads, Standard, 3 Pack]] and</li>
            <li>The toothbrush design doesn&#x27;t allow water to collect on the magnets under the brush stem - big plus for keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a dentist that has really helped with trying to figure out a combination to battle this mouth epidemic, and the last thing he tells me as I was walking out of his office the other day was try a sonicare tooth brush it may really help, so I pondered this all day since I had the first appointment of the day, and decided what the hell should try it, this dentist has done great things for me thus far, got my toothbrush yesterday in the mail and used it for</li>
            <li>This particular model has several categories: clean, gum&lt;</li>
            <li>gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, make sure you cleaned your tooth brush after used and dry with a towel completely (except for the brush area).  </li>
            <li>For a fair bit less, and for seemingly the same qualities, you can get the Flexcare RS930.</li>
            <li>I got mine directly from my dentist; I paid $150 which is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>This brush has a nice design, and a much smaller head that fits easily as far back as the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only criticisms I have are that occasionally I get one that is very noisy &amp; all work for barely more than two years.  </li>
            <li>Gross but true.</li>
            <li>the subsequent hygienist&#x27;s positive comments regarding my oral heath improvement is so heart warming that this decision was the right one.</li>
            <li>Like I want a new one from you guys!</li>
            <li>I absolutely live it and so do my teeth!</li>
            <li>My previous one stopped working correctly after many years, so I replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li>given my Oral-B to my kids because it does a lot better job than they typically do with their manual toothbrushes, even when they set a timer.g so you have additional time to brush your gums.</li>
            <li>given my Oral-B to my kids because it does a lot better job than they typically do with their manual toothbrushes, even when they set a timer.</li>
            <li>Better than my previous oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips delivers a nice electric toothbrush that has enough features to appeal to a wide segment of people.</li>
            <li>Back then, the only reputable electric toothbrush I knew and used repeatedly was Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Product had bold print that stated &amp;#34;NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34; printed on the outside of the box.</li>
            <li>I had an older version for about 6-7 years , It had some charging issues .</li>
            <li>Had same model before for at least 3 years great electronic brush.  </li>
            <li>The main competition here is the Ora-B line of brushes.  </li>
            <li>Replaced an older Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an older Sonicare model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>While Sonicare is still riding on its ultra high rpm technology making you feel like your teeth are cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in ten years, but I use this every day (and the older sonicare model, previously) and to my surprise, when I finally did go to the dentist, he said my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>there were 4 models in the high end.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if this ever goes on sale (because I still think the price is too high)</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to anyone wishing to improve the health of their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute gum massage and regular clean modes are my favorites and feel pretty distinct from each other, with timed vibrations and levels of intensity.</li>
            <li>I have always been a long brusher for that sense of clean.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used electric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual.</li>
            <li>Philips has made a believer out of me and I recommend this brush to all.tric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual.</li>
            <li>I used it for a little bit more than four years.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth never REALLY feel clean and they make your whole head shake.</li>
            <li>As stated above, the clean mode runs at 31,000 rpm; what&#x27;s the rpm for the sensitive mode?</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, it has a high frequency vibration that cleans well, and a variety of modes that are useful such as the gum-cleaning mode.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I highly recommend the Sonicare brand, but I don&#x27;t know if the newest models are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Brush heads are small and not the best design to get at hard to reach spots</li>
            <li>A sensitive mode for gentle yet thorough cleaning of the gums.</li>
            <li>The brush is ready to go out of the box but thereafter will completely charge in about 3hrs.</li>
            <li>but not least-</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are 5 brushing modes, I end up just using the normal mode for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So after a few months, you&#x27;ll need to buy more brushes.</li>
            <li>The first few days, I found myself rubbing my tongue along my teeth, just to feel how smooth they were.</li>
            <li>With my old brush, I was never patient enough to leave it on for the full recommended brushing time.</li>
            <li>Plus, compared to a normal toothbrush, it is heaven being to just hold the brush in the morning and have it brush by</li>
            <li>And I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; brush-head</li>
            <li>so you can always switch to using it like a normal toothbrush without turning on the power</li>
            <li>The only electric toothbrushes I have used were the kind that cost $15 or less at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Oral-B on that point, but it&#x27;s easy enough to just turn the Sonicare back on if you&#x27;re not done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>get extra heads when you order,  the bristles are strong and don&#x27;t seem to deform like regular brushheads.</li>
            <li>I read up on them from left to right</li>
            <li>Teeth definitely feel clean and the timer makes sure you brush for at least two minutes.</li>
            <li>It worked great for about 8 months (2 users), but now does this weird thing where it barely vibrates if I push it against my teeth with much pressure at all.</li>
            <li>We have always purchased Sonicare and will continue to do so; there is nothing ineffective about them that would make us look at a new brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are what I like about this new model :</li>
            <li>The Flexcare has a new setting for massaging your gums.</li>
            <li>and I must purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>just have to wait and see on this new purchase.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone shopping for a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I called customer support they told me I need to buy a new one offered me 10% off.</li>
            <li>When I select a model that is close to it, they tell me the toothbrush is out of warranty, but they will give me a coupon to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Seller claims the product is new.</li>
            <li>They tell me to buy a new unit and that none of their toothbrushes can be repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li>so they sent a brand new replacement handle.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d made some progress, I still had a few pockets that didn&#x27;t respond to self-care or more frequent cleanings.</li>
            <li>This does not have the same powerful rotary action that I was used to having.</li>
            <li>The different settings are helpful, but I primarily stick to the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been one to use electric toothbrushes very frequently.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works by vibrating back and forth very very fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my very old Braun Oral B Triumph 9000.</li>
            <li>Basically, for more money you get a Lithium Ion battery, more \\&quot;modes\\&quot; and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer, or if you really want to shell out the bucks a USB charger and glass charging base (the Diamond Clean).  </li>
            <li>After the first time I brushed my teeth with the Sonicare</li>
            <li>when I first time I tried it out the different it made.</li>
            <li>I think the only two areas where it takes some time to get used to is the tingling situation felt during the first week or two and the fact that you&#x27;re not supposed to move the brush from side to side ..</li>
            <li>The brush also vibrates uniquely to let you know when to switch to other parts of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush does it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any different than the first electric toothbrush I bought more than five year ago.</li>
            <li>Hope this one last longer than the first one I had.  </li>
            <li>The Elite&#x27;s battery  died shortly after the warranty expired, and I replaced it with my first Flexcare+.  </li>
            <li>had the exact same issue, with a battery that also died within 2.5 years.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer small brush heads for better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on it because the brush head sold with it was much larger.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare, in my opinion, cleans the teeth much better than any device I have ever used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Bought this unit to replace one of the exact same model that died after 2 years of use.</li>
            <li>: good brush heads will be expensive but well worth the extra money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since replaced the standard brush head with the Diamond Clean heads, which are smaller.  </li>
            <li>The included &#x27;proresults&#x27; brush head is entirely too soft for my liking and left my teeth feeling not so clean</li>
            <li>The new brush may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s got a lot of features that make the price worth it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t really think about Sonicare due to its higher price tag.</li>
            <li>The two minute timer gives a little buzz every 30 seconds so that you can make sure to brush each quadrant of your mouth equally.  </li>
            <li>The two minute timer gives a little buzz every 30 seconds so that you can make sure to brush each quadrant of your mouth equally.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am aware of, Sonicare only has two different main types.</li>
            <li>But outdoors, it shines bright like gold (sadly).</li>
            <li>They both clean well, the sonicare is less jarring for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is much better for each person to have their own base if they are teens if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the different cleaning modes it offers.</li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t completely seal the brush head, so it lets the brush airdry</li>
            <li>(I really appreciate this feature when traveling; the manual states that a fully charged brush \\&quot;should provide 42 2-minute brushings,\\&quot; or about 3 weeks), and has several \\&quot;modes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, and despite my ranting about the modes, this has been my favorite (well, and most expensive) of the several electric brushes</li>

            <li>br /&gt;care, refresh, sensitive and massage.</li>
            <li>This one was to replace a unit that was about 7+ yrs old (an elite?)</li>
            <li>Sonicare offers a variety of cleaning modes</li>
            <li>I have used so far.</li>
            <li>That said, the toothbrush is a bit loud while in operation.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a model that really stands out from a design perspective - it&#x27;s got a slim design that feels almost like a regular toothbrush -</li>
            <li>When this happened during the 2-year warranty period, I had no problem getting a replacement sent to me directly from Sonicare (just by calling their 800 customer support</li>
            <li>This one and my Oral-B Vitality Dual Action.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so I use the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li>Markedly reduces formation of plaque/tartar, cavities and gum inflammations.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes finish early, before it switches off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I really like the gum-brushing mode, which is something my prior models didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a medal rod surrounded by soft plastic, the brush head attaches to the medal rod.</li>
            <li>The problem is water eventually leaks into the motor unit inside the handle as the soft plastic around the rod eventually wears and doesn&#x27;t seal out the water.</li>
            <li>So I contacted Philips directly to see what they recommend.</li>
            <li>Upgraded from a 5 year old e-series.  </li>
            <li>As far as usage, there are two of us using the toothbrush twice a day.</li>
            <li>This brush head is sleek and smaller, the head stays much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am paying a higher price up front to save money at the dentist in the long run.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, but I just use the sensitive setting and I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slimmer and lighter than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For the first 14 uses, the brush&#x27;s intensity slowly builds so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums by using full power immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition if you are not religious enough about it, you will start getting mildew right under the rubber seal on the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>I will pick them up in a store, examine them for a minute, and inevitably put them right back on the shelf.</li>
            <li>WHAT quick one-minute touch-ups, and why not just turn the brush on again after the automatic 2-minute shut-off, and run it for as long or as short as you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The recent Sonicare toothbrush models, where the head just pops on is WAY better than the old twist on head version (which was extremely difficult to keep clean).  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd version of Sonicare with my previous one still going strong after 6 years.</li>
            <li>but I misplaced the original receipt.</li>
            <li>The charging base is kind of large for the device, but it is super convenient.</li>
            <li>Not sure if a smaller head does a better job</li>
            <li>but I think there are only two main brush heads</li>
            <li>But this particular Sonicare is my personal Favorited.  </li>
            <li>The buzz indicates that you should move on the next quadrant of your mouth (the 4 quadrants being upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right).</li>
            <li>I usually can&#x27;t get 3 months out of one toothbrush, but I think the quality of the brushes and the holder are superior above other sonic-style brands.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the brush has a sensitive mode that I used for a few days until I got used to the stronger power.</li>
            <li>As I said unbelievable fantastic.</li>
            <li>The second time it broke, it made a buzzing noise (like it was running) while it was on the charger and there was no way to turn it off and it stopped working normally.</li>
            <li>I loved the old unit and was sad when it finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>And being new to electric toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t realize that you could switch out the brush heads if you wanted a different type.  </li>
            <li>dentist said today to go back to my previous toothbrush as my teeth aren&#x27;t so clean anymore.  </li>
            <li>brushes have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard</li>
            <li>brushes.s have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same logic as the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, but you only move around much faster.  </li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s a major improvement over a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally attracted to the Oral-B because the brush head that comes with it is small</li>
            <li>found the default brush head less appealing than the round brush heads that come with Oral B&#x27;s comparable products (Vitality, Professional series, Triumph) and found it&#x27;s flex motion ticklish to my gums.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, with the gum care and added features, it&#x27;s the one that made the most sense for our entire family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it a little under a month, the battery has remained nearly at full charge despite only having been charged to 100% once after opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hand brushing does, and is quiet with a few special settings.</li>
            <li>Also want to point out that a number of the replacement heads available online have negative reviews, mentioning the brush head may be counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my two dentists: General Dentist and Periodontist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, it became clear we needed a second toothbrush, not just two heads.</li>
            <li>I found that the brush head was entirely too soft for my liking and compared to what I&#x27;m used to with my Oral B.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old model was starting to lose its ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li>No complains about the shipment and of course no regrets on buying it again.</li>
            <li>Brushing twice a day for two days without charging and the battery indicator barely dropped.</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s razors, the real money spent after getting this unit is replacing the brushes, which can run up to $30.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to have the same sonic action</li>
            <li>Got the lesser version for my birthday, took it back to the store it was purchased from and upgraded to this much nicer unit for the same price on sale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works just as well as my old Flexcare did and shouldn&#x27;t have the same issues.</li>
            <li>, it has different modes (like sensitive, gum care, massage, etc.).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 3 Flexcares: two developed problems with the motor inside getting loud/loose, the third had the beginnings of a motor problem but was still usable, however the metal rod came out of the handle when I removed the brush head one day.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is nowhere near the same thing as those vibrating $7.99 toothbrushes in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Unlike those, the Sonicare battery is rechargeable, holds its charge for almost a month with two brushings a day, travels well and offers different settings.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised a toothbrush could make such a difference.</li>
            <li>I am a complete convert and I will not be looking back!</li>
            <li>It was scary for me to put this much money down, but I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>broke down first.</li>
            <li>2nd brush - same model but new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I&#x27;m back with the manual brushes and there&#x27;s no mess involved.  </li>
            <li>The brush oscillates so fast that you hardly have to apply much pressure with the bristles.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that if any pressure is applied to the brush-head while brushing the entire toothbrush stops functioning and simply makes a loud noise.</li>
            <li>The problem is that if any pressure is applied to the brush-head while brushing the entire toothbrush stops functioning and simply makes a loud noise.</li>
            <li>Oral B, the Philips Sonicare offers several settings to match your personal preference.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true even if I tilt my head back a little to pool the juices further back, out of the way of the brush (or so I would have thought).  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no sound at all, other than the side effect sound of the change in motor speed.  </li>
            <li>Each of the two handles lasted about a year, which means it was barely under warranty for the third handle they decided to send me.</li>
            <li>We bought this toothbrush to replace out old sonicare that we has for so long that it wouldn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Oral-B. Both have a standard two-minute brushing cycle, after which the Oral-B gives a long stutter before starting a new cycle, and the Sonicare turns itself off.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare HX6921 has the same general feel in the hand though the diameter of the grip is somewhat smaller and easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first Sonicare back in 2012 and have been using it everyday since then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only downside, as far as I am concerned, is that the replacement brushes are pretty expensive, and they really need to be replaced every three or four months.</li>
            <li>My first one is still alive and kickin but the original design was bad as gunk would accumulate under the cap.</li>
            <li>I would love to experience a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that didn&#x27;t break down, due to a worn-out battery or a defect in design, as it seems a few people here have.  </li>
            <li>We got this for our teenage son who was due a new toothbrush anyway.  </li>

            <li> Perfect brush everytime</li>
            <li> and it still works great!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best money can buy with tooth brushes.</li>

            <li> its feels great and cleans awesome.  </li>
            <li> That is the biggest feature i feel that I could not replicate with my manual brush - the incredible power to stimulate the gums.  </li>
            <li> This thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li> Great Product - works great!</li>
            <li> However, my Daughter-in-Law loved it!  </li>
            <li> Good product, Philips!</li>
            <li> Good recommendation!  </li>
            <li> Item just as described and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports did a comparison and found the best models from Philips and Oral-B to be fairly equivalent: the both do a great job of getting your teeth</li>
            <li> So you are stuck with a great piece of hardware that you have to throw it away because the batteries are non-replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is one great brush.</li>
            <li> The massage mode feels great on my gums too.</li>
            <li> I think this is great, you can use your sonicare for one week, without worrying about charging.</li>
            <li> Great product and</li>
            <li> I know my great dental health is because of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> and it also has a bunch of great things about it.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to see for myself what was so great about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> This product is great for all ages....</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and great</li>
            <li> Great valued one.  </li>
            <li> (I experienced the mold problem with the Elite brush heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34;, and my Flexcare+ was always treated with great care, so I attribute the cause of this problem to an inherent defect in the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years - with great results.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I was using my Oral-B at the time, I thought it was the best toothbrush I had ever used.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Tooth brush is great.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> brush has a two- minute timer, which I find very handy, Dentists recommend brushing for two minutes at a time and with the built- in timer, the guess work is removed.</li>
            <li> I also like the slim design, very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and works fine!  </li>
            <li> still feel amazing at almost noon!</li>
            <li> eSeries are great brushes at a good price.</li>
            <li> I am more than happy with this product!</li>
            <li> many models to count with some a bit gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;Still the best prophylaxis one can get in a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The Oral B electric toothbrush was my choice for many years, and it is very good.  </li>
            <li> Amazing battery life makes great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good \\&quot;mouth</li>
            <li> Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good \\&quot;mouth</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re buying this toothbrush it&#x27;s probably a good idea to order another set of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me that experience just speaks for how valuable it is to use a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the sonicare because it is good at getting in between your teeth even if you don&#x27;t floss every day.</li>
            <li> Amazon always has good deals, so I ordered two FlexCare</li>
            <li> This is a good investment for your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seems good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Skip the HX6921 unless you find a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush and sanitizer with light.  </li>
            <li> good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so good after every bushing.</li>
            <li> We have been using a Sonicare Pro Results toothbrush for about three years and have loved it, so I jumped at the chance to try this newer model.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> It fits my hand nicely and the timer in it is very handy.</li>
            <li> The best clean teeth without the dentist.</li>
            <li> many GREAT settings like an additional minute or refresh cycle</li>
            <li> in all, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Work real good  ,powerful and lightweight .</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> number).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> So far, it works great and does a very good job of maintaining good dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> they also love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out -they are awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it, works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> Love the timer!</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; when it is time to switch sides, making sure you get the perfect clean every time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine from a utility standpoint - it does a great job cleaning my teeth - but the design could use a refresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this model certainly ranks as one of the best.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing to me</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> think I will start returning mine every time when it is a week inside warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, cheaply</li>
            <li> I want to congratulate folks at Phillips/Sonicare on hiring the most talented engineers money can buy.</li>
            <li> both are great toothbrushes, but unless you are ok shelling out $150 every 2-3 years, Oral-B is a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is effective and durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a battery level indicator too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel the handle vibrating anymore, which is nice.</li>
            <li> (others like Oral B have the circular ones that rotate, they&#x27;re not as nice).</li>
            <li> deluxe charger and cord wrap option.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel the difference from the brushes that I used to buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Now, what I liked about that model was the UV sanitizer that could hold two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibrations from this brush are very fast and it makes you feel like you are, indeed, getting a very good level of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent batteries life which is great for long trips.</li>
            <li> cleaning capabilities are great too, but I find I need longer to brush just to get the surface clean</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Very happy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is awesome, and even better than our older one.</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job--even on the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> One excellent option lets you continue brushing after the two minutes are up, just like my old Oral B did.</li>
            <li> the timer to ensure I got the recommended full 2-minute brush, and of course 3) the especially clean feeling after each brush.  </li>
            <li> That aside this  is a great looking, professional-quality brush and a great value overall.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a much better job than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> They have been working great with proven results as I have been consistently getting flying colors on my gum reports in dental</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold and used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare handle feel more ergonomic than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare</li>
            <li> In addition, it has a nice LED light on the toothbrush itself showing you if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare-</li>
            <li> After using mine, I bought three more for my grown childrem..</li>
            <li> Compared to those in the former category, this has much more power (yes, the brush does revolve faster, 31,000 RPM), has a wonderfully lightweight, ergonomic handle</li>
            <li> Like many models these days</li>
            <li> but after many weeks of using I still am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.  </li>
            <li> love it -</li>
            <li> Love it, leaves teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried oral b and love sonicare so much better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li> I love sonicares.</li>
            <li> I think this is much better for my gum health than the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> It also seems to produce much more liquid in my mouth than with Oral B.  </li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t many-</li>
            <li> No cavities, gums were healthy.</li>
            <li> only).&lt;br /&gt;-I must say, for a top branded product like this one, and having to have replaced the toothbrush three times now, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The handling is easier because of its shape, and love the options.</li>
            <li> I love the timer, and</li>
            <li> (that being said, my dentist seems perfectly satisfied with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the FlexCare Plus and FlexCare models over the HealthyWhite or DiamondClean models because the FlexCare models have more mode options (and are easier to switch between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My latest, just gave out Sunday, and I went online looking for an alternative to try out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased with that.</li>
            <li> The different settings are awesome.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I used a Phillips Elite electric toothbrush for many years so when I decided to replace it I upgraded to</li>
            <li> My Oral-B lasted me more than 5 year</li>
            <li> This Sonicare feels more refined, it feels like its works better because it just doesnt make a bunch of foam on your mouth.</li>
            <li> Everything was better.</li>
            <li> : This is my favorite feature.</li>
            <li> This brush feels a lot more like the cleaning tools that dentists use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although each style has its strengths, many believe \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; is better than \\&quot;oscillating\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> Still, oscillating ones are still better than manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> In regards to overall dental health, this is THE BEST purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> The timer keeps me focused on brushing for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li> In the dentist office, you just see the box on top of a shelve with &amp;</li>
            <li> I love the improvements</li>
            <li> I had more faith in Amazon then what was demonstrated in this transaction.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> our check ups have never been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare before and have had it for more than two years</li>
            <li> so I wanted something newer and better :)</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years &amp; never want to be without one.  </li>
            <li> But these vibrations back and forth do an excellent job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> on....somebody make a reasonably priced electric tooth brush that does a great job.</li>
            <li> The brush heads themselves seem to make the most difference to me,  </li>
            <li> This model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> And, as always with Sonicare, the brushing/cleaning quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> I have this toothbrush and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  </li>
            <li> And, I love the carrying case for the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Recharging glass cup is kinda goofy thought.</li>
            <li> I love the updated interface on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Just seems like a gadgety way to charge quite a lot more for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We love the sonicare dental products.</li>
            <li> It is a good price and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love this model.</li>
            <li> Love the selections and options.</li>
            <li> Need I say more</li>
            <li> Now on to reviewing the latest unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean feeling after every brush, and I have noticed better gums!</li>
            <li> This is what she had asked for Christmas and she was very excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> It attacks your teeth one tooth at a time and it makes your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> When the world first heard that philips was getting into the electric toothbrush category, everyone laughed, including myself.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare, my teeth (which felt good before with the Oral-B) felt SO MUCH CLEANER!  </li>
            <li> I like to feel my teeth after brushing because they feel so clean!  </li>
            <li> Clean teeth again!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Sonicare toothbrush heads and like the Diamond Clean version the best because they get my teeth the cleanest and whitest.  </li>
            <li> Since I have tried both styles, I can say with honesty that \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; does clean better and more.</li>
            <li> and I think a very good value for the money...would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric toothbrush priced between the better budget models (S40-$75) and the higher-end complete bells-and-whistles, retractable cord, auto-sanitizing, warning if you&#x27;re using too much pressure, etc.</li>
            <li> most importantly, well balanced.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to check out my detailed Youtube review by searching on Youtube for:  </li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush and really noticed the difference (as did my dentist).</li>
            <li> If you buy a good quality electric toothbrush you can really improve your teeth and gum health.  </li>
            <li> My preference is for the Phillips Sonicare unit due to the superior reach of the brush, greater flexibility of the brushhead, and what feels like superior cleaning capability of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had an the original versión, and i thought it couldnt get any better, but it did.</li>
            <li> (for example, it&#x27;s slimmer, with a longer reach to easily access all parts of your mouth), holds a charge for weeks and weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Slim design and easy to manipulate around the mouth</li>
            <li> I am back to Oral B and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a carrying case that is compact and easy to pack up.  </li>
            <li> I have used manual toothbrushes, and I have used the Braun Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is still going strong and the battery hasn&#x27;t degrade yet.</li>
            <li> I tested it fully charged and it runs strong even after one week of continuous usage without recharging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The prosthodontist strongly recommended this device.</li>
            <li> It is strong yet won&#x27;t hurt your teeth or mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a Sonicare toothbrush and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I can&#x27;t really seem to tell the difference between the settings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has money to spend and wants a clean that feels superior to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> It still worked fine up until I replaced it</li>
            <li> it brushes fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine, then just stopped turning on.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> 5 different functions, perfect for sensitive or normal teeth, great travel case, and thin beautiful design for great counter appeal.</li>
            <li> Hubby loved this upgrade from his old Sonic!</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow, the timing/speeds are very useful.  </li>
            <li> five modes include a clean mode for an outstanding clean in two minutes.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t currently have or have never used a sonicare toothbrush, the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature is a great idea.</li>
            <li> I like strong cleaning and more than two minutes worth.</li>
            <li> ; written in huge letters.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that my whole family, we are all devoted to this product because it done a nice job for us.</li>
            <li> So just saying, this model electric toothbrush is fantastic... but doesn&#x27;t have the UV.  </li>
            <li> Again, this is quite useful because most people, like me, tend to concentrate the bulk of their brushing minutes on the front teeth, since these are the teeth everyone sees each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for years and this is the most solid and most effective</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush, it now focuses my effort on the real job of flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done, this was a great recommendation and purchase that will definitely support my best possible oral health!</li>
            <li> Depends on your need, you can select one of the options available.</li>
            <li> It is light and comes with travel</li>
            <li> I researched some of the Sonicare toothbrushes and found this one to fit in my budget</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is sleek, sturdy, the materials do not feel flimsy or cheap.  </li>
            <li> and they are all fantastic.  </li>
            <li> vibrations feel more intense, Oral-B feels more mechanical&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare</li>
            <li> I have only had this a couple months, but I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> After so many years, Sonicare should have it right.</li>
            <li> It feels much different than a spin brush, and the handling of it took some getting used to, but it gives you a great noticeably clean feeling.</li>
            <li> this one is easily the best for several reasons that become obvious the more you use it.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job at brushing and getting one&#x27;s teeth exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted, worked perfectly, and arrived ahead of the expected shipping schedule.</li>
            <li> But more importantly, the brush itself is shaped more like a standard toothbrush and has even greater flexibility.</li>
            <li> brush head is smaller and seems to actually work better, my teeth always feel perfectly</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to pay more, I say get an Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I think the Philips has corrected every flaw from the original Sonicare.</li>
            <li> After significant reworking of past dental work, my dentist assured me that this would be the best investment for me to care for the magnitude of work he performed in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I owned an original Sonicare model for 8+ years.</li>
            <li> , it does not stand the test of time like the original model.</li>
            <li> And now they insist on dating the warranty from the date of purchase of the ORIGINAL TOOTHBRUSH, rather than from the date of use or from the DATE OF THE REPLACEMENT HANDLE, and won&#x27;t send another.  </li>
            <li> This is a top of the line model that is pretty affordable and does it&#x27;s intended job day in and day out.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this toothbrush for my husband, but I couldn&#x27;t resist giving it a try</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like the Oral-B cleans better because it rotates in a circular motion, but after examining my teeth, I think the Sonicare actually does a better job!</li>
            <li> It feels like 10,000 Riverdancers tapping away on my teeth except THIS time their shoes are made of Christmas morning and the original TGIF lineup.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$!</li>
            <li> with teeth masterfully repaired and prepared for anything, this little dynamo toothbrush is powerful in getting done the job of brushing and maintaining oral health.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product based on its ease of use, long battery life, and excellent cleaning actions</li>
            <li> Nice you still get a cover for each new brush.</li>
            <li> A variety of clean modes which suit well for all cleaning purposes</li>
            <li> Who knew an electric toothbrush could make my mouth feel so clean?  </li>
            <li> I feel you can get your teeth just as clean with a manual brush</li>
            <li> So get one of the sonicare toothbrush and clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I use the clean option twice a day and refresh at noon.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel after-the-dentist clean after I brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as when leaving the dentist office after a 6 months check-up.  </li>
            <li> It does get into hard-to-reach places and clean it well.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses the clean  and  massage settings.</li>
            <li> And I love how much quieter this brush is and how it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are brushing your teeth with a freight train.</li>
            <li> I bought a Diamond clean (as I didn&#x27;t find this one in the CVS by</li>
            <li> my teeth are still clean but with Flexcare it was no built up, nothing.</li>
            <li> Dentist-fresh clean every time.</li>
            <li> They have greatly improved our oral health and limited the number of cavities we&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that this was a smart buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a special \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; mode (not that I ever felt a need for that).</li>
            <li> I love the sparkling clean feeling I get from the very thorough job of brushing the Flexcare+</li>
            <li> If price is really important, the Philips is ok, and you can search for other brush heads to see if one is more appealing to you.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use, gentle on my teeth and gums and my mouth feels so fresh and so clean, clean all day!</li>
            <li> The proof of how good it is will be when I visit my dentist and see if he notices anything different.  </li>
            <li> , the toothbrush breaks the 2-minute timed brushing into fourths by basically stopping every 30 seconds and immediately accelerating to full speed.</li>
            <li> Also times so that you always take the full (recommended) 2 minutes to brush.  </li>
            <li> the full 2minutes</li>
            <li> With the gentle setting, along with a concerted effort to brush my teeth more than my gums, I have eliminated this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was never quite sure it was really cleaning as well as the bulkier models</li>
            <li> I went through the testing, and proceeded to full out a replacement form.</li>
            <li> Then purchased this Sonicare and was pleased to find it was much quieter.  </li>
            <li> or so you will come to love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this toothbrush initially because I was used to the Oral-B, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare also massages the gum line and really helps to reduce plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty good - I can&#x27;t say for sure how long it takes for one charge - but it is a while before you have to re-charge.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be pretty loud but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This model allows for three minutes and the gum setting is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> , my experiences with customer service were pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The different settings that are available are great (clean, refresh, gum care, sensitive, massage).  </li>
            <li> A refresh mode for those quick one minute touch-ups.</li>
            <li> but the basic design is good and you pay for features if they are worth it for you.</li>
            <li> My gums are pink and healthy, and, with the exception of the two pockets, are nice and smug around each tooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s philips established a well name for themselves when it came to electric products like tape, CD players, and many more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for a few years, and have been very happy with them on the whole.</li>
            <li> And it appears to be doing a better job of keeping water out of the unit, which was a problem with the older one.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li> The refresh setting is a shorter amount of time just for those quick tooth/breath freshen ups when you have to dash.  </li>
            <li> The refresh setting is a shorter amount of time just for those quick tooth/breath freshen ups when you have to dash.  </li>
            <li> I have used sonicare products for many years and recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice balance of price/gizmos and after using it for two weeks I find it comparable to my other Sonicare (the Healthy White).are</li>
            <li> More powerful and love the different modes.  </li>
            <li> Also, the sound it makes is a much higher frequency than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I would not be able to live with this if it were.  </li>
            <li> If I ever do need to purchase a new one, it sure isn&#x27;t going to be a philips.</li>
            <li> After months of hesitation, research, product and price comparison reviews, I purchased the Philips Sonicare Flexcare + and was pleased with the prompt delivery and brand new item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> ) Attractive design and small footprint keep you bathroom counter-top clutter free</li>
            <li> My recent checkup was one of the best in long time.</li>
            <li> new device appears to work fine although it is noisier than my original unit.</li>
            <li> FlexCare Plus, used on Gum Care mode, put me back on track for more pleasant dentist visits in the future.</li>
            <li> still felt amazing, brushed after breakfast at 6am and teeth</li>
            <li> They are not cheap but they do a great job of taking care of teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The vibration makes it a bit interesting to get used to, but it makes your teeth feel like you just got them professionally cleaned every time you brush.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s nice in theory (equal attention to all areas of the mouth)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this for these useful features:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this for these useful features:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Its works just like my old one but with a couple more settings.</li>
            <li> bought as gift so far ok</li>
            <li> This combination keeps my teeth nice and white.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so loud, I&#x27;d like it a lot more.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, because it delivers 31,000 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, the toothbrush was worth every cent.</li>
            <li> To be candid, I began to form yellow plaque around the gum line of my teeth.</li>
            <li> great electric toothbrush for sensitive gums and daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t make a recommendation there since I don&#x27;t own the current model for that design.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans better than my old Braun one.  </li>
            <li> but this is clearly the more powerful unit of the 3.</li>
            <li> you can spare the cost, this toothbrush is well worth</li>
            <li> you can spare the cost, this toothbrush is well worth</li>
            <li> The clean feeling of freshness after brushing is amazing and very noticeable compared to a standard brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the timer that lets me know when to move to the next area to clean.  </li>
            <li> options are nice, particularly for anyone who has sensitive gums or in my case pain caused by my braces.</li>
            <li> With a precision of a swiss time piece they manage to estimate the life cycle of the battery to die right after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, ASK YOUR DENTIST or trusted HYGIENIST if this is the right brush for you.l am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.  </li>

            <li> Wife was right about buying online.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to find a new replacement that is pretty much the same as the old unit.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I really like how clean our teeth feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare toothbrushes have a distinctly high pitched sound and feel whilst brushing and the Flexcare Plus is no exception.</li>
            <li> I generally like sonicare more.</li>
            <li> , I understand a little more fully why so many consumers rave about them the way they do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> GumCare adds 1 minute to the end of the regular 2 minute brush to clean the gums, Refresh is a 1 minute timed cleaning, Sensitive is a 2 minute cleaning with lighter vibration, and Massage is a nice setting that I sometimes use after \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to brush my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have all my Oral-B wands that are many years old and work very well still.</li>
            <li> The sensitive setting is more gentle.  </li>
            <li> a nice plus if you have limited room on your sink or wherever you keep your brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a good mid-range electric toothbrush, perfect for those looking for cleaner, healthier teeth but without having to shell out for unnecessary extras in more expensive brushes&lt;br /&gt;(+) Space on the charger to hold two brush heads (not all Sonicare brushes have this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clean setting is what I normally use.  </li>
            <li> overall feeling is Oral-B is more of a no nonsense get the job done type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My first couple of times using it, I believe I was so used to the manual brush</li>
            <li> I do get canker sores at times and after my first week of switching over to the Sonicare, did get one (not on gumline) --</li>
            <li> In any event it had stopped holding a charge so this was my replacement option not as many extra stuff as origional but things I never used save the optional longer brush time option.</li>
            <li> But it is her first</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews here first before ordering, but who thought the Sonicare site would be screwed up?  </li>
            <li> Guess I was in too big of hurry to order in time for Christmas :)</li>
            <li> When I used this for the first time, I allowed the vibrating brush to move itself all along my teeth and gums in rapid fire motion, and the result was quite a bit of bleeding.</li>
            <li> This device really does an effective job removing plaque and stains and it seems like it is built very well and made to last.</li>

            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second Sonicare toothbrush and we love them.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the first electric I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another off brand, with 40,000 cycles per minute, hoping this one will last more than one year.</li>
            <li> like how Sonicare has more universal brushes.</li>
            <li> But with this brush, a pulse every 30 seconds prompts you to switch to a different region of the mouth (front of top teeth, back of top teeth, etc.).</li>
            <li> The funny thing, is that my model is nowhere on that list.</li>
            <li> Make sure you learn how to use the toothbrush before you start; it&#x27;s not the same as using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re finished you&#x27;ll definitely feel like most (if not all) of the surfaces of your teeth are clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric tooth brush for the last 15 years or more.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many different styles, models, and companies.  </li>
            <li> So for $150 I had a grand total of 8 months use.  </li>
            <li> , the Sonicare seems to me to achieve a smoother feeling result overall, but the Oral-B seems to sometimes achieve more removal of hardening plaque.</li>
            <li> The first was an Elite, and the two most recent were the Flexcare+</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for several weeks (or more).  </li>
            <li> My 2nd one,  I love the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first time it broke, it just quit charging.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it,  I noticed some sore gums</li>
            <li> do feel the unit does a better job on my teeth than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> But, for the most part it works and feels the exact same.</li>
            <li> thought it would be interesting to look at the differences between the various models, but for the life of me couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she knew how the creators were first involved in developing her clarisonic face cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love the four different setting.</li>
            <li> I feel like my back teeth are cleaned better with this brush because of it&#x27;s design.  </li>
            <li> Planning to contact support, so I may give a higher (or lower) rating afterward.</li>
            <li> Purchased  this to replace my first that lasted almost 8 years.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that the feeling is akin to what you might feel like when ascending to the top of the Agro crag on the show GUTS.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> This one has a nice balance of price/gizmos and after using it for two weeks I find it comparable to my other Sonicare (the Healthy White).</li>
            <li> love the fact the Flexcare includes a UV sanitizer compartment since anyone who puts their toothbrush in a bathroom should be aware that studies have shown microscopic fecal particles get spread all over the bathroom when the toilet is flushed.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone who wants new clean teeth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery of the Sonicare lasts longer than the Oral-B&#x27;s, more than two weeks versus about one week, though both last plenty long for most uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried all 5 but normally use the refresh for a quick clean, and sensitive for my am/pm cleanings.</li>
            <li> For instance to switch from &#x27;Clean&#x27; to &#x27;Massage&#x27; would require pressing the power button and then pressing the selector button (directly beneath power button) until the desired option is highlighted and then pressing the power button again.</li>
            <li> It has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare has 5 settings (clean, sensitive, massage, gum care and refresh).  </li>
            <li> Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it tells you how much power is left on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The gum care setting adds an extra minute to the time as it switches to a more gentle brushing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three years later, I thought for sure there would be some new model that struck the right balance between performance and design.</li>
            <li> brush looks very high tech and pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Powerful cleaning: When I first used the brush, the vibration was a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I find this a nice feature to keep the brush head clean and dry between brushings, especially overnight.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> : better cleaning, convenient, long battery life, improves dental hygiene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> If I go the whole two minutes while paying attention my teeth feel like they do when I first get them cleaned by my hygienist.</li>
            <li> I use Oral B Pro Floss Action brush heads and find that they do a better job cleaning, especially with my braces, and leave my teeth/mouth feeling better overall.</li>
            <li> Sure, it is somewhat pricey compared other basic electric toothbrushes, but it is clearly better.</li>
            <li> For me, I find that the gentle cleaning is a good option due to my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Bought this brand new at best buy the first one only lasted about 4 months, the metal piece that vibrates was loose and not connected internally anymore.</li>
            <li> Easy to use after proper instruction by dentist and/or dental assistant for thorough cleaning of teeth and massage of gums.  </li>
            <li> This new &amp; improved version is just the whip !!</li>
            <li> These batteries do not have an unlimited number of charge-discharge cycles and letting the battery run down before recharging may allow the battery to last longer (that has been my experience with most battery operated devices using the latest battery technology).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match the quiet hum of my very old Sonicare, but I console myself with the thought that it&#x27;s probably doing a better job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how the latest models compares to the original model I had which was bullet proof, so</li>
            <li> I must say that the price on this electric toothbrush is very high.</li>
            <li> I now clean my  teeth for 7 minutes or more instead of typical time most Americans do of less than one minute.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently bought and returned 2 different Sonicare&#x27;s this month (Diamond Clean, and the Elite) and nothing compares to the power and fresh clean feeling</li>
            <li> The cheap, stiff cord won&#x27;t wrap easily and kept its kinks permanently.</li>
            <li> The travel case seems to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> Very well made and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It even lets you know how much time to spend brushing each quadrant.</li>
            <li> Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design is pleasing and doesn&#x27;t take up much real estate on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> but this makes it so much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in the trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Once I started with this it ready changed things for me, I stop having much dental work done.</li>
            <li> That sonic vibration is really knocking things looseý in your month.</li>
            <li> my teeth produced way to much plaque, i could brush my teeth and</li>
            <li> I did not find as much of a difference between the settings as I do with Oral B&#x27;s electric</li>
            <li> I was very relieved</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about electronic toothbrushes, especially for the price, but a friend convinced me to try it, and I could not be more happy.</li>
            <li> And, really, that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> Fantastic I always wanted to get a sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big price.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter and it feels like my teeth are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth very well, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause the enamel wear</li>
            <li> The timing feature makes it much easier for me to give the correct amount of attention to all of my</li>
            <li> It comes with battery meter where you can see how much battery life is left.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> If the price is not an issue, then I highly recommend this Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I put off purchasing a Sonicare brush for almost a year and will never use anything else - this is an absolute game-changer.</li>
            <li> Indoors you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> I did not have this issue using my Oral-B. Second issue, about a month ago, the battery light on my wand started to flash amber even though it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare also did not put too much pressure on my gums.</li>
            <li> Do you really need to save about 2 ounces?</li>
            <li> Who needs a &amp;#34;Bluetooth&amp;#34; capable toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;Come</li>
            <li> The handle has multiple settings and the sensitive setting is gentle and effective in cleaning my teeth without aggravating my already sensitive (I&#x27;m in the Sensodyne stage in my life) teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> The first sign your Sonicare has a problem will be the motor seems louder than normal or the motor will seem to rattle inside the handle.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to avoid it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> When it works, it does work really</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth very well and the Dentist has commented on how well it works.  </li>
            <li> After much research, I decided the wife and I would go with sonicare.</li>
            <li> For the most part, there&#x27;s not much difference in fact.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare&#x27;s battery has a longer running time and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged as much.</li>
            <li> I cannot get over how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with the sonicare flexcare toothbrush versus the manual brushing</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks, I really started to appreciate the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Really gets in between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Loud and more jarring brushing experience when compared to my very quiet Oral B&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush has a low battery indicator, which is definitely a nice feature that my last brush didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, this was a replacement for my old one that finally wore out after 5 years,</li>
            <li> When not in use, the front is completely gray and only comes on when you pick the brush up; it looks a lot more sleek.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough to buy another one, same model.</li>
            <li> I bought 2nd left to right and got 4 or 5 settings more than I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you brush your teeth less than twice a day at minimum, you won&#x27;t be able to get more than 1.5 weeks from a single charge.</li>
            <li> various Sonicares all clean very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Oral B user and originally started using electric toothbrushes after my dentist recommended I make the switch back in 2005.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare Felxcare Plus, my first one lasted for more than 5 years and I had to get the same model after reading the comparison with the newer model.</li>
            <li> hope to see significant difference from the prior version</li>
            <li> Compared to other electric toothbrushes I have used, Sonicare is clearly better in cleaning.</li>
            <li> After 8 months my dentist is excited about the overall condition of my gum tissue!</li>
            <li> So I used the same original Soniccare model for 8+ years and could have gone on using it longer, but none of the Flexcare models I&#x27;ve owned have lasted longer than 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> though the Sonicare and the Oral-B work on different mechanical principles, the results are pretty similar, with the Sonicare perhaps leaving teeth feeling smoother and the Oral-B perhaps working a bit better on hardening plaque.</li>
            <li> though the Sonicare and the Oral-B work on different mechanical principles, the results are pretty similar, with the Sonicare perhaps leaving teeth feeling smoother and the Oral-B perhaps working a bit better on hardening plaque.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me at my last visit the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; around my gumline have shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li> think this is a very high price for just the main unit, one head and travel</li>
            <li> I am hoping with continued use the trend continues beyond what appears to be an initial phases of white, clean and a fresh stimulated mouth!  </li>
            <li> I like the new style (and the smaller head) much better than the old twist on style.  </li>
            <li> This new design is lighter, sleeker, and the charge lasts much longer (after a week away it kept is charge strong.)It has a nice smaller charging unit than my older unit, a time 2minute runnign time, and various speed options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally do store the brush on its stand after every use, but I was able to go on a couple of week-long trips recently for which I didn&#x27;t even bring the charger, and the brush worked well throughout.  </li>
            <li> Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads, Standard, 3 Pack]] and</li>
            <li> The toothbrush design doesn&#x27;t allow water to collect on the magnets under the brush stem - big plus for keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a dentist that has really helped with trying to figure out a combination to battle this mouth epidemic, and the last thing he tells me as I was walking out of his office the other day was try a sonicare tooth brush it may really help, so I pondered this all day since I had the first appointment of the day, and decided what the hell should try it, this dentist has done great things for me thus far, got my toothbrush yesterday in the mail and used it for</li>
            <li> This particular model has several categories: clean, gum&lt;</li>
            <li> gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, make sure you cleaned your tooth brush after used and dry with a towel completely (except for the brush area).  </li>
            <li> For a fair bit less, and for seemingly the same qualities, you can get the Flexcare RS930.</li>
            <li> I got mine directly from my dentist; I paid $150 which is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice design, and a much smaller head that fits easily as far back as the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only criticisms I have are that occasionally I get one that is very noisy &amp; all work for barely more than two years.  </li>
            <li> Gross but true.</li>
            <li> the subsequent hygienist&#x27;s positive comments regarding my oral heath improvement is so heart warming that this decision was the right one.</li>
            <li> Like I want a new one from you guys!</li>
            <li> I absolutely live it and so do my teeth!</li>
            <li> My previous one stopped working correctly after many years, so I replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li> given my Oral-B to my kids because it does a lot better job than they typically do with their manual toothbrushes, even when they set a timer.g so you have additional time to brush your gums.</li>
            <li> given my Oral-B to my kids because it does a lot better job than they typically do with their manual toothbrushes, even when they set a timer.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips delivers a nice electric toothbrush that has enough features to appeal to a wide segment of people.</li>
            <li> Back then, the only reputable electric toothbrush I knew and used repeatedly was Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Product had bold print that stated &amp;#34;NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34; printed on the outside of the box.</li>
            <li> I had an older version for about 6-7 years , It had some charging issues .</li>
            <li> Had same model before for at least 3 years great electronic brush.  </li>
            <li> The main competition here is the Ora-B line of brushes.  </li>
            <li> Replaced an older Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an older Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> While Sonicare is still riding on its ultra high rpm technology making you feel like your teeth are cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in ten years, but I use this every day (and the older sonicare model, previously) and to my surprise, when I finally did go to the dentist, he said my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> there were 4 models in the high end.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if this ever goes on sale (because I still think the price is too high)</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to anyone wishing to improve the health of their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute gum massage and regular clean modes are my favorites and feel pretty distinct from each other, with timed vibrations and levels of intensity.</li>
            <li> I have always been a long brusher for that sense of clean.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used electric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual.</li>
            <li> Philips has made a believer out of me and I recommend this brush to all.tric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual.</li>
            <li> I used it for a little bit more than four years.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth never REALLY feel clean and they make your whole head shake.</li>
            <li> As stated above, the clean mode runs at 31,000 rpm; what&#x27;s the rpm for the sensitive mode?</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, it has a high frequency vibration that cleans well, and a variety of modes that are useful such as the gum-cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I highly recommend the Sonicare brand, but I don&#x27;t know if the newest models are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are small and not the best design to get at hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> A sensitive mode for gentle yet thorough cleaning of the gums.</li>
            <li> The brush is ready to go out of the box but thereafter will completely charge in about 3hrs.</li>
            <li> but not least-</li>
            <li> /&gt;While there are 5 brushing modes, I end up just using the normal mode for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So after a few months, you&#x27;ll need to buy more brushes.</li>
            <li> The first few days, I found myself rubbing my tongue along my teeth, just to feel how smooth they were.</li>
            <li> With my old brush, I was never patient enough to leave it on for the full recommended brushing time.</li>
            <li> Plus, compared to a normal toothbrush, it is heaven being to just hold the brush in the morning and have it brush by</li>
            <li> And I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; brush-head</li>
            <li> so you can always switch to using it like a normal toothbrush without turning on the power</li>
            <li> The only electric toothbrushes I have used were the kind that cost $15 or less at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Oral-B on that point, but it&#x27;s easy enough to just turn the Sonicare back on if you&#x27;re not done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> get extra heads when you order,  the bristles are strong and don&#x27;t seem to deform like regular brushheads.</li>
            <li> I read up on them from left to right</li>
            <li> Teeth definitely feel clean and the timer makes sure you brush for at least two minutes.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about 8 months (2 users), but now does this weird thing where it barely vibrates if I push it against my teeth with much pressure at all.</li>
            <li> We have always purchased Sonicare and will continue to do so; there is nothing ineffective about them that would make us look at a new brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are what I like about this new model :</li>
            <li> The Flexcare has a new setting for massaging your gums.</li>
            <li> and I must purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> just have to wait and see on this new purchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone shopping for a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I called customer support they told me I need to buy a new one offered me 10% off.</li>
            <li> When I select a model that is close to it, they tell me the toothbrush is out of warranty, but they will give me a coupon to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Seller claims the product is new.</li>
            <li> They tell me to buy a new unit and that none of their toothbrushes can be repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li> so they sent a brand new replacement handle.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d made some progress, I still had a few pockets that didn&#x27;t respond to self-care or more frequent cleanings.</li>
            <li> This does not have the same powerful rotary action that I was used to having.</li>
            <li> The different settings are helpful, but I primarily stick to the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been one to use electric toothbrushes very frequently.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works by vibrating back and forth very very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very old Braun Oral B Triumph 9000.</li>
            <li> Basically, for more money you get a Lithium Ion battery, more \\&quot;modes\\&quot; and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer, or if you really want to shell out the bucks a USB charger and glass charging base (the Diamond Clean).  </li>
            <li> After the first time I brushed my teeth with the Sonicare</li>
            <li> when I first time I tried it out the different it made.</li>
            <li> I think the only two areas where it takes some time to get used to is the tingling situation felt during the first week or two and the fact that you&#x27;re not supposed to move the brush from side to side ..</li>
            <li> The brush also vibrates uniquely to let you know when to switch to other parts of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush does it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any different than the first electric toothbrush I bought more than five year ago.</li>
            <li> Hope this one last longer than the first one I had.  </li>
            <li> The Elite&#x27;s battery  died shortly after the warranty expired, and I replaced it with my first Flexcare+.  </li>
            <li> had the exact same issue, with a battery that also died within 2.5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer small brush heads for better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on it because the brush head sold with it was much larger.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare, in my opinion, cleans the teeth much better than any device I have ever used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Bought this unit to replace one of the exact same model that died after 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> : good brush heads will be expensive but well worth the extra money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since replaced the standard brush head with the Diamond Clean heads, which are smaller.  </li>
            <li> The included &#x27;proresults&#x27; brush head is entirely too soft for my liking and left my teeth feeling not so clean</li>
            <li> The new brush may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s got a lot of features that make the price worth it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t really think about Sonicare due to its higher price tag.</li>
            <li> The two minute timer gives a little buzz every 30 seconds so that you can make sure to brush each quadrant of your mouth equally.  </li>
            <li> The two minute timer gives a little buzz every 30 seconds so that you can make sure to brush each quadrant of your mouth equally.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am aware of, Sonicare only has two different main types.</li>
            <li> But outdoors, it shines bright like gold (sadly).</li>
            <li> They both clean well, the sonicare is less jarring for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is much better for each person to have their own base if they are teens if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the different cleaning modes it offers.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t completely seal the brush head, so it lets the brush airdry</li>
            <li> (I really appreciate this feature when traveling; the manual states that a fully charged brush \\&quot;should provide 42 2-minute brushings,\\&quot; or about 3 weeks), and has several \\&quot;modes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, and despite my ranting about the modes, this has been my favorite (well, and most expensive) of the several electric brushes</li>
            <li> Overall, and despite my ranting about the modes, this has been my favorite (well, and most expensive) of the several electric brushes</li>
            <li> br /&gt;care, refresh, sensitive and massage.</li>
            <li> This one was to replace a unit that was about 7+ yrs old (an elite?)</li>
            <li> Sonicare offers a variety of cleaning modes</li>
            <li> I have used so far.</li>
            <li> That said, the toothbrush is a bit loud while in operation.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a model that really stands out from a design perspective - it&#x27;s got a slim design that feels almost like a regular toothbrush -</li>
            <li> When this happened during the 2-year warranty period, I had no problem getting a replacement sent to me directly from Sonicare (just by calling their 800 customer support</li>
            <li> This one and my Oral-B Vitality Dual Action.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so I use the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> Markedly reduces formation of plaque/tartar, cavities and gum inflammations.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes finish early, before it switches off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I really like the gum-brushing mode, which is something my prior models didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a medal rod surrounded by soft plastic, the brush head attaches to the medal rod.</li>
            <li> The problem is water eventually leaks into the motor unit inside the handle as the soft plastic around the rod eventually wears and doesn&#x27;t seal out the water.</li>
            <li> So I contacted Philips directly to see what they recommend.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a 5 year old e-series.  </li>
            <li> As far as usage, there are two of us using the toothbrush twice a day.</li>
            <li> This brush head is sleek and smaller, the head stays much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am paying a higher price up front to save money at the dentist in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, but I just use the sensitive setting and I have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slimmer and lighter than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the first 14 uses, the brush&#x27;s intensity slowly builds so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums by using full power immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition if you are not religious enough about it, you will start getting mildew right under the rubber seal on the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> I will pick them up in a store, examine them for a minute, and inevitably put them right back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> WHAT quick one-minute touch-ups, and why not just turn the brush on again after the automatic 2-minute shut-off, and run it for as long or as short as you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The recent Sonicare toothbrush models, where the head just pops on is WAY better than the old twist on head version (which was extremely difficult to keep clean).  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd version of Sonicare with my previous one still going strong after 6 years.</li>
            <li> but I misplaced the original receipt.</li>
            <li> The charging base is kind of large for the device, but it is super convenient.</li>
            <li> Not sure if a smaller head does a better job</li>
            <li> but I think there are only two main brush heads</li>
            <li> But this particular Sonicare is my personal Favorited.  </li>
            <li> The buzz indicates that you should move on the next quadrant of your mouth (the 4 quadrants being upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right).</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t get 3 months out of one toothbrush, but I think the quality of the brushes and the holder are superior above other sonic-style brands.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the brush has a sensitive mode that I used for a few days until I got used to the stronger power.</li>
            <li> As I said unbelievable fantastic.</li>
            <li> The second time it broke, it made a buzzing noise (like it was running) while it was on the charger and there was no way to turn it off and it stopped working normally.</li>
            <li> I loved the old unit and was sad when it finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> And being new to electric toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t realize that you could switch out the brush heads if you wanted a different type.  </li>
            <li> dentist said today to go back to my previous toothbrush as my teeth aren&#x27;t so clean anymore.  </li>
            <li> brushes have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard</li>
            <li> brushes.s have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same logic as the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, but you only move around much faster.  </li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s a major improvement over a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally attracted to the Oral-B because the brush head that comes with it is small</li>
            <li> found the default brush head less appealing than the round brush heads that come with Oral B&#x27;s comparable products (Vitality, Professional series, Triumph) and found it&#x27;s flex motion ticklish to my gums.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, with the gum care and added features, it&#x27;s the one that made the most sense for our entire family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it a little under a month, the battery has remained nearly at full charge despite only having been charged to 100% once after opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hand brushing does, and is quiet with a few special settings.</li>
            <li> Also want to point out that a number of the replacement heads available online have negative reviews, mentioning the brush head may be counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my two dentists: General Dentist and Periodontist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, it became clear we needed a second toothbrush, not just two heads.</li>
            <li> I found that the brush head was entirely too soft for my liking and compared to what I&#x27;m used to with my Oral B.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old model was starting to lose its ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> No complains about the shipment and of course no regrets on buying it again.</li>
            <li> Brushing twice a day for two days without charging and the battery indicator barely dropped.</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s razors, the real money spent after getting this unit is replacing the brushes, which can run up to $30.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to have the same sonic action</li>
            <li> Got the lesser version for my birthday, took it back to the store it was purchased from and upgraded to this much nicer unit for the same price on sale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works just as well as my old Flexcare did and shouldn&#x27;t have the same issues.</li>
            <li> , it has different modes (like sensitive, gum care, massage, etc.).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 Flexcares: two developed problems with the motor inside getting loud/loose, the third had the beginnings of a motor problem but was still usable, however the metal rod came out of the handle when I removed the brush head one day.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is nowhere near the same thing as those vibrating $7.99 toothbrushes in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Unlike those, the Sonicare battery is rechargeable, holds its charge for almost a month with two brushings a day, travels well and offers different settings.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised a toothbrush could make such a difference.</li>
            <li> I am a complete convert and I will not be looking back!</li>
            <li> It was scary for me to put this much money down, but I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> broke down first.</li>
            <li> 2nd brush - same model but new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I&#x27;m back with the manual brushes and there&#x27;s no mess involved.  </li>
            <li> The brush oscillates so fast that you hardly have to apply much pressure with the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that if any pressure is applied to the brush-head while brushing the entire toothbrush stops functioning and simply makes a loud noise.</li>

            <li> Oral B, the Philips Sonicare offers several settings to match your personal preference.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true even if I tilt my head back a little to pool the juices further back, out of the way of the brush (or so I would have thought).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no sound at all, other than the side effect sound of the change in motor speed.  </li>
            <li> Each of the two handles lasted about a year, which means it was barely under warranty for the third handle they decided to send me.</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush to replace out old sonicare that we has for so long that it wouldn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Oral-B. Both have a standard two-minute brushing cycle, after which the Oral-B gives a long stutter before starting a new cycle, and the Sonicare turns itself off.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare HX6921 has the same general feel in the hand though the diameter of the grip is somewhat smaller and easier to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first Sonicare back in 2012 and have been using it everyday since then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downside, as far as I am concerned, is that the replacement brushes are pretty expensive, and they really need to be replaced every three or four months.</li>
            <li> My first one is still alive and kickin but the original design was bad as gunk would accumulate under the cap.</li>
            <li> I would love to experience a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that didn&#x27;t break down, due to a worn-out battery or a defect in design, as it seems a few people here have.  </li>
            <li> We got this for our teenage son who was due a new toothbrush anyway.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to try Oral B as I&#x27;ve heard the brushing action is just not the same and tends to cause excess foam while brushing due to the circular action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But after 2 years of normal use it stopped working, was vibrating much less</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after a year of trying to manage some pockets that had developed due to bone loss.</li>
            <li> These seem to run around $7 apiece for both units, give or take, but when considering price, you should take into consideration the absence of any spares when you purchase the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> When I say “right after” I truly mean it.</li>
            <li> The metal post on the handle to which I attached my replacement toothbrush heads had apparently vibrated itself loose, to the point where it became unusable.  </li>
            <li> At 1/2 year I&#x27;m even with Sonicare as this new brush is half the price.</li>
            <li> It definitely looks sleeker, more up to date, with hidden lights that glow behind the handle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more difficult to track just how long I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can only hope this will last me as long as my Oral-B did.</li>
            <li> The feel in the mouth is rather different too, especially if the hard part of the brush contacts the teeth--the Sonicare is more jarring for me when that happens, though it wasn&#x27;t hard to get used</li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbrush, so I have little to compare with other</li>
            <li> At least try to sell it to me, Phillips, by telling me exactly how the speed and motion differs among them.  </li>

            <li> Relative long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used their Sonicare solutions a long time and my last one got a hole in the rubber membrane that protects the electronics inside the unit and died from the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;The newer versions have updated that part</li>
            <li> brushes indicate how long you&#x27;ve brushed by making the brush pause or stutter ever 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The Oral B had a timer that showed you how long you had brushed for.  </li>
            <li> I can also say, after using Sonicare toothbrushes for the past few years, they keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The problem is these Sonicare toothbrushes do not last very long.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is easy to use and not at all uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can use a manual toothbrush to brush your teeth with far less cost.  </li>
            <li> But instead, it&#x27;s not really a beep at all; the brush simply changes its speed briefly enough</li>
            <li> I had an OralB Professional Care electric toothbrush for a few years, and recently upgraded to the Phillips Sonicare ProResults.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 4 years (used twice daily on the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting by one person) and something inside failed and the brushing action was intermittent.</li>
            <li> This one comes with a hard travel case, which is a big step up from the soft case of my earlier model, which regularly meant the toothbrush would turn on while in luggage.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot more than my last, less expensive Sonicare</li>
            <li> I take oral hygiene very seriously and tend to wear out toothbrush heads very quickly in part due to my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I have the bathroom door closed, I haven&#x27;t had complaints from other occupants in the house, but when it&#x27;s all up in your face, then it can be loud.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I had an older Flexcare model, and the most annoying thing about it was that my hand would push the button while I was brushing and change the setting.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare Flexcare gets high marks from me for having a very minimalist and simplistic design.</li>
            <li> update review after I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for a bit longer to advise on how long the brush head lasts until replacement.  </li>
            <li> And it is portable has a travel case and holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t used to it, and it made my teeth tingle in a strange way.</li>
            <li> When I go on week long vacations, I charge before I go and do not even worry about taking the travel charger, which it does come with.  </li>
            <li> hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I would probably go with the next model or two down next time.</li>
            <li> I have a huge tendency to build up very tough plaque on the ID on my teeth...</li>
            <li> I generally have my mouth slightly ajar</li>
            <li> so we can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of it, but it seems just as high-quality as all the other Sonicare toothbrushes we&#x27;ve purchased (3 at this time over the last 10 years).</li>
            <li> On my Oral B brushes I can simply go from cleaning, to massage or any other mode without having to power off the brush.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I think I prefer the standard brush head due to the way I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, when I switched to the DiamondClean brush head, it seemed immediately that it would splash toothpaste and spit when I got to the inner side of my lower teeth due to the saliva build-up there in front of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the sonicare the same day I used the other brand.  </li>
            <li> charger has places to hold a total of 2 extra brushes which is nice if you share the base with other people.</li>
            <li> I even run my teeth over them again and again because of the weird clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Dragged kicking and screaming to this choice, relinquishing my manual toothbrush, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the power of this little enamel cleaner and gum stimulation machine!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has had the children&#x27;s Sonicare will recognize the similar small head that Sonicare has switched to from the older bulb style that trapped all sorts of gunk under the head.</li>
            <li> By going with that design, Philips knew this product would by nature have a limited lifespan, it&#x27;s programmed obsolescence.</li>
            <li> Different versions do use different brush heads, so be aware if you switch to a new base that your old ones may or may not fit.  </li>
            <li> The other setting I like to use is the &amp;#34;Refresh&amp;#34; setting, which I primarily use when I want to - as the setting suggests - refresh at some random time during the day.  </li>
            <li> I would never purchase this at the full price, since I felt skeptical even being a staff member at a dental office.&lt;br /&gt;-Sure</li>
            <li> to say, after having issues like the connector to the brushhead coming loose, the handle not charging, they informed me that they cannot replace nor repair the unit</li>
            <li> It sounds like something might be loose inside</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is a little smaller than that of other brushes from my past, and that actually makes it easier to concentrate the brush directly on the teeth.</li>
            <li> After just one month of use, the hygienist informed me that I was down to only two pockets.</li>
            <li> well... after two replacements, i finally got one that doesn&#x27;t break down after one or two uses..</li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s brush broke down instantly.</li>
            <li> so I can see what I&#x27;m doing (rather than going strictly by feel--don&#x27;t ask), and though it took a little to get used to, the standard brush generally seemed to not make a mess, even when my mouth watered.  </li>
            <li> Not a good thing with such a  hygiene sensitive item.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Oral-B (if only slightly), which has a spinning and vibrating brush: though I have no evidence it helps, the spinning brush just seems to make sense to me.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer the smaller brush heads that the Flexcare+ uses, as opposed to the bulkier, messier, less sanitary heads that attach to the Elite model.</li>
            <li> The other thing it does for you is it keep track how long you need to brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products like Oral B where the buzz indicates you&#x27;re taking too long</li>
            <li> Other differences are minor.</li>
            <li> Other differences are minor.</li>
            <li> Not only did it NOT clean my teeth well, but it died after 1 year of usage.</li>
            <li> It should last 10 years and have an easily replaceable battery.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on phillips for selling crap chinese made products.</li>
            <li> different brushing modes, the Philips Sonicare can be made to vary its timings a little bit with timed periods for gum massaging and gentler cleaning.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and I was a little concerned, wondering if this brush would be too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they send a \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; version for replacements, but apparently the replacement handles I got were a little different, made in China.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really no surprise.</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is an electric and they have wide variety.</li>
            <li> However, I would miss 1) the ability to just drag the brush along instead of vigorously work out my arm, 2)</li>
            <li> Whereas Oral B, I could only find mine at a few places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money for this product which now just sits on my counter.  </li>
            <li> She said it was of the quality she expected and loves it.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are expensive - a common compliant about most electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The induction charger base works nicely and keeps the unit charged without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (if you let it go too long the unit will just shut off so you can&#x27;t hurt it by letting the battery run down).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly certain what the benefits of the massage setting are.  </li>
            <li> The charger is very small with enough room for holding and charging the toothbrush in the upright position and also enough space to hold two brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have always had major dental problems with cavities since I was real little</li>
            <li> The two weeks of manual brushing before the new one arrived were not pleasant.</li>
            <li> The unit itself works well, but the brushheads are difficult to get into tight spaces, particularly at the back of the mouth around the third molars (wisdom teeth), even when using the FlexiSoft brushhead, which is the smallest round model.</li>
            <li> But I also find that the time for each quadrant is a little long</li>
            <li> This seems to be an issue inherent to the Sonicare HX6921/02 as she had that same model prior to moving with me and it failed for the same reason.o a wide segment of people.</li>
            <li> Not only did my gums not bleed, but I found very little plaque that the Sonicare had missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while keeping dust and other things you wouldn&#x27;t want to come in contact with the brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other sonicares and brauns before.</li>
            <li> The other issue is that cycling off the brush resets the included 2-minute brushing timer</li>
            <li> This seems to be an issue inherent to the Sonicare HX6921/02 as she had that same model prior to moving with me and it failed for the same reason.</li>
            <li> it makes your teeth feel \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; but I wouldn&#x27;t be jumping all over and never use other toothbrushes again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would&#x27;ve preferred a replacement in the box as other models offer.</li>
            <li> My family has used various models of the Sonicare toothbrushes for the past 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> I was noted to have periodontal disease and ever since using this toothbrush along with few minor changes, my gums have gotten stronger and healthier.  </li>
            <li> other thing to mention is the timed buzz that goes off while brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used other motorized toothbrushes before and this was toothbrush</li>
            <li> have to throw out my second one in four years, they seem to last 2 years, past warranty, and then die, usually through the powersource dying or shorting out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was very easy to assemble out of the box, you just set down the base and plug it in.  </li>
            <li> And, to make matters worse, I am now stuck with 2 packs of brand new brush heads that I&#x27;d purchased at Sam&#x27;s Club when they had them on sale for $40 or $45 a pack.  </li>
            <li> The UV lamp was broken upon opening the package and the brush motor started to make a very loud noise after 8 months and the brush head is rubbing on the handle.</li>
            <li> but it was too bulky and big nor could I think of a way to keep the base clean.</li>
            <li> It therefore works wonderfully in tight spaces, behind the third molar, and even can get into pockets that standard toothbrushes can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> The box is deceptively sized and much larger than it needs to be to contain the brush, charger/holder, &amp; a hard plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> This Phillips Sonicare brush has some small advantages over their less expensive models, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth paying twice the price compared to the Sonicare eSeries.  </li>
            <li> but it drips all down around the handle and even onto the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I assume it&#x27;s because it scrubs with an up and down motion 31,000 times per minute.  </li>
            <li> Let the device run down until you get the &amp;#</li>
            <li> From movies, to magazines, and large displays at your local retail store (bad assumption).</li>
            <li> I have definitely less plaque.</li>
            <li> I grabbed another one when it was on sale on Black friday.</li>
            <li> this was  replacement for a previous model that had a brush sterilizer attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> Slight interruption in vibration</li>
            <li> I got this at a black friday deal of 55 dollars.</li>
            <li> Granted, my wife and I use them 2 or 3 times daily, but to not last these are expensive.</li>
            <li> After about six weeks of use, the Philips Sonicare may have a slight edge over the Oral-B, though it&#x27;s a close call.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife and I each bought one of these brushes, and in less than a year neither works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Half the cost of an iPhone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been away for a week and a half at a time and haven&#x27;t lost the charge on my toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been away for a week and a half at a time and haven&#x27;t lost the charge on my toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li> If the toothbrush has failed within less than two years, Phillips will send a new replacement handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other electric toothbrushes I have used in the past-</li>
            <li> When you use the product, it can leave you feeling a little rattled.</li>
            <li> There is also a little tab for which you can store your brush head on.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to learn not to press the buttons while brushing.</li>
            <li> I tried buying new brush heads, cleaning it thoroughly and charging it for a few days (which seemed silly because we keep it on the charger all the time) and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> The price for this is pretty outrageous, especially when the battery isn&#x27;t user replaceable (officially), but I was able to get this on sale, so it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew this when I bought my Oral B since I could only use a few of their brushes and mine were very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I was holding the brush too firm against my teeth, but didn&#x27;t get any gum soreness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve partaken in proficient but not spectacular oral hygiene... Definitely been a little lazy on the flossing!</li>
            <li> This has caused me to drop it on a few occasions.</li>
            <li> There are a few specialized brushes</li>
            <li> I have no use for that and thankfully with the Sonicare it can be disabled, but not with</li>
            <li> Just a few questions to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> use it everyday</li>
            <li> I hate when she is right!</li>
            <li> They have brush life down to a matter of weeks if you go by the color indicator and the slimmer brush is hard to get on and off without grabbing the bristles.</li>
            <li> i probably just got some bad luck with the first two orders.</li>
            <li> I also found that it was harder to get behind my molars with the Sonicare toothbrush head in comparison to the Oral B&#x27;s round brush</li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least 3 weeks, so when I travel for less than a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t even pack the charger.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for a little of the jitters!</li>
            <li> last feature is somewhat questionable because Phillips does not specifically explain how the modes differ in their product manual.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B ProfessionalCare 8850DLX.</li>
            <li> charger/stand is stable and relatively small in size --</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for similar Sonicare brush that failed after about three years.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the remaining unused brush heads neither...</li>
            <li> Truth be told, my dentist usually didn&#x27;t get all up on me even when I used just a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> Halfway through my pregnancy, those lazy habits caught up with me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement for a Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that I had used for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thought their toothbrush SonicCare was no more than a April fools prank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To put it simply, the Flexcare handle design is flawed</li>
            <li> Although expensive I will not go back to the grocery store ones that I would have to replace every month.</li>
            <li> So, once again, I was stuck with an expensive electric toothbrush from the Philips Sonicare line that was NO LONGER OPERABLE after a short two years and some-odd months.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure what the deal is</li>
            <li> I usually let the warning play out for about three times and then charge the device</li>
            <li> nothing too bad, but just want to point out to anyone who gets them from slight trauma to mouth (like canker sores that develop from biting on lip) should just be extra careful not to press too hard on the gums with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always hated the crud one had to clean between the head and the unit.</li>
            <li> You can also take the base apart, bringing only the charger part (which is smaller).  </li>
            <li> separate display showing your brush time, warns you if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The head is well designed so that it can reach hard to reach places in your teeth.</li>
            <li> It was hard to choose another electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> hard travel case&lt;</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare as I was brushing too hard and running the risk of wearing away my gums.  </li>
            <li> The hard case protects from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model comes with a hard travel case, which I like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/18/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this toothbrush to my college student little sister (who is staying with me while at school) and unfortunately have to report that this brush is starting to fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/18/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this toothbrush to my college student little sister (who is staying with me while at school) and unfortunately have to report that this brush is starting to fail.</li>
            <li> This is at least the 4th one we&#x27;ve brought for ourselves and as a gift.</li>
            <li> It felt like I&#x27;d just come back from the dentist, and aside from the unpleasant experience that usually is, I do appreciate the feeling afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> Opened a complaint over purchase, and never heard another word from Amazon or the seller since.</li>
            <li> Also, I had virtually no bleeding at the exam / cleaning...which was fairly common for me before.  </li>
            <li> Raw, painful gums, extra plaque</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very small and focused.</li>
            <li> There must be something subtle in the number of vibrations per minute, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only bad thing I can think of (besides the price), and the reason why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had the bad inspiration to check it in on my last flight home.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as oral b.</li>
            <li> I was worried going in when I&#x27;d heard the brush signaled with a beep, as I imagined a loud, annoying beep.  </li>
            <li> Bought another name  brand because it was on sale, but the bristles were too hard and brushing was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was a borderline candidate for deep plane scaling, which is expensive and painful -</li>
            <li> It is thin and has all the choices on it including massage.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B unit has an enclosed brushhead holder behind the charging position.</li>
            <li> for me this is a revolution and a game changer</li>
            <li> I wish it came with the sanitizer like my last model, but I will just use that base to sanitize my brush heads.</li>
            <li> It has really help me with my horrible teeth and</li>
            <li> I also like the slim replacement brush head design, the screw on brush-head was prone to developing all sorts of nasty crud in the screw-on section, the Flexcare brush is much easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At $150 each I can&#x27;t justify replacing it every 2 years and won&#x27;t support a company that won&#x27;t stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> The unit lasted for approximately two months.  </li>
            <li> Since I just went thru a dental make over( not by choice, but necessity) that took 3 years, I take hygiene very seriously.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate, but not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I thought the seller had sent me the wrong toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the cost and pain of filling cavities or getting a root canal.  </li>
            <li> I also found the replacement heads are expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely, one of my worst purchases purchases.</li>
            <li> Yes, this toothbrush is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This *is* annoying, and at least has improved with time.</li>
            <li> This *is* annoying, and at least has improved with time.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, considering how expensive these brushes sell for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad it costs $100 per year to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In anger I had purchased Oral-B 7000 and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare vs Oral B&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed by a sonicare toothbrush, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> To charge, you set the brush upright on its base, and plug the base cord into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a base that you plug into the wall to keep it charged, as well as a travel case for the toothbrush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> U think this Toothbrush is the best one on the market.  I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I want to congratulate folks at Phillips/Sonicare on hiring the most talented engineers money can buy. With a precision of a swiss time piece they manage to estimate the life cycle of the battery to die right after the warranty expires. When I say “right after” I truly mean it. So you are stuck with a great piece of hardware that you have to throw it away because the batteries are non-replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd (and last) toothbrush from them. In anger I had purchased Oral-B 7000 and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare vs Oral B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare handle feel more ergonomic than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare vibrations feel more intense, Oral-B feels more mechanical&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare non replaceable battery (deal breaker for me at this point) Oral-B removable battery&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B separate display showing your brush time, warns you if you are pressing too hard. In addition, it has a nice LED light on the toothbrush itself showing you if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare- I always hated the crud one had to clean between the head and the unit. In addition if you are not religious enough about it, you will start getting mildew right under the rubber seal on the bottom of the handle. None of those issues are possible with Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;My overall feeling is Oral-B is more of a no nonsense get the job done type of toothbrush. While Sonicare is still riding on its ultra high rpm technology making you feel like your teeth are cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line- both are great toothbrushes, but unless you are ok shelling out $150 every 2-3 years, Oral-B is a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least- Your experience may vary, but my teeth are cleaner with Oral-B. Not sure if a smaller head does a better job or it’s the technology itself, but I have definitely less plaque.</li>
            <li> It is thin and has all the choices on it including massage.</li>
            <li> Very well made and gets the job done. Teeth definitely feel clean and the timer makes sure you brush for at least two minutes. My only issue is that the battery life is definitely not 3 weeks. Unless you brush your teeth less than twice a day at minimum, you won&#x27;t be able to get more than 1.5 weeks from a single charge.</li>
            <li> It will be perfect if the price is $80</li>
            <li> Great!  met all expectations!</li>
            <li> After using mine, I bought three more for my grown childrem..they also love this product!</li>
            <li> Item just as described and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product and therefore give it only 4 starts because I am still evaluating it.  So far, it works great and does a very good job of maintaining good dental hygiene.  The proof of how good it is will be when I visit my dentist and see if he notices anything different.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too noisy for my taste. It is my first electric toothbrush, so I have little to compare with other than I don;t like the noise.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is effective and durable. I purchased the first Sonicare back in 2012 and have been using it everyday since then. The toothbrush is still going strong and the battery hasn&#x27;t degrade yet. I grabbed another one when it was on sale on Black friday. I would still recommended it even at retail price.</li>
            <li> We got this for our teenage son who was due a new toothbrush anyway.  He likes it because it&#x27;s \\&quot;lip-numbingly effective.\\&quot;  We have always purchased Sonicare and will continue to do so; there is nothing ineffective about them that would make us look at a new brand.  He&#x27;s only been using it for a few weeks so we can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of it, but it seems just as high-quality as all the other Sonicare toothbrushes we&#x27;ve purchased (3 at this time over the last 10 years).</li>
            <li> After the first time I brushed my teeth with the Sonicare I felt like I&#x27;d been back from a cleaning at the dentist.  The brush oscillates so fast that you hardly have to apply much pressure with the bristles.  My first couple of times using it, I believe I was so used to the manual brush I was holding the brush too firm against my teeth, but didn&#x27;t get any gum soreness or irritation.  I do get canker sores at times and after my first week of switching over to the Sonicare, did get one (not on gumline) -- nothing too bad, but just want to point out to anyone who gets them from slight trauma to mouth (like canker sores that develop from biting on lip) should just be extra careful not to press too hard on the gums with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a little under a month, the battery has remained nearly at full charge despite only having been charged to 100% once after opening.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is well designed and even gives you room to store a second brush.  Another beneficial design feature is the snap on cover for the brush head, which is not only helpful when you do pack it for traveling, but just when you store it after use.  The cap doesn&#x27;t completely seal the brush head, so it lets the brush airdry while keeping dust and other things you wouldn&#x27;t want to come in contact with the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update review after I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for a bit longer to advise on how long the brush head lasts until replacement.  Also want to point out that a number of the replacement heads available online have negative reviews, mentioning the brush head may be counterfeit.  I haven&#x27;t purchased replacement heads yet, but plan to buy either at Costco or through the Sonicare website.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a Sonicare toothbrush and it is amazing. The vibration makes it a bit interesting to get used to, but it makes your teeth feel like you just got them professionally cleaned every time you brush. It even lets you know how much time to spend brushing each quadrant. Very happy with this toothbrush and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric toothbrush priced between the better budget models (S40-$75) and the higher-end complete bells-and-whistles, retractable cord, auto-sanitizing, warning if you&#x27;re using too much pressure, etc. models. Compared to those in the former category, this has much more power (yes, the brush does revolve faster, 31,000 RPM), has a wonderfully lightweight, ergonomic handle (for example, it&#x27;s slimmer, with a longer reach to easily access all parts of your mouth), holds a charge for weeks and weeks (I really appreciate this feature when traveling; the manual states that a fully charged brush \\&quot;should provide 42 2-minute brushings,\\&quot; or about 3 weeks), and has several \\&quot;modes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last feature is somewhat questionable because Phillips does not specifically explain how the modes differ in their product manual. (see [...] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All we&#x27;re told is that the user has a choice of five modes:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The five modes include a clean mode for an outstanding clean in two minutes. A sensitive mode for gentle yet thorough cleaning of the gums. A refresh mode for those quick one minute touch-ups. A massage mode to stimulate the gum and a gum care&lt;br /&gt;mode that helps improve gum health.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the difference between massage mode to stimulate the gums and gum care mode?  As stated above, the clean mode runs at 31,000 rpm; what&#x27;s the rpm for the sensitive mode? WHAT quick one-minute touch-ups, and why not just turn the brush on again after the automatic 2-minute shut-off, and run it for as long or as short as you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that you&#x27;d necessarily want to do this, but you cannot change brushing modes in the middle of a brushing. That&#x27;s not a drawback to me.  Like many models these days, the toothbrush breaks the 2-minute timed brushing into fourths by basically stopping every 30 seconds and immediately accelerating to full speed. IT&#x27;s nice in theory (equal attention to all areas of the mouth) but after many weeks of using I still am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.  When the Phillips stops and starts, I keep thinking I&#x27;ve locked my mouth around it, when I haven&#x27;t. This *is* annoying, and at least has improved with time. I&#x27;d prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this for these useful features:&lt;br /&gt;1. Power (31,000 RPM)&lt;br /&gt;2. Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.&lt;br /&gt;3. Relative long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;4. Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.&lt;br /&gt;6. Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good \\&quot;mouth feel\\&quot; afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the modes...I think it&#x27;s over-rated.  At least try to sell it to me, Phillips, by telling me exactly how the speed and motion differs among them.  In my opinion, if you can get features 1-6 in a cheaper model, you might prefer that. Overall, and despite my ranting about the modes, this has been my favorite (well, and most expensive) of the several electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, ASK YOUR DENTIST or trusted HYGIENIST if this is the right brush for you.l am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist&#x27;s office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist&#x27;s brush.

            <li> love it - I like it a lot more than my last, less expensive Sonicare</li>
            <li> I shopped online and compared prices and products. This particular model has several categories: clean, gum&lt;br /&gt;care, refresh, sensitive and massage. I immediately noticed the difference! My teeth sparkle and my gums look healthier. Yesterday I went to my dentist and he complimented me...&amp;#34;Your teeth and gums are in excellent&lt;br /&gt;condition.&amp;#34;  Matilda Jane - Texas</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and definitely does the job!  Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> this was  replacement for a previous model that had a brush sterilizer attached to the charger. Charger and sterilizer still worked but the handle decided it did not want to shut off after five years of use it turned on independently. Thought the toothbrush became haunted LOL. In any event it had stopped holding a charge so this was my replacement option not as many extra stuff as origional but things I never used save the optional longer brush time option. So in essence excellent replacement choice.</li>
            <li> Yes! Love it, leaves teeth and mouth feeling like you just had a cleaning aptpointment at the dentist&#x27;s office! Would definitely recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using various models of the Philips Sonicare care toothbrush for years. They have been working great with proven results as I have been consistently getting flying colors on my gum reports in dental visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are what I like about this new model :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Slim design and easy to manipulate around the mouth&lt;br /&gt;- A variety of clean modes which suit well for all cleaning purposes&lt;br /&gt;- Quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent batteries life which is great for long trips. I tested it fully charged and it runs strong even after one week of continuous usage without recharging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product based on its ease of use, long battery life, and excellent cleaning actions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other sonicares and brauns before. I generally like sonicare more. They both clean well, the sonicare is less jarring for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t currently have or have never used a sonicare toothbrush, the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature is a great idea. For the first 14 uses, the brush&#x27;s intensity slowly builds so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums by using full power immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pulses to let you know to spend the correct amount of time on the four sections of your mouth. The brush turns off when your two minutes are finished. Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are 5 brushing modes, I end up just using the normal mode for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case has an image imprinted on the bottom so you can tell how to store the brush head and handle. This case also has vent holes to prevent moisture/mold build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger has a cord-wrap built in so it keeps the cord at the perfect length. So no dangly cords! It&#x27;s nice to have a battery level indicator too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I there are more expensive and cheaper sonicare brushes (I have some) but the basic design is good and you pay for features if they are worth it for you.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as oral b.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B ProfessionalCare 8850DLX. The unit itself works well, but the brushheads are difficult to get into tight spaces, particularly at the back of the mouth around the third molars (wisdom teeth), even when using the FlexiSoft brushhead, which is the smallest round model. The Sonicare HX6921 has the same general feel in the hand though the diameter of the grip is somewhat smaller and easier to manipulate. The length of the \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; section is longer and as a result the Sonicare is easier to utilize to brush the back molars. But more importantly, the brush itself is shaped more like a standard toothbrush and has even greater flexibility. It therefore works wonderfully in tight spaces, behind the third molar, and even can get into pockets that standard toothbrushes can&#x27;t reach. Meanwhile, it has a high frequency vibration that cleans well, and a variety of modes that are useful such as the gum-cleaning mode. The induction charger base works nicely and keeps the unit charged without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B comes with a number of extra brushheads. The Sonicare does not. So after a few months, you&#x27;ll need to buy more brushes. These seem to run around $7 apiece for both units, give or take, but when considering price, you should take into consideration the absence of any spares when you purchase the Sonicare unit. The Oral-B unit has an enclosed brushhead holder behind the charging position. The Sonicare has two points where additional brushheads can be stored, but they are not enclosed. My preference is for the Phillips Sonicare unit due to the superior reach of the brush, greater flexibility of the brushhead, and what feels like superior cleaning capability of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out -they are awesome. This one was to replace a unit that was about 7+ yrs old (an elite?) and was losing it&#x27;s charge.  This new design is lighter, sleeker, and the charge lasts much longer (after a week away it kept is charge strong.)It has a nice smaller charging unit than my older unit, a time 2minute runnign time, and various speed options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is smaller and seems to actually work better, my teeth always feel perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried oral b and love sonicare so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Oral B user and originally started using electric toothbrushes after my dentist recommended I make the switch back in 2005. Since then I&#x27;ve used a number of different brush brands including Sonicare, Oral B, and Panasonic. About 1.5 years ago I decided to have braces installed on my teeth and still have them. I take oral hygiene very seriously and tend to wear out toothbrush heads very quickly in part due to my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;INITIAL IMPRESSIONS &amp; SETUP:&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare Flexcare gets high marks from me for having a very minimalist and simplistic design. The box is deceptively sized and much larger than it needs to be to contain the brush, charger/holder, &amp; a hard plastic travel case. The charger is very small with enough room for holding and charging the toothbrush in the upright position and also enough space to hold two brush heads. The design is pleasing and doesn&#x27;t take up much real estate on my bathroom vanity. The brush is ready to go out of the box but thereafter will completely charge in about 3hrs. Included in the box is one toothbrush head so if you&#x27;re buying this toothbrush it&#x27;s probably a good idea to order another set of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare toothbrushes have a distinctly high pitched sound and feel whilst brushing and the Flexcare Plus is no exception. Philips claims 31,000 brush strokes per minute so it&#x27;s really no surprise. The included toothbrush head is shaped in the traditional contoured shape of manual toothbrushes but is considerably smaller. I found that the brush head was entirely too soft for my liking and compared to what I&#x27;m used to with my Oral B. I use Oral B Pro Floss Action brush heads and find that they do a better job cleaning, especially with my braces, and leave my teeth/mouth feeling better overall. I also found that it was harder to get behind my molars with the Sonicare toothbrush head in comparison to the Oral B&#x27;s round brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare offers a variety of cleaning modes including:&lt;br /&gt;* Clean&lt;br /&gt;* Gumcare&lt;br /&gt;* Refresh&lt;br /&gt;* Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;* Massage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These options are nice, particularly for anyone who has sensitive gums or in my case pain caused by my braces. However, the one glaring design fault here is that the Sonicare has to be shut off in between cycling cleaning modes. For instance to switch from &#x27;Clean&#x27; to &#x27;Massage&#x27; would require pressing the power button and then pressing the selector button (directly beneath power button) until the desired option is highlighted and then pressing the power button again. On my Oral B brushes I can simply go from cleaning, to massage or any other mode without having to power off the brush. The other issue is that cycling off the brush resets the included 2-minute brushing timer so it&#x27;s more difficult to track just how long I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;(+) Attractive design and small footprint keep you bathroom counter-top clutter free&lt;br /&gt;(+) This is a good mid-range electric toothbrush, perfect for those looking for cleaner, healthier teeth but without having to shell out for unnecessary extras in more expensive brushes&lt;br /&gt;(+) Space on the charger to hold two brush heads (not all Sonicare brushes have this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;(-) Brush heads are small and not the best design to get at hard to reach spots&lt;br /&gt;(-) The included &#x27;proresults&#x27; brush head is entirely too soft for my liking and left my teeth feeling not so clean&lt;br /&gt;(-) Multiple brush modes require powering off the brush to make your selection and then powering back on&lt;br /&gt;(-) Brush heads are expensive - a common compliant about most electric toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;(-) Loud and more jarring brushing experience when compared to my very quiet Oral B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Philips delivers a nice electric toothbrush that has enough features to appeal to a wide segment of people. However, lack of refinement leads to a loud, jarring experience while brushing and having to turn the brush off and on to switch cleaning modes is a curious design choice. This Oral B user will not be switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/18/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this toothbrush to my college student little sister (who is staying with me while at school) and unfortunately have to report that this brush is starting to fail. The problem is that if any pressure is applied to the brush-head while brushing the entire toothbrush stops functioning and simply makes a loud noise. This seems to be an issue inherent to the Sonicare HX6921/02 as she had that same model prior to moving with me and it failed for the same reason.o a wide segment of people.

            <li> I got mine directly from my dentist; I paid $150 which is pretty pricey. I got the model with UV sanitizer. The UV lamp was broken upon opening the package and the brush motor started to make a very loud noise after 8 months and the brush head is rubbing on the handle. I am back to Oral B and couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Philips produces overpriced low quality products.</li>
            <li> Who knew an electric toothbrush could make my mouth feel so clean?  I always thought these toothbrushes were hype and just powered  what is an arm-powered job.  But my dentist recommended this one and I&#x27;m so glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You remember what your teeth feel like after the hygienist cleans them? That&#x27;s what they feel like every time you brush with this.  Also times so that you always take the full (recommended) 2 minutes to brush.  Slight interruption in vibration every 30 seconds lets you concentrate on 1/4 of your mouth at a time, then move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a gum care setting as well.  Excellent price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old model was starting to lose its ability to hold a charge. I got this at a black friday deal of 55 dollars. Its works just like my old one but with a couple more settings. I messed around with the settings but the basic one is the one I really only every use. I love sonicares. I feel you can get your teeth just as clean with a manual brush but this makes it so much easier and quicker. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare Felxcare Plus, my first one lasted for more than 5 years and I had to get the same model after reading the comparison with the newer model. No complains about the shipment and of course no regrets on buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is at least the 4th one we&#x27;ve brought for ourselves and as a gift. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Great product and haven&#x27;t needed a cavity since buying one!</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is an electric and they have wide variety. It really makes a difference in the trips to the dentist. Once I started with this it ready changed things for me, I stop having much dental work done. For me that experience just speaks for how valuable it is to use a good electric toothbrush. I like the sonicare because it is good at getting in between your teeth even if you don&#x27;t floss every day. That sonic vibration is really knocking things looseý in your month. The other thing it does for you is it keep track how long you need to brush. Cense you are supposed to brush for two minutes it has a build in timer. When you turn it on, it will turn itself off in two minutes. I can tell you that my whole family, we are all devoted to this product because it done a nice job for us. So I highly recommend this product. So get one of the sonicare toothbrush and clean your teeth. It was amazing to me when I first time I tried it out the different it made.</li>
            <li> I now clean my  teeth for 7 minutes or more instead of typical time most Americans do of less than one minute.  its feels great and cleans awesome.  get extra heads when you order,  the bristles are strong and don&#x27;t seem to deform like regular brushheads.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Xmas. She seems to like it. But it is her first so we cannot compare to others.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended I get a Sonicare.  I looked in stores, but there were several different ones to choose from, so I went to the Sonicare site to distinguish between them all. I knew I wanted one with the UV sanitizer.  On the Sonicare site, there was a chart showing 2 that had the UV, the FlexCare Platinum and the FlexCare + .  Amazon always has good deals, so I ordered two FlexCare + .........turns out that this model does NOT have the UV Sanitizer.  I should have read the reviews here first before ordering, but who thought the Sonicare site would be screwed up?  So just saying, this model electric toothbrush is fantastic... but doesn&#x27;t have the UV.  Guess I was in too big of hurry to order in time for Christmas :)</li>
            <li> I have always had major dental problems with cavities since I was real little my teeth produced way to much plaque, i could brush my teeth and 2 hours later they felt like they were growing sweaters, I have had multiple dentists and not one could figure it out... Finally, I found a dentist that has really helped with trying to figure out a combination to battle this mouth epidemic, and the last thing he tells me as I was walking out of his office the other day was try a sonicare tooth brush it may really help, so I pondered this all day since I had the first appointment of the day, and decided what the hell should try it, this dentist has done great things for me thus far, got my toothbrush yesterday in the mail and used it for the full 2minutes before I wen to to bed, woke up teeth still felt amazing, brushed after breakfast at 6am and teeth still feel amazing at almost noon! for me this is a revolution and a game changer I would highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> They are remarkable!  It is like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I think this is much better for my gum health than the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for the last 3 - 4 years now.  I thought I&#x27;d give the Philips Sonicare a try (my girlfriend has one), because I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B products exclusively and wanted to see if this brand had any advantages over the Triumph, Vitality, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Oral B, the Philips Sonicare offers several settings to match your personal preference.  I did not find as much of a difference between the settings as I do with Oral B&#x27;s electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the default brush head less appealing than the round brush heads that come with Oral B&#x27;s comparable products (Vitality, Professional series, Triumph) and found it&#x27;s flex motion ticklish to my gums.  It also seems to produce much more liquid in my mouth than with Oral B.  Granted, I only tested the default brush head and perhaps the others you can buy are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger/stand is stable and relatively small in size -- a nice plus if you have limited room on your sink or wherever you keep your brush.  The charge is long-lasting like the Oral B products, another big plus (so you can store the charger away for periods, if you so wish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I prefer Oral B&#x27;s products over Philips, even though they tend to be a bit more expensive.  If you&#x27;re willing to pay more, I say get an Oral B.  If price is really important, the Philips is ok, and you can search for other brush heads to see if one is more appealing to you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been one to use electric toothbrushes very frequently. I hear about their usefulness, friends tell me they work well, etc., but I just never seem to give them a chance. I will pick them up in a store, examine them for a minute, and inevitably put them right back on the shelf. But now, I finally have an electric toothbrush and now that I have used it for a short time, I understand a little more fully why so many consumers rave about them the way they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other electric toothbrushes I have used in the past- which isn&#x27;t many- this one is easily the best for several reasons that become obvious the more you use it. The head of the brush is a little smaller than that of other brushes from my past, and that actually makes it easier to concentrate the brush directly on the teeth. The vibrations from this brush are very fast and it makes you feel like you are, indeed, getting a very good level of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has a two- minute timer, which I find very handy, Dentists recommend brushing for two minutes at a time and with the built- in timer, the guess work is removed. It will also beep at you periodically to remind you to switch your brushing to another section of the mouth. Again, this is quite useful because most people, like me, tend to concentrate the bulk of their brushing minutes on the front teeth, since these are the teeth everyone sees each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 5 different brushing modes, the Philips Sonicare can be made to vary its timings a little bit with timed periods for gum massaging and gentler cleaning. For me, I find that the gentle cleaning is a good option due to my sensitive gums. When I used this for the first time, I allowed the vibrating brush to move itself all along my teeth and gums in rapid fire motion, and the result was quite a bit of bleeding. With the gentle setting, along with a concerted effort to brush my teeth more than my gums, I have eliminated this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used electric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual. This device really does an effective job removing plaque and stains and it seems like it is built very well and made to last. Philips has made a believer out of me and I recommend this brush to all.tric toothbrushes very frequently, but now that I have given Philips Sonicare a chance, I am glad that I have finally made my way back to electric brushing in place of manual.

            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second Sonicare toothbrush and we love them.  It is a great toothbrush.  I love the fact that it tells you how much power is left on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in ten years, but I use this every day (and the older sonicare model, previously) and to my surprise, when I finally did go to the dentist, he said my teeth looked great. No cavities, gums were healthy. I was very relieved and I probably owe it all to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is one great brush. I have used Sonicare brushes for years and this is the most solid and most effective I have used so far. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good investment for your teeth. After purchasing the Sonicare Flexcare, I&#x27;ve been impressed. I think the Philips has corrected every flaw from the original Sonicare. I couldn&#x27;t feel the handle vibrating anymore, which is nice. The brush is much smaller, making it easier to maneuver. The Flexcare has a new setting for massaging your gums. It&#x27;s great! I think the only two areas where it takes some time to get used to is the tingling situation felt during the first week or two and the fact that you&#x27;re not supposed to move the brush from side to side .. basically let the brush do the work.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for similar Sonicare brush that failed after about three years.</li>
            <li> Use of the toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;-I purchased this toothbrush because of the staff price we received at the dental office. I would never purchase this at the full price, since I felt skeptical even being a staff member at a dental office.&lt;br /&gt;-Sure it makes your teeth feel \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; but I wouldn&#x27;t be jumping all over and never use other toothbrushes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Warranty:&lt;br /&gt;-They provide a two year warranty, only. During the two year period, if there are problems, they will replace the defective parts for you (ie. if charger is not working, they will replace the charger. If the handle is not working, they will replace the handle only).&lt;br /&gt;-I must say, for a top branded product like this one, and having to have replaced the toothbrush three times now, I would not purchase again. I&#x27;m not sure why they send a \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; version for replacements, but apparently the replacement handles I got were a little different, made in China. This is probably also why it had to be replaced a total of three times.&lt;br /&gt;-Needless to say, after having issues like the connector to the brushhead coming loose, the handle not charging, they informed me that they cannot replace nor repair the unit and I must purchase a new one. But it&#x27;s not like I damaged the unit myself... there had been multiple defects, with only months apart from each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will ever purchase another unit. Not sure what to do with the remaining unused brush heads neither...</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed by a sonicare toothbrush, and this one is no exception. I had been using an Oral-b spin brush. It feels much different than a spin brush, and the handling of it took some getting used to, but it gives you a great noticeably clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for over a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The clean feeling of freshness after brushing is amazing and very noticeable compared to a standard brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system comes with 5 brush modes, varying between 1 and 2 minutes of timed brushing after which the brush shuts off automatically. The 2 minute gum massage and regular clean modes are my favorites and feel pretty distinct from each other, with timed vibrations and levels of intensity. The brush also vibrates uniquely to let you know when to switch to other parts of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems good. Brushing twice a day for two days without charging and the battery indicator barely dropped. To charge, you set the brush upright on its base, and plug the base cord into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Gillette&#x27;s razors, the real money spent after getting this unit is replacing the brushes, which can run up to $30. Not looking forward to that and I would&#x27;ve preferred a replacement in the box as other models offer. That aside this  is a great looking, professional-quality brush and a great value overall.</li>
            <li> I had an the original versión, and i thought it couldnt get any better, but it did. The handling is easier because of its shape, and love the options. I use the clean option twice a day and refresh at noon.</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about electronic toothbrushes, especially for the price, but a friend convinced me to try it, and I could not be more happy. I get the &amp;#34;just went to the dentist&amp;#34; clean feeling after every brush, and I have noticed better gums! I love the timer, and it &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; when it is time to switch sides, making sure you get the perfect clean every time. The charging base is kind of large for the device, but it is super convenient.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, my teeth literally were slick as an oil spill.  It felt like I&#x27;d just come back from the dentist, and aside from the unpleasant experience that usually is, I do appreciate the feeling afterward.  This brush gives me that, without the dentist visit.  I love the timer that lets me know when to move to the next area to clean.  I was worried going in when I&#x27;d heard the brush signaled with a beep, as I imagined a loud, annoying beep.  I would not be able to live with this if it were.  But instead, it&#x27;s not really a beep at all; the brush simply changes its speed briefly enough that you know it&#x27;s time to switch up.  There&#x27;s no sound at all, other than the side effect sound of the change in motor speed.  That said, the toothbrush is a bit loud while in operation.  If I have the bathroom door closed, I haven&#x27;t had complaints from other occupants in the house, but when it&#x27;s all up in your face, then it can be loud.  It&#x27;s a bit like a bunch of worker bees polishing your pearly whites.  But after a while, it becomes white noise, so you may get used to it after a time.  The charge in the brush seems to hold up well.  I generally do store the brush on its stand after every use, but I was able to go on a couple of week-long trips recently for which I didn&#x27;t even bring the charger, and the brush worked well throughout.  As for the brush heads, I&#x27;ve tried both the standard head that comes with the brush, as well as the DiamondClean one.  I have to say that I think I prefer the standard brush head due to the way I brush my teeth.  I generally have my mouth slightly ajar so I can see what I&#x27;m doing (rather than going strictly by feel--don&#x27;t ask), and though it took a little to get used to, the standard brush generally seemed to not make a mess, even when my mouth watered.  However, when I switched to the DiamondClean brush head, it seemed immediately that it would splash toothpaste and spit when I got to the inner side of my lower teeth due to the saliva build-up there in front of my tongue.  That&#x27;s true even if I tilt my head back a little to pool the juices further back, out of the way of the brush (or so I would have thought).  Meh.  Overall, I do like this brush, though it&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t ever use a manual brush again.  Truth be told, my dentist usually didn&#x27;t get all up on me even when I used just a manual brush.  However, I would miss 1) the ability to just drag the brush along instead of vigorously work out my arm, 2) the timer to ensure I got the recommended full 2-minute brush, and of course 3) the especially clean feeling after each brush.  The price for this is pretty outrageous, especially when the battery isn&#x27;t user replaceable (officially), but I was able to get this on sale, so it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has money to spend and wants a clean that feels superior to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Philips Sonicare Flexcar Plus. I am confident that this was a smart buy.</li>
            <li> bought as gift so far ok</li>
            <li> This was my third electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s time for some innovation in this product line. This brush does it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any different than the first electric toothbrush I bought more than five year ago. That&#x27;s fine from a utility standpoint - it does a great job cleaning my teeth - but the design could use a refresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last toothbrush was the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]. That&#x27;s a model that really stands out from a design perspective - it&#x27;s got a slim design that feels almost like a regular toothbrush - but I was never quite sure it was really cleaning as well as the bulkier models (that being said, my dentist seems perfectly satisfied with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, I thought for sure there would be some new model that struck the right balance between performance and design. I was wrong. This brush has a low battery indicator, which is definitely a nice feature that my last brush didn&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s got a special \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; mode (not that I ever felt a need for that). The travel case seems to be pretty high quality. But the brush is just so bulky. Why haven&#x27;t they found a way to address that yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design quibbles aside, though, this brush performs. My teeth feel after-the-dentist clean after I brush. The first few days, I found myself rubbing my tongue along my teeth, just to feel how smooth they were. And, really, that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> My family has used various models of the Sonicare toothbrushes for the past 10+ years.  I cannot imagine not having/using a Sonicare toothbrush.  They have greatly improved our oral health and limited the number of cavities we&#x27;ve gotten.  The recent Sonicare toothbrush models, where the head just pops on is WAY better than the old twist on head version (which was extremely difficult to keep clean).  I prefer the FlexCare Plus and FlexCare models over the HealthyWhite or DiamondClean models because the FlexCare models have more mode options (and are easier to switch between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this [[ASIN:B00CUG273A Philips Sonicare HX6921/02 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] with the [[ASIN:B0086VIA3O Philips Sonicare HX6063/64 Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads, Standard, 3 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B009PIJLMQ Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Toothpaste Twin Pack 2 X 4.1 Oz]].  This combination keeps my teeth nice and white.  I&#x27;ve tried several of the Sonicare toothbrush heads and like the Diamond Clean version the best because they get my teeth the cleanest and whitest.  (Yes, I can actually feel the difference.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all my years of using Sonicare toothbrushes, the only issue I&#x27;ve ever had is that the rod that the toothbrush sits on sometimes starts to rattle/jiggle/loosen.  When this happened during the 2-year warranty period, I had no problem getting a replacement sent to me directly from Sonicare (just by calling their 800 customer support number).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the first electric I&#x27;ve used. It seems to be pretty loud but it does a good job. It has a base that you plug into the wall to keep it charged, as well as a travel case for the toothbrush. All in all I think it&#x27;s a good product and I recommend it. If it weren&#x27;t so loud, I&#x27;d like it a lot more.</li>
            <li> Dragged kicking and screaming to this choice, relinquishing my manual toothbrush, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the power of this little enamel cleaner and gum stimulation machine!  After significant reworking of past dental work, my dentist assured me that this would be the best investment for me to care for the magnitude of work he performed in my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with teeth masterfully repaired and prepared for anything, this little dynamo toothbrush is powerful in getting done the job of brushing and maintaining oral health.  I have always been a long brusher for that sense of clean.  I will often use the 2 minute brushing cycle setting on this device...x 2!  I like to spend the time cleaning as well as giving time to work the gum line.  That is the biggest feature i feel that I could not replicate with my manual brush - the incredible power to stimulate the gums.  I&#x27;m the winner in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning capabilities are great too, but I find I need longer to brush just to get the surface clean I want on my enamels.  In the process, using a baking soda whitening paste, this device HAS contributed to whitening my teeth.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since starting use and I can see the results.  I am hoping with continued use the trend continues beyond what appears to be an initial phases of white, clean and a fresh stimulated mouth!  Figure out how best to use this device....many GREAT settings like an additional minute or refresh cycle et. al.  Using this toothbrush, it now focuses my effort on the real job of flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done, this was a great recommendation and purchase that will definitely support my best possible oral health!</li>
            <li> I must say since getting this toothbrush in December, my dental health has improved.  I was noted to have periodontal disease and ever since using this toothbrush along with few minor changes, my gums have gotten stronger and healthier.  My recent checkup was one of the best in long time.</li>
            <li> The problem is these Sonicare toothbrushes do not last very long. I&#x27;ve now had 3 die on me around the 1 year mark. Granted, my wife and I use them 2 or 3 times daily, but to not last these are expensive. My latest, just gave out Sunday, and I went online looking for an alternative to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another off brand, with 40,000 cycles per minute, hoping this one will last more than one year. At 1/2 year I&#x27;m even with Sonicare as this new brush is half the price. At one year I&#x27;ll be elated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have the same sonic action so I&#x27;m pleased with that. I did not want to try Oral B as I&#x27;ve heard the brushing action is just not the same and tends to cause excess foam while brushing due to the circular action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will just have to wait and see on this new purchase.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve partaken in proficient but not spectacular oral hygiene... Definitely been a little lazy on the flossing! Halfway through my pregnancy, those lazy habits caught up with me. Raw, painful gums, extra plaque, you get the idea. After a torturous cleaning, I knew I needed an intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 1 and 2 of using this toothbrush, my gums bled. Unfortunate, but not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;Days 3 and 4 my gums behaved but I still felt that I had engaged in overly vigorous brushing/flossing and/or had been to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 I tried flossing, and had no drama at all! Not only did my gums not bleed, but I found very little plaque that the Sonicare had missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare FlexCare Plus, used on Gum Care mode, put me back on track for more pleasant dentist visits in the future. Very happy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 months and I feel the difference</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I thought the seller had sent me the wrong toothbrush.  The handle had 2 buttons then just a shiny metallic handle with no words, no charging lights, etc.  The model number on the bottom was also slightly different than advertised.  But when you turn it on or put it on the charger, the handle lights up and it looks just like the picture.  Before I bought this, I had an older Flexcare model, and the most annoying thing about it was that my hand would push the button while I was brushing and change the setting.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this model, which is great!</li>
            <li> Since this wasn&#x27;t for me personally, I can&#x27;t rate it myself.  However, my Daughter-in-Law loved it!  This is what she had asked for Christmas and she was very excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt cleaner. I would never go back to a manual toothbrush. This is the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned. The different settings are awesome.</li>
            <li> Fantastic I always wanted to get a sonicare but didn&#x27;t want to pay the big price. I read up on them from left to right there were 4 models in the high end. I bought 2nd left to right and got 4 or 5 settings more than I will ever use. As I said unbelievable fantastic. And it is portable has a travel case and holds a long charge. I shopped around online and paid about $110.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush.  Bought another name  brand because it was on sale, but the bristles were too hard and brushing was uncomfortable.  Purchased the sonicare the same day I used the other brand.  This will be my only choice in toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This brush comes with only one toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a very high price for just the main unit, one head and travel case.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see significant difference from the prior version</li>
            <li> I used a Phillips Elite electric toothbrush for many years so when I decided to replace it I upgraded to the Flexcare Plus.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I am very happy with it. My teeth feel as clean as when leaving the dentist office after a 6 months check-up.  The massage mode feels great on my gums too. I would recommend this product to anyone shopping for a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ive only had experiences with two electric toothbrushes. This one and my Oral-B Vitality Dual Action. My Oral-B lasted me more than 5 year so I can only hope this will be the case for the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences Ive noticed is the Sonicare is a lot lighter and smaller. This has caused me to drop it on a few occasions. It is much quieter and it feels like my teeth are getting cleaner. When I used my Oral-B, my mouth would foam and I could see places where I missed with the toothbrush. That itself is very gross when I see some plaque in the morning. This Sonicare feels more refined, it feels like its works better because it just doesnt make a bunch of foam on your mouth. I have yet to miss any areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger has places to hold a total of 2 extra brushes which is nice if you share the base with other people. 3 if you leave one on the charger. It has a traveling case which is helpful. I always wondered how I could bring my Oral-B when I travel but it was too bulky and big nor could I think of a way to keep the base clean. My worries are gone with this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how Sonicare has more universal brushes. I wish I knew this when I bought my Oral B since I could only use a few of their brushes and mine were very hard to find. As far as I am aware of, Sonicare only has two different main types. There are a few specialized brushes but I think there are only two main brush heads so it should be no problem finding replacement heads. Whereas Oral B, I could only find mine at a few places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I can only hope this will last me as long as my Oral-B did. Also, I could not find any positives that the Oral-B had over this Sonicare. Everything was better.</li>
            <li> Got the lesser version for my birthday, took it back to the store it was purchased from and upgraded to this much nicer unit for the same price on sale.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used their Sonicare solutions a long time and my last one got a hole in the rubber membrane that protects the electronics inside the unit and died from the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;The newer versions have updated that part so it shouldn&#x27;t happen anymore, last unit was a Flexcare, then I got the lesser version with 3 settings, so I upgraded to the Flexcare plus.&lt;br /&gt;Works just as well as my old Flexcare did and shouldn&#x27;t have the same issues. Cleans my teeth very well, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause the enamel wear hand brushing does, and is quiet with a few special settings. I like that the power button and extra settings buttons are separate so I can set the cleaning setting I want once, and hit the power button without having to cycle through every setting just to turn the brush off.&lt;br /&gt;Great bang for buck when on sale.</li>
            <li> I had an OralB Professional Care electric toothbrush for a few years, and recently upgraded to the Phillips Sonicare ProResults. The new brush may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s got a lot of features that make the price worth it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 second timer: This is my favorite feature. With my old brush, I was never patient enough to leave it on for the full recommended brushing time. But with this brush, a pulse every 30 seconds prompts you to switch to a different region of the mouth (front of top teeth, back of top teeth, etc.). The brush turns off after 2 minutes. The timing feature makes it much easier for me to give the correct amount of attention to all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight design: My old OralB brush was bulkier and more awkward to hold. This brush has a nice design, and a much smaller head that fits easily as far back as the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful cleaning: When I first used the brush, the vibration was a bit too much. I just wasn&#x27;t used to it, and it made my teeth tingle in a strange way. Luckily, the brush has a sensitive mode that I used for a few days until I got used to the stronger power. This brush feels a lot more like the cleaning tools that dentists use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 modes: I typically only use the default \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, but I&#x27;ve tried out the others. GumCare adds 1 minute to the end of the regular 2 minute brush to clean the gums, Refresh is a 1 minute timed cleaning, Sensitive is a 2 minute cleaning with lighter vibration, and Massage is a nice setting that I sometimes use after \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to brush my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I thought all electric toothbrushes are alike. I have used Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush and it has served me well. So I didn&#x27;t really think about Sonicare due to its higher price tag. But dentists keep mentioning Sonicare, so when I had chance to get it and use it, I did. And I must say, \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Compared to other electric toothbrushes I have used, Sonicare is clearly better in cleaning. You will feel the difference after 2 minutes of brushing. Your teeth squeaks. It is powerful, because it delivers 31,000 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; vibration brush compared to \\&quot;oscillating-rotating\\&quot; brush. Although each style has its strengths, many believe \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; is better than \\&quot;oscillating\\&quot; ones. Since I have tried both styles, I can say with honesty that \\&quot;side-to-side\\&quot; does clean better and more. Still, oscillating ones are still better than manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;3. The head is well designed so that it can reach hard to reach places in your teeth. It does get into hard-to-reach places and clean it well.&lt;br /&gt;4. The rechargeable battery lasts 7-10 days depend on your usage. I think this is great, you can use your sonicare for one week, without worrying about charging. It comes with battery meter where you can see how much battery life is left.&lt;br /&gt;5. It has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage. Depends on your need, you can select one of the options available. I recommend you try Gum Care, because it does seem to improve your gum health within 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;6. It is light and comes with travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very satisfied. Sure, it is somewhat pricey compared other basic electric toothbrushes, but it is clearly better. If the price is not an issue, then I highly recommend this Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a replacement for a Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that I had used for the past 5 years.  I loved the old unit and was sad when it finally wore out.  I was happy to be able to find a new replacement that is pretty much the same as the old unit.</li>
            <li> Bought this brand new at best buy the first one only lasted about 4 months, the metal piece that vibrates was loose and not connected internally anymore. After I was sent a replacement that one made it just over 2 years then just stopped working mid brush while on vacation. I called customer support they told me I need to buy a new one offered me 10% off. After having my oralB last 10+ years with no issues there is no way you can convince me to spend another dollar on a product from phillips/sonicare. I should have never switch to this pile...</li>
            <li> In regards to overall dental health, this is THE BEST purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I put off purchasing a Sonicare brush for almost a year and will never use anything else - this is an absolute game-changer. I have a huge tendency to build up very tough plaque on the ID on my teeth...I feel like I just left the dentist every time I brush my teeth!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and it came in a timely manor, AWSOME....</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after a year of trying to manage some pockets that had developed due to bone loss. Although I&#x27;d made some progress, I still had a few pockets that didn&#x27;t respond to self-care or more frequent cleanings. The hygienist had been encouraging me to buy an electric toothbrush, and when this was reinforced by a friend who&#x27;s also a hygienist, I bit the bullet and shelled out $100+ to buy this one. I&#x27;ve been waiting to write a review until I visited my dentist. Well, the toothbrush was worth every cent. After just one month of use, the hygienist informed me that I was down to only two pockets. My gums are pink and healthy, and, with the exception of the two pockets, are nice and smug around each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is easy to use and not at all uncomfortable. The timer keeps me focused on brushing for the appropriate amount of time. The give different settings give me an option for every possible brushing need.</li>
            <li> The only electric toothbrushes I have used were the kind that cost $15 or less at Wal-Mart. Your teeth never REALLY feel clean and they make your whole head shake. It was scary for me to put this much money down, but I am very glad I did. This toothbrush is very small and focused. It attacks your teeth one tooth at a time and it makes your teeth feel very clean. I even run my teeth over them again and again because of the weird clean feeling. Plus, compared to a normal toothbrush, it is heaven being to just hold the brush in the morning and have it brush by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush looks very high tech and pretty. With the Philips Flexcare Plus and my Brauin Series 7 razor, my bathroom looks like it is from outer space!</li>
            <li> When the world first heard that philips was getting into the electric toothbrush category, everyone laughed, including myself. Back in the 90&#x27;s philips established a well name for themselves when it came to electric products like tape, CD players, and many more. They were a heck of a lot cheaper than Sony, but offered a well made product. Everyone thought their toothbrush SonicCare was no more than a April fools prank. But then dentists started recommending their toothbrush and advertised their Sonic Care all over the office. I did not know that the Sonic Care was the philips toothbrush everyone was talking about. In the dentist office, you just see the box on top of a shelve with &amp;#34;Sonic Care&amp;#34; written in huge letters. Back then, the only reputable electric toothbrush I knew and used repeatedly was Oral-B. Soon, those who were looking for the best of the best were stuck between Oral-B and Philips. A years ago, I was under the impression that Philips made the best electric toothbrush. Simply because they were everywhere. From movies, to magazines, and large displays at your local retail store (bad assumption). My results were not as impressive as I thought it would be. To be candid, I began to form yellow plaque around the gum line of my teeth. Indoors you can&#x27;t really tell. But outdoors, it shines bright like gold (sadly). I did not have this issue using my Oral-B. Second issue, about a month ago, the battery light on my wand started to flash amber even though it is fully charged. You can use the wand, but it will shut off during your brushing session because the battery runs out of juice. On Philips&#x27;s website, they say to try another outlet, another charger, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, contact them for a replacement. I went through the testing, and proceeded to full out a replacement form. There is a portion on the form where you select the model you have. The funny thing, is that my model is nowhere on that list. When I select a model that is close to it, they tell me the toothbrush is out of warranty, but they will give me a coupon to buy a new one. HA! Like I want a new one from you guys! I still have all my Oral-B wands that are many years old and work very well still. I&#x27;m just going to go back to them. If I ever do need to purchase a new one, it sure isn&#x27;t going to be a philips. Not only did it NOT clean my teeth well, but it died after 1 year of usage.</li>
            <li> I have only had this a couple months, but I was impressed with how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with this toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth, so I use the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting. The battery lasts at least 3 weeks, so when I travel for less than a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t even pack the charger.</li>
            <li> Make sure you learn how to use the toothbrush before you start; it&#x27;s not the same as using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this would alert me when I have been brushing for two minutes, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for at least a decade.  I know my great dental health is because of these brushes.  My previous one stopped working correctly after many years, so I replaced it with this one.  I love the improvements sand additional settings.  I wish it came with the sanitizer like my last model, but I will just use that base to sanitize my brush heads.</li>
            <li> great electric toothbrush for sensitive gums and daily cleaning.  I would definitely recommend product to family and friends. ! !</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Oral-B electric brush and had to return it because of the noise it made.  Then purchased this Sonicare and was pleased to find it was much quieter.  It doesn&#x27;t match the quiet hum of my very old Sonicare, but I console myself with the thought that it&#x27;s probably doing a better job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Seller claims the product is new. Evidence of package being opened and resealed. Product had bold print that stated &amp;#34;NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34; printed on the outside of the box. Not a good thing with such a  hygiene sensitive item. Have not use the item since recieving it. Opened a complaint over purchase, and never heard another word from Amazon or the seller since. I had more faith in Amazon then what was demonstrated in this transaction. Wife was right about buying online. She said sooner or later you will get burned. Back to buying in brick and mortar stores again. I hate when she is right!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my two dentists: General Dentist and Periodontist.  Easy to use after proper instruction by dentist and/or dental assistant for thorough cleaning of teeth and massage of gums.  Markedly reduces formation of plaque/tartar, cavities and gum inflammations.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It is worth every penny.  My husband and I both use it and our check ups have never been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare before and have had it for more than two years so I wanted something newer and better :) I researched some of the Sonicare toothbrushes and found this one to fit in my budget and it also has a bunch of great things about it. 5 different functions, perfect for sensitive or normal teeth, great travel case, and thin beautiful design for great counter appeal.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and I was a little concerned, wondering if this brush would be too harsh. It is amazing and I have the happiest teeth on the planet. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years &amp; never want to be without one.  The only criticisms I have are that occasionally I get one that is very noisy &amp; all work for barely more than two years.  I register for the warranty online at Phillips.  If the toothbrush has failed within less than two years, Phillips will send a new replacement handle.  Just call the number on the Phillips website.</li>
            <li> I must say that the price on this electric toothbrush is very high. But I wanted to see for myself what was so great about it.&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts on the product:&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is remarkable! The toothbrush works by vibrating back and forth very very fast. And I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; brush-head so you can always switch to using it like a normal toothbrush without turning on the power (others like Oral B have the circular ones that rotate, they&#x27;re not as nice). But these vibrations back and forth do an excellent job of cleaning the teeth. When you&#x27;re finished you&#x27;ll definitely feel like most (if not all) of the surfaces of your teeth are clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has different modes (like sensitive, gum care, massage, etc.). To be honest, I can&#x27;t really seem to tell the difference between the settings! There must be something subtle in the number of vibrations per minute, etc. I use the &#x27;massage&#x27; setting and I find it the best for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to mention is the timed buzz that goes off while brushing. I&#x27;ve used other products like Oral B where the buzz indicates you&#x27;re taking too long and it&#x27;s time to stop. But for this product, it&#x27;s slightly different. The buzz indicates that you should move on the next quadrant of your mouth (the 4 quadrants being upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right). And after 3 buzzes, when you finish your fourth and final quadrant, it switches off automatically. I like that. But I also find that the time for each quadrant is a little long and I sometimes finish early, before it switches off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one final note - it&#x27;s the only bad thing I can think of (besides the price), and the reason why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars. When you use the product, it can leave you feeling a little rattled. This is because of all those vibrations. So just be prepared. I eventually got used to it, but I don&#x27;t use the toothbrush daily on account of that. BTW, I also use the Waterpik whichI highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this ever goes on sale (because I still think the price is too high) I would recommend buying this. Just be prepared for a little of the jitters!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush took some getting used to for me.  It was very easy to assemble out of the box, you just set down the base and plug it in.  The different settings that are available are great (clean, refresh, gum care, sensitive, massage).  The toothbrush is sleek, sturdy, the materials do not feel flimsy or cheap.  The only drawback for me was the intensity of the vibration while cleaning.  I have used other motorized toothbrushes before and this was toothbrush was a bit stronger than what I was used to.  Once I over that the toothbrush has been wonderful.  The directions are easy to follow, the timing/speeds are very useful.  It also comes with a carrying case that is compact and easy to pack up.  The Sonicare also did not put too much pressure on my gums. I feel like I come away every time with cleaner teeth.  The feeling of the toothbrush is reminiscent of the feeling at the dentist office when they are applying the cleaner to your teeth.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Phillips Sonicare brush has some small advantages over their less expensive models, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth paying twice the price compared to the Sonicare eSeries.  Do you really need to save about 2 ounces? Does the option of a 1-minute timer justify the extra cost? For me, the answers are no and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eSeries are great brushes at a good price. Skip the HX6921 unless you find a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Since I just went thru a dental make over( not by choice, but necessity) that took 3 years, I take hygiene very seriously. The prosthodontist strongly recommended this device. After 8 months my dentist is excited about the overall condition of my gum tissue! I just sent my son a Sonic and he is impressed with the cleaning process. He said,\\&quot;it feels like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dental hygienist. And I might add, he was sceptical about an electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very old Braun Oral B Triumph 9000. This does not have the same powerful rotary action that I was used to having. I went to my local Wal-Mart to try and find replacement heads (I plan ahead) and I could not find any on the shelf.  Really?&lt;br /&gt; It was hard to choose another electric toothbrush. Now days they have all these bells and whistles. Who needs a &amp;#34;Bluetooth&amp;#34; capable toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;Come on....somebody make a reasonably priced electric tooth brush that does a great job.</li>
            <li> I had an older version for about 6-7 years , It had some charging issues . This new &amp; improved version is just the whip !! The toothbrush design doesn&#x27;t allow water to collect on the magnets under the brush stem - big plus for keeping it clean.Work real good  ,powerful and lightweight .</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for over a decade. This is my 3rd version of Sonicare with my previous one still going strong after 6 years. My first one is still alive and kickin but the original design was bad as gunk would accumulate under the cap. It is delegated as the honorary bathroom grout scrubber and works like a charm. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This HX6921 version comes with the following:&lt;br /&gt; Sonicare toothbrush handle&lt;br /&gt;1 brush head in standard size&lt;br /&gt;1 deluxe charger and cord wrap option. There is also a little tab for which you can store your brush head on. I find this a nice feature to keep the brush head clean and dry between brushings, especially overnight.&lt;br /&gt;1 travel cap (always come standard on brush heads)&lt;br /&gt;1 hard travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on this model for me has been excellent and I do not keep this on the charger. It has to be charged so infrequently (approx every 2 wks) that I opt to keep it unplugged until necessary to charge. The handle has multiple settings and the sensitive setting is gentle and effective in cleaning my teeth without aggravating my already sensitive (I&#x27;m in the Sensodyne stage in my life) teeth and gums. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you travel overseas, pick a Sonicare with 240 volt capablity.  This one works up to 240V (all you need is the physical plug to transform the double bladed American plug into whatever the country you need uses (a lot of Europe is two posts).  Oral B are NOT compatible with 240, so I find we are taking the Sonicare with us on trips.  You can also take the base apart, bringing only the charger part (which is smaller).  We find they last about 2 weeks on one charge, brushing 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since you had to buy them directly from the dentist.  We also have Oral B toothbrushes in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our orthodontist specifically stated that the kids had to use the floss version of Oral B brush while they were in braces.  However, both have recently had the braces removed, and have returned to using the Sonicare based on the regular dentists recommendation (but this is based on a 1997 study, so I cannot say that with all the changes in toothbrushes that that data would still hold up) .  I have to say, although the implication is that you can switch out brush heads, in practicality it is much better for each person to have their own base if they are teens if you want any peace in your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various Sonicares all clean very well.  They all work on the same principle.  Basically, for more money you get a Lithium Ion battery, more \\&quot;modes\\&quot; and sometimes some gizmos (an external timer, travel case, UV sanitizer, or if you really want to shell out the bucks a USB charger and glass charging base (the Diamond Clean).  You can google a comparison chart.  Different versions do use different brush heads, so be aware if you switch to a new base that your old ones may or may not fit.  The brush heads themselves seem to make the most difference to me,  I like the new style (and the smaller head) much better than the old twist on style.  I have not had a chance to try the Diamond head, so cannot address if those heads are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO have to get used to using a Sonicare, and the Oral B do not seem to have the same length of learning curve, so keep that in mind if you are just starting out with an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose which one you want based on cost and which gizmos you want.  I find that having a zillion modes does not matter much, one tends to pick one and use that all the time anyway.  Also check ou the brush head cost before investing,  I find that I can get them at my local ware house store for a much more reasonable price.  This one has a nice balance of price/gizmos and after using it for two weeks I find it comparable to my other Sonicare (the Healthy White).are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO have to get used to using a Sonicare, and the Oral B do not seem to have the same length of learning curve, so keep that in mind if you are just starting out with an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose which one you want based on cost and which gizmos you want.

            <li> I have been using electric tooth brush for the last 15 years or more.  I have gone through many different styles, models, and companies.  But the last 5 years or so I have stayed with Sonicare with different models.  But this particular Sonicare is my personal Favorited.  It is smaller, lighter, smaller heads, and most importantly, well balanced.  It is very comfortable to hold and used.  It is strong yet won&#x27;t hurt your teeth or mouth.  If you just started to use the Sonicare it will get some used to but give it a week or so you will come to love it as much as I do.  It has really help me with my horrible teeth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, make sure you cleaned your tooth brush after used and dry with a towel completely (except for the brush area).  It will help prolong the toothbrush and the bottom won&#x27;t get yellow and calcium build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes for years and I think they&#x27;re the best brand out there.  This model is my favorite.  I really like the gum-brushing mode, which is something my prior models didn&#x27;t have.  And, as always with Sonicare, the brushing/cleaning quality is outstanding.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> After months of hesitation, research, product and price comparison reviews, I purchased the Philips Sonicare Flexcare + and was pleased with the prompt delivery and brand new item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush ever was my son&#x27;s response</li>
            <li> I owned an original Sonicare model for 8+ years. It still worked fine up until I replaced it, I only replaced it since I was given a Flexcare as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact the Flexcare includes a UV sanitizer compartment since anyone who puts their toothbrush in a bathroom should be aware that studies have shown microscopic fecal particles get spread all over the bathroom when the toilet is flushed. Gross but true. I also like the slim replacement brush head design, the screw on brush-head was prone to developing all sorts of nasty crud in the screw-on section, the Flexcare brush is much easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, the Flexcare handle design is flawed, it does not stand the test of time like the original model. The problem is the brush head and handle connector design.The handle has a medal rod surrounded by soft plastic, the brush head attaches to the medal rod. The problem is water eventually leaks into the motor unit inside the handle as the soft plastic around the rod eventually wears and doesn&#x27;t seal out the water. By going with that design, Philips knew this product would by nature have a limited lifespan, it&#x27;s programmed obsolescence. The first sign your Sonicare has a problem will be the motor seems louder than normal or the motor will seem to rattle inside the handle. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 Flexcares: two developed problems with the motor inside getting loud/loose, the third had the beginnings of a motor problem but was still usable, however the metal rod came out of the handle when I removed the brush head one day. So I used the same original Soniccare model for 8+ years and could have gone on using it longer, but none of the Flexcare models I&#x27;ve owned have lasted longer than 2.5 years.The quickest one went out on me was around 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips covers the Flexcare for only 2 years, so you&#x27;ll be out of luck once that warranty runs out. I know Philips also sells a screw on type brush Sonicare but I&#x27;m not sure how the latest models compares to the original model I had which was bullet proof, so I won&#x27;t make a recommendation there since I don&#x27;t own the current model for that design.</li>
            <li> Love it, works like a charm!  Hope this one last longer than the first one I had.  Love the timer!</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush and really noticed the difference (as did my dentist). But after 2 years of normal use it stopped working, was vibrating much less and I could tell it wasn&#x27;t cleaning the way it used to. I tried buying new brush heads, cleaning it thoroughly and charging it for a few days (which seemed silly because we keep it on the charger all the time) and nothing helped. So I contacted Philips directly to see what they recommend. They tell me to buy a new unit and that none of their toothbrushes can be repaired or replaced. Um what?! At $150 each I can&#x27;t justify replacing it every 2 years and won&#x27;t support a company that won&#x27;t stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for all ages....highly recommend it to anyone wishing to improve the health of their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a 5 year old e-series.  More powerful and love the different modes.  Great product, great price.  Way cheaper than anywhere else I looked for it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a much better job than manual brushing.  I also like the slim design, very nice.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this because I had some pockets over 3 mm.  I was a borderline candidate for deep plane scaling, which is expensive and painful - and I really wanted to avoid it.  9 months later after using this, all pockets (even the ones over 3mm) were reduced to the point where I no longer needed deep plane scaling.  Also, I had virtually no bleeding at the exam / cleaning...which was fairly common for me before.  This toothbrush is nowhere near the same thing as those vibrating $7.99 toothbrushes in the drugstore.  Those don&#x27;t do anything.  This thing is incredible.  It takes a little time to get used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and great how it helps your gums.  Great valued one.  I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> The unit lasted for approximately two months.  And even though my date of purchase was outside the warranty, the date of use was not so they sent a brand new replacement handle.  It lasted six months.  And now they insist on dating the warranty from the date of purchase of the ORIGINAL TOOTHBRUSH, rather than from the date of use or from the DATE OF THE REPLACEMENT HANDLE, and won&#x27;t send another.  So for $150 I had a grand total of 8 months use.  Eek!</li>
            <li> You want no gum problems, use the Sonicare brand electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best brand on the market.</li>
            <li> Had same model before for at least 3 years great electronic brush.  Amazing battery life makes great for travel.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have this toothbrush and LOVE it.  I think it cleans better than my old Braun one.  I got one of these for each of my kids.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had mine, I have had NO gum issues.</li>
            <li> If you are using a regular toothbrush then you aren&#x27;t doing your teeth a favor.  If you buy a good quality electric toothbrush you can really improve your teeth and gum health.  I&#x27;ve had a number of these over the years and this model certainly ranks as one of the best.  The main competition here is the Ora-B line of brushes.  Consumer Reports did a comparison and found the best models from Philips and Oral-B to be fairly equivalent: the both do a great job of getting your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I prefer the Oral-B (if only slightly), which has a spinning and vibrating brush: though I have no evidence it helps, the spinning brush just seems to make sense to me.  My wife finds that the Oral-B is too rough and loud (and it is), and prefers this Philips, which is just a vibrating brush.  Though I prefer the Oral-B, I think most people would rather have the Philips just because it is a lot quieter.  Either way it&#x27;s a major improvement over a manual brush.  They may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the cost and pain of filling cavities or getting a root canal.  I went from a cavity every year to zero cavities since I started using these over six years ago.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for a few years, and have been very happy with them on the whole. After about six weeks of use, the Philips Sonicare may have a slight edge over the Oral-B, though it&#x27;s a close call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare has a smaller and softer brush head than a hand toothbrush, narrower and softer than Oral-B&#x27;s electric brush heads. The brush feels and sounds like it vibrates faster than the Oral-B, but it&#x27;s actually faster in one way and slower in another. The difference is that it uses a motion like that of a hand toothbrush, side-to-side 31,000 times a minute, while the Oral-B uses a combined circular and pulsating motion, pulsing 40,000 times a minute and turning back and forth 8,800 times per minute. The feel in the mouth is rather different too, especially if the hard part of the brush contacts the teeth--the Sonicare is more jarring for me when that happens, though it wasn&#x27;t hard to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cleaning power, the Sonicare seems to me to achieve a smoother feeling result overall, but the Oral-B seems to sometimes achieve more removal of hardening plaque. Though I can&#x27;t tell any difference in how they affect the gums, the softer head of the Sonicare seems likely to be easier on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery of the Sonicare lasts longer than the Oral-B&#x27;s, more than two weeks versus about one week, though both last plenty long for most uses. Neither has a replaceable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes indicate how long you&#x27;ve brushed by making the brush pause or stutter ever 30 seconds. I have no use for that and thankfully with the Sonicare it can be disabled, but not with the Oral-B. Both have a standard two-minute brushing cycle, after which the Oral-B gives a long stutter before starting a new cycle, and the Sonicare turns itself off. I prefer the Oral-B on that point, but it&#x27;s easy enough to just turn the Sonicare back on if you&#x27;re not done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the Sonicare and the Oral-B work on different mechanical principles, the results are pretty similar, with the Sonicare perhaps leaving teeth feeling smoother and the Oral-B perhaps working a bit better on hardening plaque. The Sonicare&#x27;s battery lasts longer, over two weeks. Other differences are minor. Both are excellent brushes.s have several brushing modes, including for use on gums, but I&#x27;ve never done much with any but the standard mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch brushing modes with the Sonicare, in which case you may find it behaving strangely until you notice what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the Sonicare and the Oral-B work on different mechanical principles, the results are pretty similar, with the Sonicare perhaps leaving teeth feeling smoother and the Oral-B perhaps working a bit better on hardening plaque. The Sonicare&#x27;s battery lasts longer, over two weeks. Other differences are minor. Both are excellent brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this Sonicare to replace my Oral B.  The Oral B had a timer that showed you how long you had brushed for.  The Sonicare is supposed to do that as well, only I haven&#x27;t figured out how.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful.  I honestly feel the difference from the brushes that I used to buy at the grocery store.  Unlike those, the Sonicare battery is rechargeable, holds its charge for almost a month with two brushings a day, travels well and offers different settings.  Although expensive I will not go back to the grocery store ones that I would have to replace every month.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Sonicare. This does an excellent job--even on the sensitive setting. And it appears to be doing a better job of keeping water out of the unit, which was a problem with the older one. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had three Sonicare toothbrushes.  The first was an Elite, and the two most recent were the Flexcare+ toothbrushes.  The Elite&#x27;s battery  died shortly after the warranty expired, and I replaced it with my first Flexcare+.  I love the sparkling clean feeling I get from the very thorough job of brushing the Flexcare+ does.  I also prefer the smaller brush heads that the Flexcare+ uses, as opposed to the bulkier, messier, less sanitary heads that attach to the Elite model. (I experienced the mold problem with the Elite brush heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I giving the Flexcare+ only two stars?  In a nutshell, they don&#x27;t last.  My Elite&#x27;s battery died within a couple of months after the warranty expired.  The Flexcare+ I bought to replace it had the exact same issue, with a battery that also died within 2.5 years.  The second and LAST Flexcare+ toothbrush I bought ALSO died shortly after the warranty period expired, but for a completely different reason. I started to notice that when I brushed my teeth, the Flexcare+ seemed to be getting noisier.  Within a couple days, I knew why.  The metal post on the handle to which I attached my replacement toothbrush heads had apparently vibrated itself loose, to the point where it became unusable.  I am not a &amp;#34;hard brusher&amp;#34;, and my Flexcare+ was always treated with great care, so I attribute the cause of this problem to an inherent defect in the toothbrush itself.  So, once again, I was stuck with an expensive electric toothbrush from the Philips Sonicare line that was NO LONGER OPERABLE after a short two years and some-odd months.  I would love to experience a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that didn&#x27;t break down, due to a worn-out battery or a defect in design, as it seems a few people here have.  It does a fantastic job at brushing and getting one&#x27;s teeth exceptionally clean.  It just doesn&#x27;t last.  And, to make matters worse, I am now stuck with 2 packs of brand new brush heads that I&#x27;d purchased at Sam&#x27;s Club when they had them on sale for $40 or $45 a pack.  I refuse to use my hard-earned money to buy another Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  They DO NOT LAST!!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  The charge lasts for several weeks (or more).  When I go on week long vacations, I charge before I go and do not even worry about taking the travel charger, which it does come with.  Excellent toothbrush and sanitizer with light.  And, I love the carrying case for the toothbrush.  Good product, Philips!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Has all the features described.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My 2nd one,  I love the product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this electronic toothbrush. I really like the different cleaning modes it offers.</li>
            <li> Just went through my second handle with this toothbrush. The first time it broke, it just quit charging. The second time it broke, it made a buzzing noise (like it was running) while it was on the charger and there was no way to turn it off and it stopped working normally. Each of the two handles lasted about a year, which means it was barely under warranty for the third handle they decided to send me. As far as usage, there are two of us using the toothbrush twice a day. When it works, it does work really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my experiences with customer service were pretty quick and easy. Just a few questions to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> good toothbrush.  My hygentist likes the results and so do I</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX6921/02 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it on time and it seems to be working alright</li>
            <li> Great Product - works great!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for Christmas stocking gifts, and they were a big hit. The Flexcare Plus does everything except wash your car and cook dinner. Seriously, with the gum care and added features, it&#x27;s the one that made the most sense for our entire family. Anyone who has had the children&#x27;s Sonicare will recognize the similar small head that Sonicare has switched to from the older bulb style that trapped all sorts of gunk under the head. This brush head is sleek and smaller, the head stays much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Perfect! It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit as a recommendation from my dental hygienist.  When I first started using it,  I noticed some sore gums but I quickly got used to it.  What I really don&#x27;t like is how messy it gets when you are 3 or 4 minutes into the brushing.  Perhaps it&#x27;s operator error but it drips all down around the handle and even onto the mirror.  I even dripped on my shirt which I found (if using whitening toothpaste) leaves bleach marks.  I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I&#x27;m back with the manual brushes and there&#x27;s no mess involved.  I spent a lot of money for this product which now just sits on my counter.  I also found the replacement heads are expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel the unit does a better job on my teeth than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, this was a replacement for my old one that finally wore out after 5 years, hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no beating this toothbrush.  I have one and I&#x27;ve purchased one for each of my children.  It cleans my teeth very well and the Dentist has commented on how well it works.  It fits my hand nicely and the timer in it is very handy.</li>
            <li> This is a top of the line model that is pretty affordable and does it&#x27;s intended job day in and day out.  Make sure to check out my detailed Youtube review by searching on Youtube for:  Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li> I waited and waited before ordering an electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m glad I did. I absolutely live it and so do my teeth!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so good after every bushing.</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenage kid.  He loves it.  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years - with great results.</li>
            <li> Works great !!!  Recharging glass cup is kinda goofy thought.</li>
            <li> I purchased for our daughters.  Have had one for 3 years and it has taken care of all my gum problems.</li>
            <li> well... after two replacements, i finally got one that doesn&#x27;t break down after one or two uses.. it brushes fine. i probably just got some bad luck with the first two orders.</li>
            <li> Hubby loved this upgrade from his old Sonic!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently bought and returned 2 different Sonicare&#x27;s this month (Diamond Clean, and the Elite) and nothing compares to the power and fresh clean feeling i get from this unit which i bought only for travel purposes. Not really sure what the deal is but this is clearly the more powerful unit of the 3.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each bought one of these brushes, and in less than a year neither works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine broke down first. The individual brushing modes stopped lighting up, one by one. Then, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s brush broke down instantly. Worked fine, then just stopped turning on. It would buzz for a split second at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are the newer, made in China brushes, and just aren&#x27;t made to last. Definitely, one of my worst purchases purchases. I would rate the brush lower, if Amazon allowed me to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I spoke to customer service, and since I didn&#x27;t keep the receipts, they would only offer me a $10 discount for each brush. I was disappointed, considering how expensive these brushes sell for.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided the wife and I would go with sonicare. we are very happy with the results. My dentist told me at my last visit the &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; around my gumline have shrunk significantly. This was stated before I told them I bought the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: better cleaning, convenient, long battery life, improves dental hygiene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: good brush heads will be expensive but well worth the extra money</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare as I was brushing too hard and running the risk of wearing away my gums.  This toothbrush is easy to use, gentle on my teeth and gums and my mouth feels so fresh and so clean, clean all day!</li>
            <li> I got two Sonicare toothbrushes, one for my boyfriend and one for me. His daughter showed us her and told us how she &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; it. I ordered the toothbrushes in January.  My boyfriend and I really like how clean our teeth feel. I like having the 5 cleaning options. I have tried all 5 but normally use the refresh for a quick clean, and sensitive for my am/pm cleanings. My boyfriend uses the clean  and  massage settings. I was surprised a toothbrush could make such a difference. I like to feel my teeth after brushing because they feel so clean!  Almost 3 months since my purchase and neither one of us have had any problems with the product.</li>
            <li> We have been using a Sonicare Pro Results toothbrush for about three years and have loved it, so I jumped at the chance to try this newer model. It is awesome, and even better than our older one. I love the updated interface on this toothbrush. When not in use, the front is completely gray and only comes on when you pick the brush up; it looks a lot more sleek. And I love how much quieter this brush is and how it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are brushing your teeth with a freight train. I can also say, after using Sonicare toothbrushes for the past few years, they keep your teeth clean. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, as far as I am concerned, is that the replacement brushes are pretty expensive, and they really need to be replaced every three or four months. Regardless, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to using regular toothbrushes for anything. I feel like I am paying a higher price up front to save money at the dentist in the long run. I am more than happy with this product!</li>
            <li> About five years or so ago, I finally went the electric toothbrush route and got a Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. Loved it. In fact still do. I was traveling quite a bit for a year or so, and ended up using a regular toothbrush during that time. Well, I missed my electic Sonicare. My wife&#x27;s dentist recommended she start using one, so my toothbrush became the inspiration for both of us. Now, what I liked about that model was the UV sanitizer that could hold two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, it became clear we needed a second toothbrush, not just two heads. This one fit the bill nicely. For the most part, there&#x27;s not much difference in fact. It definitely looks sleeker, more up to date, with hidden lights that glow behind the handle. But, for the most part it works and feels the exact same. This one comes with a hard travel case, which is a big step up from the soft case of my earlier model, which regularly meant the toothbrush would turn on while in luggage. The hard case protects from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be interesting to look at the differences between the various models, but for the life of me couldn&#x27;t find it. With that in mind, I highly recommend the Sonicare brand, but I don&#x27;t know if the newest models are worth the extra money. For a fair bit less, and for seemingly the same qualities, you can get the Flexcare RS930.</li>
            <li> I used it for a little bit more than four years.  I had the bad inspiration to check it in on my last flight home.  it broke, the on/off button didn&#x27;t work anymore.  I bought a Diamond clean (as I didn&#x27;t find this one in the CVS by me).&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said today to go back to my previous toothbrush as my teeth aren&#x27;t so clean anymore.  I told him that I don&#x27;t like the one I am using and he answered \\&quot;it shows\\&quot;.  my teeth are still clean but with Flexcare it was no built up, nothing.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Recommend by my dentist.  I think it is making my teeth whiter.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> 2nd brush - same model but new features-- use it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she knew how the creators were first involved in developing her clarisonic face cleaner. She loves it and says she looks forward to cleaning her teeth now! She said it was of the quality she expected and loves it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it costs $100 per year to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to throw out my second one in four years, they seem to last 2 years, past warranty, and then die, usually through the powersource dying or shorting out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t travel with mine, don&#x27;t ever drop it, never submerse it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will start returning mine every time when it is a week inside warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;$200 for a toothbrush? Half the cost of an iPhone. It should last 10 years and have an easily replaceable battery.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on phillips for selling crap chinese made products.</li>
            <li> Yes, this toothbrush is expensive.  Yes, you can use a manual toothbrush to brush your teeth with far less cost.  However this toothbrush gets my teeth the cleanest they have ever been with the exception of just finishing up with a dental cleaning.  I have used manual toothbrushes, and I have used the Braun Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  I believe though they&#x27;ve changed the model a bit since my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally attracted to the Oral-B because the brush head that comes with it is small and I prefer small brush heads for better cleaning.  And being new to electric toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t realize that you could switch out the brush heads if you wanted a different type.  Honestly, when I was using my Oral-B at the time, I thought it was the best toothbrush I had ever used.  My Oral-B pulsates and oscillate.  It has a two minute timer and if used twice a day, the battery will last for 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently though I had heard wonderful things about the Philips Sonicare so I made the plunge and purchased the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on it because the brush head sold with it was much larger.  Also, the sound it makes is a much higher frequency than the Oral-B.  I assume it&#x27;s because it scrubs with an up and down motion 31,000 times per minute.  It&#x27;s the hummingbird of toothbrushes!  After using the Sonicare, my teeth (which felt good before with the Oral-B) felt SO MUCH CLEANER!  It&#x27;s even worked on my problem areas of build up.  I&#x27;ve since replaced the standard brush head with the Diamond Clean heads, which are smaller.  My Sonicare has 5 settings (clean, sensitive, massage, gum care and refresh).  The clean setting is what I normally use.  The sensitive setting is more gentle.  I&#x27;m not exactly certain what the benefits of the massage setting are.  The gum care setting adds an extra minute to the time as it switches to a more gentle brushing so you have additional time to brush your gums. The refresh setting is a shorter amount of time just for those quick tooth/breath freshen ups when you have to dash.  The two minute timer gives a little buzz every 30 seconds so that you can make sure to brush each quadrant of your mouth equally.  It also comes with a travel case that holds the toothbrush unit and two brush heads.  You can either take the charger with you when traveling or just take the brush.  I&#x27;ve been away for a week and a half at a time and haven&#x27;t lost the charge on my toothbrush at all.  There is a battery meter on the bottom portion of the brush to show you when it&#x27;s time to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can spare the cost, this toothbrush is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve given my Oral-B to my kids because it does a lot better job than they typically do with their manual toothbrushes, even when they set a timer.g so you have additional time to brush your gums.

            <li> I have used sonicare products for many years and recommend them highly. They are not cheap but they do a great job of taking care of teeth and gums. I like strong cleaning and more than two minutes worth. This model allows for three minutes and the gum setting is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> After so many years, Sonicare should have it right. Not yet. This brush still has shortcomings. The cheap, stiff cord won&#x27;t wrap easily and kept its kinks permanently. I like the choices of settings but why isn&#x27;t the button recessed so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get changed? Sometimes I even turn the brush off inadvertently. Recessing the controls would make sense. One excellent option lets you continue brushing after the two minutes are up, just like my old Oral B did. It charges fast and holds a charge well. The handle is slim and lightweight. They have brush life down to a matter of weeks if you go by the color indicator and the slimmer brush is hard to get on and off without grabbing the bristles. Nice you still get a cover for each new brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare&#x27;s battery has a longer running time and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged as much. I love the four different setting.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare and we bought this model, HX6921/02. It lasted about 3 years of daily use by two people before something happened to the mechanism and the 5 brushing options no longer lit up. Liked it enough to buy another one, same model. The two weeks of manual brushing before the new one arrived were not pleasant. I could feel the difference on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this toothbrush for my husband, but I couldn&#x27;t resist giving it a try and now I&#x27;m hooked! I have sensitive teeth, but I just use the sensitive setting and I have not had any issues. I cannot get over how much cleaner my teeth feel after brushing with the sonicare flexcare toothbrush versus the manual brushing I was doing before. I am a complete convert and I will not be looking back!</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought it to replace an older Sonicare model. It&#x27;s slimmer and lighter than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our dentist.  Good recommendation!  Excellent product and works fine!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> love it. Better than my previous oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Third Sonicare tooth brush I have purchased over the years and they seem to improve each time.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works very well. I don&#x27;t know that I (or anyone else) necessarily need all of the additional modes that it has (massage, gums, etc...). Just seems like a gadgety way to charge quite a lot more for an electric toothbrush. I would probably go with the next model or two down next time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this toothbrush initially because I was used to the Oral-B, which I loved.  But after a couple of weeks, I really started to appreciate the Sonicare.  I feel like my back teeth are cleaned better with this brush because of it&#x27;s design.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like the Oral-B cleans better because it rotates in a circular motion, but after examining my teeth, I think the Sonicare actually does a better job!</li>
            <li> Used as spare. Perfect brush everytime</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush to replace out old sonicare that we has for so long that it wouldn&#x27;t stay charged. We love the sonicare dental products. The only thing with this toothbrush is that you can accidentally change the setting you want to use while holding the brush during use.  It takes a little practice to learn not to press the buttons while brushing. Light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The Oral B electric toothbrush was my choice for many years, and it is very good.  I changed to the Sonicare brand based on the advice of my dentist, and now I can see why I was so advised.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare, in my opinion, cleans the teeth much better than any device I have ever used in the past.  The Sonicare also massages the gum line and really helps to reduce plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> Definitely met my expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Philip Sonicare for four years and it still works great!!! I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone who wants new clean teeth!</li>
            <li> My third sonic are since 1997&lt;br /&gt;More compact&lt;br /&gt;Than originals but not as durable (the second one lasted but 3 yrs)&lt;br /&gt;Too many models to count with some a bit gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;Still the best prophylaxis one can get in a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted, worked perfectly, and arrived ahead of the expected shipping schedule.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife and she loves it. She said it does everything it boost.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars. It worked great for about 8 months (2 users), but now does this weird thing where it barely vibrates if I push it against my teeth with much pressure at all. Very frustrating. Planning to contact support, so I may give a higher (or lower) rating afterward.</li>
            <li> Overpriced but it&#x27;s the best money can buy with tooth brushes. Don&#x27;t get the diamond, get this and buy the diamond brushes. The best clean teeth without the dentist.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended. Really gets in between the teeth and gums. It is a good price and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.  I have owned three different models of the Sonicare and they are all fantastic.  The HX6921 works just as well as any.  The different settings are helpful, but I primarily stick to the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting.  That gives you the 2 minute timer that pauses every 30 seconds to notify you that you should move on to the next quadrant.  The other setting I like to use is the &amp;#34;Refresh&amp;#34; setting, which I primarily use when I want to - as the setting suggests - refresh at some random time during the day.  This setting give you a 1 minute timer that pauses every 15 seconds.  It&#x27;s the same logic as the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, but you only move around much faster.  The battery life is pretty good - I can&#x27;t say for sure how long it takes for one charge - but it is a while before you have to re-charge.  This model comes with a hard travel case, which I like.  You can put two brush heads in the travel case in case something happens or if you and your partner want to only bring one unit and interchange the brush heads for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Purchased  this to replace my first that lasted almost 8 years. I love this model.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to replace one of the exact same model that died after 2 years of use. Would have got it replaced under warranty but I misplaced the original receipt. Otherwise, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact, I actually look forward to brushing now!</li>
            <li> It feels like 10,000 Riverdancers tapping away on my teeth except THIS time their shoes are made of Christmas morning and the original TGIF lineup.  I can only imagine that the feeling is akin to what you might feel like when ascending to the top of the Agro crag on the show GUTS.</li>
            <li> I used a cheaper brush for a year and when it broke I decided to splurge. What a difference! If I go the whole two minutes while paying attention my teeth feel like they do when I first get them cleaned by my hygienist. I used to have to go for a cleaning every four months, but now she recommends every six months.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.! Love the selections and options.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! My teeth and gums feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Ordered as a replacement for my last one that died after five years.</li>
            <li> Works great and I think a very good value for the money...would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Like a powerwasher for your mouth.</li>
            <li> Dentist-fresh clean every time. Need I say more</li>
            <li> Tooth brush is great.  the massage feature is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling. Am very pleased with this toothbrush. I recommend it to everyone. It beats a regular brush by a landslide!</li>
            <li> Works great. No issues at this time. It has only been a month of use so I will see how it goes as time goes by.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare Flexcare Plus. The first one lasted 4 years (used twice daily on the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting by one person) and something inside failed and the brushing action was intermittent. The battery was still fully functional but the mechanism gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Don&#x27;t keep the device charging all the time. Let the device run down until you get the &amp;#34;charge me&amp;#34; warning. I usually let the warning play out for about three times and then charge the device (if you let it go too long the unit will just shut off so you can&#x27;t hurt it by letting the battery run down). These batteries do not have an unlimited number of charge-discharge cycles and letting the battery run down before recharging may allow the battery to last longer (that has been my experience with most battery operated devices using the latest battery technology). Now on to reviewing the latest unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new device appears to work fine although it is noisier than my original unit. It sounds like something might be loose inside but it does not appear to affect the operation. The unit has a 2 year warranty and you can add another 6 months if you register your product.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned AND the subsequent hygienist&#x27;s positive comments regarding my oral heath improvement is so heart warming that this decision was the right one.</li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare and my husband and I both feel that ir has done wonders for the health of our teeth.  I usually can&#x27;t get 3 months out of one toothbrush, but I think the quality of the brushes and the holder are superior above other sonic-style brands.  Stick with the best.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth again!  Yay!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Best Toothbrush Ever Made!  Worth the $$!</li>
