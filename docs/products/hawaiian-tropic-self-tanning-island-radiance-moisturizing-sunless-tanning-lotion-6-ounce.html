            <li>This came within the time it was suppose to, and it works great!</li>
            <li>This is the best self tanning cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is the best one I have found on the market for sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>This is the best self tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This is by fare the best I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>One of the best sunless tanning lotions on the market today.  </li>
            <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used many...</li>
            <li>Good smell</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite self tanner ever!</li>
            <li>and I still LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice even color, and</li>
            <li>This is good - goes on smoothly &amp; smells nice.  </li>
            <li>but the medium is perfect for my light skin tone right now.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly, smells nice, and produces a noticeable, natural-looking tan after just 1-2 applications.</li>
            <li>Even tan and a nice color more brown than orange.</li>
            <li>I should have read te description better, but it seems deceptive to put it in that kind of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this does not and gives a perfect natural look.  </li>
            <li>And, huge bonus: it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li>but I love the gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but cannot find it in the Midwest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product here on Amazon, because it is my favorite sunless tanner.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice natural color and doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well and the scent is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Echoing the praises of many other reviewers, I have to say this is by far the best self-tanner that I have ever used</li>
            <li>Overall, really good self tanner and worth trying.</li>
            <li>This sunless tanner has a nice scent compared to most,  goes on easy,  doesn&#x27;t easily streak,  and the can last a really long time.</li>
            <li>the creme lotion is easy to spread and it&#x27;s very moisturizing, however, it remains \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; for a loooong time.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a nice self tanning lotion since the last one I used had hemp in it.</li>
            <li>After the second night I had a nice golden glow, and thankfully no streaks.  </li>
            <li>I applied right after shower freshed shaven.</li>
            <li>So my solution is to use Jergens Natural Glow Face on my face, chest, and shoulders, and use teh hawaiian tropic everywhere else; this has worked well for me and the two seem to blend just fine.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to get an even application with this creme lotion, and it has never discolored my clothes or furniture.  </li>
            <li>The smell is better than any other tanner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this product in the store, but suddenly it was no longer on the shelves.</li>
            <li>Takes considerably longer to dry than most sprays.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly, gives a golden tan, but best if all it doesn&#x27;t have that horrible self tanner smell.</li>
            <li>The resulting color is more natural than some other tanners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color was subtle the first night, but more than a gradual tanner.  </li>
            <li>It gave me very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I prefer it by far over sunless tanning spray, which takes too long to dry, streaks easily, and can stain clothes and furniture.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and amooth too.</li>
            <li>It is a good color and does not look like a fake tan at all.</li>
            <li>I usually get multiple compliments from friends after using it just once, which is pretty incredible considering that Jergens natural glow and many other similar products seem to take forever to make a difference, and the tan produced is often blotchy and fake</li>
            <li>only criticism is that it takes a little longer to dry than some foams (because the cr√®me is so thick)... but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty predictable that if I use the tanner all over, including my face, I will start to break out after a week or so.</li>

            <li> A ltittle goes a long way and it last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I usually go in cycles with this tanner, using it for a few months (summer and special events)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and will continue to as long as I can still find it.</li>
            <li> As long as it is rubbed in to the skin thoroughly, it does not streak at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend wearing latex gloves during application and then (after removing gloves) doing your hands last... and then wash your palms &amp; around fingernails thoroughly (with soap) when done (to avoid dark orange palms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells a little like the regular Hawaiian Tropic tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It had a litte odor but other than that</li>
            <li> Its pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair/pale, always burn never tan.</li>

            <li> I do prefer the medium to dark.  </li>
            <li> use the Medium for face &amp; hands, and Medium Dark for the rest of the body.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is it stays tacky for a while as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> and then off for a few weeks/months at a time, and</li>
            <li> Usually self tanners are quite smelly.</li>
            <li> and not overwhelmingly like, you know, sunless tanner.  </li>
            <li> It has a natural color to it, doesn&#x27;t streak too bad and doesn&#x27;t smell awful like other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the scent is one of the least offensive of any tanner I&#x27;ve used...not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell bad going on but the smell does stay with you longer than the gel smell did.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake.  Do not like it  at all.  Gave it away after using it once..  It was too waterey ..Bevsbigfolly@aol..com</li>
            <li> I like this but I love the gel.  I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t making it any longer.  This doesn&#x27;t smell bad going on but the smell does stay with you longer than the gel smell did.</li>
            <li> Hey I didn&#x27;t turn orange !!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Nice even color, and I never end up with the botching that often happens with self tanners as they wear off.</li>
            <li> Echoing the praises of many other reviewers, I have to say this is by far the best self-tanner that I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them). It goes on very smoothly and evenly, smells nice, and produces a noticeable, natural-looking tan after just 1-2 applications. I usually get multiple compliments from friends after using it just once, which is pretty incredible considering that Jergens natural glow and many other similar products seem to take forever to make a difference, and the tan produced is often blotchy and fake-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that, with continued use, this sunless tanner will cause the skin on my face, chest, and shoulders to break out. I usually go in cycles with this tanner, using it for a few months (summer and special events) and then off for a few weeks/months at a time, and it&#x27;s pretty predictable that if I use the tanner all over, including my face, I will start to break out after a week or so. So my solution is to use Jergens Natural Glow Face on my face, chest, and shoulders, and use teh hawaiian tropic everywhere else; this has worked well for me and the two seem to blend just fine.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It does not streak and it goes on evenly.  I do prefer the medium to dark.  But this product is great!</li>
            <li> The smell is better than any other tanner I&#x27;ve used.  There&#x27;s no bronzer so it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing &amp; you can go out in public after putting it on.  The resulting color is more natural than some other tanners I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Medium for face &amp; hands, and Medium Dark for the rest of the body.  I recommend wearing latex gloves during application and then (after removing gloves) doing your hands last... and then wash your palms &amp; around fingernails thoroughly (with soap) when done (to avoid dark orange palms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that it takes a little longer to dry than some foams (because the cr√®me is so thick)... but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but cannot find it in the Midwest.  I tell all my friends about it when they ask.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It is my favorite self tanner ever!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a nice self tanning lotion since the last one I used had hemp in it. This one works really well and the scent is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Usually self tanners are quite smelly. This one wasn&#x27;t! It had a litte odor but other than that It works very well. Smells a little like the regular Hawaiian Tropic tanning lotion. Even tan and a nice color more brown than orange. and it moisturizes too!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin a shade darker but doesn&#x27;t tan as dark as other products.  Keeps skin soft and amooth too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and will continue to as long as I can still find it.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used many...the creme lotion is easy to spread and it&#x27;s very moisturizing, however, it remains \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; for a loooong time.  This is not a big problem for me because I only ever use self tanner overnight, but if someone wanted to wear it during the day, it might be bothersome.  The color was subtle the first night, but more than a gradual tanner.  After the second night I had a nice golden glow, and thankfully no streaks.  I may try the medium-dark next time as we get closer to summer but the medium is perfect for my light skin tone right now.  Oh, and the scent is one of the least offensive of any tanner I&#x27;ve used...not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This came within the time it was suppose to, and it works great! It has a natural color to it, doesn&#x27;t streak too bad and doesn&#x27;t smell awful like other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Its pretty expensive but I think it will last a while!</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner has a nice scent compared to most,  goes on easy,  doesn&#x27;t easily streak,  and the can last a really long time. Only complaint is it stays tacky for a while as another reviewer mentioned. Overall, really good self tanner and worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanning cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is good - goes on smoothly &amp; smells nice.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency without being greasy! Never streaky or splotchy. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I still LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  Is not orangey and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> This product is the best one I have found on the market for sunless tanners.  A ltittle goes a long way and it last for weeks.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly, gives a golden tan, but best if all it doesn&#x27;t have that horrible self tanner smell.</li>

As long as it is rubbed in to the skin thoroughly, it does not streak at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great‚Äîlike an island vacation‚Äîand not overwhelmingly like, you know, sunless tanner.  It applies the smoothest of any sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, especially if you use an applicator mitt.  I prefer it by far over sunless tanning spray, which takes too long to dry, streaks easily, and can stain clothes and furniture. It is so much easier to get an even application with this creme lotion, and it has never discolored my clothes or furniture.  And, huge bonus: it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> It gave me very natural looking tan. I am extremely fair/pale, always burn never tan. This is the best self tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be a SPRAY. I should have read te description better, but it seems deceptive to put it in that kind of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream that needs to be rubbed in. Takes considerably longer to dry than most sprays.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is a good color and does not look like a fake tan at all.</li>
            <li> This is by fare the best I have ever tried!  Anything else leaves marks where you leave off and this does not and gives a perfect natural look.  Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best sunless tanning lotions on the market today.  Unfortunately, I was only able to use my last order twice as the pump stopped working!</li>
            <li> Good smell but I try this and nothing happen I didnt not even change a darker tint. I applied right after shower freshed shaven. Nothing I put on four layers. Maybe it just didnt like me.</li>
