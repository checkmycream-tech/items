            <li>This is the best make up I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful produt which my wife loves!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this is the best product for me.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and this color is perfect for wintertime when I have no tan.</li>
            <li>Nice!!</li>
            <li>Oh, and even though I am very fair, I can also wear W20.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage and great color.</li>
            <li>great colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 10 years ago I noticed a co-worker always had really great makeup that lasted</li>
            <li>This product is great for those who are gluten intolerant, but not for those allergic to corn.</li>
            <li>works great and</li>
            <li>It gives me great coverage without feeling like I am wearing anything on my face.</li>
            <li>Unfortuantely I didn&#x27;t work that great for me.</li>
            <li>great make up.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors of foundation and blushes and the mineral veil is the best!</li>
            <li>so Light (W15) works perfectly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>good coverage.</li>
            <li>then some one else said they are still good.</li>
            <li>You can go swimming and perspire and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, it still looks good.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the products and would recommend them to anyone who has seen BareMineral ads/</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>absolutely love the price!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years now and am uninterested in looking for another of its kind as I am that</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift and in her own words</li>
            <li>I am very light-skinned, and this shade was perfect on me.  </li>
            <li>, feels nice on the face.</li>
            <li>This has a warm tone to it without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>It was nice on my cheeks where I didn&#x27;t have acne.</li>
            <li>best benefit is that it&#x27;s natural and I am 48 and don&#x27;t do all the facials, etc.</li>
            <li>I used the fair light.</li>
            <li>I love this product, let me in the face all very beautiful and velvety, lasts me all day, I really fell in love and I will continue buying</li>
            <li>best thing about Bare Escentuals Foundations is that you can adjust the coverage however you want.  </li>
            <li>It is more velvety than sheercover</li>
            <li>It costs more, at time of purchase, but it lasts for months.  </li>
            <li>I love [</li>
            <li>I do use Lauren Hutton spot concealer but use mostly all BareMineral products.</li>
            <li>It is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this makeup it makes my skin feel silky smooth and covers all blemishes without caking!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Covers as well as a liquid and feels much better on my face.</li>
            <li>I used to use the pressed powders on top of my foundation and it would just look like I had a powder mask.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this many times.</li>
            <li>I can also sleep in this and it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of blemishes or anything like most makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation .</li>
            <li>Sometimes I combine it with a lighter tone MAC foundation, and add this one on top of it.</li>
            <li>This foundation did nothing to conceal my acne, in fact it made themlike a purpleish color which to me made them more noticable.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of makeup that makes you look better naturally, but is good to your skin as well.</li>
            <li>Very light with fantastic coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair with blonde hair</li>
            <li>I love BareMinerals because it feels so light but covers so well.</li>
            <li>A little darker, but still looks great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for summer with a little blush.  </li>
            <li>Cheap knock-off of BareMinerals</li>
            <li>I like it because it is light</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; with this foundation on, and it offers good coverage.</li>
            <li>I find it most useful when the package is full upon purchase.</li>
            <li>great price--a lot less than sephora  :)</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>As long as the product isn&#x27;t damaged in any way when I receive it I will be extremely happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I got excited that this product was at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li>This, however, is pure magic.  </li>
            <li>Per my Wife, She says this a good product and has used this brand for a long time, ( She orders this stuff on my account )</li>
            <li>This makeup was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what i wanted for a way cheaper price than in stores!</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals Original Foundation for many years.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals because it covers well and feels like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup at all, I like the clean feel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I like the more natural look, and this covers without being TOO &amp;#34;covery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This was my own personal chose to use the BareMinerals  </li>
            <li>And I love BareMinerals because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick and gives my face a very natural appearance.</li>
            <li>The price was better than through Bare Minerals and it was delivered so quickly.</li>
            <li>received it super fast and no problems!  </li>
            <li>All you need is to choose the right color for you.</li>
            <li>One day, shortly thereafter, a friend of mine told me my complexion looked beautiful and asked me what I was doing to get such a glow.  </li>
            <li>I love bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals for 5 years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it makes redness disappear after long term use.  </li>
            <li>It feels so light, so fresh, so natural!</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to use the cap from my empty container, but bizarre that it didn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li>full size original foundation- Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted-</li>
            <li>This is the first foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used that does not exacerbate the condition.</li>
            <li>since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>and I can get exactly what I want when I want.  </li>
            <li>This makeup is light, non greasy and can be touched up at the end of the day if I am going out and want a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li>make-up that covers/matches your skin tone on-line, but the reviews were positive on this, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals some days I would forget to wash before I went to bed because it is so comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or slimy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>This is so light and just brushing it on with the Bare Minerals brush and you are done.</li>
            <li>I have to say its so lightweight and natural feeling that I thought it was cheap and just not staying on or showing up, but as I looked in the mirror throughout the day I noticed a nice even tone to my skin, with no makeup lines around the edges of my face that I get because my skin&#x27;s hard to match.</li>
            <li>Also, it works as a concealer VERY well.  </li>
            <li>This pales in comparison to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like BareMineral&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>They are high quality (and with the price too match!</li>
            <li>At 50, my face is still very oily.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned in the winter but this foundation still allows a rosy glow.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use mascara that fast,</li>
            <li>I think your skin needs to be moderately blemish and inperfection free for this to work for you.</li>
            <li>I have used the Original Foundation for several years in conjunction with Mineral Veil and All Over Face Color (their version of blush).  </li>
            <li>But light and natural feeling, which is Bare Minerals&#x27; claim to fame anyway.</li>
            <li>I should have known this was fake as I take great care of my skin....</li>
            <li>and really look natural.</li>
            <li>They provide an even skin tone with just the right amount of color without the heaviness of regular foundation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals Original foundation for years as it&#x27;s the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>All the fashion magazines say ladies over a certain age shouldn&#x27;t use powdered makeup (highlights the wrinkles apparently!)</li>
            <li>I was very excited to start using this base on all the good things I have heard about it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for 10 years and this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to carry it with you and when you feel a little oily</li>
            <li>natural look and this product delivers.</li>
            <li>You can make it heavy, light, or in-between.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>The locking lid which keeps the extra makeup from coming out when not in use doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments that my complexion is so young looking.</li>
            <li>This product will complete your foundation collection of Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that keeps my face from becoming an oil slick.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals has changed my life!</li>
            <li>When I opened the package and saw the larger size, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals Face Color 2.8</li>
            <li>Apparently, I am gluten inotlerant and allergic to corn.</li>
            <li>This in no way resembles the Bare Minerals product I have bought for years from another store.</li>
            <li>I have used bare minerals for years</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals for years.</li>
            <li>I received this item faster than the expected delivery date in sealed packaging, and it appears to be the real product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for about 6 years</li>
            <li>Thanks, other reviewers.....</li>
            <li>It usually covers my scars very well with just a little bit and this one I had to use so much that I automatically knew it wasn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
            <li>I had some of my Bare Minerals foundation left over and figured I would test it against this product.</li>
            <li>I have used bare minerals for several years now.  </li>
            <li>Since discovering the world of Bare Minerals years ago, I would never go back to liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li>The color was not the same as the ones I purchased from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>When you purchase it and the container arrives empty, it is hard to enjoy this product.</li>

            <li> make-up that covers/matches your skin tone on-line, but the reviews were positive on this, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals some days I would forget to wash before I went to bed because it is so comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or slimy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This is so light and just brushing it on with the Bare Minerals brush and you are done.</li>
            <li> I have to say its so lightweight and natural feeling that I thought it was cheap and just not staying on or showing up, but as I looked in the mirror throughout the day I noticed a nice even tone to my skin, with no makeup lines around the edges of my face that I get because my skin&#x27;s hard to match.</li>
            <li> Also, it works as a concealer VERY well.  </li>
            <li> This pales in comparison to the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like BareMineral&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> They are high quality (and with the price too match!</li>
            <li> At 50, my face is still very oily.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned in the winter but this foundation still allows a rosy glow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use mascara that fast,</li>
            <li> I think your skin needs to be moderately blemish and inperfection free for this to work for you.</li>
            <li> I have used the Original Foundation for several years in conjunction with Mineral Veil and All Over Face Color (their version of blush).  </li>
            <li> But light and natural feeling, which is Bare Minerals&#x27; claim to fame anyway.</li>
            <li> I should have known this was fake as I take great care of my skin....</li>
            <li> and really look natural.</li>
            <li> They provide an even skin tone with just the right amount of color without the heaviness of regular foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals Original foundation for years as it&#x27;s the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> All the fashion magazines say ladies over a certain age shouldn&#x27;t use powdered makeup (highlights the wrinkles apparently!)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to start using this base on all the good things I have heard about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for 10 years and this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so easy to carry it with you and when you feel a little oily</li>
            <li> natural look and this product delivers.</li>
            <li> You can make it heavy, light, or in-between.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> The locking lid which keeps the extra makeup from coming out when not in use doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments that my complexion is so young looking.</li>
            <li> This product will complete your foundation collection of Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that keeps my face from becoming an oil slick.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals has changed my life!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and saw the larger size, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals Face Color 2.8</li>
            <li> Apparently, I am gluten inotlerant and allergic to corn.</li>
            <li> This in no way resembles the Bare Minerals product I have bought for years from another store.</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals for years</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for years.</li>
            <li> I received this item faster than the expected delivery date in sealed packaging, and it appears to be the real product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for about 6 years</li>
            <li> Thanks, other reviewers.....</li>
            <li> It usually covers my scars very well with just a little bit and this one I had to use so much that I automatically knew it wasn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
            <li> I had some of my Bare Minerals foundation left over and figured I would test it against this product.</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals for several years now.  </li>
            <li> Since discovering the world of Bare Minerals years ago, I would never go back to liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li> The color was not the same as the ones I purchased from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> When you purchase it and the container arrives empty, it is hard to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> and half the time even forget to properly wash my face in the morning and evening, but people are always complementing me for my skin and that I don&#x27;t look as old as I am.</li>
            <li> I agree that this is not actually Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> It offers little to any coverage.</li>
            <li> It smooths and covers minor flaws which is all I need.</li>
            <li> More affordable than buying in expensive department stores!</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they are not the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, tried other foundations but always come back to BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> I will not go back to the other kinds of make-up ever again.</li>
            <li> and I had problems since I have an oily t-zone with dry cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other less expensive products and am never as satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the makeup was old or something, but it did not provide the coverage that I usually get from BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> It conceals all day, so in the end, it costs less than drug store concealers that have to be constantly reapplied and don&#x27;t blend as well, OR conceal blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive, free shipping (on two of the products)</li>
            <li> A little darker than expected.. will try a shade lighter next time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wear it, just not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t especially like that particular version, which is too expensive to leave sitting in a drawer,</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way and you must be careful to not over powder your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with any other foundations anymore.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout (not as much as other makeup).</li>
            <li> but the color was not right.</li>
            <li> arounf my jaw line and dark scars from it.</li>
            <li> I use a little moisturizer and primer to ensure even coverage.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with it</li>
            <li> Wear this everyday.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin, the way liquid foundation does, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> always end up being shiny after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never easy finding</li>
            <li> So I am giving it a poor rating because I can&#x27;t do anything with a empty container.</li>
            <li> I will not buy again :/</li>
            <li> but lately after applying my makeup, it felt and looked like I had NONE on at all.  </li>
            <li> This foundation doesn&#x27;t get cakey and thick but it also stays on all day without an issue.</li>
            <li> , and it&#x27;ll help give you a glow to your tan so that you don&#x27;t look ridiculously</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to mess up.  </li>
            <li> some one told me that SPF has an date that they are not good she work at a store</li>
            <li> I beat my old lady for buying this crap.</li>
            <li> The color is wrong, the texture is different and above all, it has an awful smell!.</li>
            <li> This company is giving Amazon and Bare Minerals a bad name!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals foundation has no smell, This stuff actually makes me sick from the smell and looks terrible on.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> I have had an auto-reorder with BareMinerals since I started using these products, but because I&#x27;m unable to change the &amp;#34;package&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> And here I thought it was just me with bad skin!!!  </li>
            <li> you saved me some grief!</li>
            <li> No comparison, this one is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only foundation I will use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now and am uninterested in looking for another of its kind as I am that&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with it.  It covers up blemishes sufficiently without looking like one is trying to hide something.  I like a&lt;br /&gt;more natural look and this product delivers.</li>
            <li> I had read al the reviews on this one compared to the rest of the mineral foundations and decided to go with this one....I am glad I did! Great coverage and great color. It is more velvety than sheercover and I will get the larger size next time.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and saw the larger size, I was surprised. The price was better than through Bare Minerals and it was delivered so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals Original foundation for years as it&#x27;s the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause me to break out.  I am very fair with blonde hair so Light (W15) works perfectly on my skin.  I don&#x27;t bother with any other foundations anymore.</li>
            <li> I beat my old lady for buying this crap.Then had her commited.</li>
            <li> This makeup was exactly what I needed! Great price too! More affordable than buying in expensive department stores! Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> The VERY BEST affordable concealer in the world.  It costs more, at time of purchase, but it lasts for months.  It conceals all day, so in the end, it costs less than drug store concealers that have to be constantly reapplied and don&#x27;t blend as well, OR conceal blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift and in her own words she described it as , &amp;#34;freakin awesome!&amp;#34; - Enough Said!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted- full size original foundation- Bare Minerals! the best! absolutely love the price! will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Same as I buy at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Before this, I could not find my perfect foundation.  I tried everything from MAC to Estee Lauder to Chanel and nothing was doing it for me.  This, however, is pure magic.  I am very light-skinned, and this shade was perfect on me.  The blushes also help a lot if you get tanner after buying this.  I love [[ASIN:B000XZSKP4 Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals Face Color 2.8g - Glee]], and it&#x27;ll help give you a glow to your tan so that you don&#x27;t look ridiculously pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about Bare Escentuals Foundations is that you can adjust the coverage however you want.  You can make it heavy, light, or in-between.  It&#x27;s really difficult to mess up.  Also, it works as a concealer VERY well.  Oh, and even though I am very fair, I can also wear W20.  A little darker, but still looks great!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of makeup that makes you look better naturally, but is good to your skin as well. You can sleep in it. I have not had any trouble with it and I have used it for four years.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin. This is the first foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used that does not exacerbate the condition. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals. This is well worth the price! Honestly, it makes redness disappear after long term use.  I tell everyone</li>
            <li> Wear this everyday. My dermatologist actually told me to wear BareMinerals and I must say it&#x27;s clean, feels nice on the face. Not a heavy makeup. I do use Lauren Hutton spot concealer but use mostly all BareMineral products.</li>
            <li> The locking lid which keeps the extra makeup from coming out when not in use doesnt work very well. There is always makeup in there when I open it.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals because it covers well and feels like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup at all, I like the clean feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never easy finding make-up that covers/matches your skin tone on-line, but the reviews were positive on this, so I gave it a try.  It is just ok.  Covers well enough, but doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;polished&#x27;.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wear it, just not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two years ago.  One day, shortly thereafter, a friend of mine told me my complexion looked beautiful and asked me what I was doing to get such a glow.  Guess what???  It was this foundation that made the difference.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick and gives my face a very natural appearance. Love it !</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals Original Foundation for many years. It makes my skin tone look even and flawless. A little of this product goes a long way and you must be careful to not over powder your face. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin, the way liquid foundation does, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I will be using this product for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> This is not the same as you would buying from the store, maybe it was expired but had to toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it from the store.</li>
            <li> i have been using bareminerals for a couple of years now and am hooked.  this is the only product i&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or break my face out.  this stuff is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I did not read the reviews until after the item had shipped. BIG mistake! I agree that this is not actually Bare Minerals. I had some of my Bare Minerals foundation left over and figured I would test it against this product. This pales in comparison to the real thing. It offers little to any coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this makeup for years.....since it first came out.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they are not the same.  it&#x27;s worth the money to buy this product.  good coverage. does not block pores or create pimples.  great colors. best makeup i ever bought and will never use anything else. and i will recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock-off of BareMinerals</li>
            <li> And here I thought it was just me with bad skin!!!  I should have known this was fake as I take great care of my skin....but lately after applying my makeup, it felt and looked like I had NONE on at all.  Thanks, other reviewers..... you saved me some grief!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup it makes my skin feel silky smooth and covers all blemishes without caking! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Could not use it.  Even the lightest shade was too &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; for me. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it.  Sometimes it does not pay to listed to the adds.</li>
            <li> This is the best make up I have ever found.  I like the more natural look, and this covers without being TOO &amp;#34;covery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product will complete your foundation collection of Bare Minerals. I love it. All you need is to choose the right color for you. I wear this one in the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful produt which my wife loves!&lt;br /&gt;But I find it most useful when the package is full upon purchase. When you purchase it and the container arrives empty, it is hard to enjoy this product. So I am giving it a poor rating because I can&#x27;t do anything with a empty container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, tried other foundations but always come back to BareMinerals. Goes on even and stays put. Covers as well as a liquid and feels much better on my face. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Haven&#x27;t received the product yet, but I will not be buying from Ulta anymore. $25 to $30 a pop there depending on what product you buy. As long as the product isn&#x27;t damaged in any way when I receive it I will be extremely happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 10 years ago I noticed a co-worker always had really great makeup that lasted and I had problems since I have an oily t-zone with dry cheeks and I had gone through the mousse foundations, pressed powders, liquid foundations, etc. from the drug store and department stores. It just felt like I was wearing a really gross mask on my face and I could not wait to run to the bathroom sink and wash it off at the end of the day. The Bare Minerals some days I would forget to wash before I went to bed because it is so comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or slimy feeling at all. There are so many colors of foundation and blushes and the mineral veil is the best! I used to use the pressed powders on top of my foundation and it would just look like I had a powder mask. This is so light and just brushing it on with the Bare Minerals brush and you are done. No work trying to blend it into your foundation. And it&#x27;s so easy to carry it with you and when you feel a little oily just brush it on quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best benefit is that it&#x27;s natural and I am 48 and don&#x27;t do all the facials, etc. and half the time even forget to properly wash my face in the morning and evening, but people are always complementing me for my skin and that I don&#x27;t look as old as I am. That&#x27;s part genetics, but I also think it&#x27;s how you take care of yourself too. I will not go back to the other kinds of make-up ever again. I love this.</li>
            <li> The product was the same as I purchase from big retailers, but it came with no cap. Thankfully I was able to use the cap from my empty container, but bizarre that it didn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals for several years now.  It never disappoints! Very light with fantastic coverage.  I have combination skin and this helps even it out.</li>
            <li> I really like BareMineral&#x27;s products. They are high quality (and with the price too match! Egads!) and really look natural.</li>
            <li> I used this product because my skin would breakout with anything else. Apparently, I am gluten inotlerant and allergic to corn. This product is great for those who are gluten intolerant, but not for those allergic to corn. It made me breakout (not as much as other makeup).</li>
            <li> Per my Wife, She says this a good product and has used this brand for a long time, ( She orders this stuff on my account ), i know she likes this brand because she orders it for herself and our three Duaghters, shipping was on time and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Since discovering the world of Bare Minerals years ago, I would never go back to liquid makeup.  All the fashion magazines say ladies over a certain age shouldn&#x27;t use powdered makeup (highlights the wrinkles apparently!) but I have never had a problem.  This makeup is light, non greasy and can be touched up at the end of the day if I am going out and want a little more coverage.  This is definitely going to be a part of my beauty protocol forever.</li>
            <li> Fake. Didn&#x27;t work the same. Waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for 10 years and this is not the real product. It usually covers my scars very well with just a little bit and this one I had to use so much that I automatically knew it wasn&#x27;t the real product. I am disappointed. I will not buy again :/</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the others reviews before buying. This in no way resembles the Bare Minerals product I have bought for years from another store. The color is wrong, the texture is different and above all, it has an awful smell!. Bare Minerals foundation has no smell, This stuff actually makes me sick from the smell and looks terrible on. This company is giving Amazon and Bare Minerals a bad name! I thought the manufacturer had changed the formula so I bought the same one at a store in town. No comparison, this one is horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this powder for myself  but the color was not right. I used the fair light. some one told me that SPF has an date that they are not good she work at a store then some one else said they are still good. This was my own personal chose to use the BareMinerals  and I like then</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals for years and i LOVEEEEEEEE it!  works great and you can adjust how little/much you want to wear!  received it super fast and no problems!  will definitely order again when im running low! great price--a lot less than sephora  :)</li>
            <li> A little darker than expected.. will try a shade lighter next time.</li>
            <li> I love this product, let me in the face all very beautiful and velvety, lasts me all day, I really fell in love and I will continue buying</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for years. I&#x27;ve used other less expensive products and am never as satisfied with them. I received this item faster than the expected delivery date in sealed packaging, and it appears to be the real product. I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is 24 and lives out of the states. She requested it and the price was cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. I like it because it is light and I cannot feel it on my face. It smooths and covers minor flaws which is all I need. I have ordered this many times.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what i wanted for a way cheaper price than in stores! I would defiantly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> At 50, my face is still very oily.  I have tried just about everything and my face always end up being shiny after a few hours.  This is the only product I have found that keeps my face from becoming an oil slick.</li>
            <li> This has a warm tone to it without being overbearing.  Perfect for summer with a little blush.  During the winter I mix it with a lighter shade to avoid looking washed out</li>
            <li> I love BareMinerals because it feels so light but covers so well. I have very fair skin and this color is perfect for wintertime when I have no tan. It helps me cover up freckles and possible rosacea on my lower left cheek. This foundation doesn&#x27;t get cakey and thick but it also stays on all day without an issue. I like that it doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out either. I am very fair-skinned in the winter but this foundation still allows a rosy glow. And I love BareMinerals because I have sensitive skin and it never irritates me. I can also sleep in this and it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of blemishes or anything like most makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for 5 years now and absolutely love it. I have oily/acne prone skin so this is the best product for me. I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; with this foundation on, and it offers good coverage.</li>
            <li> The color was not the same as the ones I purchased from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I got this after having used up my Minerologie foundation. I have to say its so lightweight and natural feeling that I thought it was cheap and just not staying on or showing up, but as I looked in the mirror throughout the day I noticed a nice even tone to my skin, with no makeup lines around the edges of my face that I get because my skin&#x27;s hard to match. And when I washed my face at night, it was obvious it had stayed on all day. Nice!! Not the solid coverage of Minerologie that people like me with acne problems need, some spots were softened but still visible. But light and natural feeling, which is Bare Minerals&#x27; claim to fame anyway. I use a little moisturizer and primer to ensure even coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation . It gives me great coverage without feeling like I am wearing anything on my face. I get lots of compliments that my complexion is so young looking. You can go swimming and perspire and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, it still looks good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for about 6 years and I absolutely love it! Sometimes I combine it with a lighter tone MAC foundation, and add this one on top of it. Bare Minerals has changed my life! It feels so light, so fresh, so natural! I will definitely buy it from Amazon again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying BareMinerals for 4 years now and I got excited that this product was at a discounted price. I don&#x27;t know if the makeup was old or something, but it did not provide the coverage that I usually get from BareMinerals. I don&#x27;t understand why the consistency was so different but I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Original Foundation for several years in conjunction with Mineral Veil and All Over Face Color (their version of blush).  They provide an even skin tone with just the right amount of color without the heaviness of regular foundation.  These products don&#x27;t streak or wear off during the day.  I have had an auto-reorder with BareMinerals since I started using these products, but because I&#x27;m unable to change the &amp;#34;package&amp;#34; I signed up with, I receive mascara every four months with the foundation and mineral veil.  I can&#x27;t use mascara that fast, don&#x27;t especially like that particular version, which is too expensive to leave sitting in a drawer, plus the blush isn&#x27;t part of the package and must be purchased separately.  I&#x27;m ending the auto-delivery and purchasing from Amazon now.  It&#x27;s less expensive, free shipping (on two of the products) and I can get exactly what I want when I want.  I am very satisfied with the products and would recommend them to anyone who has seen BareMineral ads/QVC presentations/info-mercials and is on the fence about the quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to start using this base on all the good things I have heard about it. Unfortuantely I didn&#x27;t work that great for me. I have cystic acne arounf my jaw line and dark scars from it. This foundation did nothing to conceal my acne, in fact it made themlike a purpleish color which to me made them more noticable. I even tried using this with my regular concealor and a bareminerals concealor and again they were still purple. It was nice on my cheeks where I didn&#x27;t have acne. I think your skin needs to be moderately blemish and inperfection free for this to work for you.</li>
            <li> great make up. only downside is this shade had a yellowish tint i haven&#x27;t had before from this product</li>
