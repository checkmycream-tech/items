            <li>goood qulity loved it</li>

            <li>i got a annie dying kit.....but three stars because it still worked good :) but plz dont mix up orders -_-</li>
            <li>The applicator tool is better than any I have ever had in any boxed hair color kit, and I will be using it again and again.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not all of that its just ok.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased all in all with the kit.</li>
            <li>Not the best value, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I still buy one every time I buy my dye :)</li>
            <li>Okay so i did get the hair dye kit but its not the manic panic brand.</li>
            <li>Or even ones online that are probably a much better quality than this.</li>
            <li>When i bought these they were $8.50 and the reviews were pretty good.</li>
            <li>The shower cap is cheap, though, so I&#x27;d suggest getting a backup one just in case.</li>
            <li>You can buy cheap gloves and hair caps at any convenience store.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a better quality kit that includes more, you will have to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li>Brush, cap and gloves are of good quality, the gloves did not rip when I put them on, nor did the brush bristles come loose.</li>
            <li>This is better than anything the competition offers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth it.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a pretty good little kit.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for with this kit, a brush to put on color, some gloves and a cap.</li>
            <li>brush worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t worth the $7 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Had everything I needed in it, I would for sure buy another one for the next time I bleach my hair.</li>
            <li>This works great, Im very satisfide with it, My hair turned out a bit brighter too when I used the yellow cap, The gloves didn&#x27;t break like the ordanary gloves you buy in a big box like a certain other kind....</li>
            <li>Gloves were great but the brush is really cheap and useless.</li>
            <li>shower cap worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to have this when dying your hair.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t even really use it then.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap as far as Manic Panic products go, gives you everything you need to dye your hair short of something to pour it into.</li>
            <li>I did not have that particular problem, my gloves did the the job</li>
            <li>The shower cap is clear and thin, but easy if you want to use it to pull hair through to do highlights, although it is more of a one time use item.  </li>
            <li>used to use regular latex gloves when I dyed my hair, but the dye always managed to get through the gloves to my hands, which pretty much defeated the purpose of wearing them.</li>
            <li>At least be honest about what you&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li>These gloves were nice and thick, and nothing got through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the brush and the other contacts saved me from looking like I killed someone.</li>
            <li>I used it to completely cover my hair with dye, then just rubbed some in with my (gloved) hands to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It looks like they&#x27;ve dropped down to $5 so it might be less of a gamble, however when i recieved these the gloves were cheaply made and ripped after the first couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>The cap was okay but was really loose fitting on my head which is inconvenient when you&#x27;re trying to keep from dying your skin purple</li>
            <li>There are other kits out there which are a far better value, but this is the only kit I&#x27;ve found that has all of the bare essentials (all the others were missing either a shower cap or gloves, and I need both).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but i cant reuse it with dye all over it and its kind of expensive for a kit I cant reuse.</li>
            <li>glove were ok, did not use the other tools, but the main reason I got this was for the cap, and it was useless.  </li>

            <li> After using standard coloring gloves, and finding my hands covered in purple hair dye for the next week, I decided to give these a try.  The gloves are really thick and can be used over and over.  The shower cap is clear and thin, but easy if you want to use it to pull hair through to do highlights, although it is more of a one time use item.  The applicator tool is better than any I have ever had in any boxed hair color kit, and I will be using it again and again.  This is a small investment that makes a big difference in the ease of coloring your hair well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not all of that its just ok. you can not reuse the gloves or the cap for your head.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for with this kit, a brush to put on color, some gloves and a cap. Other reviewers complained that the gloves were weak and broke easily. I did not have that particular problem, my gloves did the the job and I was pleased all in all with the kit. If you are looking for a better quality kit that includes more, you will have to spend a little more money.</li>

These gloves were nice and thick, and nothing got through.&lt;br /&gt;The shower cap worked very well. It was a good size, and the elastic was tight enough to stay on (without being so tight that it was uncomfortable). I didn&#x27;t trust it to stay in place while I was sleeping though, so I put a stocking cap on over it. I looked like an idiot, but it worked. XD&lt;br /&gt;The brush worked pretty well. I used it to completely cover my hair with dye, then just rubbed some in with my (gloved) hands to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a pretty good little kit. Not the best value, but it works well enough.</li>

            <li> i got a annie dying kit.....but three stars because it still worked good :) but plz dont mix up orders -_-</li>
            <li> I received a dollar knock off dye kit, not the manic panic kit. Very disappointed. I thought it was a good idea for an add on item, but now I am just disappointed. I can literally run over to my local dollar store and buy the one I got for $1.00.</li>
            <li> The dye tool kit is the perfect companion to the Manic Panic dye.  It has everything you need and is not overly pricey.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as expected...the only problem is that their was a piece of chewed gum stuck on one item DISGUSTING!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush, cap and gloves are of good quality, the gloves did not rip when I put them on, nor did the brush bristles come loose.</li>
            <li> this kit is great but i cant reuse it with dye all over it and its kind of expensive for a kit I cant reuse. Oh well, I still buy one every time I buy my dye :)</li>

            <li> Helped me get the job done perfectly! The shower cap is cheap, though, so I&#x27;d suggest getting a backup one just in case. Mine ripped.</li>
            <li> This is better than anything the competition offers.</li>
            <li> Had everything I needed in it, I would for sure buy another one for the next time I bleach my hair.</li>
            <li> i still use the brush but after 3 uses on the shower cap it fell apart and the gloves ripped as soon as i put them on.</li>
            <li> Ordered this along with Manic Panic vampire red dye, except I wasn&#x27;t sent Manic Panic Hair dye tool kit.&lt;br /&gt;Instead I got Annie Coloring Kit. At least be honest about what you&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li> goood qulity loved it</li>
            <li> Okay so i did get the hair dye kit but its not the manic panic brand. I was expecting the manic panic brand. Not annie. Or whatever brand you sent me instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because it was cheaper to buy this and then just the dye rather than their &amp;#34;dying kit&amp;#34;. Go figure. lol. It came with everything in the description and the items were good quality.</li>
            <li> When i bought these they were $8.50 and the reviews were pretty good. It looks like they&#x27;ve dropped down to $5 so it might be less of a gamble, however when i recieved these the gloves were cheaply made and ripped after the first couple of minutes. The cap was okay but was really loose fitting on my head which is inconvenient when you&#x27;re trying to keep from dying your skin purple and it&#x27;s still sinking onto the back of your neck. I still have the brush, it&#x27;s alright but i don&#x27;t use it now and i didn&#x27;t even really use it then. It&#x27;s a bit awkward because it&#x27;s got the comb on the other side. However, i did use the end of it to part my hair during dying it. So it seems i paid $8.50 plus shipping to part my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it. You can buy cheap gloves and hair caps at any convenience store. Or even ones online that are probably a much better quality than this.</li>
            <li> glove were ok, did not use the other tools, but the main reason I got this was for the cap, and it was useless.  The elastic was broken.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap as far as Manic Panic products go, gives you everything you need to dye your hair short of something to pour it into. I washed off the gloves and cap after I was done and saved it to use again because there&#x27;s no point paying an extra four dollars every time you want to re-color your hair. Would recommend this alongside whatever dye you use.</li>
