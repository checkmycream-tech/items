    <ol>
            <li>This was a great product and the price is great!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I know the purpose of this stuff but after ordering and receiving then reading the label im like WOAH this stuff surely is unsafe!!  </li>
            <li>Does the job wonderfully, cost effective, perfect to secure custom lace wigs</li>
            <li>, I did not use it, I safely disposed of it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the sealant, but I do not like the smell.</li>
            <li>Quick service!  </li>
            <li>Both are full lace wigs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the description says!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>used the product on my first system in hopes of stopping the shedding that was occurring.  </li>
            <li>There was no shedding at all after the first application, but I didn&#x27;t expect the unit to shed at the first styling.  </li>
            <li>I invest a pretty penny in my wigs</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>so you must use in a VERY well ventilated area, and you cannot let the spray get on the hair itself so you must develop a method of spraying to coat but not oversaturate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, Package was not in orginal bottle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works very well as intended.</li>
            <li>It really sealed the knots to keep the hair from shedding.  </li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing but give me a headache</li>
            <li>4oz is more than enough and will last you a long time!</li>
            <li>used on my second system from the very beginning.  </li>
            <li>Does not take much so this will last for awhile.</li>
            <li>Used this product for nearly two years and it does work.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the product has done well so far.</li>
            <li>it does stop shedding,so to be fair this product does do its job, but if you use it i would suggest allowing the unit to air dry until the odor goes away, which takes a really long time,it is almost unbearable, kinda smells like really strong paint thinner :(</li>
            <li>Will use in the near future.</li>

            <li> this stuff stinks,FOR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> i used this on my lace closure and my shedding was very minimal and this last forever</li>
            <li> The package was open and item missing; nothing but the receipt was in the envelope.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I even used it on my other wigs and ponytails.</li>
            <li> That was disappointing due to the fact that I needed the item right away.</li>
            <li> Did well less shedding of lace wig</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with the previous unit, this product does little to nothing to stop the hair from releasing from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if acetone is all that&#x27;s need to seal the knots</li>
            <li> I do not want dangerous chemicals in my hair or near it at all.</li>
            <li> , this product will cause some stiffness/shrinkage with your cap (which loosens over time), the smell is TERRIBLE and nearly toxic</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> AND THE FUMES ARE TERRIBLE.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is nothing but Acetone, nail polish remover. Place a dab of it on a cotton ball and it will remove your nail polish. I&#x27;m not sure if acetone is all that&#x27;s need to seal the knots but this is nothing but acetone, nail polish remover...</li>
            <li> I still get a lot of shedding. I guess I was expecting a miracle in a bottle... I don&#x27;t wear a lot of wigs so I don&#x27;t know what to compare this to.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on 2 different hair systems.  Both are full lace wigs.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product on my first system in hopes of stopping the shedding that was occurring.  I did not use on it from the beginning because I did not want to weaken the knots.  This product did not stop the shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on my second system from the very beginning.  There was no shedding at all after the first application, but I didn&#x27;t expect the unit to shed at the first styling.  At the second application (worn for 2 weeks and then washed) there was a lot of shedding.  Based on my experience with the previous unit, this product does little to nothing to stop the hair from releasing from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the above, this product will cause some stiffness/shrinkage with your cap (which loosens over time), the smell is TERRIBLE and nearly toxic so you must use in a VERY well ventilated area, and you cannot let the spray get on the hair itself so you must develop a method of spraying to coat but not oversaturate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
            <li> Even though it says knot sealer. I didn&#x27;t notice a change once I used the product on my lace wig. The hair still seemed to shed.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the description says! 4oz is more than enough and will last you a long time! I promise</li>
            <li> Seals the knots but the smell is unbearable!  Took about a week after wearing the unit for the smell to fade.</li>
            <li> Quick service!  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Does the job wonderfully, cost effective, perfect to secure custom lace wigs</li>
            <li> Worked well. Did what it was supposed to do. Got to be carful when using it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Package was not in orginal bottle. There was a paper label glued on bottle.</li>
            <li> this stuff stinks,FOR A LONG TIME AND THE FUMES ARE TERRIBLE. it does stop shedding,so to be fair this product does do its job, but if you use it i would suggest allowing the unit to air dry until the odor goes away, which takes a really long time,it is almost unbearable, kinda smells like really strong paint thinner :(</li>
            <li> I received my package; however there was nothing in it.  The package was open and item missing; nothing but the receipt was in the envelope. That was disappointing due to the fact that I needed the item right away.</li>
            <li> I know the purpose of this stuff but after ordering and receiving then reading the label im like WOAH this stuff surely is unsafe!!  Needless to say, I did not use it, I safely disposed of it. I do not want dangerous chemicals in my hair or near it at all.</li>
            <li> this did not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I invest a pretty penny in my wigs so I was advised to use this product and its working well on my wigs!!! thumbs up</li>
            <li> Yes and it works just as it stated it would</li>
            <li> This produce works, remember to use from the beginning when you buy your wigs and everytime you wash. It helps with not only the knots on the wig but the lace. Does not take much so this will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says it will do. Sealed the knots with no shedding! Fast shipping. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Used this product for nearly two years and it does work. Worth the purchase. Will use in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Did what I needed it to do and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the sealant, but I do not like the smell. In addition, it irritates my skin from time to time. Besides that, the product has done well so far.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and the price is great! i used this on my lace closure and my shedding was very minimal and this last forever I&#x27;ve had this for almost 5 months now!</li>
            <li> Works very well as intended.</li>
            <li> Did well less shedding of lace wig</li>
            <li> I used TDI Hair Knot Sealer everytime I washed my lace wigs.  It really sealed the knots to keep the hair from shedding.  I even used it on my other wigs and ponytails.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing but give me a headache</li>
