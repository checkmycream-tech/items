            <li> and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere on Long Island.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small old fashion tin of bliss to my chapped hands and in Chicago, it doesn&#x27;t take much to dry out your hands especially during our winter.  </li>
            <li> for my dry hands.</li>

            <li> A little bit of a markup!  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I am truly hopeful that this company will re-make this product without the parabens or other dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the fact that the container said the cost was $4.50, but I paid $5.95.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this cream!</li>
            <li> Very faint chamomile scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Will heal worst hands fast...period.</li>

            <li> I love this product. The best hand cream on the market.  The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the fact that the container said the cost was $4.50, but I paid $5.95.  A little bit of a markup!  I ordered six, so I would not run out this winter.</li>
            <li> Will heal worst hands fast...period. Leave other oily products alone and buy this one. Price high but WORTH it after trying at least 15 other products most of which made my hands worse.</li>

            <li> This is such a great moisturizer, but everyone now knows the dangers of parabens, and this product is full of them.  Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I had an opportunity to see the ingredients ahead of time.  I am truly hopeful that this company will re-make this product without the parabens or other dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere on Long Island.  I will definitely buy this again.  It arrived perfectly and intact.</li>
            <li> this heavy duty non greasy cream really makes chapped and split knuckles and nails feel and look better.  much better than bag balm, burts bees, and really expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream ever!</li>
            <li> The most excellent hand cream I have ever used. I have been using it for 3 years. It always helps to keep moisture and soft.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! Sweet smelling but not at all over-powering. And so smoothing! Best of all, I don&#x27;t need to keep reapplying all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream on the market.  It&#x27;s soothing and really penetrates deeply.  A little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Best. Hand cream. Ever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t rave about it enough. My Oma used to give it to me when I was younger and it&#x27;s only the olde. I get that I appreciate and love it more and more! It&#x27;s non greasy and silky smooth. You&#x27;ll notice a difference in your skin immediately. I used it the most when I was living in the Rockies when my hands would chap to bad they&#x27;d bleed and this cream made sure that never happened again. I now but it and give it as gifts. You cannot go wrong with this cream!</li>
            <li> I grew up with this product. It is wonderfully soothing on the eczema spots on my hands. It really calms the flareups.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works wonders.  Will definitely order more in the future. Not only works on your hands but I also use it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream. It works so well on my hands. I clean houses and my hands get real dry. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Hard to find. Thus I purchased 3 tins. I did NOT like&lt;br /&gt;getting clipped for 3 S&amp;H charges. Would not have bothered me had they been shipped&lt;br /&gt;separately but instead they were packaged in one box and then sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that is the American dream. I will purchase this product again as I find most&lt;br /&gt;effective for my dry hands. I wil NOT purchase this product from the vendor again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can take that to the bank!</li>
            <li> The best remedy for dry skin!  I just wish they made an unscented version.</li>
            <li> Best cream I have ever used on my hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s a small old fashion tin of bliss to my chapped hands and in Chicago, it doesn&#x27;t take much to dry out your hands especially during our winter.  You&#x27;ll like this product.  The tin is small, but you&#x27;ll have enough to share with other hands that take care of you!  Sugar Bear approved, too!  She loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> This smells good and keeps my hands from becoming dry. I think it&#x27;s quite useful</li>
