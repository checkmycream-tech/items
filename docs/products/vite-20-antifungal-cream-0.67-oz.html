            <li>Have been selling this to my clients for years and everyone has had good results.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked</li>
            <li>it smelled great (these kinds of products rarely do)</li>
            <li>It worked way better than over the counter Lamasil that the doctor recommended.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>The amazon price is better than I could find anyplace else.    </li>
            <li>Just use it a couple times on your nails (on top, at cuticle and under toe nail.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Three times a day is better.  </li>
            <li>and it was confirmed.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to get a much cheaper price on Amazon compared with the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>No not everything works for everyone but this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice applicator tip to get in all the little crevices easily.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star, as it really helps quickly, (stops nail lifting if used consistently)</li>

            <li>It was used by a boyfriend of mine and I am a nurse and know that antifungals are very time consuming and rarely work.  </li>
            <li>Use this first for 6 months and if you don&#x27;t see any differance then see your doctor for the pill.  </li>
            <li>and I love the pink, fresh looking nail that is growing out to replace the yellowing and crumbling affected nail.  </li>
            <li>The Vite 20 Antifungal Cream really works.  </li>
            <li>This product might work for some but doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>As it was not for me I really have nothing to say.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 3  of them,  and found after reading the ingredients that they are completely different than what I had originally purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it here at Amazon because it&#x27;s a little cheaper....</li>
            <li>My toe nails look normal now.</li>
            <li>however it wasn&#x27;t an ultimate success.</li>
            <li>but was told about this from a new nail tech.</li>
            <li>never did clear up all the fungus.  </li>
            <li>but I was still getting frequent nail lifting, so</li>
            <li>but I believe without the oral meds, it would not have gone away completely just kept it at bay.</li>
            <li>I was given this product by a nail professional at a salon.</li>
            <li>It just depends on how far the fungal infection has gone.  </li>
            <li>The ones from Amazon are missing the key ingredients which fight fungus medically such as your Urea, clotrimazole, etc,so therefore I am thinking that they are copycats made by someone-and not the genuine product</li>
            <li>Be careful in hot weather especially wearing tennis shoes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I knew I was having nail problems but didn&#x27;t know that the cause was a fungus.  The technician who did my pedicure told me it was a fungus and sold me this product from the salon.  I liked the way it worked but it was too expensive to keep buying it from the salon so I started buying it through Amazon at roughly half the salon price.  I have been using it faithfully and I love the pink, fresh looking nail that is growing out to replace the yellowing and crumbling affected nail.  I wish it smelled better, but I have noticed all antifungals smell bad.  This one has a nice applicator tip to get in all the little crevices easily.</li>
            <li> I got this product from a friend who bought it at her nail salon.  I was suspicious that I had nail fungus, but it did not present in obvious ways, so went to the doctor and it was confirmed.  He put me on oral medication but I was still getting frequent nail lifting, so I began using the cream topically in addition to the oral meds.  It worked way better than over the counter Lamasil that the doctor recommended.  I was glad to get a much cheaper price on Amazon compared with the nail salon.  Now that I have finally begun to improve being on the meds for 4 months, I will continue to use this cream to prevent another occurrence. I gave it a 4 star, as it really helps quickly, (stops nail lifting if used consistently) but I believe without the oral meds, it would not have gone away completely just kept it at bay.</li>
            <li> I was told that the toenail problem I had could only be cured with a pill that was very dangerous for my liver as well as being expensive. I used this product 1-2 times a day for several months and it cleared up my toenail. It may not remove the problem permanently, but it does improve the appearance. My toe nails look normal now. I continue to use it infrequently to prevent it from returning.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3  of them,  and found after reading the ingredients that they are completely different than what I had originally purchased elsewhere.The ones from Amazon are missing the key ingredients which fight fungus medically such as your Urea, clotrimazole, etc,so therefore I am thinking that they are copycats made by someone-and not the genuine product</li>
            <li> I tried several things, including lamisil cream which worked ok but was told about this from a new nail tech. It works. It takes a while for the nail to grow out but it does work. The amazon price is better than I could find anyplace else.    A tip. Be careful in hot weather especially wearing tennis shoes. My toe fungus is called the Florida curse.</li>
            <li> after almost 4 months of continuous use (2x per day) this did not conquer my husband&#x27;s nail fungus. it smelled great (these kinds of products rarely do) however it wasn&#x27;t an ultimate success. he did notice for the first few months that it didn&#x27;t spread excessively, so perhaps it kept it at bay , but never killed it.</li>
            <li> I was told by mom, how was told by some lady that have fungs problems to use this.. She told me hers was bad. I must confess my IT&#x27;S BAD, well it was after using it, now I have seen results, but I been using it on and off due to using falsies at times... I have to cut my nails all the way down... and start using this. Still want something that can get rid of this problem for good.</li>
            <li> The Vite 20 Antifungal Cream really works.  I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to put on everyday, only until you clear up.</li>
            <li> I learned about Vite 20 from my doctor.  He had another patient who had tried it for a toenail fungus infection and he was impressed by the results.  I had tried several other remedies and nothing seemed to improve the condition of my toenails at all.  Vite 20 had them looking healthier within a week, and Amazon was the only place I found it for sale.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this last time I got a pedicure and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  I&#x27;ve taken Lamisil (perscription for fungus) for two years and you aren&#x27;t supposed to take it long because it&#x27;s hard on your liver or something....never did clear up all the fungus.  The gal who gave me a pedicure suggested this and I&#x27;ve used one bottle (.67 fluid ounces) and the fungus is gone.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon because it&#x27;s a little cheaper....and I want to continue using it so the fungus doesn&#x27;t come back!  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Mom bought this for me just in case I needed it one day. I did and this is the replacement. Just use it a couple times on your nails (on top, at cuticle and under toe nail. Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> My toenail and fingernail were in the process of falling off..Both would ache and were discusting to look at. This product worked immediately.  I run on a regular basis and I use if whenever fungus flairs up.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Within a couple of weeks it has already cleared up if you apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> The cream seemed to dry out the toenails and then they would break off. This product might work for some but doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Would I buy again, Yes.  Would it be my first choice, No.  I&#x27;ve used it on a couple problem areas that were small and it did the trick.  If you have a bigger problem area.  I would recommend see a doctor.</li>
            <li> For unknown reasons, I began developing a fungus probem with my toe nails. When having a pedicure, this product was recommended and it worked wonders. At the salon it was almost double the price I found on line at Amazon so have bought it through Amazon and continue using it for over a  year....Problem solved! Lesson learned; always check Amazon before buy OTC.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail fungus product in the market.  Weâ€™ve used other similar over the counter medicines and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Just received today. This is a good product for people that have suffer with finger nail issues, I am watching it work on a friend. No not everything works for everyone but this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> As it was not for me I really have nothing to say.  My friend says that this cream is the best there is.  I gave four stars only becuase I have to rely on other opinion.</li>
            <li> I dose what  it said it would .....great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; WHICH OTHER PRODUCTS DIDN&#x27;T  DO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AL ANDREOZZI OF  PALM HARBOR FLA. WHERE YOUR FEET AND HAND ARE ALLWAY WET...</li>
            <li> I was given this product by a nail professional at a salon. It was used by a boyfriend of mine and I am a nurse and know that antifungals are very time consuming and rarely work.  But this one did.  And now that the nail salon has closed, and I have another friend who has a fungal problem, I could not find the vite&#x27; 20  except on amazon.  I am so thrilled.!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it&#x27;s great!.  It&#x27;s a product that works just as well some of the prescription medicines.</li>
            <li> This  cream works!  All you gotta do is use it daily.  Three times a day is better.  One tiny drop and massage it and before you know it, it&#x27;s gone.  It just depends on how far the fungal infection has gone.  Use this first for 6 months and if you don&#x27;t see any differance then see your doctor for the pill.  Have been selling this to my clients for years and everyone has had good results.</li>
