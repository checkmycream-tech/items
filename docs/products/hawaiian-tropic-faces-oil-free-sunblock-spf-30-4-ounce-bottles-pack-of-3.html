            <li>Feels very good on your face or skin.&lt;br /&gt;100% Oil FREE!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes</li>
            <li>I think this is very good stuff, though.  </li>
            <li>I use Retin-A, so I need a really good moisturizer in the a.m. along with a sun-protection during the day, this works like a charm!  </li>

            <li>Glides on real smooth.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found a great deal here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As many others have mentioned, I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it in any store (although almost all of them did carry the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; variety!).</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on amazon as I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for over a year.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is everything that was promised and more: an oil-free, lightweight, non-greasy SPF 30 sunscreen.</li>
            <li>There have been many \\&quot;controversial\\&quot; statements made about the amalgamation of the ingredients in sunscreen/block, but I would still rather wear something than nothing.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I import to Brazil and my relatives love it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this sunblock!  </li>
            <li>I hope this will be available forever!</li>
            <li>I thought I was safe when using this sunblock</li>
            <li>Love the product and the service.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>It wears well under make-up and doesn&#x27;t ball-up when you apply things on top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it and will be using on my face for beach days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect for everyday use; I would advise something a bit more water/sweat resistant for the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People, especially young children, elderly, &amp; those with fair complexions with light hair need to be vigilant when it comes to sun protection.</li>
            <li>Just wish it would be a a higher in SPF as I&#x27;m super fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important along with knowing the difference between UVA &amp; UVB rays.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does everything it claims -- it&#x27;s light, absorbs fully into the skin , and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>The pudding type texture is smooth and does feel hydrating.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, rubs in quickly, and leaves me with a hydrated but matte like finish that I can wear under or over make up or alone.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; sunscreens out there in terms of sheerness and matte-ness.  </li>
            <li>Its not greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and as pictured.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and can be worn under make up.</li>
            <li>Also have super sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s unusual to find anything that won&#x27;t give me problems skin wise, and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing - the first time I put it on my face, I was just astounded - soft skin, no greasy feel, no weird chemical smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything it says it is: fragrance free, fast absorbing, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product over past six years and the only thing I can say: It is the best.   </li>
            <li>I tried it the first day</li>
            <li>Since it was the first</li>
            <li>This is an excellent sunblock, oil- free, comes in a convenient pump bottle with a small round mirror on it (smart!)</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and just love it!</li>
            <li>the little mirror on the bottle is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>This one worked out very well.</li>
            <li>I really do want to like this sunblock because it&#x27;s non-greasy</li>
            <li>The liquids really feel like nothing on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, smells nice (not strong)</li>
            <li>I am amazed that you can provide such good service at such low prices.</li>
            <li>I used it on my kids and even after swimming, eating, crying :) it seemed to still do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily (and we live in sunny country)</li>
            <li>Most other facial sunblocks I have purchased will cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen works great, but not happy at all with all 3 bottles only half full.</li>
            <li>Mild scent (not really any scent) and feels almost like lotion.</li>
            <li>I still only have positive things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>only recommendation to Hawaiian Tropic would be a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; smell - a little more coconut or something like that.</li>
            <li>Its made sensitive for faces but I use it to protect all exposed skin.</li>
            <li>Even the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li>Many of us don&#x27;t concern ourselves with the everyday sun exposure we encounter back &amp; forth to work or when we run errands.</li>
            <li>I know that sunscreen is vital to having \\&quot;young\\&quot; skin, and having lived in the South now for several years, I was still searching for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>I really like that it leaves a matte appearance after applying, and does not seem to get into the eyes and burn like every other sunscreen I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this goes on, feels really soft but not oily, the only problem is I did burn a little on my nose, needs to be reapplied through out the day, which I did not have to do with my previous sunblock, should have bought a higher SPF</li>
            <li>After having a bad skin reaction to regular sunblock I searched for a good oil-free substitute.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn dozens of brands &amp; products &amp; I require something for sensitive combination skin, that will absorb quickly so not to flake or paste up on my skin or get onto my clothing.</li>
            <li> The key problem with most sunscreens/blocks and wearing them daily is they are difficult to apply (poor absorbing, etc...), leaving one pasty or with flaky remnants, or the product encourages the skin to become oily and break out &amp; rash.</li>
            <li> that gives you the right quantity of sublock (I was reading somewhere that people usually use less sunblock than what they should), at a steal price!</li>
            <li> Never found a face sunblock before that wasn&#x27;t super expensive</li>
            <li> I have a very dry face and rosacea.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I play golf and other sunblocks \\&quot;leak\\&quot; into my eyes and burn.</li>
            <li> One penetrates deeper than the other of the epidermis &amp; dermis.</li>
            <li> But I usually the sunblock only in face and in my hands.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy film on my face like other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I planned on giving the other two bottles to friends to try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this product religiously on my face and neck for the past 9 months</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t even get any tan or any dark spots</li>
            <li> Others feel like I&#x27;m coating myself in the viscus equivalent of watered down glue, this product isn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> but I spent a few hours at the beach and came home sunburned!</li>
            <li> just a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve tried either stings, itches, is too thick &amp; shiny, or won&#x27;t work under makeup.</li>
            <li> i mean nothing, i would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, beware of the false security it may provide.</li>
            <li> , i wish they still sold them in the stores :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally a sunscreen I don&#x27;t hate to have to wear.</li>
            <li> sun there is brutal, however with this sunblock on my face</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. Its made sensitive for faces but I use it to protect all exposed skin. Its not greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. I was so glad to find it on amazon as I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for over a year.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find it on the shelves, but thank goodness for Amazon! I play golf and other sunblocks \\&quot;leak\\&quot; into my eyes and burn. Even the sensitive ones. This product gives great block and my eyes never burn.</li>
            <li> I have slightly to mostly oily skin, and as such, it&#x27;s been difficult to find a sunscreen for my face that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like the proverbial oil-slick just a few minutes after application. I know that sunscreen is vital to having \\&quot;young\\&quot; skin, and having lived in the South now for several years, I was still searching for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product. I read about this in a magazine and decided to try it. As many others have mentioned, I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it in any store (although almost all of them did carry the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; variety!). Luckily, I found a great deal here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say about this except I LOVE IT! This is everything that was promised and more: an oil-free, lightweight, non-greasy SPF 30 sunscreen. It&#x27;s amazing - the first time I put it on my face, I was just astounded - soft skin, no greasy feel, no weird chemical smells. In fact, I have started using this not only as my facial moisturizer, but also on my decolletage area as well as my arms! It&#x27;s just perfect for everyday use; I would advise something a bit more water/sweat resistant for the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation to Hawaiian Tropic would be a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; smell - a little more coconut or something like that. But I&#x27;m guessing that adding something might change the feel/texture/oil-freeness of the product - and I do NOT want to lose that!</li>
            <li> Many of us don&#x27;t concern ourselves with the everyday sun exposure we encounter back &amp; forth to work or when we run errands. But it&#x27;s that same incidental sun that causes the problems we incur when we age with wrinkles &amp; various benign &amp; malignant sarcomas/&amp; or skin cancers. Granted fake baking under heat lamps and laying out during the key UV times of the midday aren&#x27;t any better. There are reasons why we see UV ratings on the weather channel. People, especially young children, elderly, &amp; those with fair complexions with light hair need to be vigilant when it comes to sun protection. There have been many \\&quot;controversial\\&quot; statements made about the amalgamation of the ingredients in sunscreen/block, but I would still rather wear something than nothing. You should also be concerned about chemical blocker vs. physical blocker ingredients as well (research those to tell the difference). It&#x27;s important along with knowing the difference between UVA &amp; UVB rays. One penetrates deeper than the other of the epidermis &amp; dermis. The key problem with most sunscreens/blocks and wearing them daily is they are difficult to apply (poor absorbing, etc...), leaving one pasty or with flaky remnants, or the product encourages the skin to become oily and break out &amp; rash. I&#x27;ve worn dozens of brands &amp; products &amp; I require something for sensitive combination skin, that will absorb quickly so not to flake or paste up on my skin or get onto my clothing. Others feel like I&#x27;m coating myself in the viscus equivalent of watered down glue, this product isn&#x27;t like that at all. It goes on easily, rubs in quickly, and leaves me with a hydrated but matte like finish that I can wear under or over make up or alone. It shipped quickly and as pictured.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing, and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!  This sunscreen is fantastic!  My face soaks up the sunscreen.  It seems to work like a really good moisturizer without being oily/greasy.  I really like that it leaves a matte appearance after applying, and does not seem to get into the eyes and burn like every other sunscreen I have tried.  I use Retin-A, so I need a really good moisturizer in the a.m. along with a sun-protection during the day, this works like a charm!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product over past six years and the only thing I can say: It is the best.   I import to Brazil and my relatives love it too. It&#x27;s not oily (and we live in sunny country), it&#x27;s not jelly but vanish once in skin contact.    The only con is the fact this product uses Oxybenzone, a cancer linked substance. But I usually the sunblock only in face and in my hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  I use this every day and it blends in perfectly with my skin.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing sunscreen.  It does not leave a greasy film on my face like other sunscreens.  I was worried about needing to buy a pack of three.  Who goes through all that sunscreen?  I planned on giving the other two bottles to friends to try.  However, I am so happy with this sunblock that I&#x27;m keeping all three bottles to myself.  It&#x27;s perfect for every day use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this product religiously on my face and neck for the past 9 months and I have just now finished my three bottles.  I still only have positive things to say about this product.  It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and can be worn under make up. When I purchased it in August of 2011 I paid around twenty six dollars for a three pack.  As of May 2012 the price is just under twenty.  I will be purchasing another three pack.  Most other facial sunblocks I have purchased will cause me to break out.  That is not the case with this one.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sunblock, oil- free, comes in a convenient pump bottle with a small round mirror on it (smart!) that gives you the right quantity of sublock (I was reading somewhere that people usually use less sunblock than what they should), at a steal price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this sunblock!  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and totally affordable!  Just wish it would be a a higher in SPF as I&#x27;m super fair skinned.  Never found a face sunblock before that wasn&#x27;t super expensive that felt good on my skin and didn&#x27;t give me pimples!  Also have super sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s unusual to find anything that won&#x27;t give me problems skin wise, and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is THE best sunblock for your face! I just got back from Iraq, and sun there is brutal, however with this sunblock on my face i didn&#x27;t even get any tan or any dark spots i mean nothing, i would recommend this to everyone, i wish they still sold them in the stores :(</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen/moisturizer I have ever used, not to mention it is affordable! I hope this will be available forever!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use on my face; as sun protection and moisturizer. It&#x27;s everything it says it is: fragrance free, fast absorbing, non-greasy. I wear it everyday and just love it!</li>
            <li> Feels very good on your face or skin.&lt;br /&gt;100% Oil FREE!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes even you sweat a lot!</li>
            <li> After having a bad skin reaction to regular sunblock I searched for a good oil-free substitute. This one worked out very well. It&#x27;s not greasy, smells nice (not strong) and I can&#x27;t feel it once applied. The 3-pack is a good value and the little mirror on the bottle is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works great, but not happy at all with all 3 bottles only half full. It should be advertised as 2 oz bottles!</li>
            <li> I thought I was safe when using this sunblock but I spent a few hours at the beach and came home sunburned! It may be that the product has expired as I never even touched the water. I really do want to like this sunblock because it&#x27;s non-greasy but if it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, beware of the false security it may provide.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or irritated skin.  I used it on my kids and even after swimming, eating, crying :) it seemed to still do it&#x27;s job.  I would suggest applying it indoors with the kids so it dries before they go outside.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes on, feels really soft but not oily, the only problem is I did burn a little on my nose, needs to be reapplied through out the day, which I did not have to do with my previous sunblock, should have bought a higher SPF</li>
            <li> Love the product and the service. I am amazed that you can provide such good service at such low prices. I don&#x27;t even mind paying the use tax the state requires we pay. Love Amazon. Tara</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does everything it claims -- it&#x27;s light, absorbs fully into the skin , and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny finish.  The pudding type texture is smooth and does feel hydrating.  It wears well under make-up and doesn&#x27;t ball-up when you apply things on top.  Also, this three pack is at a great price.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; sunscreens out there in terms of sheerness and matte-ness.  The liquids really feel like nothing on your face.  I think this is very good stuff, though.  I&#x27;m glad I found it and will be using on my face for beach days.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the liquid type on workdays.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say. Mild scent (not really any scent) and feels almost like lotion. Glides on real smooth. Does not smell \\&quot;like sunscreen\\&quot; at all! Does not have that sticky sunscreen feel at all either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a sunscreen I don&#x27;t hate to have to wear. It says it&#x27;s anti-aging but frankly I don&#x27;t care - I buy it cause it feels great!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product and bought it because of them. The product is great. It does not leave my skin shiny - and I have oily skin. I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product year-round for several years, and now can&#x27;t find it locally. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or feel itchy like Neutrogena. It leaves a tiny amount of shine, but I use powder/mineral powder over it. It doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This is my all-in-one sun protector/moisturizer.  Can use over treatment serums, creams, etc. and it stays. Everything else I&#x27;ve tried either stings, itches, is too thick &amp; shiny, or won&#x27;t work under makeup. This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and I thought it will work for me. I have a very dry face and rosacea. I tried it the first day and I felt like my face was on fire. Since it was the first so I tried it again but got the same feeling. So I stopped using this product.</li>
