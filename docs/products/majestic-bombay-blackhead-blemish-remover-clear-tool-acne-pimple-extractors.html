            <li>All in all super well made at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>Love this product, great price and packaging</li>
            <li>Worked great for me for the most part</li>
            <li>At under $8 and free shipping with Amazon Prime, it&#x27;s a great deal, too.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t as effective as hoped.</li>

            <li>All opinions my own.</li>
            <li>DO NOT READ THIS UNLESS YOU WANT AN UNBIASED, HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked instructions</li>
            <li>My reviews are my honest opinion</li>
            <li>The product is good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong and well made tool.</li>
            <li>I will be recommending this product to many of my friends, for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and better and more effective than using fingernails - plus it&#x27;s more hygenic.  </li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>but it does make skin a lot better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to cleanse it before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*i received a free product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten facials many times and was looking for a do it yourself product.  </li>
            <li>It’s better to use an acne extractor rather than squeezing them out with your fingers so you don’t aggravate your skin.</li>
            <li>Before using the tool, make sure to disinfect and sterilize with alcohol.</li>
            <li>More information can be found on my blog, Lit From Within.)</li>
            <li>After gripping tool for a couple of minutes, rust smell transfers from metal to fingers.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I had the chance to try this tool and will be keeping it in my medicine cabinet as a go</li>
            <li>For the most part it worked well.</li>
            <li>When I tried again this afternoon I was able to get them.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>Best to use after showering which causes pores to open up and makes for easy extractions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the most comfortable thing to do...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure his complaints were justified.</li>
            <li>I think my husband was more excited than I was about trying this one out.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it is durable.</li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments).</li>
            <li>GIVEN THIS FOR FREE.</li>
            <li>In addition to good skincare, this extractor is an invaluable tool in maintaining clear skin.  </li>
            <li>To prevent infection, use a rubbing alcohol pad to clean the affected area.</li>
            <li>Also use a rubbing alcohol pad to clean the tool after use.</li>
            <li>Tried to clean with rubbing alcohol, didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Definitely way more effective, not to mention safer, than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good alternative to using your fingers to pop white and blackheads.</li>
            <li>It feels quite solid and of superior quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-made, easy to sanitize, and has a tool on each end to deal effectively with different types of blemishes.</li>
            <li>But once I received it, and cleaned it as said, I began using it after a hot shower, and the smell of it was horrendous!</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>I like to apply a warm towel to the affected area for a couple of minutes to help open the pores.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Rusty smell right out of package.</li>
            <li>and they came right out.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool!</li>
            <li>This is pretty great for getting rid of those whiteheads without all the mess!</li>
            <li>Recommend paying a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>It seems like the loops should be just a little smaller to be more effective as most blackheads are very small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the best way to use it is after steaming the skin for a few minutes to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>thanks you!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Hi I loved this blackhead remover , it definitely does the job, however for deeper blackheads that may not be as visible to the human eye a addition needle blackhead tool should be purchased as well.</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>Effective for removing black heads.</li>
            <li>Clearly one of the best in the industry, on par with the expensive brand name counterparts.</li>
            <li>, which is a bummer because I really wanted to like the product</li>
            <li>Simply pat lightly with a gauze or tissue to absorb the blood.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much faster and easier than anything else and safer than a lot of things I have used.</li>
            <li>This really helps with reduce pimples since once they are popped</li>
            <li>I really like this tool.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Between living in a very humid climate and having oily skin, this tool has been a life saver for me for safely removing blackheads and other blemishes without damaging my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>extractor is heavy duty tool, and feels really durable, if you&#x27;re not sensitive to the metal smells, it&#x27;s a great price for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a 40+ year old woman with oily skin, I can enjoy not having as many wrinkles, but it means I&#x27;m STILL dealing with pimples, way past puberty.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this Blackhead and Blemish Extractor to help keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li>so there is no worries of slipping, and it&#x27;s got the two different ends that make it very easy to get rid of any blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads that were pushed out were pretty cool to see, but for the most part, it was really difficult to get them pressed without it hurting.</li>
            <li>The tool is made of stainless steel and comes in a little pouch for easy storage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially hard to use on the nose, which is the place most people feel they need it most.</li>
            <li>There are certain facial areas where this works much easier than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found I had to use force  which left a nice, round dent in my face for 15 minutes...</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s pretty gross</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product was as I expected.</li>
            <li>If you have larger zits/blackheads/ pores then maybe this could work but don&#x27;t be fooled by all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This one does a really good job at removing my blackheads, and the whitehead remover is small enough and rounded enough to remove my whiteheads without needing to apply tons of pressure.</li>
            <li>Works well, I bought this to replace my old one which I lost.</li>
            <li>And actually made my pores look much</li>
            <li>Make sure to not be too harsh though, it will leave deep marks.</li>
            <li>Use the flat side and gently roll out whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I finally searched YouTube and watched a couple videos that totally and completely grossed me out but showed me how to use this</li>
            <li>Still using but not sure it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li>The holes on each end are quite large and require some effort to get smaller black heads out.</li>

            <li> The holes on each end are quite large and require some effort to get smaller black heads out.</li>
            <li> First attempt at using this was a total failure.  </li>
            <li> The metallic rust scent was really strong and hard to get past.</li>
            <li> This might sound silly</li>
            <li> With that said ALL of the blackhead removers are rough on the skin so this is not specific to this model.</li>
            <li> It features a thin angled loop to gently roll out white heads and a flat side to press out blackheads.</li>
            <li> one looks rope braided the other completely flat</li>
            <li> I did a little bit of research on how to use it and how well it actually works...</li>
            <li> The directions were not easy to follow and left us unsure how to use it.</li>
            <li> this is one scary looking tool it looks like something completely new and different to me</li>
            <li> This one is a little harder on the skin because you have to press harder for some black heads.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little rough on the skin</li>
            <li> it works and helps to keep the reddening of the skin down to a minimum, but it leaves a mark if you press too hard and it is sized for a bigger area than an average blackhead.</li>
            <li> and I both tried this with no success.  </li>
            <li> Causes less bruising then using your fingers to remove blemishes.  </li>
            <li> In some cases, your skin may bleed slightly after using the tool.</li>
            <li> the area becomes less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Other skin care tools that I&#x27;ve bought have thin and weak metal, but this one seems very well built.</li>
            <li> use it everyday after shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I came across quite a few videos</li>
            <li> , that were...pretty disgusting to be honest</li>
            <li> The wire is thin enough to move the gunk out.</li>
            <li> have pretty bad blackheads.</li>
            <li> Use the thin loop side for blackheads and press down to remove.</li>
            <li> He has lots of blackheads on his nose which are hard to get out.</li>
            <li> , i had tiny little black heads on my nose which i hated because i would scrub my face raw</li>
            <li> He complained a lot that this hurt</li>

            <li> and still they wouldnt come out at all until i used this no scrubbing and my poor nose</li>

            <li> Amazing! Love this product, great price and packaging is great I still use it for storage.</li>
            <li> It is a solid piece of equipment. No fear of breaking or bending using this.</li>
            <li> Works well, I bought this to replace my old one which I lost. This one is a little harder on the skin because you have to press harder for some black heads. Over all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good. And actually made my pores look much better.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday after shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the most comfortable thing to do... but it does make skin a lot better.</li>
            <li> Hi I loved this blackhead remover , it definitely does the job, however for deeper blackheads that may not be as visible to the human eye a addition needle blackhead tool should be purchased as well. Worked great for me for the most part</li>
            <li> Causes less bruising then using your fingers to remove blemishes.  Best to use after showering which causes pores to open up and makes for easy extractions.</li>
            <li> its alright. wasn&#x27;t as effective as hoped. perhaps needs a different technique.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t have one of these before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty bad blackheads. Between living in a very humid climate and having oily skin, this tool has been a life saver for me for safely removing blackheads and other blemishes without damaging my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the best way to use it is after steaming the skin for a few minutes to open up the pores. Then extract away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great grip on the handle so there is no worries of slipping, and it&#x27;s got the two different ends that make it very easy to get rid of any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: This was given to me for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The product is good and easy to use. It does the job it was intended to do. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> works well. It is a short one.</li>
            <li> This is a great blackhead and whitehead remover! Other skin care tools that I&#x27;ve bought have thin and weak metal, but this one seems very well built. This one does a really good job at removing my blackheads, and the whitehead remover is small enough and rounded enough to remove my whiteheads without needing to apply tons of pressure.</li>
            <li> Happy!! Works as described!</li>
            <li> this is one scary looking tool it looks like something completely new and different to me it is all metal and has two loops one looks rope braided the other completely flat, i had tiny little black heads on my nose which i hated because i would scrub my face raw and still they wouldnt come out at all until i used this no scrubbing and my poor nose thanks you! best part is it didn&#x27;t even hurt me one bit you would think metal hurts like i did but nope don&#x27;t think that because it doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product 100% free to review this also means no shipping payments). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> Before I received this extractor to review,  I did a little bit of research on how to use it and how well it actually works...and I came across quite a few videos, that were...pretty disgusting to be honest lol...but showed how well these extractors are when put to use! So I was sold before I even got it! But once I received it, and cleaned it as said, I began using it after a hot shower, and the smell of it was horrendous! The metallic rust scent was really strong and hard to get past. I also found that it didn&#x27;t work as well for me, as it does for the people in videos. The heads that were pushed out were pretty cool to see, but for the most part, it was really difficult to get them pressed without it hurting. It&#x27;s especially hard to use on the nose, which is the place most people feel they need it most. But it works great for popping zits without having to use your fingers. Just make sure to cleanse it before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extractor is heavy duty tool, and feels really durable, if you&#x27;re not sensitive to the metal smells, it&#x27;s a great price for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i received a free product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions my own.</li>
            <li> A fancy paper weight. The holes on each end are quite large and require some effort to get smaller black heads out. If you have larger zits/blackheads/ pores then maybe this could work but don&#x27;t be fooled by all these positive reviews. I found I had to use force  which left a nice, round dent in my face for 15 minutes... I&#x27;ve since stopped using it, which is a bummer because I really wanted to like the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****DISCLAIMER: I WAS NOT PAID NOR GIVEN THIS FOR FREE. DO NOT READ THIS UNLESS YOU WANT AN UNBIASED, HONEST REVIEW*****</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten facials many times and was looking for a do it yourself product.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Does the same thing the salon product does at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It works great. Make sure to not be too harsh though, it will leave deep marks.</li>
            <li> This might sound silly but I don&#x27;t know how to use it! It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how it works</li>
            <li> Looking for a tool to help with acne and blackheads? Check out this 2-in-one Blackhead Blemish Remover and Acne Extractor by Majestic Bombay. It features a thin angled loop to gently roll out white heads and a flat side to press out blackheads. There is a no slip grip design for ultimate hand control. The tool is made of stainless steel and comes in a little pouch for easy storage. I have been using this on my pimples. It’s better to use an acne extractor rather than squeezing them out with your fingers so you don’t aggravate your skin. Softening the affected area before using the tool will make it easier to remove acne and pimples. I like to apply a warm towel to the affected area for a couple of minutes to help open the pores. Before using the tool, make sure to disinfect and sterilize with alcohol. Use the flat side and gently roll out whiteheads. Use the thin loop side for blackheads and press down to remove. In some cases, your skin may bleed slightly after using the tool. Simply pat lightly with a gauze or tissue to absorb the blood. To prevent infection, use a rubbing alcohol pad to clean the affected area. Also use a rubbing alcohol pad to clean the tool after use. I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products that I would personally use myself. I would definitely recommend this Blackhead and Blemish Extractor to help keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li> (received for review.  All opinions are my own.  More information can be found on my blog, Lit From Within.) As a 40+ year old woman with oily skin, I can enjoy not having as many wrinkles, but it means I&#x27;m STILL dealing with pimples, way past puberty.  In addition to good skincare, this extractor is an invaluable tool in maintaining clear skin.  It&#x27;s well-made, easy to sanitize, and has a tool on each end to deal effectively with different types of blemishes. It&#x27;s easy to use, and better and more effective than using fingernails - plus it&#x27;s more hygenic.  At under $8 and free shipping with Amazon Prime, it&#x27;s a great deal, too.</li>
            <li> Rcv&#x27;d this with no instructions; still trying to figure it out</li>
            <li> This is a very strong and well made tool. However, it is a little rough on the skin so I use it only when neccessary. With that said ALL of the blackhead removers are rough on the skin so this is not specific to this model. All in all super well made at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this works! It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent job. Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Rusty smell right out of package. Tried to clean with rubbing alcohol, didn&#x27;t help. After gripping tool for a couple of minutes, rust smell transfers from metal to fingers. Recommend paying a little more for better quality. I threw mine away.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Still using but not sure it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing Tonsilloliths (tonsil stones). Much faster and easier than anything else and safer than a lot of things I have used.</li>
            <li> Effective for removing black heads. The wire is thin enough to move the gunk out.</li>
            <li> Would have liked instructions</li>
            <li> Here is an awesome tool to help deal with blackheads and pimples. I think my husband was more excited than I was about trying this one out. He has lots of blackheads on his nose which are hard to get out. Well he tried this and they came right out. Yes it&#x27;s pretty gross but it works and that is all that matters. I tried this on an actual pimple that was bugging me and is took it out too. This really helps with reduce pimples since once they are popped the area becomes less noticeable. I am glad I had the chance to try this tool and will be keeping it in my medicine cabinet as a go too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> it works and helps to keep the reddening of the skin down to a minimum, but it leaves a mark if you press too hard and it is sized for a bigger area than an average blackhead.</li>
            <li> First attempt at using this was a total failure.  A couple of my kids and I both tried this with no success.  The directions were not easy to follow and left us unsure how to use it. I finally searched YouTube and watched a couple videos that totally and completely grossed me out but showed me how to use this properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching the videos and trying again I got this to work. For the most part it worked well. My son was my guinea pig. There were a couple blackheads on the end of his nose that I couldn&#x27;t get despite several attempts. He complained a lot that this hurt so I finally quit trying. You do have to apply a lot of pressure to get this to work properly on tough blackheads so I&#x27;m sure his complaints were justified. When I tried again this afternoon I was able to get them.  There are certain facial areas where this works much easier than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good alternative to using your fingers to pop white and blackheads. It seems like the loops should be just a little smaller to be more effective as most blackheads are very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I’m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> Clearly one of the best in the industry, on par with the expensive brand name counterparts. And at this price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Just like what the pros use.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.  It is easy to use and it is durable.</li>
            <li> It feels quite solid and of superior quality. It works as described and I am seeing improvements every day! Definitely way more effective, not to mention safer, than using your fingers. I will be recommending this product to many of my friends, for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool! I absolutely love this thing. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product was as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great for getting rid of those whiteheads without all the mess!</li>
