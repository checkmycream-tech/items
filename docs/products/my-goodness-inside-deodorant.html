    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all of that, it IS the best experience I&#x27;ve had with a healthier deodorant.</li>
            <li>However, I can say I have no idea how some reviewers experienced stickiness on either their fingers or in their underarms; I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This is working great for my wife.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day at greatly reducing body odor, and I&#x27;m the one who notices most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it works great as a deodorant</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good for both women and men</li>
            <li>I thought My Goodness might be a good option, so I gave it a try, but I just don&#x27;t like the application method.</li>
            <li>This is QUITE good.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very good thing, and a strong selling point for this</li>
            <li>This a very interesting concept in deodorant.</li>
            <li>Most amazing deodorant I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I received the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; which did not prevent odor or perspiration, but what is pretty wonderful, is that during the day, if you apply it, the odor goes away *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s applied as a lotion with the fingertips, which isn&#x27;t as convenient as a roll-on or some kind of applicator, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are someone who uses the clinical strength deodorants, this might be a cost effective alternative for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing on lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy after-feel.</li>
            <li>in all, however, My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change of deodorant pace for an athletic dude.</li>
            <li>Effective or not, the price just makes it out of reach and impractical.</li>
            <li>Goodness Deodorant is a nice change, albeit far from perfect.</li>
            <li>I experienced no unpleasant from using it</li>
            <li>for the product, itself, I must say it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very important for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so thankful that it is stain free!  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with how well it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more liquidy that I would wish.  </li>
            <li>A roll-on bottle would be much better, esp.</li>
            <li>For $19.99, I just thought the container would be a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li>contain more product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s got to be something better than hand application, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mostly inside and under 90 degrees.  </li>
            <li>and I am allergic to many deodorants</li>
            <li>It smells amazing - like a lightly scented very clean vanilla soap that fades as the product dries.</li>
            <li>most importantly for me it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out in a rash in the week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>(roll ons are becoming like pay phones).</li>
            <li>It seems to completely neutralize body odor even on very warm days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced the strong stuff is clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not 48 hour strong.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it feels fine.</li>
            <li>- Smells great- clean and fresh - Dries fast.</li>
            <li>However, it went on smooth</li>
            <li>I found this to be an interesting product and a useful one.</li>
            <li>The instructions said to apply it like lotion, but it ran too much for that, and I kind of had to catch it and slap it on before it ran through my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Goodness Deodorant is touted as Aluminum and toxin free.</li>
            <li>I know many women very much want a more natural alternative to most products like this, and I appreciate the work that went into making one available!</li>
            <li>This unique deodorant is a lotion that is rubbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;m pretty sure my classmates were</li>
            <li>* fresh as a daisy, a do-over!</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled that this was clearly marked gluten free.  </li>
            <li>it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free to review, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey if you want to buy it!  </li>
            <li>Even assuming this is true, there&#x27;s no way I would pay the asking price for this product:  about $200 per year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product works for me for 24 hours which is good enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product works for me for 24 hours which is good enough.</li>
            <li>Their biggest selling point is that these are not only not harmful ingredients but GOOD ones.</li>
            <li>; But here&#x27;s what really is notable. a)I;ve used and reviewed natural deodorants on amazon and to me they&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is ALL NATURAL, and it doesn&#x27;t have Aluminum and is toxin free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is unscented, although that means no added scent---it had a mild, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell just from what makes</li>
            <li>The sting went away in about 30 min, and - after a full day of use, including an intense workout - My Goodness Deodorant holding fairly strong.</li>
            <li>I really like the light, clean scent it has for about 45 minutes after I apply it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok if we smear our armpits with it, as if it wont be absorbed into our very porous skin- hahaha!  </li>
            <li>Its amazing that it can last up to 48 hours</li>
            <li>I tried the regular strength version of this product and it has been the most effective natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, it makes you feel fresh</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I knicked my underarms, but I rarely do because I&#x27;m using a quality razor and blades.</li>
            <li>I know there&#x27;s a lot of controversy about whether or not it&#x27;s safe for celiacs to use topical products with gluten, but I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others at a fraction of the cost and didn&#x27;t have those issues that were far better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural ingredients (mostly magnesium) which I prefer, but</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with any brand of natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, a good bit was absorbed during said workout, but there&#x27;s certainly no offensive stench.</li>
            <li>the manufacturer instructs, do NOT use right after shaving or it stings; they offer a \\&quot;Soothing\\&quot; version to use then.</li>
            <li>we &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want that stuff on our hands&amp;#34; right?...  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used mine up, and I don&#x27;t use very much at one time, according to the manufacturer a one-ounce bottle lasts 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and has a bit of a lotion smell.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use most commercial deodorants, because I don&#x27;t want an antiperspirant and don&#x27;t want to use aluminum, although I do use crystal deodorants, which are made from an aluminum salt.)  </li>
            <li>In the morning of the day I first put it on, I gardened in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>It would use more plastic, which the manufacturer (and some consumers) would likely not want</li>
            <li>When I was reading about this deodorant, I was thinking it looked like a product that doesn&#x27;t exactly know what its niche is.</li>
            <li>To read the literature that came with it, you&#x27;d think it was more of a nutrient-rich facial serum.</li>
            <li>first day I tried it, I had a hot yoga class.  </li>
            <li>It was hot</li>
            <li>My armpits don&#x27;t hurt for the first time in ages...</li>
            <li>, I did not smell a thing, however, it is not an antiprespirant, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>While the deodorant works - but not for 48 hours (not for me, anyway) - and the application is okay, the cost puts it outside of my price range.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; on deodorants as I am a line dance teacher</li>
            <li>I thought at first the stinging was because I had showered and shaved.  </li>
            <li>You actually squeeze pleasant smelling white liquid onto your hands and rub it in.</li>
            <li>It;s stain free, gluten free vegan and also has :&amp;#34;Magnesium rich Dead Sea minerals.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This makes for a nice alternative to other products in the market.  </li>
            <li>what is symptom versus cure, but there&#x27;s clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.ts.</li>
            <li>what is symptom versus cure, but there&#x27;s clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>As I said in the title, it&#x27;s overpriced, leaves white marks and isn&#x27;t that easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth it for the protection and natural composition of the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I found this formula to be fast drying and non staining.</li>
            <li>In today&#x27;s world I try to be more careful to avoid toxins; and when I&#x27;m using deodorant</li>
            <li>I really would.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing.</li>
            <li>really hope I see this a)</li>
            <li>I much prefer a roll-on applicator to a rub-in lotion.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need much of it, either.</li>
            <li>and I was really sweating profusely, but I had no odor.  </li>
            <li>and I have very acrid perspiration.  </li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would definitely recommend this if you are searching for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>do not care much for the absence of the applicator, because this being a liquid (well, lotion) when I squeese it on my fingers, it is hard to make sure you take just a little bit, but otherwise it is very good.</li>
            <li>I cannot even begin to tell you the hoops I&#x27;ve had to jump through to try and control my body odor, but until I found this I was using a three-step combination of tea tree oil soap, crystal salt rock, and a natural deodorant every morning... and even with this multi-stage protection I still found myself sneaking off to the bathroom to wash my pits mid-day on hot days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s starting to wear off, though, because I&#x27;m smelling less of the deodorant and more of me&amp;mdash;my skin—but still no bad odor.</li>
            <li>The lotion essentially disappeared quickly and I felt nothing after I applied it.  </li>
            <li>If you do not need the extra coverage then use a more traditional product.</li>
            <li>I had applied it immediately before going outside, so maybe that&#x27;s the key for me...to make sure that I apply it just before strenuous activity, even if I&#x27;ve used it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one was okay for regular daily use.</li>
            <li>When I combine that with the high price tag, I have to say I would not purchase this product for myself.</li>
            <li>giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product.</li>
            <li>giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to aluminum and other products in most deodorants, as they will give me rashes, pain, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky.</li>
            <li>For someone adamantly opposed to using any existing products but wants something that works without regard to cost, it&#x27;s an option.</li>
            <li>just normal moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got it and felt it must not be a deodorant -- but it&#x27;s a different concept, much like the tube shaving creams you sometimes find.</li>
            <li>The deodorant protected me against odor on normal days...</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find out about this deodorant, because I have been searching for a long time for a deodorant without aluminum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The size of this bottle makes if far more convenient to travel with than typical deodorants.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely, really, and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample through the Vine program, but I&#x27;d never pay this much for a little deodorant.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;ve never been an option which leaves all of the natural products and remedies which, for the most part, do little or nothing to control odor (</li>
            <li>This deodorant was a new experience for me.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if the price were in the ballpark of a commercial deodorant, I&#x27;d be interested.</li>
            <li>I really like that they use Dead Sea Minerals and that it is Magnesium rich.  </li>
            <li>On hot days (over 80 degrees) when I sweat, it is quickly obvious that it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>The little bottle is easy to carry to the gym or to use for travel.</li>
            <li>I put it on while I&#x27;m doing other things like drying my hair and by the time I am ready to get dressed, it&#x27;s dry and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I have only used it three times, but so far I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>It also does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>have tried everything under the sun to get away from chemical-laden antiperpirants, but given my body chemistry, I have just found natural alternatives ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I had applied it early morning, and yoga wasn&#x27;t until evening.  </li>
            <li>started using this about a week ago and so far I&#x27;m amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>You rub it in completely like a lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, I don&#x27;t comment on the price of a product when it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t pay for, but in this case I think the price compared to the value is so far out of whack.</li>
            <li>AND it really does last (they say up to 48 hours).</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it seems like a natural product</li>
            <li>but so far have had to reaction to this one.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend the soothing deodorant if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients, and</li>
            <li>You could use up the small bottle fairly quickly if you use a lot, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m struggling with this product for several reasons, one of which has to more to do with the company and less to do with the actual product, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing that surprised the most when I received it was that it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle, but it only takes a dab (about the size of a pea) to cover my armpit.  </li>
            <li>and I have to switch deodorants constantly because they start to become less effective over time - even after just a few weeks, especially during the hot, humid summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a roll on form, even a small roll on bottle, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>so if I find that it doesn&#x27;t really live up to it&#x27;s potential during the summer months I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li>Plus, I can always use a little more magnesium, and it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or other toxins in it that add to your body&#x27;s toxic load.</li>
            <li>There are other brands that work for sensitive skin that have a roll-on application method plus a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li>It just took a small dot of the thick white creamy lotion to completely cover one armpit, and it went on soft and smooth and soothing, drying quickly and invisibly.</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d really put it to the test and see how long it would last.</li>
            <li>I read on their website that they have three different formulas for varying degrees of perspiration, and for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I assume it would work on me as I am a normal \\&quot;sweat-er\\&quot; from my limited knowledge of sweating practices.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t see any reason to apply this with anything other than your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly a week into using the stuff, and I don&#x27;t if I want to go back to traditional anti-perspirants/deodorants.</li>
            <li>It also comes in different strengths, so if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience with natural deodorants, perhaps a stronger formula (Max or Ultra) would be the way to go.</li>
            <li>The product says made in America but some of the instructions sound a little odd:</li>
            <li>Which makes little sense as I&#x27;m a very athletic guy, plus consume gallons of water day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> /&gt;Having said all of that, it IS the best experience I&#x27;ve had with a healthier deodorant.</li>
            <li> However, I can say I have no idea how some reviewers experienced stickiness on either their fingers or in their underarms; I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This is working great for my wife.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day at greatly reducing body odor, and I&#x27;m the one who notices most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it works great as a deodorant</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good for both women and men</li>
            <li> I thought My Goodness might be a good option, so I gave it a try, but I just don&#x27;t like the application method.</li>
            <li> This is QUITE good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very good thing, and a strong selling point for this</li>
            <li> This a very interesting concept in deodorant.</li>
            <li> Most amazing deodorant I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I received the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; which did not prevent odor or perspiration, but what is pretty wonderful, is that during the day, if you apply it, the odor goes away *</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s applied as a lotion with the fingertips, which isn&#x27;t as convenient as a roll-on or some kind of applicator, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are someone who uses the clinical strength deodorants, this might be a cost effective alternative for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like rubbing on lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy after-feel.</li>
            <li> in all, however, My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change of deodorant pace for an athletic dude.</li>
            <li> Effective or not, the price just makes it out of reach and impractical.</li>
            <li> Goodness Deodorant is a nice change, albeit far from perfect.</li>
            <li> I experienced no unpleasant from using it</li>
            <li> for the product, itself, I must say it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very important for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so thankful that it is stain free!  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with how well it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more liquidy that I would wish.  </li>
            <li> A roll-on bottle would be much better, esp.</li>
            <li> For $19.99, I just thought the container would be a bit more substantial.</li>
            <li> contain more product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s got to be something better than hand application, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mostly inside and under 90 degrees.  </li>
            <li> and I am allergic to many deodorants</li>
            <li> It smells amazing - like a lightly scented very clean vanilla soap that fades as the product dries.</li>
            <li> most importantly for me it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out in a rash in the week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> (roll ons are becoming like pay phones).</li>
            <li> It seems to completely neutralize body odor even on very warm days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced the strong stuff is clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not 48 hour strong.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it feels fine.</li>
            <li> - Smells great- clean and fresh - Dries fast.</li>
            <li> However, it went on smooth</li>
            <li> I found this to be an interesting product and a useful one.</li>
            <li> The instructions said to apply it like lotion, but it ran too much for that, and I kind of had to catch it and slap it on before it ran through my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Goodness Deodorant is touted as Aluminum and toxin free.</li>
            <li> I know many women very much want a more natural alternative to most products like this, and I appreciate the work that went into making one available!</li>
            <li> This unique deodorant is a lotion that is rubbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;m pretty sure my classmates were</li>
            <li> * fresh as a daisy, a do-over!</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled that this was clearly marked gluten free.  </li>
            <li> it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free to review, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey if you want to buy it!  </li>
            <li> Even assuming this is true, there&#x27;s no way I would pay the asking price for this product:  about $200 per year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product works for me for 24 hours which is good enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product works for me for 24 hours which is good enough.</li>
            <li> Their biggest selling point is that these are not only not harmful ingredients but GOOD ones.</li>
            <li> ; But here&#x27;s what really is notable. a)I;ve used and reviewed natural deodorants on amazon and to me they&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is ALL NATURAL, and it doesn&#x27;t have Aluminum and is toxin free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is unscented, although that means no added scent---it had a mild, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell just from what makes</li>
            <li> The sting went away in about 30 min, and - after a full day of use, including an intense workout - My Goodness Deodorant holding fairly strong.</li>
            <li> I really like the light, clean scent it has for about 45 minutes after I apply it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok if we smear our armpits with it, as if it wont be absorbed into our very porous skin- hahaha!  </li>
            <li> Its amazing that it can last up to 48 hours</li>
            <li> I tried the regular strength version of this product and it has been the most effective natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, it makes you feel fresh</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I knicked my underarms, but I rarely do because I&#x27;m using a quality razor and blades.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s a lot of controversy about whether or not it&#x27;s safe for celiacs to use topical products with gluten, but I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others at a fraction of the cost and didn&#x27;t have those issues that were far better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural ingredients (mostly magnesium) which I prefer, but</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with any brand of natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, a good bit was absorbed during said workout, but there&#x27;s certainly no offensive stench.</li>
            <li> the manufacturer instructs, do NOT use right after shaving or it stings; they offer a \\&quot;Soothing\\&quot; version to use then.</li>
            <li> we &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want that stuff on our hands&amp;#34; right?...  </li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used mine up, and I don&#x27;t use very much at one time, according to the manufacturer a one-ounce bottle lasts 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and has a bit of a lotion smell.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use most commercial deodorants, because I don&#x27;t want an antiperspirant and don&#x27;t want to use aluminum, although I do use crystal deodorants, which are made from an aluminum salt.)  </li>
            <li> In the morning of the day I first put it on, I gardened in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li> It would use more plastic, which the manufacturer (and some consumers) would likely not want</li>
            <li> When I was reading about this deodorant, I was thinking it looked like a product that doesn&#x27;t exactly know what its niche is.</li>
            <li> To read the literature that came with it, you&#x27;d think it was more of a nutrient-rich facial serum.</li>
            <li> first day I tried it, I had a hot yoga class.  </li>
            <li> It was hot</li>
            <li> My armpits don&#x27;t hurt for the first time in ages...</li>
            <li> , I did not smell a thing, however, it is not an antiprespirant, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> While the deodorant works - but not for 48 hours (not for me, anyway) - and the application is okay, the cost puts it outside of my price range.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; on deodorants as I am a line dance teacher</li>
            <li> I thought at first the stinging was because I had showered and shaved.  </li>
            <li> You actually squeeze pleasant smelling white liquid onto your hands and rub it in.</li>
            <li> It;s stain free, gluten free vegan and also has :&amp;#34;Magnesium rich Dead Sea minerals.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This makes for a nice alternative to other products in the market.  </li>
            <li> what is symptom versus cure, but there&#x27;s clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.ts.</li>
            <li> what is symptom versus cure, but there&#x27;s clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> As I said in the title, it&#x27;s overpriced, leaves white marks and isn&#x27;t that easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but worth it for the protection and natural composition of the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found this formula to be fast drying and non staining.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s world I try to be more careful to avoid toxins; and when I&#x27;m using deodorant</li>
            <li> I really would.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing.</li>
            <li> really hope I see this a)</li>
            <li> I much prefer a roll-on applicator to a rub-in lotion.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need much of it, either.</li>
            <li> and I was really sweating profusely, but I had no odor.  </li>
            <li> and I have very acrid perspiration.  </li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would definitely recommend this if you are searching for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> do not care much for the absence of the applicator, because this being a liquid (well, lotion) when I squeese it on my fingers, it is hard to make sure you take just a little bit, but otherwise it is very good.</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you the hoops I&#x27;ve had to jump through to try and control my body odor, but until I found this I was using a three-step combination of tea tree oil soap, crystal salt rock, and a natural deodorant every morning... and even with this multi-stage protection I still found myself sneaking off to the bathroom to wash my pits mid-day on hot days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s starting to wear off, though, because I&#x27;m smelling less of the deodorant and more of me&amp;mdash;my skin—but still no bad odor.</li>
            <li> The lotion essentially disappeared quickly and I felt nothing after I applied it.  </li>
            <li> If you do not need the extra coverage then use a more traditional product.</li>
            <li> I had applied it immediately before going outside, so maybe that&#x27;s the key for me...to make sure that I apply it just before strenuous activity, even if I&#x27;ve used it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one was okay for regular daily use.</li>
            <li> When I combine that with the high price tag, I have to say I would not purchase this product for myself.</li>
            <li> giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product.</li>
            <li> giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to aluminum and other products in most deodorants, as they will give me rashes, pain, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky.</li>
            <li> For someone adamantly opposed to using any existing products but wants something that works without regard to cost, it&#x27;s an option.</li>
            <li> just normal moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got it and felt it must not be a deodorant -- but it&#x27;s a different concept, much like the tube shaving creams you sometimes find.</li>
            <li> The deodorant protected me against odor on normal days...</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find out about this deodorant, because I have been searching for a long time for a deodorant without aluminum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The size of this bottle makes if far more convenient to travel with than typical deodorants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely, really, and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample through the Vine program, but I&#x27;d never pay this much for a little deodorant.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;ve never been an option which leaves all of the natural products and remedies which, for the most part, do little or nothing to control odor (</li>
            <li> This deodorant was a new experience for me.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if the price were in the ballpark of a commercial deodorant, I&#x27;d be interested.</li>
            <li> I really like that they use Dead Sea Minerals and that it is Magnesium rich.  </li>
            <li> On hot days (over 80 degrees) when I sweat, it is quickly obvious that it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> The little bottle is easy to carry to the gym or to use for travel.</li>
            <li> I put it on while I&#x27;m doing other things like drying my hair and by the time I am ready to get dressed, it&#x27;s dry and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have only used it three times, but so far I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> It also does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> have tried everything under the sun to get away from chemical-laden antiperpirants, but given my body chemistry, I have just found natural alternatives ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I had applied it early morning, and yoga wasn&#x27;t until evening.  </li>
            <li> started using this about a week ago and so far I&#x27;m amazed at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> You rub it in completely like a lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, I don&#x27;t comment on the price of a product when it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t pay for, but in this case I think the price compared to the value is so far out of whack.</li>
            <li> AND it really does last (they say up to 48 hours).</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it seems like a natural product</li>
            <li> but so far have had to reaction to this one.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend the soothing deodorant if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients, and</li>
            <li> You could use up the small bottle fairly quickly if you use a lot, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m struggling with this product for several reasons, one of which has to more to do with the company and less to do with the actual product, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing that surprised the most when I received it was that it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle, but it only takes a dab (about the size of a pea) to cover my armpit.  </li>
            <li> and I have to switch deodorants constantly because they start to become less effective over time - even after just a few weeks, especially during the hot, humid summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it was available in a roll on form, even a small roll on bottle, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> so if I find that it doesn&#x27;t really live up to it&#x27;s potential during the summer months I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Plus, I can always use a little more magnesium, and it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or other toxins in it that add to your body&#x27;s toxic load.</li>
            <li> There are other brands that work for sensitive skin that have a roll-on application method plus a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li> It just took a small dot of the thick white creamy lotion to completely cover one armpit, and it went on soft and smooth and soothing, drying quickly and invisibly.</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d really put it to the test and see how long it would last.</li>
            <li> I read on their website that they have three different formulas for varying degrees of perspiration, and for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I assume it would work on me as I am a normal \\&quot;sweat-er\\&quot; from my limited knowledge of sweating practices.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t see any reason to apply this with anything other than your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly a week into using the stuff, and I don&#x27;t if I want to go back to traditional anti-perspirants/deodorants.</li>
            <li> It also comes in different strengths, so if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience with natural deodorants, perhaps a stronger formula (Max or Ultra) would be the way to go.</li>
            <li> The product says made in America but some of the instructions sound a little odd:</li>
            <li> Which makes little sense as I&#x27;m a very athletic guy, plus consume gallons of water day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, using my Tom&#x27;s deodorant works pretty much as well for a quarter (or less) of the price of this.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried other natural deodorants and everything from crystals to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> A little would go a long way, because of how much it&#x27;s a liquid, so that could balance out the price.  </li>
            <li> I have used every other all natural deodorant that I have come across and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other types of natural deodorant before</li>
            <li> She says that the My Goodness Deodorant REGULAR, took only a second to dry.</li>
            <li> Extra Dry and/or coconut oil/baking soda paste will last all day.  </li>
            <li> so I need a deodorant that will last all day long</li>
            <li> Clearly lotion breaks down easier than roll on/powder.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this, hoping against all odds that it would be the magical product that finally frees me from my dependence on dangerous chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It comes out like a lotion, which was a strange experience to put on deodorant with my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have not made my way through the entire bottle yet, but using only a small amount a day it should last for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> not sure about the manufacturer claims that this product is edible and detoxifies, but while expensive it is indeed quite effective.</li>
            <li> other advantage of a deodorant of this type is that you don&#x27;t get the annoying clumps that accumulate later on in the day, because it rubs directly into your skin there is no mess at the end of the day, which was a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> So it got tested with both physical and mental caused stress!  </li>
            <li> We put so many different chemicals in our bodies on a regular basis that it scares the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t pinpoint what caused the initial sting, but perhaps I need to step down in My Goodness Deodorant strength.</li>
            <li> , I did not have any irritation (like some other reviewers seem to have), and it kept me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> that well (or maybe those folks simply reek too strongly).b)the typical deodorant</li>
            <li> know this product is expensive, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I went for a 200 round trip motorcycle ride (around 86 outside)</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use it until bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Feels like a powder when dry - Feels weird to apply it with your hands at first but just think of it as body lotion.</li>
            <li> We saw no real difference in comparison with using other products.</li>
            <li> A little bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A small application of My Goodness, rubbed on like lotion, can last for two days.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not contain aluminum or other problem ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product also contains Magnesium and other minerals and vitamins-though they are not listed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tested this deodorant under extreme condition.  </li>
            <li> like I do with other deodorants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the fact that it&#x27;s a liquid</li>
            <li> You pour about a dime sized amount on a finger, rub it on your pits, and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li> Their for a foot product, an acne, product, and maybe some other product.</li>
            <li> Their for a foot product, an acne, product, and maybe some other product.</li>
            <li> I did not have any stinging as other reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have about 5 containers of deodorant in my bathroom that I have used but had underarm itching or other or other problems with.</li>
            <li> This seems to combat perspiration extremely well.</li>
            <li> Also - and perhaps due to it not clogging pores - I sweated significantly less from my armpits.</li>
            <li> come down in price and b)</li>
            <li> Putting it on a cotton ball or other applicator is just going to waste it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using less than that amount (combined) on both sides</li>
            <li> Dare I say less sweat than when using a supposed anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Either way, the sting sensation was significantly less on Day 2.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already read some other reviews, some of which complained that the cream is sticky, or burns when applied over a shaved area, or didn&#x27;t prevent odor, so I was curious.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other natural deodorant that is so expensive compared to its size.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive deodorant made with Dead Sea minerals and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The application is like a lotion, which took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> too)&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use it daily for work and had no problems with odor, but I was afraid to try it in a situation where I actually SWEAT.  </li>
            <li> I do not like heavy deodorants</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a ball would waste product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do heavy working out or gardening that would make me sweat profusely, so your mileage may vary if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received a one-ounce version of the deodorant (not the acne treatment) in return for an unbiased review.  I&#x27;d already read some other reviews, some of which complained that the cream is sticky, or burns when applied over a shaved area, or didn&#x27;t prevent odor, so I was curious.  (I don&#x27;t use most commercial deodorants, because I don&#x27;t want an antiperspirant and don&#x27;t want to use aluminum, although I do use crystal deodorants, which are made from an aluminum salt.)  I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t shave my armpits, so I can&#x27;t report about stinging.  However, I can say I have no idea how some reviewers experienced stickiness on either their fingers or in their underarms; I didn&#x27;t.  The lotion essentially disappeared quickly and I felt nothing after I applied it.  I also didn&#x27;t have underarm odor at any time after using the product.  So for me, it works. It&#x27;s applied as a lotion with the fingertips, which isn&#x27;t as convenient as a roll-on or some kind of applicator, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.  In fact, if the price were in the ballpark of a commercial deodorant, I&#x27;d be interested. (There&#x27;s no way to compete with the crystal deodorant on price, since that stuff literally lasts for years.) But the price isn&#x27;t in the ballpark, or in the ballpark&#x27;s parking lot.  Although I haven&#x27;t used mine up, and I don&#x27;t use very much at one time, according to the manufacturer a one-ounce bottle lasts 4-6 weeks.  Even assuming this is true, there&#x27;s no way I would pay the asking price for this product:  about $200 per year.  But that&#x27;s an individual choice, of course.  For someone adamantly opposed to using any existing products but wants something that works without regard to cost, it&#x27;s an option.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was a new experience for me.  First of all it comes in a small tube and does not roll on like a regular deodorant.  It comes out like a lotion, which was a strange experience to put on deodorant with my hands.  However, it went on smooth, I did not have any irritation (like some other reviewers seem to have), and it kept me dry all day long.  The advantage of a deodorant in this style is that  it will not stain your clothes.  It is almost totally scentless (although it did smell a bit when I was putting it on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other advantage of a deodorant of this type is that you don&#x27;t get the annoying clumps that accumulate later on in the day, because it rubs directly into your skin there is no mess at the end of the day, which was a huge bonus for me.  I live in a hot climate so I need a deodorant that will last all day long and this one did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product can be used on different parts of your body as well, although I only used it as a regular underarm deodorant.  Personally I cannot see the appeal to using a deodorant anywhere else, but I suppose for some that might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the product is that you have to apply it with your hands, and that it comes in a small size, and is a bit expensive.  However, if you are someone who uses the clinical strength deodorants, this might be a cost effective alternative for you.  The clinical strength deodorants often times come in small sizes, and can be costly.  I have used them in the past, and this product protected me from sweat as well, if not better than those.  I have not made my way through the entire bottle yet, but using only a small amount a day it should last for several weeks.  This makes for a nice alternative to other products in the market.  The only downside is the cost.</li>
            <li> Most amazing deodorant I have ever used! The application is like a lotion, which took a little getting used to. But, the effectiveness is beyond compare. I have used every other all natural deodorant that I have come across and none compare to this one. I literally have not had any odor since beginning to use this product two weeks ago. It is pricey, but worth it for the protection and natural composition of the product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We did not use this for deodorant as I wanted to try it out on zits, since some of the reviewers said it was supposed to work on bad eruptions. We saw no real difference in comparison with using other products. I would not purchase this again. It may work for you, it did not work for us.</li>
            <li> I like the My Goodness Deodorant. I&#x27;ve used other types of natural deodorant before and I like to try them and alternate between regular deodorant. A lotion deodorant did take a bit of getting used to. A small application of My Goodness, rubbed on like lotion, can last for two days. This is an expensive deodorant made with Dead Sea minerals and other natural ingredients. This deodorant does not contain aluminum or other problem ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this formula to be fast drying and non staining. It dries very fast and has a bit of a lotion smell. I read on their website that they have three different formulas for varying degrees of perspiration, and for sensitive skin. This product also contains Magnesium and other minerals and vitamins-though they are not listed on the bottle. I found this to be an interesting product and a useful one. The little bottle is easy to carry to the gym or to use for travel. This product did not sting or leave a residue on my skin. This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is ALL NATURAL, and it doesn&#x27;t have Aluminum and is toxin free.  In today&#x27;s world I try to be more careful to avoid toxins; and when I&#x27;m using deodorant that&#x27;s very important for me.  I really like that they use Dead Sea Minerals and that it is Magnesium rich.  Its amazing that it can last up to 48 hours and I&#x27;m so thankful that it is stain free!  The only thing that bothered me was putting it on with my hands...  I&#x27;ve been using a spray with Mineral salts and water so its different to apply it with my hands, I guess that will change once I get used to it.  Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> yeah, well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won&#x27;t make it. We, in today&#x27;s world, have evolved well past a product like this. The application process alone - squirt into hand and apply to underarm - yeah, that&#x27;s primal. The price does not justify the product&#x27;s features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t see the benefit. This is really a big step backward.</li>
            <li> I have only used it three times, but so far I am really liking it. It is not sticky, it makes you feel fresh and there is no odor at all. I do not like heavy deodorants but the one I had been using lately was not working so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not care much for the absence of the applicator, because this being a liquid (well, lotion) when I squeese it on my fingers, it is hard to make sure you take just a little bit, but otherwise it is very good.</li>
            <li> My college daughter runs all day and she doesn&#x27;t mind that this deodorant is applied like a lotion. She says that the My Goodness Deodorant REGULAR, took only a second to dry. She adds, &amp;#34;It works well for blocking odor and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, yeah!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to control wetness and I smelled stinky from this product.</li>
            <li> I tested this deodorant under extreme condition.  In the morning of the day I first put it on, I gardened in the hot sun.  Later that day, I wound up taking my daughter to the ER.  So it got tested with both physical and mental caused stress!  It deodorized well.  Although I was sweaty, I didn&#x27;t smell!  I was quite pleased with how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say it&#x27;s a bit tricky to apply.  It&#x27;s a lot more liquidy that I would wish.  The instructions said to apply it like lotion, but it ran too much for that, and I kind of had to catch it and slap it on before it ran through my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unscented, although that means no added scent---it had a mild, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell just from what makes it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free to review, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey if you want to buy it!  A little would go a long way, because of how much it&#x27;s a liquid, so that could balance out the price.  I know many women very much want a more natural alternative to most products like this, and I appreciate the work that went into making one available!</li>
            <li> Application is problematic requiring you to wash your hands and the product does sting. If you do not need the extra coverage then use a more traditional product.</li>
            <li> This is working great for my wife. She&#x27;s tried other natural deodorants and everything from crystals to essential oils.  Nothing has worked as well as this! It lasts all day at greatly reducing body odor, and I&#x27;m the one who notices most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she loves that it is paraben-free! It is also vegan and gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the unscented which has only a faint fruity sunscreen-like scent. Part of that may be the apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses about a pea-sized amount under each arm, and here&#x27;s the bad part - a lot does get wasted and she needs to wash her hands after use. A roll-on bottle would be much better, esp. as this is so expensive. This 1 oz bottle will probably last a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the manufacturer instructs, do NOT use right after shaving or it stings; they offer a \\&quot;Soothing\\&quot; version to use then. Otherwise it feels fine. The product says made in America but some of the instructions sound a little odd: \\&quot;Rub in to absorption.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the manufacturer claims that this product is edible and detoxifies, but while expensive it is indeed quite effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I was stunned by the \\&quot;petiteness\\&quot; of this bottle of deodorant. For $19.99, I just thought the container would be a bit more substantial. Let me say this up front: I will NEVER pay upwards of $20 for deodorant. It&#x27;ll be a cold day in hell when that happens. I removed a star for price though I could have removed two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, itself, I must say it&#x27;s pretty great. It smells amazing - like a lightly scented very clean vanilla soap that fades as the product dries. It&#x27;s lovely, really, and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry. I put it on while I&#x27;m doing other things like drying my hair and by the time I am ready to get dressed, it&#x27;s dry and fragrance free. It also worked well all day. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a 48 hour period but I assume it would work on me as I am a normal \\&quot;sweat-er\\&quot; from my limited knowledge of sweating practices. Also, the instructions are to use a dime-sized amount of product for each underarm but that was an awful lot for me. I ended up using less than that amount (combined) on both sides and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that is somewhat peripheral but could enhance the product a bit. I understand the application and I personally don&#x27;t mind it but I think the product could benefit from a roll-on ball. It would use more plastic, which the manufacturer (and some consumers) would likely not want but it could justify the cost slightly (very slightly) and make it easier for people to apply. I don&#x27;t know if a ball would waste product but it&#x27;s worth looking into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the price, I would DEFINITELY buy this. I really would. I think it&#x27;s good for both women and men and it really doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing. And I appreciae its veganness and naturalness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope I see this a) come down in price and b) contain more product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to aluminum and other products in most deodorants, as they will give me rashes, pain, etc. I thought My Goodness might be a good option, so I gave it a try, but I just don&#x27;t like the application method. I much prefer a roll-on applicator to a rub-in lotion. When I combine that with the high price tag, I have to say I would not purchase this product for myself. There are other brands that work for sensitive skin that have a roll-on application method plus a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li> When I was reading about this deodorant, I was thinking it looked like a product that doesn&#x27;t exactly know what its niche is. A deodorant? Really? To read the literature that came with it, you&#x27;d think it was more of a nutrient-rich facial serum. But I thought I&#x27;d try it as it is pitched&amp;mdash;as a deodorant—and see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my initial experience. I bathed and shaved my legs and underarms with a double-edged safety razor. I don&#x27;t think I knicked my underarms, but I rarely do because I&#x27;m using a quality razor and blades. Usually when I put on deodorant after shaving, it feels unpleasant on my skin for a while even if it doesn&#x27;t sting. Not this My Goodness deodorant. It just took a small dot of the thick white creamy lotion to completely cover one armpit, and it went on soft and smooth and soothing, drying quickly and invisibly. It was like it was not even there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d really put it to the test and see how long it would last. It&#x27;s been over 48 hours since I applied it, and I have no underarm body odor. I can tell it&#x27;s starting to wear off, though, because I&#x27;m smelling less of the deodorant and more of me&amp;mdash;my skin—but still no bad odor. I put some under my breasts, where I tend to sweat a lot because I hate wearing bras, and I didn&#x27;t get any breaking out like I do with other deodorants. Plus, I can always use a little more magnesium, and it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or other toxins in it that add to your body&#x27;s toxic load. That&#x27;s a very good thing, and a strong selling point for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t see any reason to apply this with anything other than your fingers. It&#x27;s like rubbing on lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy after-feel. Putting it on a cotton ball or other applicator is just going to waste it. And you don&#x27;t need much of it, either. You could use up the small bottle fairly quickly if you use a lot, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot. At least I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t do heavy working out or gardening that would make me sweat profusely, so your mileage may vary if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product. I may be wrong; it&#x27;s going to depend on how long the bottle lasts me, but I won&#x27;t know that until it&#x27;s all gone.ardening that would make me sweat profusely, so your mileage may vary if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars, not five, because I think the $34.99 retail price ($32.82 Prime price at the time of this writing) is just too high for this product.

            <li> This unique deodorant is a lotion that is rubbed into the skin.  It&#x27;s unscented and leaves no residue.  It also does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  I have celiac disease and I was thrilled that this was clearly marked gluten free.  I know there&#x27;s a lot of controversy about whether or not it&#x27;s safe for celiacs to use topical products with gluten, but I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing so.  I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything under the sun to get away from chemical-laden antiperpirants, but given my body chemistry, I have just found natural alternatives ineffective.  I was eager to try this, hoping against all odds that it would be the magical product that finally frees me from my dependence on dangerous chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it, I had a hot yoga class.  That was a miserable failure.  I had applied it early morning, and yoga wasn&#x27;t until evening.  When I started sweating,  the effectiveness wore off almost immediately.  I was bummed. (And I&#x27;m pretty sure my classmates were too)&lt;br /&gt;I continued to use it daily for work and had no problems with odor, but I was afraid to try it in a situation where I actually SWEAT.  I finally decided to give it another go last weekend while working in the yard.  It was hot and I was really sweating profusely, but I had no odor.  I had applied it immediately before going outside, so maybe that&#x27;s the key for me...to make sure that I apply it just before strenuous activity, even if I&#x27;ve used it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;I know this product is expensive, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.  I know I will continue to buy once this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> My armpits hurt. All the time. I also sweat...a LOT. Which makes little sense as I&#x27;m a very athletic guy, plus consume gallons of water day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried extra strength anti perspire/deodorants, mainstream...also non mainstream products. I&#x27;m tired of the weird hard, chemical glob left on my undershirts, also the smell at the end of the day. I&#x27;m convinced the strong stuff is clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change, albeit far from perfect. To begin, it stings upon initial use. Application is a tad nasty having to rub the product into your armpits. Even suggested dime size amount is awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still...it works and well. The sting went away in about 30 min, and - after a full day of use, including an intense workout - My Goodness Deodorant holding fairly strong. Not 48 hour strong. Yes, a good bit was absorbed during said workout, but there&#x27;s certainly no offensive stench. Also - and perhaps due to it not clogging pores - I sweated significantly less from my armpits. Dare I say less sweat than when using a supposed anti-perspirant. No glob on the undershirt, just normal moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t pinpoint what caused the initial sting, but perhaps I need to step down in My Goodness Deodorant strength. Being a Vine review, however, I can only review what I get. Hopefully they&#x27;ll offer alternate strengths in review products. Either way, the sting sensation was significantly less on Day 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like an improvement on application method. As a dude, we&#x27;re not fans of rubbing lotion onto armpit hair. While this product works well, I&#x27;d like a middle ground. Clearly lotion breaks down easier than roll on/powder. There&#x27;s got to be something better than hand application, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, however, My Goodness Deodorant is a nice change of deodorant pace for an athletic dude. My armpits don&#x27;t hurt for the first time in ages...no undershirt glob. I&#x27;m nearly a week into using the stuff, and I don&#x27;t if I want to go back to traditional anti-perspirants/deodorants. I&#x27;m now convinced they made me sweat more by blocking the pores, also made my sweat smell a little funky. I have no idea what is symptom versus cure, but there&#x27;s clearly something to be said about using a more natural deodorant.ts.

            <li> Given the price, I had high hopes for this product. Since this is the most expensive deodorant I ever tried, I assumed it must work or else no one would buy it. However, I was wrong. As I said in the title, it&#x27;s overpriced, leaves white marks and isn&#x27;t that easy to apply. I&#x27;ve used others at a fraction of the cost and didn&#x27;t have those issues that were far better. Unless you happen to have a dying curiosity to see what this about and have $30 to spare, I would advise passing on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had two issues to overcome with regards to deodorant: I have super-sensitive skin and I have very acrid perspiration.  Standard deodorants/antiperspirants cause a horrible rash so they&#x27;ve never been an option which leaves all of the natural products and remedies which, for the most part, do little or nothing to control odor (and I&#x27;ve tried them all.)  I cannot even begin to tell you the hoops I&#x27;ve had to jump through to try and control my body odor, but until I found this I was using a three-step combination of tea tree oil soap, crystal salt rock, and a natural deodorant every morning... and even with this multi-stage protection I still found myself sneaking off to the bathroom to wash my pits mid-day on hot days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about a week ago and so far I&#x27;m amazed at how well it works.  It seems to completely neutralize body odor even on very warm days.  I went to their website and discovered that you can apply this any time during the day and it will neutralize perspiration on contact.  I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it&#x27;s certainly a different approach to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I read on their website it&#x27;s all natural ingredients (mostly magnesium) which I prefer, but most importantly for me it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out in a rash in the week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  The thing that surprised the most when I received it was that it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle, but it only takes a dab (about the size of a pea) to cover my armpit.  You rub it in completely like a lotion so it leaves no residue to get on your clothes.  Everything about this product seems to be an entirely different approach to deodorant.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so if I find that it doesn&#x27;t really live up to it&#x27;s potential during the summer months I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised. There is no scent, which I missed so I took one star away. Also, it works great as a deodorant, I did not smell a thing, however, it is not an antiprespirant, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m struggling with this product for several reasons, one of which has to more to do with the company and less to do with the actual product, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATURAL&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s natural. I really do. We put so many different chemicals in our bodies on a regular basis that it scares the crap out of me. My co-workers, family, and friends think my concern about the environment and what we put into our bodies is unnatural, but I think their nonchalance is unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the fact that it&#x27;s a liquid and you have to rub it on, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I wish it was available in a roll on form, even a small roll on bottle, but it is what it is. Maybe they&#x27;ll change it after receiving lots of feedback. Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTIVENESS&lt;br /&gt;It works. You pour about a dime sized amount on a finger, rub it on your pits, and repeat on the other side. I do wash my hands when I&#x27;m done. It says it can work up to 48 hours, but that&#x27;s not an option for me. I&#x27;m stinky and I&#x27;ve always been stinky (I sometimes have to reapply deodorant in the middle of the day) and I have to switch deodorants constantly because they start to become less effective over time - even after just a few weeks, especially during the hot, humid summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I don&#x27;t comment on the price of a product when it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t pay for, but in this case I think the price compared to the value is so far out of whack. I don&#x27;t know of any other natural deodorant that is so expensive compared to its size. I&#x27;m struggling with that, because the reality is that, I will often purchase a product that I&#x27;ve reviewed and there is a need. While the deodorant works - but not for 48 hours (not for me, anyway) - and the application is okay, the cost puts it outside of my price range. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense for me. I can&#x27;t find a way to justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SALES PAGE&lt;br /&gt;This is where it gets absolutely, mind-bogglingly confusing for me. The sales page sells multiple products. So those 100+ reviews you see are NOT all for the deodorant. Their for a foot product, an acne, product, and maybe some other product. I don&#x27;t know about you but before I make a purchase I like to read the reviews - the good, the bad, and the ugly. And it confused the hell outta me that the reviews were for products that you apply to your face, and feet, and whatever else. I&#x27;m not sure if the company saves money by placing all of their products on the same sales page, but it makes it very difficult for a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product works for me for 24 hours which is good enough. If it weren&#x27;t for the cost, the application and the sales page, it would have received 5 stars.bogglingly confusing for me. The sales page sells multiple products.

            <li> This a very interesting concept in deodorant. My Goodness Deodorant is touted as Aluminum and toxin free. It;s stain free, gluten free vegan and also has :&amp;#34;Magnesium rich Dead Sea minerals.&amp;#34; But here&#x27;s what really is notable. a)I;ve used and reviewed natural deodorants on amazon and to me they&#x27;ve been fine but some say they don;t work that well (or maybe those folks simply reek too strongly).b)the typical deodorant how is the stick (roll ons are becoming like pay phones). This is VERY different. It&#x27;s a small bottle. You actually squeeze pleasant smelling white liquid onto your hands and rub it in. A little bottle goes a long way. AND it really does last (they say up to 48 hours). I first got it and felt it must not be a deodorant -- but it&#x27;s a different concept, much like the tube shaving creams you sometimes find. This is QUITE good. Their biggest selling point is that these are not only not harmful ingredients but GOOD ones. The size of this bottle makes if far more convenient to travel with than typical deodorants.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular strength version of this product and it has been the most effective natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used. I really like the light, clean scent it has for about 45 minutes after I apply it. However, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me throughout the day. On hot days (over 80 degrees) when I sweat, it is quickly obvious that it isn&#x27;t working. Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with any brand of natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the application. It&#x27;s a liquid that you have to rub into your armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, it IS the best experience I&#x27;ve had with a healthier deodorant. It also comes in different strengths, so if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience with natural deodorants, perhaps a stronger formula (Max or Ultra) would be the way to go.</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant for a week before reviewing.  I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; on deodorants as I am a line dance teacher and I also ride motorcycles in heat of inland SoCal.&lt;br /&gt;Why only three stars?? The deodorant protected me against odor on normal days...mostly inside and under 90 degrees.  I went for a 200 round trip motorcycle ride (around 86 outside) and I had to &amp;#34;redo&amp;#34; about a quarter of the way through the ride.  My Arrid Extra Dry and/or coconut oil/baking soda paste will last all day.  This one was okay for regular daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been using My Goodness regular deodorant for about a week. It is liquid with no applicator. You put a tiny amount on a finger and apply to armpits. It does not contain any harmful additives or scent. Supposed to last 24 hours. I did not have any stinging as other reviews mentioned. It did last 48 hours. I experienced no unpleasant from using it and I think the 1 ounce bottle will last about a month if used as suggested in the description. I am going to continue to use it until bottle is empty. I like the fact that it seems like a natural product and I am allergic to many deodorants but so far have had to reaction to this one. I have about 5 containers of deodorant in my bathroom that I have used but had underarm itching or other or other problems with. I hope this one will be a winner.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find out about this deodorant, because I have been searching for a long time for a deodorant without aluminum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to work well to eliminate odor - I squeeze a small amount onto my fingertips and apply it to my underarms.  I have not noticed any odor even though I did sweat quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it does sting a bit after applying.  I thought at first the stinging was because I had showered and shaved.  So I waited and applied it the next day when I had not shaved, and it still stung a bit.  I do plan to buy this product again when I run out, however I will be buying the &amp;#34;My Goodness Soothing Deodorant&amp;#34; which is mentioned on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish this was in an underarm applicator so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use my fingers.  Those are the only changes I would make to this product, it needs a roll on applicator and I would recommend the soothing deodorant if you have sensitive skin.  Otherwise I would definitely recommend this if you are searching for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; which did not prevent odor or perspiration, but what is pretty wonderful, is that during the day, if you apply it, the odor goes away *poof* fresh as a daisy, a do-over! It does not mask the issues, it is resolved.&lt;br /&gt;i tried this product for it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients, and although it didn&#x27;t perform by preventing anything, it&#x27;s definitely something to carry with, and apply, as needed. I like it.</li>
            <li> This seems to combat perspiration extremely well. It should--for the price. For the teeny tiny bottle, you pay a lot. And that&#x27;s why the stars off. This just seems overpriced. I mean, using my Tom&#x27;s deodorant works pretty much as well for a quarter (or less) of the price of this. I got a free sample through the Vine program, but I&#x27;d never pay this much for a little deodorant. Effective or not, the price just makes it out of reach and impractical.</li>
            <li> PROS: - Smells great- clean and fresh - Dries fast. Feels like a powder when dry - Feels weird to apply it with your hands at first but just think of it as body lotion. When you think about it, it&#x27;s weird to apply deodorant / antiperspirant the traditional way &#x27;cause we &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want that stuff on our hands&amp;#34; right?...  But it&#x27;s ok if we smear our armpits with it, as if it wont be absorbed into our very porous skin- hahaha!
