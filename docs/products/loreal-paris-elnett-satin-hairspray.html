            <li>great delivery from seller</li>

            <li>It worked great for that purpose.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be a very nice flexible hold</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most wonderful Hair Spray!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not the best as they advertise.</li>

            <li>Very good product to help maintain healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for colored hair, and if you&#x27;re going out in the sun â€” it has a UV filter, how amazing is that?&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It is light and smells great!</li>
            <li>I loved Texture hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I heard lots of good things about this hairspray, plus I was attracted to the UV protection aspect.</li>
            <li>good product and price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- really good hold&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Performance wise - yes, I&#x27;d use it again.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try saw on a youtube tutorial it holds well and has good smell.</li>
            <li>Masterpiece from Bed head holds and smells good.</li>

            <li>My hair took it and looked good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>The hold seems good on this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>it has UV protection and a strong hold for color treated hair!!  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be the best of help, because as I was looking for &amp;#34;the best hair spray ever&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve noticed many people dislike the Elnett Hairspray scent so much, comparing it to chemical smell and to grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has very good hold for fine hair.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li>I really love this hairspray and its a great price here, vs the drug store.</li>
            <li>More for great hold.  </li>
            <li>Great hold and healthy shine</li>
            <li>The best part about this hairspray is that even if you use a ton of this product it brushes right out at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite hairspray, and at a great price, what could be better?!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray!  </li>

            <li>The absolute best hairspray, EVER!</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good price for it as I know it&#x27;s more at drugstores and even at Target.</li>
            <li>A spray of this keeps the humidity at bay and gives a bit more volume and helps my hair stay looking good all day.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price so far on it!</li>
            <li>LOVE, love, love this hairspray!  </li>
            <li>At first I bought a sample size at a beauty supply, it worked great</li>
            <li>It also comes in a handy travel size that easily fits in a purse.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>When I have used this it has held my style better then most products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Plus it feels light and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this hairspray, mostly because I was attracted to</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray and have been using it over 4 years now.</li>
            <li>I never get helmet head, I&#x27;m always able to restyle over it if I need too.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, and I meant to give it a 5 star rating, but they posted only one.  </li>
            <li>Went to send it back and the site wont let me re turn it because it is a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27;!!!!</li>
            <li>Love Elnett.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris.</li>
            <li>Lots of people rave over this hairspray but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>CANNOT beat this hairspray, with coupons and extra bucks or thru AMAZON PRIME AWESOME DEAL!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of sprays, and this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Brushes out lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the UV protection as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love how it sprays.</li>
            <li>I further my quest to find the perfect hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite salon brand hairspray has changed</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to get hold without achieving non-moving helmet head.</li>
            <li>more could you ask for?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i would surely give it a try.  </li>
            <li>it was an excellent product back then.  </li>
            <li>love this hairspray - you can comb through it - feels like no sticky residue</li>
            <li>I purchased it after seeing it reviewed on the Today Show as the hairspray their stylists use and the stars love.</li>
            <li>The hold is fine and it brushes out easily, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a bonfire!</li>
            <li>This hairspray has a nice hold and it&#x27;s true when they say &amp;#34;one brush stroke&amp;#34; to brush it out.</li>
            <li>more accurate word for this is hair fog, not spray.</li>
            <li>great hair, very stylish with the flips of those years and used those wire curlers with the pink stickers to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>So easy to have the product in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and easy to brush out.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love the smell, and so I found myself purchasing good old</li>
            <li>does what its supposed to while not leaving clumps and easy to brush out  with hand or comb.</li>
            <li>The smell is pungent and does not wear off easily.</li>
            <li>Holds hair and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>It is the strong hold spray-</li>
            <li>She loves the strong hold.</li>
            <li>Keeps my style of the day strong without looking greasy or preventing movement.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong, that it triggered a migraine( not a joke)  </li>
            <li>This hairspray does not seem to have a strong hold on hair</li>
            <li>Good stuff - still pricey - no complaint about service.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best hairspray I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Spray is fine, can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and</li>
            <li>I gave this 1 star because the smell was so strong to me that I could not get beyond it to enjoy what the product could do.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this hairspray because it has a perfect hold; does not look stiff and yet brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>Really light, flexible hold.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a light hairspray that would help keep hair in place.</li>
            <li>It might work great in another climate, but it definitely won&#x27;t work in a humid one.  </li>
            <li>If sunscreen is important to you because you color your hair or just do not want your hair to bleach out in the sun</li>
            <li>I wish there was an unscented version easily available.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit into ANY bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li>There is an unscented version, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap hairspray.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy (not in a good way).  </li>
            <li>This Elnett hairspray is just spectacular and has a great hold but not in a stiff way.</li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray for fine or slick hair.</li>
            <li>It can produce any result from a light hold to securing an updo for a full night.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not fans of the smell, there&#x27;s this exact thing in scent-free, so look it up here on Amazon and check that one out :)</li>
            <li>dont understand why everyone is so excited about this overpriced hair spray.</li>
            <li>It does a great job holding curls and styling in place, and it definitely can disappear with the stroke of a brush (as they claim) if you do so right after application.</li>
            <li>so now I have moved up to the full size.</li>
            <li>This product is why my curls stay full and bouncy all day without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks..  :)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I did a quick brush through after 5 minutes to soften the curls and then let it set.</li>
            <li>time, I think I&#x27;ll try the Moroccan Oil Hairspray -- it costs a whole lot more, but I think its worth it not to smell like Raid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate too, because the price is AWESOME, the can is HUGE, and the mist is so fine.</li>
            <li>This would be great hairspray,  but the smell ruins it.</li>
            <li>I normally use TGIF Masterpiece, and love the scent + hold.  </li>
            <li>The delivery from the can is a very fine mist that leaves your hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a spray that can be worked through or hold tight, depending on the circumstance.  </li>
            <li>It provides great hold without being crunchy or sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li>far as hold goes, I think I like Fructis anti humidity hairspray better.</li>
            <li>I am quite surprised that L&#x27;oreal of all companies (they make many hair color products and hair color protecting products) can be so deceiving with this one.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and works just as well as other sprays that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product, but for me there is one big drawn back - the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is as soft and fine as baby hair</li>
            <li>A little is good hold.  </li>
            <li>But if it keeps my medium blonde dye job from turning brassy in the sun, that is OK.</li>
            <li>This Hairspray is 16.29 at CVS, so I use my extra bucks to buy it, it lasts about three months, but I love to just spray away</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t care for the smell, but the hold is natural and fantastic and the smell fades after you&#x27;ve sprayed it.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how light weight the spray is.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued but glad to see it back</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray because it actually holds my braid and surrounding hair in place all day.  </li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this L&#x27;Oreal product because it is more product for the same price.  </li>
            <li>You can brush it right out, but it also holds very well.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not unpleasant, although smell is always a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li>Now let me me clear, it&#x27;s not a horrible, make me want to gag kind of smell - just really not an enjoyable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big into hairspray, but this has good hold without being sticky or gross.</li>
            <li>Usually I don&#x27;t have an issue with how a product smells (and roll my eyes at reviewers who do), as the fragrance either smells nice or is quickly forgotten as it dries.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>and it never feels crusty just like pure AIR..</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, which is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time.</li>
            <li>One thing to have in mind is that this does not perform very well in the rain.</li>
            <li>One&#x27;s hair can get very sticky and knotty when caught in the rain with this applied.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and it really does keep your locks in place.</li>
            <li>I have been growing out my bangs and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I used to be a RUSK WORX Atomizer user until I tried this (once it became available to the public in the States).  </li>
            <li>Does it really cost L&#x27;Oreal three times as much to manufacture this as it does their entry level sprays?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;would really like to hear from someone who tried it 30 -40 years ago and have purchased this product now.  </li>
            <li>This really does disappear with the stroke of a brush as the advert says.  </li>
            <li>Not like most other sprays that build up with each use.  </li>
            <li>using the black or blue/black hair dye, it didn&#x27;t flake; my hair was very touchable; held up on misty mornings going to work and kept you looking good at the disco later that</li>
            <li>But this definitely will last a long time, and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>While this product is hard to find in many stores it is worth asking them to stock it.</li>
            <li>I live on the Gulf Coast where its very humid.  </li>
            <li>I like this hair spray because it smells refreshing and not like your typical \\&quot;chemical\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am sure some people feel differently, since it is on the market a while, but I got an instant headache</li>
            <li>By the next day, they were more relaxed and actually looked even</li>
            <li>and I only used one quick spray to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have spent a small fortune trying to find a spray I liked, from Aveda to cheap versions like Suave</li>
            <li>cost is a bit on the high side for a \\&quot;drug</li>
            <li>It does, however, spray on very lightly and does not make hair feel stiff at all.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>This is the only hairspray worth buying in my estimation.</li>
            <li>It does not dull your hair</li>
            <li>I can run my fingers through my hair without any resistance, yet it falls right back into place.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana, world capital of heat combined with humidity (or maybe a tie with Houston).</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used l&#x27;oreal paris hairspray all through the end of the 60&#x27;s, through the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and it disappeared from every drugstore in the five boros of new york in the very early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Very natural oozing and combs out well.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or heavy; no helmet head; brushes out easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair, and if I get even slight too much hairspray</li>
            <li>I put this on my hair in the morning and had to leave work early to come home and wash it off.</li>
            <li>I am NOT a person who is particularly sensitive to scents, but this hairspray&#x27;s smell was overpoweringly</li>
            <li>I have long hair that I set with hot rollers or zelcro rollers.</li>
            <li>Hair stays but not firm when combing out.</li>
            <li>Well, my curls lasted through the whole day and through the next.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used professional product on my hair and Elnett</li>
            <li>A frequent repurchase for a number of years...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like old lady perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can really control the amount that I want to use, like short bursts or longer mists.</li>
            <li>Looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>If you do not have an issues with scent you make like this but avoid if you are sensitive to scents in hairspray.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and touchable,  Does not build up on your hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff holds and holds and your hair can actually still move very naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my review is on the product of old because i have a phobia against paying $14.00 for a can of hairspray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the superhold is very superhold and must be washed out and not just combed or brushed</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old Aquanet hairspray from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it is firm enough to use it to sculpt your style and keep your hair looking respectable on windy days.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be better for people who do not have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Its a little pricey, but so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap hairspray to super expensive salon brand hairsprays.</li>
            <li>It has a fabulous firm hold without being flaky or giving you helmet head!</li>
            <li>This can lasts quite a long time--you don&#x27;t need to use much with each styling.</li>
            <li>While I agree that this spray smells nice and holds well, it leaves my hair looking very dry and dull.  </li>
            <li>I have hair that curls easily, and after I spray my hair it gets sicky and hard</li>
            <li>My hair is long and pretty thick and this product is strong enough to keep it out of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I usually use John Frieda Sheer Blonde spray, which holds my hair for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>It is not cheap and I have tried so many other brands to see if I could find a substitute.  </li>
            <li>It kept the curls in longer and soft enough that i could still run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>My wife has tried so many hairsprays, and never happy until she found this one.</li>
            <li>In fact, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE INGREDIENT IN THIS PRODUCT THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR HAIR FROM SUN EXPOSURE!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>I left review for Elnett hairspray under &amp;#34;Elnett unscented hairspray&amp;#34;  Pretty much same hairspray but the smell of this spray is so overpowering that it ruins the entire hairspray..  </li>
            <li>My 12 yr old daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li>Since my hair is long I must be very careful what products I use on it to keep it from breaking or getting too much residue on it.  </li>

            <li> It worked great for that purpose.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be a very nice flexible hold</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most wonderful Hair Spray!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not the best as they advertise.</li>

            <li> Very good product to help maintain healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for colored hair, and if you&#x27;re going out in the sun â€” it has a UV filter, how amazing is that?&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It is light and smells great!</li>
            <li> I loved Texture hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I heard lots of good things about this hairspray, plus I was attracted to the UV protection aspect.</li>
            <li> good product and price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- really good hold&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Performance wise - yes, I&#x27;d use it again.</li>

            <li> The hold seems good on this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> it has UV protection and a strong hold for color treated hair!!  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be the best of help, because as I was looking for &amp;#34;the best hair spray ever&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve noticed many people dislike the Elnett Hairspray scent so much, comparing it to chemical smell and to grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has very good hold for fine hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really love this hairspray and its a great price here, vs the drug store.</li>
            <li> More for great hold.  </li>
            <li> Great hold and healthy shine</li>
            <li> The best part about this hairspray is that even if you use a ton of this product it brushes right out at the end of the night.  </li>

            <li> The absolute best hairspray, EVER!</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good price for it as I know it&#x27;s more at drugstores and even at Target.</li>
            <li> A spray of this keeps the humidity at bay and gives a bit more volume and helps my hair stay looking good all day.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price so far on it!</li>
            <li> LOVE, love, love this hairspray!  </li>
            <li> At first I bought a sample size at a beauty supply, it worked great</li>
            <li> It also comes in a handy travel size that easily fits in a purse.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> When I have used this it has held my style better then most products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Plus it feels light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this hairspray, mostly because I was attracted to</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray and have been using it over 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I never get helmet head, I&#x27;m always able to restyle over it if I need too.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, and I meant to give it a 5 star rating, but they posted only one.  </li>
            <li> Went to send it back and the site wont let me re turn it because it is a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27;!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Elnett.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris.</li>
            <li> Lots of people rave over this hairspray but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> CANNOT beat this hairspray, with coupons and extra bucks or thru AMAZON PRIME AWESOME DEAL!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of sprays, and this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Brushes out lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love the UV protection as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love how it sprays.</li>
            <li> I further my quest to find the perfect hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite salon brand hairspray has changed</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to get hold without achieving non-moving helmet head.</li>
            <li> more could you ask for?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i would surely give it a try.  </li>
            <li> it was an excellent product back then.  </li>
            <li> love this hairspray - you can comb through it - feels like no sticky residue</li>
            <li> I purchased it after seeing it reviewed on the Today Show as the hairspray their stylists use and the stars love.</li>
            <li> The hold is fine and it brushes out easily, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a bonfire!</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a nice hold and it&#x27;s true when they say &amp;#34;one brush stroke&amp;#34; to brush it out.</li>
            <li> more accurate word for this is hair fog, not spray.</li>
            <li> great hair, very stylish with the flips of those years and used those wire curlers with the pink stickers to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> So easy to have the product in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and easy to brush out.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love the smell, and so I found myself purchasing good old</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to while not leaving clumps and easy to brush out  with hand or comb.</li>
            <li> The smell is pungent and does not wear off easily.</li>
            <li> Holds hair and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> It is the strong hold spray-</li>
            <li> She loves the strong hold.</li>
            <li> Keeps my style of the day strong without looking greasy or preventing movement.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong, that it triggered a migraine( not a joke)  </li>
            <li> This hairspray does not seem to have a strong hold on hair</li>
            <li> Good stuff - still pricey - no complaint about service.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best hairspray I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Spray is fine, can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and</li>
            <li> I gave this 1 star because the smell was so strong to me that I could not get beyond it to enjoy what the product could do.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this hairspray because it has a perfect hold; does not look stiff and yet brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> Really light, flexible hold.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a light hairspray that would help keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> It might work great in another climate, but it definitely won&#x27;t work in a humid one.  </li>
            <li> If sunscreen is important to you because you color your hair or just do not want your hair to bleach out in the sun</li>
            <li> I wish there was an unscented version easily available.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit into ANY bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> There is an unscented version, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap hairspray.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy (not in a good way).  </li>
            <li> This Elnett hairspray is just spectacular and has a great hold but not in a stiff way.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray for fine or slick hair.</li>
            <li> It can produce any result from a light hold to securing an updo for a full night.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not fans of the smell, there&#x27;s this exact thing in scent-free, so look it up here on Amazon and check that one out :)</li>
            <li> dont understand why everyone is so excited about this overpriced hair spray.</li>
            <li> It does a great job holding curls and styling in place, and it definitely can disappear with the stroke of a brush (as they claim) if you do so right after application.</li>
            <li> so now I have moved up to the full size.</li>
            <li> This product is why my curls stay full and bouncy all day without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks..  :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did a quick brush through after 5 minutes to soften the curls and then let it set.</li>
            <li> time, I think I&#x27;ll try the Moroccan Oil Hairspray -- it costs a whole lot more, but I think its worth it not to smell like Raid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate too, because the price is AWESOME, the can is HUGE, and the mist is so fine.</li>
            <li> This would be great hairspray,  but the smell ruins it.</li>
            <li> I normally use TGIF Masterpiece, and love the scent + hold.  </li>
            <li> The delivery from the can is a very fine mist that leaves your hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a spray that can be worked through or hold tight, depending on the circumstance.  </li>
            <li> It provides great hold without being crunchy or sticky or too heavy.</li>
            <li> far as hold goes, I think I like Fructis anti humidity hairspray better.</li>
            <li> I am quite surprised that L&#x27;oreal of all companies (they make many hair color products and hair color protecting products) can be so deceiving with this one.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price and works just as well as other sprays that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great product, but for me there is one big drawn back - the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is as soft and fine as baby hair</li>
            <li> A little is good hold.  </li>
            <li> But if it keeps my medium blonde dye job from turning brassy in the sun, that is OK.</li>
            <li> This Hairspray is 16.29 at CVS, so I use my extra bucks to buy it, it lasts about three months, but I love to just spray away</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t care for the smell, but the hold is natural and fantastic and the smell fades after you&#x27;ve sprayed it.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how light weight the spray is.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued but glad to see it back</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray because it actually holds my braid and surrounding hair in place all day.  </li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this L&#x27;Oreal product because it is more product for the same price.  </li>
            <li> You can brush it right out, but it also holds very well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not unpleasant, although smell is always a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li> Now let me me clear, it&#x27;s not a horrible, make me want to gag kind of smell - just really not an enjoyable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big into hairspray, but this has good hold without being sticky or gross.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t have an issue with how a product smells (and roll my eyes at reviewers who do), as the fragrance either smells nice or is quickly forgotten as it dries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> and it never feels crusty just like pure AIR..</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, which is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time.</li>
            <li> One thing to have in mind is that this does not perform very well in the rain.</li>
            <li> One&#x27;s hair can get very sticky and knotty when caught in the rain with this applied.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and it really does keep your locks in place.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my bangs and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I used to be a RUSK WORX Atomizer user until I tried this (once it became available to the public in the States).  </li>
            <li> Does it really cost L&#x27;Oreal three times as much to manufacture this as it does their entry level sprays?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;would really like to hear from someone who tried it 30 -40 years ago and have purchased this product now.  </li>
            <li> This really does disappear with the stroke of a brush as the advert says.  </li>
            <li> Not like most other sprays that build up with each use.  </li>
            <li> using the black or blue/black hair dye, it didn&#x27;t flake; my hair was very touchable; held up on misty mornings going to work and kept you looking good at the disco later that</li>
            <li> But this definitely will last a long time, and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> While this product is hard to find in many stores it is worth asking them to stock it.</li>
            <li> I live on the Gulf Coast where its very humid.  </li>
            <li> I like this hair spray because it smells refreshing and not like your typical \\&quot;chemical\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am sure some people feel differently, since it is on the market a while, but I got an instant headache</li>
            <li> By the next day, they were more relaxed and actually looked even</li>
            <li> and I only used one quick spray to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune trying to find a spray I liked, from Aveda to cheap versions like Suave</li>
            <li> cost is a bit on the high side for a \\&quot;drug</li>
            <li> It does, however, spray on very lightly and does not make hair feel stiff at all.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray worth buying in my estimation.</li>
            <li> It does not dull your hair</li>
            <li> I can run my fingers through my hair without any resistance, yet it falls right back into place.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana, world capital of heat combined with humidity (or maybe a tie with Houston).</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used l&#x27;oreal paris hairspray all through the end of the 60&#x27;s, through the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and it disappeared from every drugstore in the five boros of new york in the very early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Very natural oozing and combs out well.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy; no helmet head; brushes out easily.  </li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair, and if I get even slight too much hairspray</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair in the morning and had to leave work early to come home and wash it off.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a person who is particularly sensitive to scents, but this hairspray&#x27;s smell was overpoweringly</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I set with hot rollers or zelcro rollers.</li>
            <li> Hair stays but not firm when combing out.</li>
            <li> Well, my curls lasted through the whole day and through the next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used professional product on my hair and Elnett</li>
            <li> A frequent repurchase for a number of years...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like old lady perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can really control the amount that I want to use, like short bursts or longer mists.</li>
            <li> Looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> If you do not have an issues with scent you make like this but avoid if you are sensitive to scents in hairspray.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and touchable,  Does not build up on your hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff holds and holds and your hair can actually still move very naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my review is on the product of old because i have a phobia against paying $14.00 for a can of hairspray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the superhold is very superhold and must be washed out and not just combed or brushed</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old Aquanet hairspray from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but it is firm enough to use it to sculpt your style and keep your hair looking respectable on windy days.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would be better for people who do not have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey, but so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap hairspray to super expensive salon brand hairsprays.</li>
            <li> It has a fabulous firm hold without being flaky or giving you helmet head!</li>
            <li> This can lasts quite a long time--you don&#x27;t need to use much with each styling.</li>
            <li> While I agree that this spray smells nice and holds well, it leaves my hair looking very dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that curls easily, and after I spray my hair it gets sicky and hard</li>
            <li> My hair is long and pretty thick and this product is strong enough to keep it out of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I usually use John Frieda Sheer Blonde spray, which holds my hair for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> It is not cheap and I have tried so many other brands to see if I could find a substitute.  </li>
            <li> It kept the curls in longer and soft enough that i could still run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried so many hairsprays, and never happy until she found this one.</li>
            <li> In fact, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE INGREDIENT IN THIS PRODUCT THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR HAIR FROM SUN EXPOSURE!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I left review for Elnett hairspray under &amp;#34;Elnett unscented hairspray&amp;#34;  Pretty much same hairspray but the smell of this spray is so overpowering that it ruins the entire hairspray..  </li>
            <li> My 12 yr old daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> Since my hair is long I must be very careful what products I use on it to keep it from breaking or getting too much residue on it.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it is very hard for fine limp hair to hold a style or body.  </li>
            <li> is a cut above any other professional spray i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft &amp; does not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> This spray didn&#x27;t hold my curls long enough to get into my car.  </li>
            <li> After I flat iron my haor, I spray it with Elnett.  </li>
            <li> TOTALLY FLAT.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on glowing reviews from not only other Amazon customers, but also from a Real Simple &amp;#34;Top 10 Hairsprays&amp;#34; review--both of which I always trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me in a cardboard box for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> It also has a strange smell to me.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair long and flowing.  </li>
            <li> long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you are a wash your hair every other day or every few days gal, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It hardens the hair a bit, obviously, since it&#x27;s a hair spray, but a slight finger combing motion would get rid of that in a second, whenever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy it very long time.</li>
            <li> Amps up my thin fine hair without the tacky stiff feel of anything.  </li>
            <li> Looked like I had washed my hair, put on lots of conditioner, and let it dry with no styling or styling product.</li>
            <li> I have it sent on a regular basis, and I get it less than a the stores.</li>
            <li> It holds fine, but it stinks and the smell lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Not to wet, not too dry, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> so I finally spent the money.  </li>
            <li> It does not make your hair feel stiff and it can easily be brushed out to restyle!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> i use aqua net hair spray now and very little of that.  </li>
            <li> TexTure hairspray was the only product that gave me a hold without feeling stiff or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have not and will not buy any other hair spray since they brought Elnett to the states.  </li>
            <li> Works just like any other you can get for $1.99</li>
            <li> Please read other review to know about hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I keep a small version in my purse if I need a touch-up later in the day.</li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I find it leaves my hair sticky and weighs it down without maintaining the hair style.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that it tends to dull the shine in my hair a little.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long.</li>
            <li> sadly, the new formula just didn&#x27;t do anything but cost me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on one section of hair to try it.</li>
            <li> Attended a recent barbeque and the wind was blowing very hard.</li>
            <li> Saying it smells like a combination of rotting dead fishy seaweed on a beach, musty, dank DIRTY old lady, and Indian take-out left in the car on a hot day MIGHT come close to giving you some idea of how incredibly bad this stuff reeks.</li>
            <li> My hair looked limp and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> all this product has going for it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to try a few others before considering repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Upset I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The price does seem expensive, in comparison to other similar products out there.</li>
            <li> my hair is touchable, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it lasts Forever!  </li>
            <li> I can also get away with only washing my hair every other day--it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dirty on day 2.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a firm hold, but doesn&#x27;t make it hard to the touch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear hairspray, since I just let my hair airdry every day without styling it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy this one!</li>
            <li> However I cannot get past the scent.  </li>
            <li> Not real happy about that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when it is humid it becomes frizzy.</li>
            <li> the smell - seriously</li>
            <li> (I read the reviews that said it was stinky before I bought it, but nothing prepared me for how bad it actually DID smell).</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is not beautifully scented; it literally smells like burning rubber.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the reviews about the smell were exaggerated, but alas they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not worth it if I can&#x27;t handle the scent.  :-(</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive for a hairspray but it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do so I will continue to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> Are the decision makers at L&#x27;Oreal playing some weird trick on us?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I was swayed by magazine articles.</li>
            <li> unfortunately that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Reminds me of, unfortunately, Raid ant spray.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I cannot get past the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> STINKS</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get it to hold a curl or stay in one place.</li>
            <li> But OMG did it smell bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it smells that bad,  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This hair spray smells so bad!</li>
            <li> Does not hold hair and has a very bad smell</li>
            <li> The smell of this hairspray is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> the smell is awful !!!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible - look elsewhere unless you like to stink all day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best hairspray for fine or slick hair. It provides great hold without being crunchy or sticky or too heavy. You can brush it out and reapply a lot and it still doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. It adds volume too. If they ever discontinue it I will cry.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and use it every day.  It is quite expensive for a hairspray but it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do so I will continue to</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it is very hard for fine limp hair to hold a style or body.  When I have used this it has held my style better then most products I have tried.  Plus it feels light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried so many hairsprays, and never happy until she found this one. It&#x27;s cheaper here than our local stores. It great for color treated hair. It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> This hair spray smells so bad! I put this on my hair in the morning and had to leave work early to come home and wash it off. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone would rate this 5 star. YUCK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the number one recommended hairspray by my hairstylist. It does a great job holding curls and styling in place, and it definitely can disappear with the stroke of a brush (as they claim) if you do so right after application. One thing to have in mind is that this does not perform very well in the rain. One&#x27;s hair can get very sticky and knotty when caught in the rain with this applied. However, it&#x27;s nothing that a shower can&#x27;t fix. The price does seem expensive, in comparison to other similar products out there. But this definitely will last a long time, and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Amazon Verified Purchase Review:  I have used this product for years. It is the only hairspray you can brush out.I am impressed by the excellent service &amp; the fast delivery as well as the price. Amazon is terrific.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever!!</li>
            <li> Holds hair without making you have a helmet.  Brushes out if you need to redo it.  I wish they could rework the scent because it reminds me of Aqua Net.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li> You may as well be breathing in chemicals. This hairspray is not beautifully scented; it literally smells like burning rubber. I am sure some people feel differently, since it is on the market a while, but I got an instant headache and I cannot get that smell out of my room or my hair.</li>
            <li> Really light, flexible hold.</li>
            <li> Spray is fine, can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this hairspray, mostly because I was attracted to it&#x27;s retro looking packaging. But OMG did it smell bad. I am NOT a person who is particularly sensitive to scents, but this hairspray&#x27;s smell was overpoweringly n a s t y. To say it smelled like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t enough of a warning. (I read the reviews that said it was stinky before I bought it, but nothing prepared me for how bad it actually DID smell). Spray it on and picture your head emanating odoriffic waves (like in a cartoon). Saying it smells like a combination of rotting dead fishy seaweed on a beach, musty, dank DIRTY old lady, and Indian take-out left in the car on a hot day MIGHT come close to giving you some idea of how incredibly bad this stuff reeks. It&#x27;s weird. There can&#x27;t possibly be anyone who likes this smell, can there? Are the decision makers at L&#x27;Oreal playing some weird trick on us? Did they forget to make ANY effort towards making it smell even slightly pleasant? I don&#x27;t pretend to know what&#x27;s up, but hear me now and believe me later. This ish REEKS, yo.</li>
            <li> The best Hairspray ever.  I just can&#x27;t be without it, so I have it sent on a regular basis, and I get it less than a the stores.</li>
            <li> I have not and will not buy any other hair spray since they brought Elnett to the states.  LOVE it!!  Does not clog the nozzle like some.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s very soft &amp; does not weigh the hair down.  It brushes out &amp; doesn&#x27;t build up on the hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long. It is very difficult to get it to hold a curl or stay in one place. I like this hair spray because it smells refreshing and not like your typical \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smelling hair sprays, it hold like a champ, and you can brush through it with ease. Its a little pricey, but so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product. It was supposed to be a light hairspray that would help keep hair in place. I have thick hair and when it is humid it becomes frizzy. Tried this hairspray hoping to contain the frizz, it did nothing for the frizz nor did it hold my style in place at all. It does, however, spray on very lightly and does not make hair feel stiff at all. Maybe it would be better for people who do not have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and it really does keep your locks in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big into hairspray, but this has good hold without being sticky or gross. So I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> BEST HAIR SPRAY EVER! It has a fabulous firm hold without being flaky or giving you helmet head! If you need to restyle, just brush it out! 10&#x27;S ACROSS THE BOARD! !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all kinds of magazine articles about how wonderful this hairspray is so I finally spent the money.  I live on the Gulf Coast where its very humid.  I have long hair that I set with hot rollers or zelcro rollers. This spray didn&#x27;t hold my curls long enough to get into my car.  My hair looked limp and frizzy.  It might work great in another climate, but it definitely won&#x27;t work in a humid one.  I usually use John Frieda Sheer Blonde spray, which holds my hair for most of the day.  I&#x27;m sorry I was swayed by magazine articles. I&#x27;m back to my Sheer Blonde spray!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray and have been using it over 4 years now. Amazon has the best price so far on it! It is light and smells great!</li>
            <li> Does not hold hair and has a very bad smell</li>
            <li> Best hairspray on the market. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that sticky feeling.Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Holds well but not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair, and if I get even slight too much hairspray it looks greasy.  Never an issue with this stuff.  Best hairspray ever.  I never get helmet head, I&#x27;m always able to restyle over it if I need too.</li>
            <li> I loved Texture hairspray.  I have fine hair and TexTure hairspray was the only product that gave me a hold without feeling stiff or weighing my hair down.  I have tried several others and finally found this one which works almost as well.  The only problem I have with this is that it tends to dull the shine in my hair a little.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since it came out. Won&#x27;t even consider another time. Very natural oozing and combs out well. Doesn&#x27;t get tacky.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray &amp; only this hairspray for years.  It can produce any result from a light hold to securing an updo for a full night.  The best part about this hairspray is that even if you use a ton of this product it brushes right out at the end of the night.  I am forever devoted.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, and I meant to give it a 5 star rating, but they posted only one.  So easy to have the product in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> You can buy cheaper hairspray but none that keeps your hair in place and yet touchable. Also, the UV protection is key, both for your hair (if colored) and your scalp (yes, the sun DOES get through to your scalp). This can lasts quite a long time--you don&#x27;t need to use much with each styling. You&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this hairspray because it has a perfect hold; does not look stiff and yet brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> The best on the marker</li>
            <li> Not enough hold for me.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, holds hair in place and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> Yup. Smells like RAID. But if it keeps my medium blonde dye job from turning brassy in the sun, that is OK. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;As far as hold goes, I think I like Fructis anti humidity hairspray better. But I only bought this for the UV Protection. I&#x27;ll get back later with my opinion on that. If you don&#x27;t care about the UV, go with the Fructis. Way Way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 45 minutes ago. Now I have a headache and my head and face are itchy. Went to send it back and the site wont let me re turn it because it is a &#x27;hazardous material&#x27;!!!! It was shipped to me in a cardboard box for crying out loud. Why can&#x27;t I send it back??</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray!  So easy to use and easy to brush out.  Does not pull your hair out and way cheaper here than anywhere else!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews for this product.  Does NOT hold hair in place.  It has a pleasant smell, unfortunately that&#x27;s all this product has going for it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The very best hair spray available!!!!</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients before you buy this product.  If sunscreen is important to you because you color your hair or just do not want your hair to bleach out in the sun then this is definitely not the hairspray for you.  It does not contain a proven sunscreen ingredient like benzophenone-3, benzophenone-4, or octyl methoxy cinnamate.  Without one of these sunscreen that have been proven to work on hair (without being sticky or too oily), don&#x27;t count on it doing anything to prevent fading from sun exposure. In fact, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE INGREDIENT IN THIS PRODUCT THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR HAIR FROM SUN EXPOSURE!  There are plenty of really great hairsprays out there that do protect your hair from the sun.  Just research it and you will find quite a few really well known brands that produce hairsprays that actually contain sunscreen!  I am quite surprised that L&#x27;oreal of all companies (they make many hair color products and hair color protecting products) can be so deceiving with this one.</li>
            <li> Love Elnett. At first I bought a sample size at a beauty supply, it worked great so now I have moved up to the full size. Great  hold with no flakes.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray. Hair stays but not firm when combing out. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Elnett has been around for ages. The reason why: it is a great product. Doesn&#x27;t feel like hair spray, while holding your style perfectly. It does brush out as it says it does so if you are a wash your hair every other day or every few days gal, I highly recommend it. Used by the pros in my modeling days.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my bangs and this works very well. It is the strong hold spray- I love it! Nancy</li>
            <li> Smells like my grandmother&#x27;s hair spray. Not real happy about that. Holds well.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris. Smells good. I buy it very long time.</li>
            <li> SUPERB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most wonderful Hair Spray!  It is a little pricey, but it lasts Forever!  It has superb all-day hold --- Never sticky or flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray and forget it!  Your hair is under &amp;#34;complete control&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susie</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear hairspray, since I just let my hair airdry every day without styling it. But my cousin&#x27;s outdoor wedding is coming up and I wanted to do a test run on my wedding day hairdo. I heard lots of good things about this hairspray, plus I was attracted to the UV protection aspect. I did big, bouncy curls and sprayed all over. I did a quick brush through after 5 minutes to soften the curls and then let it set. Well, my curls lasted through the whole day and through the next. I was very impressed with how my curls held up, even through heat and sweating. By the next day, they were more relaxed and actually looked even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, which is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be the best of help, because as I was looking for &amp;#34;the best hair spray ever&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve noticed many people dislike the Elnett Hairspray scent so much, comparing it to chemical smell and to grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the smell, and so I found myself purchasing good old Elnett.&lt;br /&gt;This is great. It has amazing hold. It&#x27;s great for colored hair, and if you&#x27;re going out in the sun â€” it has a UV filter, how amazing is that?&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not fans of the smell, there&#x27;s this exact thing in scent-free, so look it up here on Amazon and check that one out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elnett never made my hair feel crunchy or gross. It hardens the hair a bit, obviously, since it&#x27;s a hair spray, but a slight finger combing motion would get rid of that in a second, whenever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold stays through the day, the night, whatever. Even if I finger comb through it, the hold stays, it&#x27;s just softer. Awesome!</li>
            <li> She loves the strong hold. Makes her thinning hair look fuller, with the body she desires. Any thing that makes her happy</li>
            <li> The absolute best hairspray, EVER!</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray for hold!</li>
            <li> I really love this hairspray and its a great price here, vs the drug store. It gives my hair a firm hold, but doesn&#x27;t make it hard to the touch.</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to while not leaving clumps and easy to brush out  with hand or comb. STINKS THOUGH. I wish there was an unscented version easily available. The smell is pungent and does not wear off easily.</li>
            <li> Lots of people rave over this hairspray but it&#x27;s not my favorite.It&#x27;s okay but not the best as they advertise. I find it leaves my hair sticky and weighs it down without maintaining the hair style. It also has a strange smell to me. My 12 yr old daughter has very long hair she curls with a spiral wand. This spray also make her hair sticky and the curls fall out shortly after spraying.</li>
            <li> I know this is a runway and model staple but I don&#x27;t like the smell and the bottle is so damn tall it doesn&#x27;t fit into ANY bathroom shelf. I prefer DryBar&#x27;s Money Maker or even Herbal Essences. Those smell heavenly and work just as well.</li>
            <li> I used to be a RUSK WORX Atomizer user until I tried this (once it became available to the public in the States).  Flexible ALL DAY hold or for restyling.  Amps up my thin fine hair without the tacky stiff feel of anything.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> This Hairspray is 16.29 at CVS, so I use my extra bucks to buy it, it lasts about three months, but I love to just spray away and it never feels crusty just like pure AIR.. and it smells heavenly. PLUS it has UV protection and a strong hold for color treated hair!!  CANNOT beat this hairspray, with coupons and extra bucks or thru AMAZON PRIME AWESOME DEAL!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of sprays, and this is definitely my favorite.  The best thing about it is that most of it comes out when I brush my hair.  Not like most other sprays that build up with each use.  Would have given it five stars except for the price.  Does it really cost L&#x27;Oreal three times as much to manufacture this as it does their entry level sprays?  I doubt it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  A little is good hold.  More for great hold.  Brushes out lovely.  I buy 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> LOVE, love, love this hairspray!  When one runs out, I just come and buy another can.  I love the UV protection as well.  It&#x27;s great to have a spray that can be worked through or hold tight, depending on the circumstance.  Some complain about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s a great price and works just as well as other sprays that cost twice as much. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy this one!</li>
            <li> This is unquestionably the best hair spray ever.  I wear my hair long and flowing.  My hair is naturally wavy (not in a good way).  After I flat iron my haor, I spray it with Elnett.  It moves, but it stays in place out of my eyes.  If i comb through it, it goes back where it belongs.  The conditin of my hair has improved since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I have very blonde hair and it gives it a wonderdful sheen.  I&#x27;ve always used professional product on my hair and Elnett is a cut above any other professional spray i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> While I agree that this spray smells nice and holds well, it leaves my hair looking very dry and dull.  I have medium blonde hair and it has no shine whatsoever after using.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite hairspray, and at a great price, what could be better?!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hairspray. Everything at Ulta, and I like this. Flexible, and holds.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Some people don&#x27;t care for the smell, but the hold is natural and fantastic and the smell fades after you&#x27;ve sprayed it.  This product is why my curls stay full and bouncy all day without being crunchy.  I can also get away with only washing my hair every other day--it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dirty on day 2.</li>
            <li> A frequent repurchase for a number of years... good product and price.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- really good hold&lt;br /&gt;- my hair is touchable, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or stiff&lt;br /&gt;- long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- cost is a bit on the high side for a \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; brand&lt;br /&gt;- the smell - seriously, it&#x27;s like old lady perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product, but for me there is one big drawn back - the smell. Usually I don&#x27;t have an issue with how a product smells (and roll my eyes at reviewers who do), as the fragrance either smells nice or is quickly forgotten as it dries. But this one just lingers. Hours after I&#x27;ve sprayed it on I&#x27;ll turn my head and get a big whiff of it. Now let me me clear, it&#x27;s not a horrible, make me want to gag kind of smell - just really not an enjoyable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, would I buy this product again? Performance wise - yes, I&#x27;d use it again. But I&#x27;m going to try a few others before considering repurchasing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairspray, the best.  I have spent a small fortune trying to find a spray I liked, from Aveda to cheap versions like Suave, this spray is a must have!</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite hairspray! It&#x27;s never sticky and doesn&#x27;t flake. Holds the style all day! I buy them in pairs so I never run out.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a nice hold and it&#x27;s true when they say &amp;#34;one brush stroke&amp;#34; to brush it out. It has a nice fragrance that I like. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair as shiny as it says though. I wish it had a longer-lasting effect on holding my curl in, but I still like it enough to buy it again. I love how it sprays. I can really control the amount that I want to use, like short bursts or longer mists.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or hard. You can brush it right out, but it also holds very well. Best smelling hairspray ever!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray and I have tried a LOT of them!  I like it because it provides great hold without giving you &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does not hold my curls.  I have hair that curls easily, and after I spray my hair it gets sicky and hard and then the curls fall out.  My hair remains sticky and then turns into a knot.  I further my quest to find the perfect hairspray.</li>
            <li> Holds well, but it smells like my grandmother</li>
            <li> This would be great hairspray,  but the smell ruins it. It&#x27;s not that it smells that bad,  but it is overpowering and never dissipates. I sprayed a little on one section of hair to try it. I could still smell it when I went to bed. I woke in the night and could smell it. Ridiculous! I threw the can away in the morning and washed my hair. I wish I had paid attention to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps my style of the day strong without looking greasy or preventing movement.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. On time!</li>
            <li> Looks completely natural. Not sticky or heavy; no helmet head; brushes out easily.  My hair is long and pretty thick and this product is strong enough to keep it out of my eyes.  That said, I don&#x27;t care for the smell (which lasts for hours).  My husband doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever!!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try saw on a youtube tutorial it holds well and has good smell. Does NOT. Masterpiece from Bed head holds and smells good. Upset I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> The smell of this hairspray is HORRIBLE. My husband says my hair smells burnt. The hold is fine and it brushes out easily, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a bonfire!</li>
            <li> I gave this 1 star because the smell was so strong to me that I could not get beyond it to enjoy what the product could do. If you do not have an issues with scent you make like this but avoid if you are sensitive to scents in hairspray.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on glowing reviews from not only other Amazon customers, but also from a Real Simple &amp;#34;Top 10 Hairsprays&amp;#34; review--both of which I always trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am more sensitive to smells than others, but this stuff stinks. My hair now smells like Raid Bug Killer! It&#x27;s unfortunate too, because the price is AWESOME, the can is HUGE, and the mist is so fine. The product is as great as the reviewers said, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I think I&#x27;ll try the Moroccan Oil Hairspray -- it costs a whole lot more, but I think its worth it not to smell like Raid.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Leaves your hair soft and touchable,  Does not build up on your hair.  Use the one for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - still pricey - no complaint about service.</li>
            <li> Only hairspray will use &amp; have used them all! Not to wet, not too dry, not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake! The gold standard!</li>
            <li> love this product! great delivery from seller</li>
            <li> Great hold and healthy shine</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how light weight the spray is. It holds well even so.</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product.  Elnett lives up to all the hype about being the best hairspray.  Controls frizz in all weather</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hairspray!!! It does not make your hair feel stiff and it can easily be brushed out to restyle!!! Very good product to help maintain healthy hair. Worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Great hold smells good</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this hairspray. I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap hairspray to super expensive salon brand hairsprays. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. My all time favorite salon brand hairspray has changed it&#x27;s formula and, sadly, the new formula just didn&#x27;t do anything but cost me a lot of money. This Elnett hairspray is just spectacular and has a great hold but not in a stiff way.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the reviews about the smell were exaggerated, but alas they weren&#x27;t. The smell is so strong, that it triggered a migraine( not a joke)  and I only used one quick spray to try it out. I move my head and I leave a vapor trail.( not a joke either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so looking forward to a hair spray that didn&#x27;t bleach the color out in the sun..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make this in an unscented form.</li>
            <li> I started using this hair spray about a year ago  and it&#x27;s just the best. Not too heavy or sticky at all. You truly can brush through it and you can reapply without the feeling of a lot of buildup. It has very good hold for fine hair. Amazon has a good price for it as I know it&#x27;s more at drugstores and even at Target.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  It never clogs, it has the perfect amount of &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; and it smells wonderful!!  I will definitely buy again, in fact, it&#x27;s on my subscribe and save order!!</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana, world capital of heat combined with humidity (or maybe a tie with Houston). My hair is as soft and fine as baby hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to get hold without achieving non-moving helmet head. This stuff holds and holds and your hair can actually still move very naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more accurate word for this is hair fog, not spray. The delivery from the can is a very fine mist that leaves your hair soft and touchable. I can run my fingers through my hair without any resistance, yet it falls right back into place. Attended a recent barbeque and the wind was blowing very hard. My hair took it and looked good nonetheless. The fragrance is light and not unpleasant, although smell is always a matter of personal preference. Why else would there be hundreds of perfumes??? There is an unscented version, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the product of a lifetime in this hairspray and recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> i am n not a \\&quot;verified purchaser\\&quot; of this product from amazon.  my review is on the product of old because i have a phobia against paying $14.00 for a can of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used l&#x27;oreal paris hairspray all through the end of the 60&#x27;s, through the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s and it disappeared from every drugstore in the five boros of new york in the very early 90&#x27;s.  this stuff was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am african american with (use to have) great hair, very stylish with the flips of those years and used those wire curlers with the pink stickers to curl my hair.  i had \\&quot;gerry\\&quot; curls, hair straightners, blow drying, every black/brown color that clairol had to offer and what held it all together was l&#x27;oreal hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no afros or braids for me.  just the swinging styles of \\&quot;charlie angels\\&quot; and i was set to go.  using the black or blue/black hair dye, it didn&#x27;t flake; my hair was very touchable; held up on misty mornings going to work and kept you looking good at the disco later that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what more could you ask for?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the packaging is still the same as i remember but is the formula the same.  i am now gray and dying my hair brown.  i use aqua net hair spray now and very little of that.  the superhold is very superhold and must be washed out and not just combed or brushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would like to try this 11 oz can of l&#x27;oreal but seniors do not pay $14.00 for hairspray.  my birthday is coming up sooooooooooo!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would really like to hear from someone who tried it 30 -40 years ago and have purchased this product now.  is it still the same formula?  you might not have&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;black\\&quot; hair but if a product works, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if it is the same, there are miracles and i would surely give it a try.  it was an excellent product back then.  don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued but glad to see it back and where would we find it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on amazon, of course!!!</li>
            <li> love this hairspray - you can comb through it - feels like no sticky residue</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray because it actually holds my braid and surrounding hair in place all day.  It also is great because it disappears when you brush your hair.  Since my hair is long I must be very careful what products I use on it to keep it from breaking or getting too much residue on it.  I like the smell and that it also has UV protection for my blond colored hair which tends to change colors in the sun.</li>
            <li> the smell is awful !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this spray specifically to use when setting my hair in heat rollers. It worked great for that purpose.  It kept the curls in longer and soft enough that i could still run my fingers through my hair. I also use it after applying gel to my hair for that extra texture.  It helps create great wonderful waves.  And it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> dont understand why everyone is so excited about this overpriced hair spray. Works just like any other you can get for $1.99</li>
            <li> I left review for Elnett hairspray under &amp;#34;Elnett unscented hairspray&amp;#34;  Pretty much same hairspray but the smell of this spray is so overpowering that it ruins the entire hairspray..  Superstrong fragrance that reeks!  Please read other review to know about hairspray.  Thanks..  :)</li>
            <li> While this product is hard to find in many stores it is worth asking them to stock it. It is hands down the best hairspray I have ever used. It also comes in a handy travel size that easily fits in a purse. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Does not hold well at all</li>
            <li> This hairspray does not seem to have a strong hold on hair and I have to keep reapplying it throughout the day. I also do not care for the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I used this and thought, &amp;#34;Wow.  No tackiness.  No stiffness.  It looks and feels great!&amp;#34;  And it did.....for about an hour.  Next time I walked by a mirror I was shocked.  Looked like I had washed my hair, put on lots of conditioner, and let it dry with no styling or styling product. TOTALLY FLAT.  What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible - look elsewhere unless you like to stink all day.</li>
            <li> It holds fine, but it stinks and the smell lasts all day.  I even had people making comments about something smelling like their grandmother&#x27;s hairspray and we are all in our 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I purchased it after seeing it reviewed on the Today Show as the hairspray their stylists use and the stars love. It is supposed to be a very nice flexible hold but unfortunately I cannot get past the terrible smell. It reminds me of the old Aquanet hairspray from the 80&#x27;s. No it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky but it has a chemical hairspray smell that lingers all day. I just don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap hairspray.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  Holds hair and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST hairspray. I used to be anti-hairspray. I don&#x27;t like a crunchy look and I&#x27;ve got curly hair. A spray of this keeps the humidity at bay and gives a bit more volume and helps my hair stay looking good all day. I keep a small version in my purse if I need a touch-up later in the day. Lasts forever too - it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> This really does disappear with the stroke of a brush as the advert says.  It does not dull your hair but it is firm enough to use it to sculpt your style and keep your hair looking respectable on windy days.  It is not cheap and I have tried so many other brands to see if I could find a substitute.  Forget it!  This is the only hairspray worth buying in my estimation.</li>
            <li> The hold seems good on this hairspray.  Just used it for the first time this morning.  However I cannot get past the scent.  Reminds me of, unfortunately, Raid ant spray.  I will be giving it away to coworkers.  I normally use TGIF Masterpiece, and love the scent + hold.  With that product, I only get 9.5 ounces.  I wanted to try this L&#x27;Oreal product because it is more product for the same price.  Not worth it if I can&#x27;t handle the scent.  :-(</li>
            <li> I was happy to find a hair spray that you can use on dyed hair and protect it from uv rays</li>
