            <li>and I go through it so quickly!</li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have always liked CND lotions because I have VERY sensitive skin and am allergic the shea butter</li>
            <li>It was very silky and smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>this one just smells like a cheap imitation and very strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure CND is the only scented lotion I&#x27;ve had no issues with!</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles and will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>On a cold winter day its a great pick-me-up because it smells just like sun lotion and reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It will be wonderful to take away the depressing winter blues we can get here in Ohio.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent from CND - make me feel like I&#x27;ve spent a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I also wish they didn&#x27;t make this just a limited release, but that&#x27;s what they seem to do because my other favorite (fig) is not being made anymore either!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft and supple without having that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Wish CND has this particular scent in a larger size bottle.  </li>
            <li>It not only bathes your body in luxurious scent, but it leaves it feeling silky &amp; smooth, and not the least too heavy or sticky in the summer when you can really perspire</li>

            <li> so I usually can&#x27;t use scented lotions.</li>
            <li> It invokes all those luscious scents and your memories of past fave beach spots!  </li>
            <li> Not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed, but please leave some left for me!!</li>

            <li> love love love the smell</li>
            <li> Did not care for the smell. While I like the smell of suntan lotion this one just smells like a cheap imitation and very strong. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is silky like all the CND lotions</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!  Smells like summer, feels great on skin...  Wanna feel like summer?  Well then this is what your looking for!.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful cream. My salon I go to uses this and it is fantastic. If you love the beach scent you will love this cream!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish they made this is the larger salon size because it smells so awesome and I go through it so quickly! I have always liked CND lotions because I have VERY sensitive skin and am allergic the shea butter so I usually can&#x27;t use scented lotions. I&#x27;m pretty sure CND is the only scented lotion I&#x27;ve had no issues with! On a cold winter day its a great pick-me-up because it smells just like sun lotion and reminds me of the beach! I also wish they didn&#x27;t make this just a limited release, but that&#x27;s what they seem to do because my other favorite (fig) is not being made anymore either!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells beachy like suntan lotion!</li>
            <li> My favorite CND lotion they have made.  Makes you smell like the beach.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of sunscreen this lotion is a must have!</li>
            <li> Went to a spa and this was a sample to use. It smells so wonderful. I bought 3 bottles and will definitely be getting more. It makes your skin very soft and supple without having that greasy feeling.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had tried to purchase this from the salon I go to weekly for my nails.  They could not see the wisdom in ordering this CND product, so I had to look elsewhere.  The fragrance is just like having spent a day at the beach.  It invokes all those luscious scents and your memories of past fave beach spots!  CND makes some of the best lotions.  It not only bathes your body in luxurious scent, but it leaves it feeling silky &amp; smooth, and not the least too heavy or sticky in the summer when you can really perspire and then the lotion slides off--doesn&#x27;t happen with this.  You will not be disappointed, but please leave some left for me!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell that stays with you all day. smells like summer</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and you cannot find it any longer.  If I had to describe the scent, I&#x27;d say it smells just like the beach.  To me, it reminds me of Yankee Candle&#x27;s Surf and Sand scent.  the coverage is nice too. Not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Items arrived quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like you&#x27;ve just stepped off the beach. It was very silky and smooth, not greasy at all. It will be wonderful to take away the depressing winter blues we can get here in Ohio. But for now I plan on enjoying it all summer!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and the scent is clean</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Wish CND has this particular scent in a larger size bottle.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and smells great!</li>
            <li> CND has some great lotions and this one is one that is in my top favorite.  Scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from CND - make me feel like I&#x27;ve spent a day at the beach.</li>
