            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Most creams are specialized for women, so I didn’t anticipate much.</li>
            <li>This cream is known to help improve overall skin health, protect skin from environmental damage, lighten age spots, retain moisture balance, reduce redness &amp; sun spots, improve skin texture, and much more!</li>
            <li>but, hopefully, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I am always looking for better skin care products that will leave my skin looking fresh, young, and radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a non greasy formula that is easily absorbed into the skin and with added vitamin c it boosts collagen and reduces pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Now I will buy my own as my roommate is getting enough of me borrowing her creams!</li>
            <li>I have quite a few other Anaiti products too, so I make sure to use them all together for the best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t gone yet, but definitely fading, and I&#x27;m super excited to see what the results are after using it for a  longer period!</li>
            <li>Not only did I believe the face cream to begin working on my skin, but it was so simple to use and smelled great.</li>

            <li>Unfortunately, no change at all.</li>

            <li>The first time I used it, my skin felt much smoother.</li>
            <li>Although I have not seen any immediate results on dark spot, it is a really nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>After just 10 days use, I noticed that my skin began to look more vibrant and had a youthful, younger look.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the wrinkle part because I am lucky to say that I do not have any wrinkles so far.  </li>
            <li>jar makes it easy to scoop out just enough</li>
            <li>Time will tell about the dark spots, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Most products take months to see the results I saw after a single day.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I first discovered it from different review on this product.</li>
            <li>but it seems to really work.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t go out now without getting comments about how my skin looks brighter and how young I look, which really annoys the wife.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have really fair skin, and I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I spent a lot of time outside without enough sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Good old soap and water has always been standard but after being nagged by the wife to get dragged into the 21st century I finally relented to buying my first facial product.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to the fact that it was a single cream that could do all the things my medicine cabinet full of products were supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Luminous Cream is made with all natural ingredients like Renovage which can reduce pigmentation of the skin, Matrixyl that boosts collagen production for improved skin elasticity!</li>

            <li>While it may seem a bit young to be looking for an anti-aging regime, I was looking for something that would improve the quality of my skin in the long run.</li>

            <li> concerns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>

            <li> skin is instantly hydrated, softer, smoother, and more</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no change at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not always good about putting sunscreen on, and a few months ago</li>

            <li> I have really fair skin, and I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I spent a lot of time outside without enough sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good old soap and water has always been standard but after being nagged by the wife to get dragged into the 21st century I finally relented to buying my first facial product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e495e2aac5f29102473d05b8d6015f14]]I bought this cream in October and I have been using it religiously since. I wanted a good cream with a High level of Vitamin C.  This one fit the bill, and my budget, well. It goes on smooth and smells great and the results have been nothing short of wonderful! My skin feels and looks better, from neckline to hairline.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This product exceeds expectations.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I hope that it will be available at a Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s near me soon.</li>
            <li> Great cream that is keeping my skin looking young! It has a very subtle lovely smell which I appreciate because I don&#x27;t like highly scented creams. This works well and is filling in the bit of wrinkles I have.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:32dbad7b460b099b5ca82b6213eae261]] I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s,I live in Hawaii and am in the sun almost everyday... I&#x27;m not always good about putting sunscreen on, and a few months ago I started noticing some dark spots appearing on my cheek bones.  Then not too long ago I even had someone make a comment about it *gasp*.  That was the last straw so I bought the Anaiti Luminous Cream.  I&#x27;m so glad too--I&#x27;m seeing results!  They aren&#x27;t gone yet, but definitely fading, and I&#x27;m super excited to see what the results are after using it for a  longer period!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It really helped the acne scars fade within just a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin naturally has lots of dark spots. I tried many things but, unfortunately, nothing helped or if it did then not for long. I got this product as a present from a friend. I don’t know what is inside but it seems to really work. The spots got lighter and my skin feels fresher in general. A bit upset about the price but, hopefully, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for a week – let’s see what happens in another week. Very happy so far</li>
            <li> I waited a while before I post my comment because wanted to see if this cream would  work. I&#x27;ve  been using this cream for 2 weeks now and it does not work for me. I thought you pay for what you get,  I guess not I&#x27;m still searching ...... If I see any changes in another week or so I will remove my comment</li>
            <li> I am always looking for better skin care products that will leave my skin looking fresh, young, and radiant. As I age, spots begin to form and winkles begin to show. I want something that will absolutely luminate my skin and help me to look young again. I decided to try Anaiti’s Luminous Face Cream to see how well it would work for me, and if this is the product I can continue to use. After just 10 days use, I noticed that my skin began to look more vibrant and had a youthful, younger look. I have developed some darks spots, and by using this cream, I noticed the dark spots began to fade. Not completely, but then again, I had only been using the cream for 10 days. I truly believe that longer use will completely reduce the dark spots. Not only did I believe the face cream to begin working on my skin, but it was so simple to use and smelled great. It has a slight citrus scent, which left my face feeling soft and fresh. I applied the cream 2 times a day for the best benefit. The cream is made with anti-aging ingredients to include Vitamin C and Vitamin B3. These two vitamins are great for your skin and really starts reversing the aging process and environmental damage that often occurs. There are also several other products offered by Anaiti that after using this one product, I may be looking into other Anaiti products as well. I am convinced that if this Luminous Face Cream works, then their serums and other creams will work as well. Note: I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:302b1617bc6c2eff883a12cf5cc9344e]]As a fifty something old gentleman I am of the old school where lotions and potions are concerned. Good old soap and water has always been standard but after being nagged by the wife to get dragged into the 21st century I finally relented to buying my first facial product. I am totally amazed how this luminous face cream has not only cleared my skin from any dark spots but has also made my face feel alive and fresh. I am also sure some of the in grained wrinkles I had are dissipating.  My skin is so soft instead of course and rugged. It&#x27;s a non greasy formula that is easily absorbed into the skin and with added vitamin c it boosts collagen and reduces pigmentation. Because it&#x27;s an anti ageing dermatological product it has the ability to even the skin tone. I can&#x27;t go out now without getting comments about how my skin looks brighter and how young I look, which really annoys the wife. She also uses it now because it has natural ingredients so it&#x27;s a great under make up primer. All in all myself AND my wife think it&#x27;s a fantastic product and I know we will use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, absorbs well without greasy film.  Time will tell about the dark spots, but so far so good.  Lovely orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received a free sample for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I dot&#x27;t see any different yet.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I hate the wrinkles I&#x27;m getting and I don&#x27;t like how tight and dry my skin feels. Anaiti&#x27;s Luminous Skin Cream was the perfect solution. It&#x27;s light, smells pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave my face all shiny and wet-feeling. I know most people probably use it in the morning, but I put it on at night. It feels great going on, and I can see and feel the difference almost right away. Now I will buy my own as my roommate is getting enough of me borrowing her creams!</li>
            <li> I love this Luminous Face Cream because it effectively gets rid of the dark spots or pigmentation left behind by periodic breakouts, exposure to the sun and hormonal imbalances. You would think that by my mid-thirties, I would be spared from zits but this is so not the case! This formula works for my sensitive skin. There are products that I used in the past that aggravates the problem instead of fixing it - leaving me with dark pigmentations, skin as red as a lobster and a few more zits. This is not the case with Anaiti&#x27;s Luminous Face Cream! I have been using it for quite some time now and I never experienced any breakouts or rashes from it. It has significantly diminished my dark spots, pimple marks/scars and hormone induced pigmentation that I get periodically. I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin like myself, who have the same skin concerns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:eb4be3521d764ecfc76612972b18d026]]My skin type is prone to age spots. I have been told by my dermatologist to be careful and I have been but I am noticing more and more of them. I decided to use Anaiti&#x27;s New Dark Spot Corrector and I love it! Even as a guy! I made this video to show you!</li>
            <li> This cream is truly one of a kind. I’ve seen a vast improvement in the quality of my skin. The first time I used it, my skin felt much smoother. Everyone says that I glow. As a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age,&amp;#34;, this was a great compliment. The thing I love most about it is that I don’t have to use many different products. Everything I need is in the same jar. It’s continually helping my skin, but also moisturizing and protecting it. I have very dry and easily damaged skin, so having a moisturizer and protector all in one product has been great.</li>
            <li> Initially, I had my doubts about this cream. I have tried numerous anti-aging creams. I’m a fairly young woman in my late twenties. While it may seem a bit young to be looking for an anti-aging regime, I was looking for something that would improve the quality of my skin in the long run. I want to have healthy mature skin, so I decided to start a great skin routine early. I have gone through numerous different creams and serums. Majority of them have given me no results. I have a few spots and harsh lines around my eyes. I figured that the product that showed results in those areas would be the best product for long-term results. I ended up trying multiple products, making my skin care routine very lengthy. I came across this product and decided to give it a try. I was drawn to the fact that it was a single cream that could do all the things my medicine cabinet full of products were supposed to do. I haven’t looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been happier with a product. My skin felt so great after just the first use. I was so shocked to see that my skin was softer and brighter. Most products take months to see the results I saw after a single day. I continued to use it and saw amazing results. My skin feels as if I were 18 again. It’s smooth and glowing. I get compliments all of the time. The sunspots have faded quite a bit and the lines have softened. I have no doubt in my mind that it will help me age gracefully.</li>
            <li> The Dark Spot Corrector – Luminous Face Cream By Anaiti arrived safely and was well packaged in a box as scheduled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great idea! Three in one cream where it combines anti-wrinkle cream, skin brightener, and moisturizer. You just have to use one jar. This saves me SO much time and storage space on my self and space when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This luminous face cream has a thick texture and has a light orange scent. You know the dry feeling you had after washing your face, and some moisturizer leave you feeling the same after you put it on?  This luminous face cream does not do that, it actually leave your face feeling soft and hydrated.  The directions were easy to follow, it suggested to apply it twice a day after cleansing and apply a thin layer until it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is cruelty free, non toxic and paraben-free.  So far, I really like this as a moisturizer.  Although I have not seen any immediate results on dark spot, it is a really nice moisturizer.  I cannot comment on the wrinkle part because I am lucky to say that I do not have any wrinkles so far.  I think applying this after you wash your face with warm water will give you a better and faster result because your pores are open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no questions ask money back guarantee, I rate this 5 out of 5 Stars.  I originally received the wrong item, and they sent me the correct one right away. I am very please with the customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

            <li> I bought this because I am noticing more and more age spots on my face. Approaching 45 is a scary thing and I want to do all I can to protect the skin I have. Its too early to see any change on the discolorations but I did notice right away how easy this is applied. It goes on so smooth and this little bottle should last a while. I&#x27;ve used other face products that are so hard to rub in it seem like I&#x27;m causing more wrinkles just by applying them! I can definitely feel the difference in the texture of my skin already and looking forward to lightening the age spots. Thanks for a great product with excellent ingredients!</li>
            <li> I have just use it for 3 days now. Have not noticed any differences yet. Will come back and review it after two weeks or so.  I was excited when I first discovered it from different review on this product. Have used it for more than 4 weeks now. No different. Unfortunately, no change at all. 11/2/15</li>
            <li> Anaiti sent me their Lumious Face Cream free to try out and I have to say, I&#x27;m liking it so far! It has a fresh clean sent, absorbs easily into my skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been taking skin care much more seriously as I&#x27;m inching closer to 30. Using this cream I can see a difference in the texture and the brightness of my skin. I feel confident that this cream will meet all expectations. I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week and I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic difference in any dark spots but I have in the smoothness of my face. I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing to use this and see all the results come to life! I&#x27;m glad that the scent is light and not over powering as I cannot stand strong odors. It just smells clean.</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin, and I&#x27;m ashamed to say that I spent a lot of time outside without enough sunscreen. Now I&#x27;m paying the price with skin that&#x27;s red in spots and darkish in others with grayish undertones all over. I started using Luminous Face Cream daily a few months ago, and I could see a difference in my skin tone right away. As I keep using it, most of my discolored spots have evened out, my skin feels brighter and it looks less stressed and wrinkled. This cream is like dermatologist skin care without the co-pay!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results I have seen after using this cream. I am a man in my early thirties that continuously works outside. Years of working in the sun started taking a toll on my skin. I started noticing a number of sunspots forming on my face. My wife had gotten a recommendation from a friend to use this cream. I was a bit skeptical at first. Most creams are specialized for women, so I didn’t anticipate much. Boy was I wrong! I’ve been using it for months now and have noticed a significant change in the problems I had. The spots have brightened up quite a bit. Not only that, but I’ve noticed an improvement in some fine lines I had around my eyes. I wasn&#x27;t looking for an anti-wrinkle cream, so it was a great surprise. I’m so happy with my results. I’m excited to see what other results I get as I continue to use it.</li>
