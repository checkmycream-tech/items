            <li>They also do a great job on my neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that the Wahl Echo does trim at a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level, which comes out to 1/64&amp;#34; or 0.4mm.</li>

            <li>Best part is that it gets super close!</li>
            <li>I bought these trimmers because a friend of mine had them and I loved using hers.</li>
            <li>Good</li>

            <li>Love the freedom of no cord!</li>
            <li>Although it is made of plastic it feels sturdy and has a nice heft to it</li>
            <li>They really are superb.</li>
            <li>The charging stand is handy and keeps the trimmer charged at all times.</li>
            <li>Great product, very powerful and makes greats beard shapes and outlines, makes almost no noise and is very light.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s kind of growing on me.    </li>
            <li>Love these trimmers absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>I would go as far as to say its the best trim I have ever had from a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>And they are still going strong!</li>
            <li>My Fiance loved it, provides a clean shave and he got rave reviews about this brand from the girls that cut his hair -</li>
            <li>Great purchase, makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Echo is very light weight at an even 4oz, which is about 1/3 the weight of the Headliner.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and what appears to be great battery life.</li>
            <li>I love it quite and it cut well.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the hair many times and just couldn&#x27;t get through thicker neck and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li>FYI, the Echo&#x27;s power adapter measures at 4.5v DC, whereas most USB power adapters (for phones and tablets and iPods) output 5v DC.</li>

            <li>Most noticeable was the battery life.</li>
            <li>I have owned many trimmers in my life and they have all seen a lot of use.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They are very lightweight and feel great in your hand.</li>
            <li>Never had a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love these trimmers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile now and use them very often holds a charge and cuts great.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I dont have to worry about the cord getting tangled.</li>
            <li>My search continues :).</li>
            <li>20 or 30 bucks more</li>
            <li>But they have a close cut and are light!</li>
            <li>I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I will update when it dies but for now, 4 stars, would have given it five if the accessories had been better.</li>
            <li>I was torn between these and Oster t finisher, glad I chose these.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Great companion to the Classic 76.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice clean line without any pinching or cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how detailed you can get with them.</li>
            <li>Make sure you oil the blade once in a while, keeps the blade running smoothly and prevents from pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>This also makes it easy to replace the blades if needed.    </li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Product is designed well and battery life is strong.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would be good quality and last a while, so I looked up what kind of trimmers barbers use.</li>
            <li>blades are easy to clean  blades are easy to replace    Cons:  </li>
            <li>I am a 10 yr stylist and love them well worth the money</li>
            <li>Advanced Tip</li>
            <li>another great thing  is they are so quiet, it doesnt even seem like they are on!!</li>
            <li>It seems to fit the hand well.    </li>
            <li>Great close cut, but would bite the skin occasionally.</li>
            <li>Nice and ckean cut and very close</li>
            <li>When trimming eyebrows with a clipper over comb technique, they are quite and a comfortable weight.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My haircuts had been getting shorter and shorter over the years thanks to my DNA  :)  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love my trimmers very close to skin</li>
            <li>Luckily you can get just about anything</li>
            <li>the top popped back on and worked liked new!!</li>
            <li>the smallest cutting guide worked perfect as I want somewhere in between stubble and a beard, but I think that the 4 that are included would fit most people&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>the smallest cutting guide worked perfect as I want somewhere in between stubble and a beard, but I think that the 4 that are included would fit most people&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small in size but packs a powerful punch, fits very nicely in your hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I think there are equally good products available for $40 or less.</li>
            <li>They get close to the skin, fit great in the hand, and they are extra quiet (which helps with nervous kids).</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at this, as it cuts through hair better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silent light weight and cuts very clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone right now...if my opinion changes then I will change my post...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s silent, which had me concerned when I first got it, but it has proven to be an amazing addition to my arsenal.</li>
            <li>I previously had the mag trimmers which cut perfectly but the internal battery eventually was no longer chargeable in about a years time.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze, the blade can be taken off with out a screw driver and the entire assembly cleaned easily.</li>
            <li>so I recently purchased a set of Oster Classic 76 clippers to do my own shave jobs.</li>
            <li>I have had good experiences with Wahl before, and many reviewers love this trimmer, so perhaps mine was a fluke, but in years of using clippers and trimmers, I have never before had one that was as bad as this one.</li>
            <li>Most consumer trimmers can only achieve a 1/12&amp;#34; or 2mm trim length, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that wahl finally has trimmers and clippers that have the lithium battery and can be used corded when battery drains.  </li>
            <li>I called Wahl to make sure they were the same.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not as happy with is, as expected,  these trimmers are not quite as powerful as the corded trimmers I am used to.</li>
            <li>Its very compact, very sharp and looks and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>I damaged the first two, by one too many drops on a hard floor, most times the head pops off, sometimes they break</li>
            <li>All of my coworkers have these and we wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
            <li>Also, the motor and other internals are fully encased when you take off the blade which is nice.</li>
            <li>After receiving item,  and charging for the first time, cut the hair of 4 of my crew members.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper started strong and kept working the entire time.  </li>
            <li>Most other brands sound like major damage is about to occur, but not with this clipper.</li>
            <li>this red one was supposed to make it more fun for me, but it barely cuts at all, and it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li>It works great, but I needed a trimmer to use while traveling in the US and abroad, and the Headliner is a heavy beast in my backpack, and as a corded model it only runs on 120v 60hz.</li>
            <li>I do roughly 50-60 mens cuts a week and have tried many trimmers.</li>
            <li>See my advanced tip below for a method of recharging the Echo via any standard USB charger, which would allow you to charge the Echo in any country.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another cable you could use is the one for the Sony PSP or the Sony Reader, though its DC connector is 4mm, so it would only fit the Echo&#x27;s charging stand.</li>

            <li>Cuts evenly and very closely.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very quite.</li>

            <li>I really like the size of it.</li>

            <li>They are also very durable.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>This trimmer makes things so much easier when doing cuts on children.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful, quiet (for trimmers),</li>
            <li>Some other differences are that the Echo runs very cool, whereas the Headliner can get uncomfortably hot with extended use.</li>

            <li>One example of such a cable is the one that&#x27;s used for powering a GameBoy Classic DMG, and this cable would fit both the trimmer and the charging stand.</li>

            <li>The customer is put at ease by the low noise level of this trimmer, specially when using them around a person&#x27;s eyes and face.</li>
            <li>This one is small and cuts nice over the ears.</li>
            <li>After looking at and buying and returning a number of different consumer models from my local big-box stores, I realized that what most manufacturers call a &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; is not what I would call it.</li>
            <li>High quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I still used corded trimmers for high and tights.</li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer</li>
            <li>So you can&#x27;t fine tune the length as you might with other options.</li>
            <li>The only important difference in trim quality between the two is that the Echo needs a slow hand to achieve a smooth trim -- if you go too fast it will pull on the hairs and nip at you.</li>
            <li>As far as I can see, it&#x27;s the exact same trimmer but in stainless steel and</li>
            <li>So quiet, very close cut, and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Crazy long battery life, clean cut, light in hand, and a great value compared to other Li-Ion trimmers.</li>
            <li>But I also wanted a small, cordless clipper of better quality than what I could get at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>On top of all that it&#x27;s so small that you can carry it in your shirt pocket - see pictures.</li>
            <li>The Echo has a smaller trim head, and this makes it more agile in difficult areas.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not a perfect product but pretty darn nice.</li>
            <li>The first was dropped in the toilet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advanced Tip:&lt;br /&gt;I found that I could use certain USB cable adapters to charge the Echo via a standard USB power adapter, or even via my laptop.</li>
            <li>: I found that I could use certain USB cable adapters to charge the Echo via a standard USB power adapter, or even via my laptop.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d have a hard time finding a better cordless trimmer at this price (or any price, for that matter).</li>
            <li>This item is not made for professional barbers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely quiet and Worked very well for work.</li>
            <li>no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I am a professional in the industry for 13 yrs and specialize in men&#x27;s cuts.</li>
            <li>You can also plug the power adapter directly into the trimmer, thus bypassing the charging stand if you don&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li>You can also plug the power adapter directly into the trimmer, thus bypassing the charging stand if you don&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li>Not for soft sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a month but gave it 4 stars because I really don&#x27;t see the value in it for the $60.  </li>
            <li>but it has worked well so far</li>
            <li>The cat used to run away when he&#x27;d turn on his old trimmer, now the cat stays in the bathroom with him.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but isn&#x27;t really heavy either.</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>transformer (plugs in to stand or directly in to the trimmer itself)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have professional Hair Dressers in my family and they advised this was the one to get.</li>
            <li>Professional hair stylist here.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 star - is b/c for whatever reason the charging plug doesn&#x27;t hold very well in the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well and it extremely quiet.</li>
            <li>Super long charge time as well...will last all day, never losing any power!</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my beard, is small, lightweight, and has a lithium ion battery so it should last a little longer than the old Nicad/NiMH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and motor is powerful.</li>
            <li>They are exactly the same just a different color.</li>
            <li>After going through several of the cheaper Wahl trimmers in the last year this one seems to be of much higher quality.</li>
            <li>All of the Wahl products that are made in the USA are really high quality (like this one), I bought a Wahl kit at Sam&#x27;s club and it was made in China and not the same quality at all.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is very compact, well made and holds the charge a long time.</li>
            <li>Be careful where you use it ;D</li>
            <li>The blades shave very close and have enough power that only one or two passes are required (thus reducing irritation.)</li>
            <li>My last beard trimmer (a Pillips/Norelco) didn&#x27;t work very well and had a part break on it shortly after I got it.</li>
            <li>Small trimmer (smaller than I thought it would be)  allows me to cut neatly and easily around their ears and to trim their neckline.  </li>
            <li>I dropped these on a very hard ceramic floor and the top blade flew off.</li>
            <li>Wahl seems to be the big brand for professional trimmers.</li>
            <li>but their professional line isn&#x27;t sold in stores that the public can shop in as a rule.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, but it hasn&#x27;t been used long enough to determine how long the charge will actually last (Wahl says it will last for 2 continuous hours).</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will live up to Wahl&#x27;s reputation and last a long time to come.he clipper oil and cleaning brush)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will live up to Wahl&#x27;s reputation and last a long time to come.</li>
            <li>All the other trimmers we&#x27;ve had have died far too early.</li>
            <li>really any serious cons, but the casing does look a little cheap.</li>
            <li>They seem a little cheap and don&#x27;t click on as firmly as previous models.</li>
            <li>little large for trimming around the mouth</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that the Wahl Echo does trim at a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level, which comes out to 1/64&amp;#34; or 0.4mm.</li>

            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased on how it cuts.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Love the freedom of no cord!</li>
            <li> Although it is made of plastic it feels sturdy and has a nice heft to it</li>
            <li> They really are superb.</li>
            <li> The charging stand is handy and keeps the trimmer charged at all times.</li>
            <li> Great product, very powerful and makes greats beard shapes and outlines, makes almost no noise and is very light.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s kind of growing on me.    </li>
            <li> Love these trimmers absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> I would go as far as to say its the best trim I have ever had from a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> And they are still going strong!</li>
            <li> My Fiance loved it, provides a clean shave and he got rave reviews about this brand from the girls that cut his hair -</li>
            <li> Great purchase, makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Echo is very light weight at an even 4oz, which is about 1/3 the weight of the Headliner.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and what appears to be great battery life.</li>
            <li> I love it quite and it cut well.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the hair many times and just couldn&#x27;t get through thicker neck and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> FYI, the Echo&#x27;s power adapter measures at 4.5v DC, whereas most USB power adapters (for phones and tablets and iPods) output 5v DC.</li>

            <li> Most noticeable was the battery life.</li>
            <li> I have owned many trimmers in my life and they have all seen a lot of use.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They are very lightweight and feel great in your hand.</li>
            <li> Never had a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love these trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile now and use them very often holds a charge and cuts great.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I dont have to worry about the cord getting tangled.</li>
            <li> My search continues :).</li>
            <li> 20 or 30 bucks more</li>
            <li> But they have a close cut and are light!</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I will update when it dies but for now, 4 stars, would have given it five if the accessories had been better.</li>
            <li> I was torn between these and Oster t finisher, glad I chose these.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Great companion to the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice clean line without any pinching or cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how detailed you can get with them.</li>
            <li> Make sure you oil the blade once in a while, keeps the blade running smoothly and prevents from pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This also makes it easy to replace the blades if needed.    </li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Product is designed well and battery life is strong.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would be good quality and last a while, so I looked up what kind of trimmers barbers use.</li>
            <li> blades are easy to clean  blades are easy to replace    Cons:  </li>
            <li> I am a 10 yr stylist and love them well worth the money</li>
            <li> Advanced Tip</li>
            <li> another great thing  is they are so quiet, it doesnt even seem like they are on!!</li>
            <li> It seems to fit the hand well.    </li>
            <li> Great close cut, but would bite the skin occasionally.</li>
            <li> Nice and ckean cut and very close</li>
            <li> When trimming eyebrows with a clipper over comb technique, they are quite and a comfortable weight.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My haircuts had been getting shorter and shorter over the years thanks to my DNA  :)  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love my trimmers very close to skin</li>
            <li> Luckily you can get just about anything</li>
            <li> the top popped back on and worked liked new!!</li>
            <li> the smallest cutting guide worked perfect as I want somewhere in between stubble and a beard, but I think that the 4 that are included would fit most people&#x27;s needs.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s small in size but packs a powerful punch, fits very nicely in your hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I think there are equally good products available for $40 or less.</li>
            <li> They get close to the skin, fit great in the hand, and they are extra quiet (which helps with nervous kids).</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at this, as it cuts through hair better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silent light weight and cuts very clean.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone right now...if my opinion changes then I will change my post...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s silent, which had me concerned when I first got it, but it has proven to be an amazing addition to my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I previously had the mag trimmers which cut perfectly but the internal battery eventually was no longer chargeable in about a years time.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze, the blade can be taken off with out a screw driver and the entire assembly cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> so I recently purchased a set of Oster Classic 76 clippers to do my own shave jobs.</li>
            <li> I have had good experiences with Wahl before, and many reviewers love this trimmer, so perhaps mine was a fluke, but in years of using clippers and trimmers, I have never before had one that was as bad as this one.</li>
            <li> Most consumer trimmers can only achieve a 1/12&amp;#34; or 2mm trim length, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that wahl finally has trimmers and clippers that have the lithium battery and can be used corded when battery drains.  </li>
            <li> I called Wahl to make sure they were the same.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not as happy with is, as expected,  these trimmers are not quite as powerful as the corded trimmers I am used to.</li>
            <li> Its very compact, very sharp and looks and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> I damaged the first two, by one too many drops on a hard floor, most times the head pops off, sometimes they break</li>
            <li> All of my coworkers have these and we wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
            <li> Also, the motor and other internals are fully encased when you take off the blade which is nice.</li>
            <li> After receiving item,  and charging for the first time, cut the hair of 4 of my crew members.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper started strong and kept working the entire time.  </li>
            <li> Most other brands sound like major damage is about to occur, but not with this clipper.</li>
            <li> this red one was supposed to make it more fun for me, but it barely cuts at all, and it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> It works great, but I needed a trimmer to use while traveling in the US and abroad, and the Headliner is a heavy beast in my backpack, and as a corded model it only runs on 120v 60hz.</li>
            <li> I do roughly 50-60 mens cuts a week and have tried many trimmers.</li>
            <li> See my advanced tip below for a method of recharging the Echo via any standard USB charger, which would allow you to charge the Echo in any country.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another cable you could use is the one for the Sony PSP or the Sony Reader, though its DC connector is 4mm, so it would only fit the Echo&#x27;s charging stand.</li>

            <li> They are also very durable.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes things so much easier when doing cuts on children.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful, quiet (for trimmers),</li>
            <li> Some other differences are that the Echo runs very cool, whereas the Headliner can get uncomfortably hot with extended use.</li>

            <li> One example of such a cable is the one that&#x27;s used for powering a GameBoy Classic DMG, and this cable would fit both the trimmer and the charging stand.</li>

            <li> The customer is put at ease by the low noise level of this trimmer, specially when using them around a person&#x27;s eyes and face.</li>
            <li> This one is small and cuts nice over the ears.</li>
            <li> After looking at and buying and returning a number of different consumer models from my local big-box stores, I realized that what most manufacturers call a &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; is not what I would call it.</li>
            <li> High quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I still used corded trimmers for high and tights.</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer</li>
            <li> So you can&#x27;t fine tune the length as you might with other options.</li>
            <li> The only important difference in trim quality between the two is that the Echo needs a slow hand to achieve a smooth trim -- if you go too fast it will pull on the hairs and nip at you.</li>
            <li> As far as I can see, it&#x27;s the exact same trimmer but in stainless steel and</li>
            <li> So quiet, very close cut, and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Crazy long battery life, clean cut, light in hand, and a great value compared to other Li-Ion trimmers.</li>
            <li> But I also wanted a small, cordless clipper of better quality than what I could get at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> On top of all that it&#x27;s so small that you can carry it in your shirt pocket - see pictures.</li>
            <li> The Echo has a smaller trim head, and this makes it more agile in difficult areas.</li>

            <li> I am a professional in the industry for 13 yrs and specialize in men&#x27;s cuts.</li>

            <li> Not for soft sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a month but gave it 4 stars because I really don&#x27;t see the value in it for the $60.  </li>
            <li> but it has worked well so far</li>
            <li> The cat used to run away when he&#x27;d turn on his old trimmer, now the cat stays in the bathroom with him.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but isn&#x27;t really heavy either.</li>

            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star - is b/c for whatever reason the charging plug doesn&#x27;t hold very well in the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well and it extremely quiet.</li>
            <li> Super long charge time as well...will last all day, never losing any power!</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my beard, is small, lightweight, and has a lithium ion battery so it should last a little longer than the old Nicad/NiMH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and motor is powerful.</li>
            <li> They are exactly the same just a different color.</li>
            <li> After going through several of the cheaper Wahl trimmers in the last year this one seems to be of much higher quality.</li>
            <li> All of the Wahl products that are made in the USA are really high quality (like this one), I bought a Wahl kit at Sam&#x27;s club and it was made in China and not the same quality at all.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is very compact, well made and holds the charge a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful where you use it ;D</li>
            <li> The blades shave very close and have enough power that only one or two passes are required (thus reducing irritation.)</li>
            <li> My last beard trimmer (a Pillips/Norelco) didn&#x27;t work very well and had a part break on it shortly after I got it.</li>
            <li> Small trimmer (smaller than I thought it would be)  allows me to cut neatly and easily around their ears and to trim their neckline.  </li>
            <li> I dropped these on a very hard ceramic floor and the top blade flew off.</li>

            <li> but their professional line isn&#x27;t sold in stores that the public can shop in as a rule.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, but it hasn&#x27;t been used long enough to determine how long the charge will actually last (Wahl says it will last for 2 continuous hours).</li>

            <li> They seem a little cheap and don&#x27;t click on as firmly as previous models.</li>
            <li> little large for trimming around the mouth</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you are looking for something small and compact, quiet if you shave at night and don&#x27;t want to bother people with loud clippers, and long charge times</li>

            <li> Very quiet and very sharp.cuts through thick hairlines no problem.</li>
            <li> Quiet, sharp, holds charge FOREVER and allows corded operation if/when the battery finally does lose its charge.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pick something negative to say, it&#x27;d be that the charger is very lightweight</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t even try to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a trimmer that can keep your face with short even stubble, looking like you shaved earlier that day.</li>
            <li> It cut so unevenly that I decided to just shave my entire beard off.</li>
            <li> They get really close without biting or irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> I expected the attachment to fall off in operation</li>
            <li> Big waste of money!</li>
            <li> the other girls in the shop had me order them one too.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Echo comes with a power adapter that is also strictly for 120v 60hz usage, but as I discovered, the trimmer&#x27;s lithium ion battery holds enough charge that I can travel for a few weeks of trimmer usage without needing to recharge it!</li>
            <li> small con is the plastic material which looks very fragile.</li>
            <li> sharp and cuts efficiently&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other thoughts:  </li>
            <li> small, the entire length of it is shorter than the length of my hand</li>
            <li> They are $10 cheaper than the other.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Wahl that I have had for 7 years and although the head has become loose with ware, it still works and the battery charges and holds for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Never slowing down.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s SHARP!</li>
            <li> For me, these lasted a little less than one year.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Echo Cordless trimmers expecting the same cutting quality but was severely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is fantastic for line-ups, the ultra thin blade, the lightweight design and the quite cutting power</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few trimmers before this</li>
            <li> I bought them to use at work as I usually have 80% mens cuts all day.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and work at Greatclips, I do approximately 100-120 a week on average with about 85% of those being men.</li>
            <li> , I had a hard time finding what accessories were included in this online, so here is a list of everything that comes in the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they only allow wahl clippers and I was cutting with Osters.</li>
            <li> Using these work for no guard fades but it does take a little longer due to slower cutting.</li>
            <li> Now the trim will cut the crap out of you if not careful.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, mine came already broken.</li>
            <li> Needless to say for some reason</li>
            <li> I have to say there are the tightest cutting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-4 cutting guides 1/8th\\&quot; through 1/2\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Recharging</li>
            <li> Started dulling badly at 6 months.</li>

            <li> High quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cut my three son&#x27;s hair.  Small trimmer (smaller than I thought it would be)  allows me to cut neatly and easily around their ears and to trim their neckline.  use it infrequently so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s battery life but the cut is very good and the unit seems well made.</li>
            <li> My haircuts had been getting shorter and shorter over the years thanks to my DNA  :)  so I recently purchased a set of Oster Classic 76 clippers to do my own shave jobs. And they are awesome. But I also wanted a small, cordless clipper of better quality than what I could get at Target or Walmart. And the Wahl Echo is perfect! Very high quality and what appears to be great battery life. These have been used to dry shave and they leave very short stubble which is the look I was going for. They also do a great job on my neck between haircuts. They don&#x27;t get razor-close, but what does? I think these will last a long, long time and so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I think you&#x27;d have a hard time finding a better cordless trimmer at this price (or any price, for that matter). Great companion to the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer! It&#x27;s lightweight and cordless. Best part is that it gets super close! All the stylist I work w always come to my station to use my trimmer for edge ups..</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and work at Greatclips, I do approximately 100-120 a week on average with about 85% of those being men. I love this little trimmer it&#x27;s silent, which had me concerned when I first got it, but it has proven to be an amazing addition to my arsenal.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It cut so unevenly that I decided to just shave my entire beard off. I have had good experiences with Wahl before, and many reviewers love this trimmer, so perhaps mine was a fluke, but in years of using clippers and trimmers, I have never before had one that was as bad as this one.</li>
            <li> Great trimmers! They&#x27;re extremely quiet and Worked very well for work.</li>
            <li> Bought this February 2015. Its now been 4 months and it&#x27;s no longer holding a charge! Big waste of money! 😩😓</li>
            <li> Product is designed well and battery life is strong. Attachments work as advertised so no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I am a professional in the industry for 13 yrs and specialize in men&#x27;s cuts. I do roughly 50-60 mens cuts a week and have tried many trimmers. I previously had the mag trimmers which cut perfectly but the internal battery eventually was no longer chargeable in about a years time. I recently purchased the Echo Cordless trimmers expecting the same cutting quality but was severely dissatisfied. I had to go over the hair many times and just couldn&#x27;t get through thicker neck and ear hair. I will be returning these and going back to the mags.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I am a pro and the other girls in the shop had me order them one too.</li>
            <li> Best cordless trimmer in the market!</li>
            <li> With this trimmer, I no longer use a razor for my facial hair. It goes through anything and it trims so close to the skin, you may just go without using a razor altogether. On top of all that it&#x27;s so small that you can carry it in your shirt pocket - see pictures.</li>
            <li> Crazy long battery life, clean cut, light in hand, and a great value compared to other Li-Ion trimmers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my trimmers very close to skin I am a 10 yr stylist and love them well worth the money</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a trimmer that can keep your face with short even stubble, looking like you shaved earlier that day. After looking at and buying and returning a number of different consumer models from my local big-box stores, I realized that what most manufacturers call a &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; is not what I would call it. For me, a stubble trimmer can keep your beard trimmed at a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level, or equivalent to about a day&#x27;s growth. But all I was finding were trimmers that could only trim at a five-day growth level, which is not what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search is finally over and I&#x27;m happy to say that the Wahl Echo does trim at a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow level, which comes out to 1/64&amp;#34; or 0.4mm. Most consumer trimmers can only achieve a 1/12&amp;#34; or 2mm trim length, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another trimmer that I like is the  [[ASIN:B0009XH6OG Andis Headliner]], which I&#x27;ve used for over a year. It also has a 0.4mm trim length. It works great, but I needed a trimmer to use while traveling in the US and abroad, and the Headliner is a heavy beast in my backpack, and as a corded model it only runs on 120v 60hz. I needed something lighter, and that could handle all the various international electric standards. The Wahl Echo comes with a power adapter that is also strictly for 120v 60hz usage, but as I discovered, the trimmer&#x27;s lithium ion battery holds enough charge that I can travel for a few weeks of trimmer usage without needing to recharge it! How awesome is that. See my advanced tip below for a method of recharging the Echo via any standard USB charger, which would allow you to charge the Echo in any country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Echo is very light weight at an even 4oz, which is about 1/3 the weight of the Headliner. Its also very quiet compared to the Headliner, and can trim equally close. The only important difference in trim quality between the two is that the Echo needs a slow hand to achieve a smooth trim -- if you go too fast it will pull on the hairs and nip at you. The Headliner, with its heavy corded motor, can go much faster with ease, and I&#x27;ve never had it pull hair. Some other differences are that the Echo runs very cool, whereas the Headliner can get uncomfortably hot with extended use. The Echo has a smaller trim head, and this makes it more agile in difficult areas. The Headliner can trim faster with its larger trim head. They both come with various guide attachments, but I only use these trimmers for trimming, and not for clipping. The Echo&#x27;s charging stand is lightweight and seems to make contact reliably when you dock the trimmer on it. You can also plug the power adapter directly into the trimmer, thus bypassing the charging stand if you don&#x27;t want to use it. The red color of the Echo is a little nicer looking in person than in the product picture above. The body material contains sparkle flecks that give the finish some depth, and I&#x27;m happier with the look than I thought I&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Tip:&lt;br /&gt;I found that I could use certain USB cable adapters to charge the Echo via a standard USB power adapter, or even via my laptop. The power cable you&#x27;d need would have a standard Type A USB plug on one side, and a 3.5mm DC barrel plug on the other side. One example of such a cable is the one that&#x27;s used for powering a GameBoy Classic DMG, and this cable would fit both the trimmer and the charging stand. Another cable you could use is the one for the Sony PSP or the Sony Reader, though its DC connector is 4mm, so it would only fit the Echo&#x27;s charging stand. FYI, the Echo&#x27;s power adapter measures at 4.5v DC, whereas most USB power adapters (for phones and tablets and iPods) output 5v DC. The Echo appears to have smart charging circuitry onboard, and this will correctly handle that small difference in voltage.iner, with its heavy corded motor, can go much faster with ease, and I&#x27;ve never had it pull hair.

            <li> sometimes they bite clients necks.  Other than that they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Relatively quiet and dependable. Most noticeable was the battery life. I have charged the battery once when I bought the trimmer. In the month that has passed since I have used the trimmer 8 or 9 times and the battery is still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small con is the plastic material which looks very fragile.</li>
            <li> Quiet, sharp, holds charge FOREVER and allows corded operation if/when the battery finally does lose its charge.  Highly recommended if you are looking for something small and compact, quiet if you shave at night and don&#x27;t want to bother people with loud clippers, and long charge times so you can take it on month-long vacations and not need to bring the charging cord.</li>
            <li> After receiving item,  and charging for the first time, cut the hair of 4 of my crew members.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper started strong and kept working the entire time.  Never slowing down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! All of my coworkers have these and we wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind. Would definitely recommend them to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Fragile...I dropped the trimmer in the sink an the steel guide on one corner broke off.  Now the trim will cut the crap out of you if not careful.  Not for soft sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a month but gave it 4 stars because I really don&#x27;t see the value in it for the $60.  I think there are equally good products available for $40 or less.</li>
            <li> I have owned many trimmers in my life and they have all seen a lot of use. I have to say there are the tightest cutting. I love them. They are very lightweight and feel great in your hand. I love how detailed you can get with them. Great purchase, makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second Echo. The first was dropped in the toilet. Didn&#x27;t even try to dry it out. I&#x27;m a 56y/o guy and use it on my beard. It&#x27;s not a perfect product but pretty darn nice. Here&#x27;s how I rate it...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice size for beards&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge well&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp and cuts efficiently&lt;br /&gt;Priced fairly&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little large for trimming around the mouth&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t work after taking a dunk in the toilet (just kidding)</li>
            <li> I bought these trimmers because a friend of mine had them and I loved using hers. Needless to say for some reason the ones I received are nothing like hers. They do not cut well and are a lot louder then hers</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long but it has worked well so far and I like the fact that it has a charger instead of batteries. Note that there is no variable guard for it - there are several separate guards of different sizes. So you can&#x27;t fine tune the length as you might with other options. All the other trimmers we&#x27;ve had have died far too early. I&#x27;m hoping this one keeps working this well over time.</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers i&#x27;ve ever used! Cuts evenly and very closely. another great thing  is they are so quiet, it doesnt even seem like they are on!! Super long charge time as well...will last all day, never losing any power!</li>
            <li> My Fiance loved it, provides a clean shave and he got rave reviews about this brand from the girls that cut his hair - If a stylist says it&#x27;s a great brand, we&#x27;re sold!</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with this trimmer.  I&#x27;m glad that wahl finally has trimmers and clippers that have the lithium battery and can be used corded when battery drains.  I would recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> Never had a better trimmer. Don&#x27;t have to worry about nicking the skin yet cuts close as a razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. It cuts close and very quietly.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this instead of shaving his face and this is his second Wahl trimmer. The trimmer is very quite. The cat used to run away when he&#x27;d turn on his old trimmer, now the cat stays in the bathroom with him. The blades shave very close and have enough power that only one or two passes are required (thus reducing irritation.) It charges quickly, but it hasn&#x27;t been used long enough to determine how long the charge will actually last (Wahl says it will last for 2 continuous hours). Although it is made of plastic it feels sturdy and has a nice heft to it so it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but isn&#x27;t really heavy either. (They make a metal version called the MAG if you don&#x27;t want plastic.) Clean up is a breeze, the blade can be taken off with out a screw driver and the entire assembly cleaned easily. Also, the motor and other internals are fully encased when you take off the blade which is nice. This also makes it easy to replace the blades if needed.    Pros:  study construction  close shave  battery charges fast  blades are easy to clean  blades are easy to replace    Cons:  None so far. The color isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s kind of growing on me.    Other thoughts:  I really like the size of it. It seems to fit the hand well.    Note: Pay attention to where the trimmer is made. All of the Wahl products that are made in the USA are really high quality (like this one), I bought a Wahl kit at Sam&#x27;s club and it was made in China and not the same quality at all.</li>
            <li> Incredible trimmer, it DOES NOT pinch the skin!! It&#x27;s small in size but packs a powerful punch, fits very nicely in your hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Love these trimmers. Work great. I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile now and use them very often holds a charge and cuts great. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Very powerful, quiet (for trimmers), last throughout my workday and does not lose power at all...They trim well and are very good for shaping...I would recommend to anyone right now...if my opinion changes then I will change my post...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist. And All the girls at work have the wahl sterling silver Mag. I decided to get something different and found this one. I&#x27;m very pleased on how it cuts. It&#x27;s silent light weight and cuts very clean. We cut a lot of hair every day, and it does last along time cordless. I don&#x27;t like the T edges blade. This one is small and cuts nice over the ears. IT&#x27;s totally worth buying. I really recommend it. Update: June 2015. I&#x27;ve had them for 7 months now. And they are still going strong! I love the fact that I dont have to worry about the cord getting tangled. Make sure you oil the blade once in a while, keeps the blade running smoothly and prevents from pulling the hair. I would definitely purchase again. Now im looking into buying a cordless clipper. But they only allow wahl clippers and I was cutting with Osters. My search continues :). I hope this review helps people!</li>
            <li> My last beard trimmer (a Pillips/Norelco) didn&#x27;t work very well and had a part break on it shortly after I got it. I&#x27;ve been through a few trimmers before this and they either don&#x27;t seem to last very long or don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my next trimmer I wanted something that would be good quality and last a while, so I looked up what kind of trimmers barbers use. Wahl seems to be the big brand for professional trimmers. Wahl has a line of consumer trimmers and clippers that you can pick up at Target or Walmart or whatever but their professional line isn&#x27;t sold in stores that the public can shop in as a rule. Luckily you can get just about anything online nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Echo turned out to be just what I was looking for. It does a great job on my beard, is small, lightweight, and has a lithium ion battery so it should last a little longer than the old Nicad/NiMH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very small, the entire length of it is shorter than the length of my hand (I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;11\\&quot; man)&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium ion battery&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for trimming hair around the beard line, or I&#x27;d imagine the neckline. Makes a nice clean line without any pinching or cutting.&lt;br /&gt;-Very quiet. I was surprised at this, as it cuts through hair better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned but just makes a quiet buzzing noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not really any serious cons, but the casing does look a little cheap. If it bothers you, you can get the metal version of the trimmer called the MAG. As far as I can see, it&#x27;s the exact same trimmer but in stainless steel and 20 or 30 bucks more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had a hard time finding what accessories were included in this online, so here is a list of everything that comes in the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-4 cutting guides 1/8th\\&quot; through 1/2\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Recharging stand&lt;br /&gt;-Recharging transformer (plugs in to stand or directly in to the trimmer itself)&lt;br /&gt;-Accessory storage well that attaches to stand (holds the clipper oil and cleaning brush)&lt;br /&gt;-Small bottle of oil&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;-Red blade guard (I don&#x27;t really understand the purpose of this, I guess protects it if you are traveling or something, but doesn&#x27;t seem necessary)&lt;br /&gt;-Instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the smallest cutting guide worked perfect as I want somewhere in between stubble and a beard, but I think that the 4 that are included would fit most people&#x27;s needs. Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the trimmer. Hopefully it will live up to Wahl&#x27;s reputation and last a long time to come.he clipper oil and cleaning brush)&lt;br /&gt;-Small bottle of oil&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;-Red blade guard (I don&#x27;t really understand the purpose of this, I guess protects it if you are traveling or something, but doesn&#x27;t seem necessary)&lt;br /&gt;-Instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the smallest cutting guide worked perfect as I want somewhere in between stubble and a beard, but I think that the 4 that are included would fit most people&#x27;s needs.

            <li> This is the same thing as the Mag, Beret, and the Sterling Ion. It will stay going without the cord for 2 hrs solid use. I can do 15 neck, beard or blends with these. Love them! They are $10 cheaper than the other. I called Wahl to make sure they were the same. They are exactly the same just a different color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, mine came already broken. They wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge so I sent them back</li>
            <li> I use wahl cordless trimmers all the time to trim my mini  shih tzus paws, etc.  this red one was supposed to make it more fun for me, but it barely cuts at all, and it&#x27;s brand new! where do we go from here?</li>
            <li> Trimmer is very compact, well made and holds the charge a long time. I have professional Hair Dressers in my family and they advised this was the one to get.</li>
            <li> Love these trimmers absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> Professional hair stylist here. For me, these lasted a little less than one year. Now they wont hold a charge. Great close cut, but would bite the skin occasionally. Quiet operation. Started dulling badly at 6 months. If i could replace the battery, they would be 4 stars. Im upgrading to the Wahl Mag.</li>
            <li> Best clippers ever!  I use them daily and I can&#x27;t wait to use them every time.</li>
            <li> It sometimes yanks hair on the back of the neck. You kinda need to go slower with them. But they have a close cut and are light! Yayyy !!!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star - is b/c for whatever reason the charging plug doesn&#x27;t hold very well in the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Excellent rrimmer. Using for neck and it does a great job. Nice and ckean cut and very close</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers. They really are superb. I am a hairdresser and I use this on almost all of my men clients. They get really close without biting or irritating the skin. They are also very durable. I dropped these on a very hard ceramic floor and the top blade flew off. I thought I broke them but nope the top popped back on and worked liked new!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a pro stylist for use as a beard trimmer. The blades are sharp and motor is powerful. The charging stand is handy and keeps the trimmer charged at all times. There are only 3 guide combs included with the trimmer, which are enough for a close beard trim. After going through several of the cheaper Wahl trimmers in the last year this one seems to be of much higher quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using a beard trimmer for years. I started with a Phillips that lasted me for 5 years and I truly missed it after it had died. I replaced it with a Wahl that I have had for 7 years and although the head has become loose with ware, it still works and the battery charges and holds for a few weeks. However, I dint want to wait until it died so I purchased a Remington 12 months ago. That&#x27;s how long it lasted before the battery stopped holding its charge. I trashed the Remington a headed back to Wahl. I love this trimmer. Its very compact, very sharp and looks and feels good in the hand. It trims effortlessly. I would go as far as to say its the best trim I have ever had from a beard trimmer. If I&#x27;m going to fault it anywhere, its the attachments. They seem a little cheap and don&#x27;t click on as firmly as previous models. I expected the attachment to fall off in operation but it never has and I use it daily on my close goatee. I will update when it dies but for now, 4 stars, would have given it five if the accessories had been better.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is fantastic for line-ups, the ultra thin blade, the lightweight design and the quite cutting power make it the best trimmer I have ever used. When trimming eyebrows with a clipper over comb technique, they are quite and a comfortable weight. The customer is put at ease by the low noise level of this trimmer, specially when using them around a person&#x27;s eyes and face. Most other brands sound like major damage is about to occur, but not with this clipper. I am now purchasing my 3rd echo trimmer.  I damaged the first two, by one too many drops on a hard floor, most times the head pops off, sometimes they break</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these trimmers! I&#x27;ve had them for about two weeks now and they work beautifully. So quiet, very close cut, and gentle on the skin. Lightweight and easy to maneuver. Love the freedom of no cord! Also, they&#x27;re SPARKLY! I was torn between these and Oster t finisher, glad I chose these. If I had to pick something negative to say, it&#x27;d be that the charger is very lightweight and sometimes I&#x27;m scared it will slide off the station, but no problems with that as of now. It&#x27;s obvious these are made well, a quality product. I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are the best ive ever purchased. Very quiet and very sharp.cuts through thick hairlines no problem.I bought them to use at work as I usually have 80% mens cuts all day. I hope they never discontinue these cause they are the best!</li>
            <li> Good: This thing works well, and it&#x27;s sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It&#x27;s SHARP! Be careful where you use it ;D</li>
            <li> Great product, very powerful and makes greats beard shapes and outlines, makes almost no noise and is very light.</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot of trimmers in my 8 years as a hairstylist. These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They get close to the skin, fit great in the hand, and they are extra quiet (which helps with nervous kids). Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very close shave. Amazingly quiet. Great battery life. I use this daily to shave my face to avoid irritation and in-grown hair from traditional foil razors. Also use to do detail trimming around my neck and ears. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It is the best trimer I have ever used.  And I have used a lot. I have been a hairdresser for over 40 years</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  It keeps a great charge. It cuts very well and it extremely quiet. This trimmer makes things so much easier when doing cuts on children.  I will be ordering another pair! The only thing I am not as happy with is, as expected,  these trimmers are not quite as powerful as the corded trimmers I am used to. I still used corded trimmers for high and tights. Using these work for no guard fades but it does take a little longer due to slower cutting.</li>
