    <ol>
            <li>These are excellent for those gotta have moments.</li>
            <li>They smell like a wood fire, but taste great.</li>
            <li>I bought menthols and specials and both were great.</li>
            <li>They came ON TIME on a great day and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good when it comes to how it makes you feel after you smoke these</li>
            <li>These are quite good.</li>
            <li>These were good.</li>
            <li>So people who are trying to find a cigarette that taste good, Stop being picky because most of them doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Otherwise taste good :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a very nice alternative to tobacco to every once and a while light up and have a relaxing moment.  </li>
            <li>i stopped smoking and after a couple weeks realized while i felt better</li>
            <li>most enjoyment I&#x27;ve got out of these was sticking them in friends packs of cigarettes and watch them cringe after they&#x27;ve inhaled these.</li>
            <li>Mostly got thumbs up.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it was ok.</li>
            <li>t love the box the cigarettes are in</li>
            <li>a bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....what more can be said?</li>
            <li>They do have a nice, smooth flavor.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have some kind of &#x27;special&#x27; taste, but it was just okay to me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very familiar to a strong incense smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i did not expect great things from any herbal &#x27;cigarette&#x27; but was pleasantly surprised with this.  </li>
            <li>If you don t mind the strong smell and taste ,I would recomend it.</li>
            <li>They are to strong.</li>
            <li>Just thought I&#x27;d share that these made my Valentine&#x27;s Day just more special.</li>
            <li>they will never replace tobacco, you have to get free of the tobacco drug.  </li>
            <li>then you can enjoy something like this.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong burning like paper smell,and they do burn up quick.</li>
            <li>but actually they&#x27;re really good</li>
            <li>This is it, it does burn very quickly but it&#x27;s very mild, and enjoyable enough to smoke.</li>
            <li>Taste great just wish it had that back of the throat kick a real cigg</li>
            <li>I bet that most of them already smoke normal tobacco cigarettes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a non smoker, and you&#x27;re just looking for something easy to smoke and fast.</li>
            <li>Anything you burn will rarely have a taste.</li>
            <li>I tried the special and it taste like real cigarettes and they also smell like them too.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone who is sensitive to strong smells or incense like smoke/scents.</li>
            <li>It just felt like straight up air!</li>
            <li>First time buyer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how these got any positive reviews.</li>
            <li>i really missed the relaxing ritual.  </li>
            <li>so they came really fast.</li>
            <li>Two stars knocked off because they burn too fast.</li>
            <li>I am smoke-free thanks to this product</li>
            <li>Although what I found pleasing was the smell of the cigarettes when I opened them, a very fruity sent.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Menthol one.</li>
            <li>The smoke goes down smoothly, but does burn quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty Good if you&#x27;re not a smoker, because it does not taste as harsh as traditional cigarette.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; but this Special is worth it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m more or less use to that type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These, I highly recommend and will keep on buying.</li>
            <li>This will not get you high or buzzed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the other flavors, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>but it was to strong other than that met my expectations</li>
            <li>i tried the honeyrose vanilla and did not care for the smell or taste, too heavy, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>These have really helped me cut back on nicotine - more than any of the other things I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s almost everything out there.  </li>
            <li>really took me back.</li>
            <li>the only thing is they burn out so fast.</li>
            <li>These tasted very similar to real cigarettes.</li>

            <li> Most people give them bad reviews saying that they are horrible and don&#x27;t taste right.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i did not expect great things from any herbal &#x27;cigarette&#x27; but was pleasantly surprised with this.  i stopped smoking and after a couple weeks realized while i felt better i really missed the relaxing ritual.  i tried the honeyrose vanilla and did not care for the smell or taste, too heavy, but this one is much better.  it is light, does not smell bad, and serves its function.  of course is is NOT like smoking a cigarette.  if you are expecting an herbal alternative that is the exact same as your cigarette you will be disappointed in everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a very nice alternative to tobacco to every once and a while light up and have a relaxing moment.  that is what they are for.  they will never replace tobacco, you have to get free of the tobacco drug.  then you can enjoy something like this.  i find once or twice a day is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tobacco addiction is both a physical and muscle memory thing, if that makes sense.  you can kick the physical addiction in time but the muscle memory of the ritual, to me, is harder to resolve.  so this is a big help.</li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d share that these made my Valentine&#x27;s Day just more special. They came ON TIME on a great day and they are amazing. They smell sweet, they don&#x27;t taste too bad, and they go down extremely smooth. It just felt like straight up air! These, I highly recommend and will keep on buying. I WILL try the other favors as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;These are not tobacco cigarettes. Most people give them bad reviews saying that they are horrible and don&#x27;t taste right. I bet that most of them already smoke normal tobacco cigarettes. They&#x27;re used to the taste of tobacco cigarettes. These are used to help you quit and/or give you something to smoke. They&#x27;re nothing like cigarettes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good when it comes to how it makes you feel after you smoke these but it&#x27;s very familiar to a strong incense smell.&lt;br /&gt;I burn incense all the time so I&#x27;m more or less use to that type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone who is sensitive to strong smells or incense like smoke/scents. I like it but definitely will be looking into other brands and or different flavors and types of herbal cigarettes.</li>
            <li> These are quite good. I have been a smoker for several years and am trying to quit. These are excellent for those gotta have moments. They smell like a wood fire, but taste great. They come in a pack of 20 and are a slide type case. I have not tried the other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; but this Special is worth it. I have brought a pack to my tobacco shop and they are working on getting them in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how these got any positive reviews. They are quite possibly the worst tasting herbal cigarettes I&#x27;ve ever tried. If you like the taste of inhaling campfire , then thee are for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most enjoyment I&#x27;ve got out of these was sticking them in friends packs of cigarettes and watch them cringe after they&#x27;ve inhaled these.</li>
            <li> horrible taste like grass</li>
            <li> Tried these to get a fake fix for not smoking tobacco with friends at a get-together.  Shared them with smoker friends.  Mostly got thumbs up.  I thought they were alright.  Would be helpful for those who chew nicotine gum, who might still need to take the &#x27;edge off&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First time buyer and I thought it was ok.It does have a strong burning like paper smell,and they do burn up quick.I didn t love the box the cigarettes are in,you can t get to them quick,like when you are driving etc.If you don t mind the strong smell and taste ,I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> I am running low....:((((((((((((((((((((</li>
            <li> smoked a turd once....at CYO summer camp...lost a bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these really took me back. i&#x27;m 48 and i&#x27;ve never welched on a bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....what more can be said?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a non smoker, and you&#x27;re just looking for something easy to smoke and fast. This is it, it does burn very quickly but it&#x27;s very mild, and enjoyable enough to smoke. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other flavors, and this is by far my favorite. Pretty Good if you&#x27;re not a smoker, because it does not taste as harsh as traditional cigarette.</li>
            <li> I received these and the menthol 2 days after I order them so they came really fast. I tried the special and it taste like real cigarettes and they also smell like them too. I found that out while I was smoking it in my room. Oops. XD the only thing is they burn out so fast. So its kinda not helping me.</li>
            <li> These have really helped me cut back on nicotine - more than any of the other things I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s almost everything out there.  The paper and filter burn faster so be careful with that but they help the nervousness of not smoking while cutting back</li>
            <li> These were good. Some people who like to be dramatic talk about how sickening they were, how they taste like dead grass or garbage or almost made them throw up, they&#x27;re drama queens. These tasted very similar to real cigarettes. Two stars knocked off because they burn too fast. Half the time of a normal cigarette. I bought menthols and specials and both were great.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be horrible from reading the comments but actually they&#x27;re really good and they don&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> They do have a nice, smooth flavor. No harshness. Only bought for when those moments arise that \\&quot; I just need a cigarette and can&#x27;t start that habit again. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;However, like the other herbal cigarettes, it doesn&#x27;t show the side of the box with the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; WARNING, herbal cigarettes are dangerous to your health, they produce tar and carbon monoxide.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, as I love alot of products made in England...&lt;br /&gt;It also states on the CDC website they are dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying these again. 4 packs too many, and so embarrassed when I gave a friend a pack. :(</li>
            <li> I am smoke-free thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Okay. Let me talk about the taste these have.... they don&#x27;t have a taste. Anything you burn will rarely have a taste. So people who are trying to find a cigarette that taste good, Stop being picky because most of them doesn&#x27;t. Although what I found pleasing was the smell of the cigarettes when I opened them, a very fruity sent. The smoke goes down smoothly, but does burn quickly. This will not get you high or buzzed. It&#x27;s just an alternative for people to quit smoking.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have some kind of &#x27;special&#x27; taste, but it was just okay to me. I much prefer the Menthol one.</li>
            <li> Taste great just wish it had that back of the throat kick a real cigg has! Otherwise taste good :)</li>
            <li> The flavor was alright but it was to strong other than that met my expectations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather smoke a used rubber.</li>
            <li> They are to strong. They are stronger than regular cigs. And the taste of them taste likechemicals</li>
            <li> I have tried all honeyrose products and am still disapointed, terrible taste and the opposite of smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells like burning grass, tastes like it too</li>
    </ol>
