            <li>i am always on amazon and if youve seen my reviews you know i am always fair.</li>
            <li>This is a good soap if your skin gets to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I would buy again and recommend it to others as a healthy soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap and so does my face and body</li>
            <li>but then when i finally did it was well AWESOME.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice that it was delivered to my door on the 15th, plus what it does to my skin is ungodly, I&#x27;ll be sure to order again soon</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin nice and smooth and helps with breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again because I found another Healing Tree product that works even better for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe great for other uses, but wasn&#x27;t good for my skin type.</li>
            <li>My skin is problem free most of the times.</li>
            <li>This bamboo charcoal soap is really easy to use as it will stick to your skin the bar</li>

            <li>im excited to see what it will do and how it will help, so i will continue to use it and update my review in a week.</li>
            <li>my face feels so clean.</li>
            <li>but it does clean well thank you</li>
            <li>and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Not bad as a bath bar.  </li>
            <li>Love that it leaves skin soft and clean feeling...</li>
            <li>, well I quickly found out that the 10$ bar is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It left my face with a burning sensation and it kind of hurt.</li>
            <li>It really works, just be aware of the strong scent that comes from this soap.</li>
            <li>I like this product, live the skin clean.</li>
            <li>i may like something at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old woman with oily skin that sometimes still has an occasional acne breakout, and this soap has worked great at keeping my face clear.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne with sensitive skin and this product was recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not fond of is the strong scent of cigarettes.</li>
            <li>also, assist in combating acne and large pores.</li>
            <li>This product is great, especially for everyday uses.</li>
            <li>it was packaged really well</li>
            <li>Really cleaned my face .and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like it that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now and it has done absolutely nothing for my face.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to buy this please do.</li>
            <li>I was using this soap on my face but after about 10 days, I found it to be very drying.  </li>
            <li>Other then that I love this charcoal bamboo soap and I use it day and night .</li>
            <li>My skin has started to clear up since using this soap!!</li>
            <li>but in this case unless i have some unforeseen reaction i dont expect to come back with anything but positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It really cleans deep .</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and oily skin and this soap worked miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li>even if it was made in china - beware tho, it makes a HUGE mess (made in china and mess are why it got four instead of five stars</li>

            <li> I used it throughout my second pregnancy (during which I usually have more acne flareups than usual), and I didn&#x27;t have a single breakout this pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> That when I used it the first time I scrubbed too hard on my face.</li>
            <li> So my advice is to not scrub hard and rub to much.</li>
            <li> And it came earlier than I expected it to</li>
            <li> I threw out all of my other acne washes and use only this soap twice a day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry it out and cleared up a lot of my acne.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin, this soap doesn&#x27;t leave it oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I ran out recently and was using some of my husband&#x27;s soap for a few weeks, and I immediately had several breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited for this soap only to find it rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just regular bar soap in black</li>
            <li> Be careful where you use it as it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> the product showed up faster than i expected..</li>
            <li> went back to my usual face-wash</li>
            <li> I was using a different charcoal soap that worked wonders but for a small bar</li>
            <li> and it made a mess overtime in the shower and sink (as other reviewers have mentioned).  </li>
            <li> I have to spend extra time cleaning my sink and counters because the black suds get EVERYWHERE, and believe me I tried very hard not to make a mess but with this soap, it&#x27;s unavoidable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s INCREDIBLY messy, the suds (what little bit you get) are black and it dries out my face as well.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soap cleans its a little messy but it works well</li>
            <li> Pores reduced in size and dark spots seam to be fading!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather, I felt small spots of itch and breakouts sometimes while I was using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To bad though, I had high hopes for the cheaper bar.</li>
            <li> I mean wherever you stop moving it</li>

            <li> This bamboo charcoal soap is really easy to use as it will stick to your skin the bar I mean wherever you stop moving it so you never had any problem knowing where it is because the TV is stuck to your leg but face chest whatever but it does clean well thank you</li>
            <li> This is a good soap if your skin gets to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s skin seems to liking it. After a month&#x27;s use, his acne breakout is visibly controlled. I plan to purchase this regularly for him.&lt;br /&gt;However, my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like it that much. My skin is problem free most of the times. After using this soap for a month, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Rather, I felt small spots of itch and breakouts sometimes while I was using this.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my usual face-wash and I don&#x27;t get those skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is fine, great price, but I would not personally buy again.  I have mild acne with sensitive skin and this product was recommended to me.

            <li> I like the way this soap cleans its a little messy but it works well</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for my skin! And it came earlier than I expected it to, I ordered it on the 12th and I didn&#x27;t notice that it was delivered to my door on the 15th, plus what it does to my skin is ungodly, I&#x27;ll be sure to order again soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now and it has done absolutely nothing for my face. It&#x27;s INCREDIBLY messy, the suds (what little bit you get) are black and it dries out my face as well. I have to spend extra time cleaning my sink and counters because the black suds get EVERYWHERE, and believe me I tried very hard not to make a mess but with this soap, it&#x27;s unavoidable. I was really excited for this soap only to find it rather disappointing. I was using a different charcoal soap that worked wonders but for a small bar it was 10$ so I thought I&#x27;d try this 4$ bar, well I quickly found out that the 10$ bar is worth the money. To bad though, I had high hopes for the cheaper bar. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this charcoal soap in place of face wash.  It works great for me!  I&#x27;m a 29 year old woman with oily skin that sometimes still has an occasional acne breakout, and this soap has worked great at keeping my face clear.  I used it throughout my second pregnancy (during which I usually have more acne flareups than usual), and I didn&#x27;t have a single breakout this pregnancy.  I ran out recently and was using some of my husband&#x27;s soap for a few weeks, and I immediately had several breakouts.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with charcoal soap from now on.</li>
            <li> Love that it leaves skin soft and clean feeling... also, assist in combating acne and large pores. The downside to this product is that it has a tendency to leave shower or bath blacken, which comes clean easily.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!! My complexion has improved dramaticaly. Pores reduced in size and dark spots seam to be fading!! I will buy it again!! My teenage daughters also use it and their acne had cleared up too!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great bar of soap if you have oil or blemished skin. I use it on my back and it&#x27;s helped a lot. Be careful where you use it as it will dry your skin. Moisturize!</li>
            <li> This product does work. It helps keep my skin nice and smooth and helps with breakouts here and there. The only thing I&#x27;m not fond of is the strong scent of cigarettes. Anyone who wants to buy this please do. It really works, just be aware of the strong scent that comes from this soap.</li>
            <li> I was using this soap on my face but after about 10 days, I found it to be very drying.  Not bad as a bath bar.  I won&#x27;t buy it again because I found another Healing Tree product that works even better for me.</li>
