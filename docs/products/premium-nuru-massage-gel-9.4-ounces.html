            <li>What a great fun</li>
            <li>We loved how it felt on our skin and made body massaging very fun.</li>
            <li>As with anything worthwhile, Nuru Massage has a learning curve.</li>

            <li>The back of the bottle has full directions for using it which was nice because I didn&#x27;t know that you need to use water to activate the gel.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is to take a shower and to not dry off afterwards.</li>
            <li>Now it gets sticky after a little while, however is still a great lubricant.</li>
            <li>Finally, you need to make sure both the room and the nuru gel are heated.</li>

            <li>Very slippery</li>
            <li>It was very slippery and has no scent.</li>
            <li>hope to have to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I ran my space heater in the bedroom and left the nuru gel bottle (still closed) in a bowl of warm water while we were in the shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is super, super slick and slippery.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, very stringy, slippery, and doesn&#x27;t dry up.</li>
            <li>And of course it makes a fun mess.</li>

            <li> It becomes very sticky if left to dry.  </li>
            <li> Other websites advise against using nuru as sex lube, but once your in the moment things just happen, and since this is all natural, there haven&#x27;t been any issues.</li>
            <li> If the gel starts to dry out after a really long massage</li>
            <li> It is really thick and lasted for the entire massage before starting to dry up.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It seemed thicker than other gels I&#x27;ve tried and had no taste or odor.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is thick that it is like a solid but still a liquid.</li>
            <li> When it drys it becomes a little sticky.</li>
            <li> But it does get a little sticky after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and wanted to share what I&#x27;ve learned.</li>
            <li> And messy - you might want to cover the bedclothes.</li>
            <li> Other gels that I&#x27;ve tried (like baby oil) won&#x27;t work because they aren&#x27;t as thick and are too watery.</li>
            <li> It is slick, but either you need to us a lot, or add water along the way.</li>
            <li> then you can renew it on your skin with a small bit of water.</li>
            <li> Just use a really small amount of water though because you don&#x27;t want to over-dilute the gel.</li>
            <li> Very slick....</li>
            <li> I hated it and wish I never purchased it.</li>

            <li> It was awesome slippery...you can use it multiple ways....</li>
            <li> Very sticky. Tends to evaporate.</li>
            <li> When it drys it becomes a little sticky.</li>
            <li> SliqGel lives up to its name! It is super, super slick and slippery. It has a unique texture that is kind of hard to describe in words. It is thick that it is like a solid but still a liquid. Its this thickness that makes it perfect for nuru massage. Other gels that I&#x27;ve tried (like baby oil) won&#x27;t work because they aren&#x27;t as thick and are too watery.</li>
            <li> Very slippery but it can get sticky. And of course it makes a fun mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, very stringy, slippery, and doesn&#x27;t dry up. This size surprisingly is lasting a while. Other websites advise against using nuru as sex lube, but once your in the moment things just happen, and since this is all natural, there haven&#x27;t been any issues.</li>
            <li> It is slick, but either you need to us a lot, or add water along the way. It becomes very sticky if left to dry.  Practice makes perfect.</li>

            <li> Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it dries, it will be &amp;#34;reactivated&amp;#34; in water.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> all good and slippery as it should be.</li>
            <li> I heard of a nuru massage and thought I&#x27;d find out what all this was about and bought this Sliqgel stuff. What fun! this is some slippery stuff and worked just as I was hoping. Fun name and a good new product, I&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> As with anything worthwhile, Nuru Massage has a learning curve. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and wanted to share what I&#x27;ve learned. The most important thing is to take a shower and to not dry off afterwards. The water on your skin is what makes the nuru gel slippery. You also need some sort of slippery surface. I used an air mattress but am considering buying nuru sheets in the future. Finally, you need to make sure both the room and the nuru gel are heated. I ran my space heater in the bedroom and left the nuru gel bottle (still closed) in a bowl of warm water while we were in the shower. When we got out both the nuru gel and the room were properly heated. I also recommend keeping a glass of water next to the bed. If the gel starts to dry out after a really long massage then you can renew it on your skin with a small bit of water. Just use a really small amount of water though because you don&#x27;t want to over-dilute the gel. I&#x27;m really glad I decided to try out this SliqGel.  It&#x27;s a great way to spend an evening at home.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice alternative. Additionally the speed of delivery was impressive.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars but they changed the formula.  Now it gets sticky after a little while, however is still a great lubricant.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for all types of massages. It is really thick and lasted for the entire massage before starting to dry up. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was good for a temporary source.</li>
            <li> Better than anticipated. Great for those personal intimate moments.</li>
            <li> Found this type of massage on the Internet and figure me and the wife tried it out. Was very intimate and erotic, slippery fun time</li>
            <li> Wow. Pretty incredible!...</li>
            <li> Very slick....What a great fun experience!!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to break it out again!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope to have to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and am allergic to almost everything. But my husband wanted to give me a nuru massage and begged me to try this product. I was thoroughly impressed! This stuff didn&#x27;t cause any type of allergic reaction, anywhere! It stayed liquid and never got sticky. I can&#x27;t wait until this weekend to try it again!</li>
            <li> The gel gets a bit sticky when it dries...</li>
            <li> Constantly having to reapply, Gets gummy.</li>
            <li> It was so sticky! We had to get in the shower after 3 minutes. I hated it and wish I never purchased it.</li>
            <li> You and your partner will have great erotic fun with this gel! Slippery, slippery! And messy - you might want to cover the bedclothes. Search the net on nuru massage.</li>
            <li> Great gel for us. We loved how it felt on our skin and made body massaging very fun. It was very slippery and has no scent. But it does get a little sticky after awhile.</li>
