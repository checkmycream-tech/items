            <li>A favorite of mine, have used it for decades.</li>
            <li>It is her favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, but then I opened the box, it had leaked onto the papers and box.</li>
            <li>I truely love this product was tickled that I was able to find it.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Have not found one that smells better.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it</li>
            <li>Glad to see it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragerence</li>
            <li>Lovely for your nose and those about you.</li>
            <li>My daughters favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume for years.</li>
            <li>and I receive so many comments.</li>
            <li>, Just love it.</li>
            <li>The soft beautiful floral fragrance gets me so many compliments as to what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  </li>
            <li>it was not too strong or over powering .</li>
            <li>The house smelt so strong.</li>
            <li>lasts long and good quality perfume:) mature scent and is very strong so make sure your carefull with the amount</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild not too strong.</li>
            <li>Narcisse by Parfums Chloe is a unique scent.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear it I get compliments and it makes me feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Since that day, I have worn no other kind of perfume.  </li>
            <li>Just right for any occasion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her.</li>
            <li>She applies the perfume in more quantity and a minute later you cannot smell it.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume I buy...have considered it my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; perfume for many years.</li>
            <li>it has never failed me and people are always asking me what am i wearing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went back to it.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, clean smell - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I wore this scent several years back and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order online, match the info on the bottle and order exactly the same product, piece of cake!</li>
            <li>I shopped at other stores, but I couldn&#x27;t find the same product for such a great price!</li>
            <li>For some reason people notice my fragrance in a pleasant way instead of negative.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t smell much of anything</li>
            <li>She loves this perfume so much she turned to Amazon to keep wearing it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Plus I had found one other perfume that I hadn&#x27;t been able to get in a store also.</li>
            <li>It is a great expensive smelling scent that is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>But seems to be the real thing at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Was able to purchase it online at half the price as in the store...</li>
            <li>I happened on to this fragrance several (maybe a few more) years ago, and if you like a flowery, clean aura, this is a must try.  </li>
            <li>This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  </li>
            <li>Any time I get I order frequently, because I like it so much</li>
            <li>It starts a little strong but quickly settles down to a very nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Chloe Narcisse does have a rather strong smell, but I just apply less.  </li>
            <li>My first introduction to this perfume was when it was being test-sampled at The Bon/Macy&#x27;s back in 1992 and a woman came up to me and asked if I would try a new perfume.  </li>
            <li>I can only wear a very select few perfumes because I am prone to migraines when the perfume is too strong.  </li>
            <li>I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to be delivered and the product must be very old as it had no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I received this perfume to give it as a present but found that it barely smelled like the one she had before.</li>
            <li>Same beautiful smell as when I first was introduced to it in the late 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fragrance that doesn&#x27;t turn badly on me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its long lasting.</li>
            <li> Has a long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> I definitely detect other florals, specifically a creamy gardenia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted, and have been literally from the first spray.</li>
            <li> &quot; Or in other words, What do you want me to say?</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> My Mother has always wore Chloe and has just recently had a hard time finding it in the stores around our area.</li>
            <li> One guy was so taken by it that he had me write the name down</li>
            <li> Wasted time and money.</li>
            <li> I wore Chloe Narcisse quite a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I had not used it for a few years so decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li> I always gets compliments when I wear it, which is usually every day.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming and stays perfectly subtle ALL day.</li>
            <li> I would have expected to hate that part, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have a very difficult time finding perfumes that I like on me.</li>

            <li> Hey, what can I say? It&#x27;s just what she wanted! It arrived on time and in perfect condition.  And now, I order to fulfill the required number of words, I say \\&quot;fark donalee fur boken der stinekin furbin\\&quot; Or in other words, What do you want me to say?</li>
            <li> I received this perfume to give it as a present but found that it barely smelled like the one she had before. She applies the perfume in more quantity and a minute later you cannot smell it. The vaporizator looks different and doesn&#x27;t work as before.</li>
            <li> This is the most glorious, highly sensual, extremely feminine, and exceedingly enjoyable fragrance I have encountered in a long, long time - perhaps ever.  This scent is such a treat for both the wearer and those around her.  From the second this precious juice hits my skin, my nose is inundated with fresh, dewy, delicious daffodils!  I didn&#x27;t even know how in love with daffodils I am!  The scent continues to unfold and just gets richer and richer from there.  It is hard to improve a perfect daffodil, but this beauty pulls it off. I definitely detect other florals, specifically a creamy gardenia. I also get a distinct hint of sweetness unfolding as well, but my nose can&#x27;t identify which individual sweet or fruity notes are in the mix, only that it is absolutely intoxicating. I can smell the bitter quality I have read mentioned in other people&#x27;s reviews, but to me it is gentle and not unpleasant. I would have expected to hate that part, but I don&#x27;t. To me it seems like it is just part of the spice profile. I have to admit something: I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists!  I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted, and have been literally from the first spray. If possible, I plan to never allow this perfume to escape my collection.  It is such a priceless experience to be enveloped in this heavenly scent!  I don&#x27;t think there is any time or occasion that this would be inappropriate for, but I do think this is a strong enough fragrance that the wearer must spray lightly to avoid overpowering those around her. Enjoy this impeccable beauty!!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful sweet smelling perfume. It is a great expensive smelling scent that is not expensive at all. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this and always have. Everywhere I go I get compliments from everyone. Just right for any occasion. Not too anything, absolutely perfect</li>
            <li> Great Springtime fragrance. ihave used it for ears. This is a good proce.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong scent and not to my liking. I may end up using it for a room spray. I will not order this product again.</li>

            <li> This is the one inexpensive perfume that I gets me compliments. Not overwhelming and stays perfectly subtle ALL day.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girl friend and she lived it.</li>
            <li> The best smell ever! I get so many compliments when wearing Chloe Narcisse, I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  Great price for a timeless scent.  Fast shipping.  3+ Ounces is a lot of good smelling.</li>
            <li> Something has happened to the formulation of this perfume. It no longer has the wonderful scent I&#x27;ve loved for many years. I really can&#x27;t smell much of anything and I&#x27;m using 6-8 sprays per use! Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PURCHASE! I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED WITH IT. THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I ordered perfume and got eu de toilette</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  Whenever I wear it I get compliments and it makes me feel fresh and clean.  I hope they NEVER discontinue this fragrance!</li>
            <li> My Mother has always wore Chloe and has just recently had a hard time finding it in the stores around our area. She loves this perfume so much she turned to Amazon to keep wearing it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it. Thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite all time perfume. Keep it stocked for me!</li>
            <li> The favorite of my mother! Now I still have for giving her the Fifth Avenue, Tresor and Gio.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I buy...have considered it my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; perfume for many years. Was able to purchase it online at half the price as in the store...same 1.7 oz size bottle. The soft beautiful floral fragrance gets me so many compliments as to what I am wearing.  This perfume doesn&#x27;t cause upper respiratory problems when spraying it on and breathing it in.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a really good price! I shopped at other stores, but I couldn&#x27;t find the same product for such a great price!</li>
            <li> Surprised that for the low price the bottle was a larger size than expected.</li>
            <li> delivered on time product as described</li>
            <li> This is the the only parfums that I use. I was happy to see that Amazon has it at a good price.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to be delivered and the product must be very old as it had no smell at all.  Narcisse is a signature perfume for me, so I know what it should smell like.  Wasted time and money.</li>
            <li> The package came when promise and well wrapped. It is a gift so cannot say much more about it  till will have to wait till opened.</li>
            <li> Awesome, sweet - as always!</li>
            <li> My first introduction to this perfume was when it was being test-sampled at The Bon/Macy&#x27;s back in 1992 and a woman came up to me and asked if I would try a new perfume.  Since that day, I have worn no other kind of perfume.  In the almost 20 years that I have been wearing it, I cannot count the number of times men, and women, have stopped me to ask what kind of perfume I had on.  One guy was so taken by it that he had me write the name down so he could buy a bottle for his girlfriend for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume in the world! It lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine, have used it for decades.</li>
            <li> Ordered it as a present for my wife. Delivered on time an intact.  It is her favorite.  It was easy to order online, match the info on the bottle and order exactly the same product, piece of cake!</li>
            <li> lasts long and good quality perfume:) mature scent and is very strong so make sure your carefull with the amount</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but then I opened the box, it had leaked onto the papers and box. The house smelt so strong.</li>
            <li> I truely love this product was tickled that I was able to find it. Plus I had found one other perfume that I hadn&#x27;t been able to get in a store also.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent. it has never failed me and people are always asking me what am i wearing. I will always buy this. Its long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance fir years. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Have not found one that smells better. Has a long lasting fragrance and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a Christmas and I fell in love with it and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. Glad to see it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragerence</li>
            <li> I wore this scent several years back and loved it.  It smells great.  I&#x27;m glad I went back to it.</li>
            <li> I happened on to this fragrance several (maybe a few more) years ago, and if you like a flowery, clean aura, this is a must try.  It is the only fragrance I use.  Lovely for your nose and those about you.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FROM A GREAT SUPPLIER......THANKS</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite cologne.  Amazon is the only place I can find it.  She is always thrilled when she gets it.</li>
            <li> I wore Chloe Narcisse quite a few years ago.  I can only wear a very select few perfumes because I am prone to migraines when the perfume is too strong.  Chloe Narcisse does have a rather strong smell, but I just apply less.  It will always be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this item. IT was a gift for my daughter. She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet. But seems to be the real thing at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Chloe is the only perfume I can use. It smells sweet and lasts all day. I always gets compliments when I wear it, which is usually every day. I encourage all women to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume for years. A very good price, best by far.Any time I get I order frequently, because I like it so much</li>
            <li> For some reason people notice my fragrance in a pleasant way instead of negative.  I does not seem to overwhelm..</li>
            <li> Narcisse by Parfums Chloe is a unique scent.  I had not used it for a few years so decided to try it again.  It was everything I loved before.  It starts a little strong but quickly settles down to a very nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and for the best price!</li>
            <li> I have wore Chloe for women for 29 yrs and I receive so many comments., Just love it.</li>
