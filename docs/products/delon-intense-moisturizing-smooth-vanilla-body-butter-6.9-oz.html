            <li>This is solid also, yet so incredibly creamy</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Good for even the driest hottest New Mexico elevation in both winter and summer.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, loved that.</li>

            <li>These are better than the body shop brand and after trying for the first time I am</li>
            <li>I love this body butter so much!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is just right, not too strong.</li>
            <li>The vanilla has a clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li>The seal was on it and the first one was fine...</li>

            <li>It is a mild vanilla that is absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>I have the smooth vanilla, fabulous, light scent, deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I often make my own body butters, but when I&#x27;m short on time, this is my go to brand.</li>
            <li>The product shipped right away.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear vanilla scents but after smelling this one I became a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This body butter has become my favorite daily moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>It was first given to me as a gift</li>
            <li>The most incredibly deep moisturizer I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>She got a single can for a gift and had to have more.</li>
            <li>Like this brand so much.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;These lotions are gifts for co - workers.</li>
            <li>have used many different brands of body butters and use to love the body shop brand but did not love the price.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the reviews, and suddenly I&#x27;m a HUGE  fan of vanilla as long as it&#x27;s this particular vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Coconut</li>
            <li>Most butters (at least in my low-temp home) are too solid, and it takes a thumb nail to scoop some out, then rubbing hands together to melt it enough to smooth on.  </li>
            <li>A couple of friends that are sensitive to smells and can&#x27;t stand candles, perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li>My skin is always soft because of it</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This is what vanilla is supposed to smell like, natural with no chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Just like the old days.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin moist and refreshing for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, dries, and comes back if you&#x27;re active.</li>
            <li>They go so far as to ask me the name of the lotion and where I bought it because they want to buy the same thing.  </li>
            <li>It offers deep, penetrating moisture without feeling sticky on my skin.</li>

            <li> Usually i buy the amazon shea butter</li>
            <li> I can smell the subtle vanilla all day.  </li>
            <li> npt disappointed also its not greasy what sobever compared to the amazon shea butter</li>

They go so far as to ask me the name of the lotion and where I bought it because they want to buy the same thing.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering.  A couple of friends that are sensitive to smells and can&#x27;t stand candles, perfumes, etc. aren&#x27;t bothered.  It is a mild vanilla that is absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from wearing this scent. It&#x27;s light, never over-powering. It goes on smooth, dries, and comes back if you&#x27;re active.

            <li> It was first given to me as a gift &amp; now I gift it often. , wonderful texture, is not greasy &amp; absorbs  well. The scent is a definite  plus too</li>
            <li> I love this. I often make my own body butters, but when I&#x27;m short on time, this is my go to brand. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, and the scent is lovely. I&#x27;ve been busted, on several occasions, sniffing my arm throughout the day because the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I buy this by the four-pack, I like it so well. Smells good, and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion ever since I bought it at Costco.  Now I have to order it.  I use it for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  The vanilla has a clean and fresh scent and I also recommend the Olive scent also.  Leaves a lovely glow on my skin!</li>
            <li> Like this brand so much. It makes your skin smooth and moist. Smells good!</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent of this lotion. I have received many compliments when wearing it. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more body butter!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years...smells awesome, moisturizes extremely well in both summer and winter, great price!</li>
            <li> Usually i buy the amazon shea butter but i was prompted to buy this one in wanting to try something new.i tell you ibwas npt disappointed also its not greasy what sobever compared to the amazon shea butter</li>
            <li> Nice consistency but overpowering vanilla scent.  I would choose mango.</li>
            <li> great product .....2nd purchase</li>
            <li> Love this body butter. I am out-of-doors often for my job and it keeps my skin soft and supple. An added benefit is that I don&#x27;t get as many mosquito bites as I do using repellants.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky all day long. The scent is light but plesant.</li>
            <li> one of the best....if not the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is what vanilla is supposed to smell like, natural with no chemical smell. Goes on smooth, not greasy after.</li>
            <li> I have just opened my second container and it is starting to dry up it seems. The seal was on it and the first one was fine...not sure what i&#x27;ll find in the next two. I love this product and this was very disappointing...I guess after opening the next two I&#x27;ll decide if I want to order it again. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my last order of 4.</li>
            <li> This is the best body butter!</li>
            <li> While I was disappointed with one order ( because the consistency was so different than it had been ), I tried once more because I missed &amp;#34; an old favorite&amp;#34;.  So glad I did ðŸ˜„ . Just like the old days.  It is a GREAT  product- love it!</li>
            <li> The most incredibly deep moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for face and body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, loved that. Packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;These lotions are gifts for co - workers. I have the smooth vanilla, fabulous, light scent, deep moisturizing. I know these well be loved, happy to give something I know well be used and appreciated.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, not greasy &amp; has a nice lasting smell that isn&#x27;t over powering.  I would recommend this product to a friend looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I can smell the subtle vanilla all day.  I have used it for 3 months now and still love it.  The product shipped right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla-scented products.  I tried this because of the reviews, and suddenly I&#x27;m a HUGE  fan of vanilla as long as it&#x27;s this particular vanilla.  Wow.  It smells fantastic!  And the scent lingers on your skin for a long time. Most butters (at least in my low-temp home) are too solid, and it takes a thumb nail to scoop some out, then rubbing hands together to melt it enough to smooth on.  This is solid also, yet so incredibly creamy I can just swipe my fingers over the top. It feels luxurious going on, gliding over the skin.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter, it goes on like silk and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Makes my skin feel great!! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite body butter and recommend to many friends and gave them as gifts!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great moisturizing butter. I alternate between the vanilla and the coconut. I definitely recommend the product after shower.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever!  Love the scent, feel and texture.  Keeps skin moist and refreshing for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this body butter. Hope I can get more. This smells so good, a lot of days I don&#x27;t even wear my perfume.</li>
