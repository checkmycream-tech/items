    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My partner has been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall she is very happy and says she has noticed all these changes and is considering moving away from an Olay cream she uses to this one permanently</li>
            <li>The instructions state that for best results it should be used twice a day for 4 to 8 weeks depending on the pigmentation spots.</li>
            <li>The Amazon listing says, &amp;#34;For best results, apply for 4 to 8 weeks depending on pigmentation spots.&amp;#34; I am obliged to review within 30 days, so I cannot at this time give a report on longer-term results.</li>
            <li>Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with Phyto products.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced a miracle of anti-aging, but I do believe it has contributed to healthier skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream!!</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs very nicely into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is not inexpensive, however, you are purchasing a superior product that delivers and will probably not need to be purchased again.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling cream with a pleasant scent, but</li>
            <li>Would have been nice is this was included with the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: Lippia citriodora (verbena) leaf water, Rosa damascena (rose) flower water), aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol, octyldodecanol, glycerin (vegetal), Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, benzyl alcohol, cetearyl glucoside, C14-22 alcohols,  parfum (fragrance), xanthan gum, tocopherol (vitamin E), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame seaweed) extract, dehydroacetic acid, phytic acid, sodium hydroxide, Glycine soja (soybean) oil unsaponifiables, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, potassium sorbate, Leontopodium alpinum (edelweiss) extract.</li>
            <li>It also has a wonderful fragrance to it, light and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a good quality moisturizer over time will lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put this on a fresh, clean face for best results.</li>
            <li>skin is more even toned</li>
            <li>skin is more radiant</li>
            <li>The most concerning was the parfum fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This mostly botanical pigmentation cream is from the Ageless La cure line by Laboratoire Gibro in Fleurier, Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin does feel more moisturized than before and the tone seems to be evening out which has me looking nicer without makeup on.</li>
            <li>I have used it after shaving and in the evening and have noticed a healthier sheen to my skin and a more congruous tone.  </li>
            <li>That fact added more to the mystery of the product.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice, light scent, too; not medicinal in any way.</li>
            <li>I have also used  Phyto Peel and have been pleased with the results from both products.  </li>
            <li>oh so smooth!</li>
            <li>The amount of cream dispensed when you press down on the top of the jar is the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>It is dispensed by a pump so is easy to use and apply.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong for me</li>
            <li>Overall, he is happy with the cream and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>, this is free of harmful ingredients that I try to avoid (parabens, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it reminds me of the cheap rosewater I&#x27;d buy when I was</li>
            <li>Phyto 5 pigmentation cream has the antioxidant Eldelweiss, which of course I know from the movie The Sound of Music.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral fragrance</li>
            <li>It has a rich formula which is great as an extra moisturizer step.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incredibly useful, effective and safe to use, I highly recommend Phyto 5 to everyone.</li>
            <li>I do like the feel of this lotion on my face, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is a light floral, not unpleasant but not something I would use as perfume either.</li>
            <li>It would probably be considered a good amount for the entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking back at the Amazon listing, I see much more detailed information about the product, as well as better instructions for using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You apply this light weight and fresh smelling cream to affected areas twice a day after cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>box didn&#x27;t say how much or how little, so I did the best I could.</li>
            <li>The marks are still visible but are not the light colored scars commonly associated with acne, they&#x27;re darker marks on my otherwise very fair skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I am lucky not to suffer from hyperpigmentation, every now and then, I like to use products that help even skin</li>
            <li>; That&#x27;s why I overlooked it the first time!</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant smelling and nicely textured cream and goes on smoothly and only takes a few minutes to become absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic after apply Phyto 5 and it definitely brightens my skin and looks more luminous.  </li>
            <li>The product is nice enough, although the list of ingredients feels overlong</li>
            <li>Will report back after another 4 weeks if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>This cream from Phyto 5 goes on smooth; the pump dispenses just enough for one application and smells sweet and floral, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>The cream is light enough to go on easily and feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients, as I am careful what kind of chemicals I put on my body, as most get absorbed into your body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cream leaving the skin feeling moisturized, and there weren&#x27;t any side effects such as sensitive skin, rash reaction, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is also one of the ingredients that makes this product very silky to the touch and yet it absorbs to the skin really quickly without leaving any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will want to make sure you have sun protection if you&#x27;re using this and then staying out in the sun for long periods of time as this can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but feels a touch (only a touch) oily going on, which quickly goes away, and your face is left feeling fresh and very smooth.</li>
            <li>followed the regimen carefully for a full 30 days, and truthfully, I cannot see any difference in the pigmentflecken.</li>
            <li>European standards are more stringent than US standards on what is called organic, so if you are into organic skin care, this is a product for you.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the scent nearly disappears after the product is rubbed in, but when I&#x27;m applying it the scent is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>you can get past that hiccup, it&#x27;s a good cream and seems to be helpful</li>
            <li>Jury is still out on pigmentation, but I&#x27;ll update this review in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li>reading the box, I noticed that the German word for pigmentation is &amp;#34;pigmentflecken.&amp;#34; This became my new favorite word.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: it soaks in nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it</li>
            <li>Pythic acid, also pone of the main ingredients comes form wheat grain, so anyone who is allergic to the topic application of wheat germs should be aware of it.  </li>
            <li>pump on the container is convenient but I feel it pumps out too much of the cream.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t help with my real worry:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality seems to make the price reasonable if you are looking for something you can trust.</li>
            <li>But really it&#x27;s about the results here, and I saw none.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, his skin has not experienced any adverse reactions to the product.</li>
            <li>I love plant based products, especially when they are made out of white flowers.  </li>
            <li>I never used any creams that used edelweiss, so I picked this product because edelweiss is one of the main ingredients.  </li>
            <li>like that Phyto-Bio-Ceutical is a manufacturer of high integrity.</li>
            <li>Edelweiss is derived from Edelweiss flowers grown at high altitudes in the Swiss alps.</li>
            <li>This product came with precious little information.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite picky when it comes to what creams and moisturizers I will put on my face, but this one I really like so far</li>
            <li>In Europe, especially Austria and Switzerland, edelweiss flower is symbolic of deep love and devotion because young men risked climbing the mountains to pick edelweiss for their brides.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently testing it on the back of one hand, where it will be easy to see if it helps with hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Phyto 5 is a fantastic solution for minimizing pigmentation due to aging and skin exposure.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no problems with redness, puffiness or any other kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial cream has immediate positive effects on skin.  </li>
            <li>After several weeks, my skin tone and color looks far more uniform than before; that is to say, the dark pigmentation spots on my skin has been diminished</li>
            <li>The change is not dramatic but the improvement is enough to get me to buy another bottom of the cream to see if the spots continue to fade.</li>
            <li>and I suppose this was designed for women, despite that not being made clear in the product name or description.  </li>
            <li>skin is soft</li>
            <li>I am using it for sun spots that developed through the years.</li>
            <li>The cream is not heavy feeling</li>
            <li>ingredients are 98.7% of natural origin and 62.7% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I prefer natural and organic skin care products</li>
            <li>who knows if it will completely fade away with continued use?</li>
            <li>The sunspot on my neck was the size of a pinkie nail and it has lightened considerably.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m still new to this Resolut product, it is helping to shorten the time it takes for those dark spots to fade out, far better than any other over the counter treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The box says &amp;#34;Certified Organic&amp;#34; but is this only for the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>The cream has a slight fragrance which, thankfully, does not linger and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The edelweiss plant contains phytochemicals such a chlorogenic acid (present in coffee) and luteolin which is reported to demonstrate antioxidant activity twice as much as you get from Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Phyto 5 formulation features 62.7% organic ingredients with natural ingredients bringing the organic/natural total to 98.7%.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young woman and had acne as a teen.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if there will be a noticeable difference in my skin (results are supposed to be apparent 4-8 weeks after you begin using it)</li>
            <li>I put a drop on the back of my hands and my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hypo-pigmentation issues associated with occasional but at times moderately severe acne outbreaks since early adolescence.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Teenagers can use this product to get rid of reddish marks from the (freshly squeezed) pimples, people with hormonal changes, sometimes have uneven skin tone and regular use of this product can help resolving that problem.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream which, after it dries, leaves a very light sense of moisturizer on the skin -- not too heavy or annoying.  </li>
            <li>the insert says to try for at least 4-5 weeks before seeing results, and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>as part of a varied skin regimen that includes periodic facial peels, a bath srub-brush to exfoliate the back, my major problem area ,and the steam room at the gym to deep-clean the skin and exfoliate the entire body.</li>
            <li>Everyone has such varied preferences in what smells good / bad.</li>

            <li> In Europe, especially Austria and Switzerland, edelweiss flower is symbolic of deep love and devotion because young men risked climbing the mountains to pick edelweiss for their brides.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently testing it on the back of one hand, where it will be easy to see if it helps with hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Phyto 5 is a fantastic solution for minimizing pigmentation due to aging and skin exposure.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problems with redness, puffiness or any other kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This facial cream has immediate positive effects on skin.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks, my skin tone and color looks far more uniform than before; that is to say, the dark pigmentation spots on my skin has been diminished</li>
            <li> The change is not dramatic but the improvement is enough to get me to buy another bottom of the cream to see if the spots continue to fade.</li>
            <li> and I suppose this was designed for women, despite that not being made clear in the product name or description.  </li>
            <li> skin is soft</li>
            <li> I am using it for sun spots that developed through the years.</li>
            <li> The cream is not heavy feeling</li>
            <li> ingredients are 98.7% of natural origin and 62.7% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I prefer natural and organic skin care products</li>
            <li> who knows if it will completely fade away with continued use?</li>
            <li> The sunspot on my neck was the size of a pinkie nail and it has lightened considerably.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m still new to this Resolut product, it is helping to shorten the time it takes for those dark spots to fade out, far better than any other over the counter treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box says &amp;#34;Certified Organic&amp;#34; but is this only for the main ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cream has a slight fragrance which, thankfully, does not linger and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The edelweiss plant contains phytochemicals such a chlorogenic acid (present in coffee) and luteolin which is reported to demonstrate antioxidant activity twice as much as you get from Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 formulation features 62.7% organic ingredients with natural ingredients bringing the organic/natural total to 98.7%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young woman and had acne as a teen.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if there will be a noticeable difference in my skin (results are supposed to be apparent 4-8 weeks after you begin using it)</li>
            <li> I put a drop on the back of my hands and my hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hypo-pigmentation issues associated with occasional but at times moderately severe acne outbreaks since early adolescence.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teenagers can use this product to get rid of reddish marks from the (freshly squeezed) pimples, people with hormonal changes, sometimes have uneven skin tone and regular use of this product can help resolving that problem.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cream which, after it dries, leaves a very light sense of moisturizer on the skin -- not too heavy or annoying.  </li>
            <li> the insert says to try for at least 4-5 weeks before seeing results, and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> as part of a varied skin regimen that includes periodic facial peels, a bath srub-brush to exfoliate the back, my major problem area ,and the steam room at the gym to deep-clean the skin and exfoliate the entire body.</li>
            <li> Everyone has such varied preferences in what smells good / bad.</li>
            <li> ingredient list is long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a long list of ingredients beyond just the organic components.</li>
            <li> I will wait until the fall to use over my entire face as I assume you need to be careful with this product if you are going to be in the sun, even using sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is white and creamy and has a very faint and slightly sweet natural floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the order of ingredients is different than the few ingredients listed above, why the discrepancy?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what is annoying is how perfumed it is, I suppose this is because the second ingredient listed on the box is rose water (\\&quot;Rosa Damascena Flower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve integrated this spot treatment into the process to help fade out occasional acne dark spots that might appear on shoulders, arms or chest and it does help.</li>
            <li> After applying it to his dark spots for a couple of weeks, he has seen a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been applying this to a small, old hyper pigmented scar (keloid) on my face for a month.</li>
            <li> The product indicates the effect might take 4-8 weeks so perhaps I&#x27;ll notice some change down the line and, if I do, I will come back to update my review.</li>
            <li> To me, it isn&#x27;t bad, but is more aroma than I want to be emanating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last</li>

            <li> the last few days my brown age spots have begun to faded.  </li>
            <li> , let me get to the reason why this is a premium product, namely, its alleged ability to reduce spots on the skin and even out one&#x27;s skin tone.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products for my brown spots and after investing a lot of time they did not work.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely dubious.</li>
            <li> That and being dark-skinned has given me woefully extensive experience with treatments for the dark spots that acne pimples almost always leave behind, especially on people of color.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I did not have any problem with the fragrance; it is subtle and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Over a period of 4 weeks it did fade dark spots somewhat.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount of Phyto 5 as part of my daily regimen to a few brown spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> the pigment is slowly fading from a dark red to a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> I think this cream compares well to other serums I have used; although, it is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just have the type of spots that this product doesn&#x27;t lighten (lifelong freckles, but also later-in-life-developed spots due to sun damage), but I noticed no difference after using this product for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little misleading to say it&#x27;s certified organic or to just list the organic ingredients on the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it has effected my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this cream for uneven pigmentation as a result of acne.</li>
            <li> On my skin it does sting very slightly.</li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes, my skin feels ever so slightly irritated -- does that mean this cream is having an effect?&lt;br</li>
            <li> cream comes in a small pump bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> plastic pump bottle dispenses just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes in a small container with a convenient dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I will not know the effects until 6-8 weeks, so hard to comment on that.  </li>
            <li> At least I can rest assured that it is \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Which might mean we are going to have to start spending the money on it...</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t think this product did anything in that regard for me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My partner has been very happy with this product. Which might mean we are going to have to start spending the money on it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- skin is more even toned&lt;br /&gt;- skin is soft&lt;br /&gt;- skin is more radiant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- $75 pricey&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles and such&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall she is very happy and says she has noticed all these changes and is considering moving away from an Olay cream she uses to this one permanently</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a 3* rating and will update after a month of use. It is impossible to review the effectiveness until it has been used for some time. I am currently applying it daily to some brown spots I have on my legs. If it works and I do not have any sensitivity then I will try it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The pump on the container is convenient but I feel it pumps out too much of the cream. It would probably be considered a good amount for the entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is long. The most concerning was the parfum fragrance. I do not like the fragrance. There is no need for it, why do companies use it? There is also a few different alcohols including, benzyl alcohol which is known for causing allergic reactions. I did know this when choosing the product because Amazon lists it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products for my brown spots and after investing a lot of time they did not work. I am actually hopeful this will. Will update in a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hypo-pigmentation issues associated with occasional but at times moderately severe acne outbreaks since early adolescence. That and being dark-skinned has given me woefully extensive experience with treatments for the dark spots that acne pimples almost always leave behind, especially on people of color. Though I&#x27;m still new to this Resolut product, it is helping to shorten the time it takes for those dark spots to fade out, far better than any other over the counter treatment I&#x27;ve tried. I usr it as part of a varied skin regimen that includes periodic facial peels, a bath srub-brush to exfoliate the back, my major problem area ,and the steam room at the gym to deep-clean the skin and exfoliate the entire body. I&#x27;ve integrated this spot treatment into the process to help fade out occasional acne dark spots that might appear on shoulders, arms or chest and it does help. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs very nicely into my skin.  I am using it for sun spots that developed through the years. ... I appreciate the natural ingredients, as I am careful what kind of chemicals I put on my body, as most get absorbed into your body.  I will not know the effects until 6-8 weeks, so hard to comment on that.  I will update on the pigmentation issue.&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging and pump system.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I dinged one point was because the smell of the cream is not to my liking... I would prefer a cream which has no odor, as its purpose is not as a fragrance.  Everyone has such varied preferences in what smells good / bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband. He has some age spots around the sides of his face. The pump dispenses just enough for one application. The product is creamy, but not overly gooey. It does have a flowery smell. After applying it to his dark spots for a couple of weeks, he has seen a definite improvement. Most importantly, his skin has not experienced any adverse reactions to the product. Overall, he is happy with the cream and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The Phyto5 Pigmentation and Spot Treatment Cream is an organic cream to lighten spots.  It is non-greasy and is easily absorbed into the skin.  The instructions state that for best results it should be used twice a day for 4 to 8 weeks depending on the pigmentation spots. Over a period of 4 weeks it did fade dark spots somewhat.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling cream with a pleasant scent, but after 4 weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of the sun/age spots on my chest and hands.  But I did notice an improvement in the spots and inflammation associated with my rosacea/acne.  The cream seamed to quicken the healing process and the fading of the redness associated with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me it worked on acne hyperpigmentation but it didn&#x27;t help with my real worry: the age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8-2-2015&lt;br /&gt;In the last few days my brown age spots have begun to faded.  The change is not dramatic but the improvement is enough to get me to buy another bottom of the cream to see if the spots continue to fade.</li>
            <li> I love this as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about a month. I&#x27;m not sure that it has effected my dark spots. However, in the midst of summer, it may have helped keep them from spreading. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. It has a rich formula which is great as an extra moisturizer step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Phyto 5 is a fantastic solution for minimizing pigmentation due to aging and skin exposure. I applied a small amount of Phyto 5 as part of my daily regimen to a few brown spots on my skin. After several weeks, my skin tone and color looks far more uniform than before; that is to say, the dark pigmentation spots on my skin has been diminished noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Phyto-Bio-Ceutical is a manufacturer of high integrity. The Phyto 5 formulation features 62.7% organic ingredients with natural ingredients bringing the organic/natural total to 98.7%. I believe that&#x27;s why Phyto 5 agrees with my skin. I have absolutely no problems with redness, puffiness or any other kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly useful, effective and safe to use, I highly recommend Phyto 5 to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cream leaving the skin feeling moisturized, and there weren&#x27;t any side effects such as sensitive skin, rash reaction, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a small pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says &amp;#34;Certified Organic&amp;#34; but is this only for the main ingredients. There&#x27;s a long list of ingredients beyond just the organic components. It&#x27;s been pointed out by others as well, so it&#x27;s a little misleading to say it&#x27;s certified organic or to just list the organic ingredients on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past that hiccup, it&#x27;s a good cream and seems to be helpful working fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will want to make sure you have sun protection if you&#x27;re using this and then staying out in the sun for long periods of time as this can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This product came with precious little information. There were no instructions for application on the dispenser whatsoever. I studied the box, and finally found this under the heading &amp;#34;With anioxidant edelweiss.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s why I overlooked it the first time! It says, &amp;#34;Apply the cream twice a day after cleansing to face, neck and hands.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading the box, I noticed that the German word for pigmentation is &amp;#34;pigmentflecken.&amp;#34; This became my new favorite word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box didn&#x27;t say how much or how little, so I did the best I could. The cream has a slight fragrance which, thankfully, does not linger and dissipates quickly. The cream is not heavy feeling and I didn&#x27;t notice it after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking back at the Amazon listing, I see much more detailed information about the product, as well as better instructions for using it. Would have been nice is this was included with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the regimen carefully for a full 30 days, and truthfully, I cannot see any difference in the pigmentflecken. The Amazon listing says, &amp;#34;For best results, apply for 4 to 8 weeks depending on pigmentation spots.&amp;#34; I am obliged to review within 30 days, so I cannot at this time give a report on longer-term results. I will continue to use up the bottle, and if there are any improvements in results, I will update here.</li>
            <li> What I like about this cream:  It moisturizes well.  It absorbs into the skin well but doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this cream:  I am a male and I suppose this was designed for women, despite that not being made clear in the product name or description.  Why do I suppose this was made for women?  Well, unless you&#x27;re a guy who likes to wear floral scents, the fragrance of this is decidedly feminine.  Fortunately the scent nearly disappears after the product is rubbed in, but when I&#x27;m applying it the scent is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me get to the reason why this is a premium product, namely, its alleged ability to reduce spots on the skin and even out one&#x27;s skin tone.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t think this product did anything in that regard for me.  Maybe I just have the type of spots that this product doesn&#x27;t lighten (lifelong freckles, but also later-in-life-developed spots due to sun damage), but I noticed no difference after using this product for the past few weeks.  The product indicates the effect might take 4-8 weeks so perhaps I&#x27;ll notice some change down the line and, if I do, I will come back to update my review.</li>
            <li> This mostly botanical pigmentation cream is from the Ageless La cure line by Laboratoire Gibro in Fleurier, Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is white and creamy and has a very faint and slightly sweet natural floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains multiple ingredients such as shea butter and vitamin E that soothe, protect, and moisturize the skin.  The seaweed extract and phytic acid are intended to suppress melanin production and lighten skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a good quality moisturizer over time will lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic pump bottle dispenses just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Apply the cream twice a day to face, neck, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The Amazon page lists only the \\&quot;essential\\&quot; ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are 98.7% of natural origin and 62.7% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Lippia citriodora (verbena) leaf water, Rosa damascena (rose) flower water), aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol, octyldodecanol, glycerin (vegetal), Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, benzyl alcohol, cetearyl glucoside, C14-22 alcohols,  parfum (fragrance), xanthan gum, tocopherol (vitamin E), Undaria pinnatifida (wakame seaweed) extract, dehydroacetic acid, phytic acid, sodium hydroxide, Glycine soja (soybean) oil unsaponifiables, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, potassium sorbate, Leontopodium alpinum (edelweiss) extract.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this cream for uneven pigmentation as a result of acne. I&#x27;m a young woman and had acne as a teen. The marks are still visible but are not the light colored scars commonly associated with acne, they&#x27;re darker marks on my otherwise very fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle gives you just enough for one application per pump. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last but I&#x27;m guessing a couple months from the size of the bottle itself. The cream is light enough to go on easily and feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed. I much prefer this to heavy creams although it does take a minute to work in. On my skin it does sting very slightly. Sort of a &#x27;tightening&#x27; feeling. The scent is a light floral, not unpleasant but not something I would use as perfume either. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger but is noticeable just after you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only just started using it so I can&#x27;t get comment on how it works for my marks. My skin does feel more moisturized than before and the tone seems to be evening out which has me looking nicer without makeup on. Time will tell how well it works, I&#x27;ll update when I see results.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if there will be a noticeable difference in my skin (results are supposed to be apparent 4-8 weeks after you begin using it) I do like the feel of this lotion on my face, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. It also has a wonderful fragrance to it, light and clean. This is an organic facial cream and I prefer natural and organic skin care products, this is free of harmful ingredients that I try to avoid (parabens, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> This facial cream has immediate positive effects on skin.  It is a pleasant smelling and nicely textured cream and goes on smoothly and only takes a few minutes to become absorbed.  As a guy, I did not have any problem with the fragrance; it is subtle and barely noticeable.  I have used it after shaving and in the evening and have noticed a healthier sheen to my skin and a more congruous tone.  I haven&#x27;t experienced a miracle of anti-aging, but I do believe it has contributed to healthier skin.  It comes in a small container with a convenient dispenser.  Only a couple fingertip size drops of the cream are enough to cover my face, forehead and neck.  I think this cream compares well to other serums I have used; although, it is not cheap.  It&#x27;s quality seems to make the price reasonable if you are looking for something you can trust.</li>
            <li> I love plant based products, especially when they are made out of white flowers.  I never used any creams that used edelweiss, so I picked this product because edelweiss is one of the main ingredients.  In Europe, especially Austria and Switzerland, edelweiss flower is symbolic of deep love and devotion because young men risked climbing the mountains to pick edelweiss for their brides.  That fact added more to the mystery of the product.  Shea Butter is also one of the ingredients that makes this product very silky to the touch and yet it absorbs to the skin really quickly without leaving any oily residue.  Pythic acid, also pone of the main ingredients comes form wheat grain, so anyone who is allergic to the topic application of wheat germs should be aware of it.  However, Pythic acid helps with hyperpigmentation.  Although I am lucky not to suffer from hyperpigmentation, every now and then, I like to use products that help even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenagers can use this product to get rid of reddish marks from the (freshly squeezed) pimples, people with hormonal changes, sometimes have uneven skin tone and regular use of this product can help resolving that problem.  Beauty of the product is that it can be used on face, hands and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certified organic product.  European standards are more stringent than US standards on what is called organic, so if you are into organic skin care, this is a product for you.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been applying this to a small, old hyper pigmented scar (keloid) on my face for a month. the insert says to try for at least 4-5 weeks before seeing results, and it&#x27;s true. the pigment is slowly fading from a dark red to a lighter shade. who knows if it will completely fade away with continued use? i have sensitive skin and have not experienced any irritation. it has a nice, light scent, too; not medicinal in any way. 3.5/5 stars (rounded up to 4)</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream which, after it dries, leaves a very light sense of moisturizer on the skin -- not too heavy or annoying.  It is dispensed by a pump so is easy to use and apply.  After about 30 minutes, my skin feels ever so slightly irritated -- does that mean this cream is having an effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the package itself says nothing, the Amazon listing says to wait 4-8 weeks for effect.  I&#x27;m currently testing it on the back of one hand, where it will be easy to see if it helps with hyperpigmentation (the last cream I tried, [[ASIN:B003MX6FXI Nia 24 Rapid Exfoliating Serum]], made no difference after the prescribed time).  Until then, I&#x27;m giving it a neutral rating of 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what is annoying is how perfumed it is, I suppose this is because the second ingredient listed on the box is rose water (\\&quot;Rosa Damascena Flower Water\\&quot;).  To me, it isn&#x27;t bad, but is more aroma than I want to be emanating.  Also it reminds me of the cheap rosewater I&#x27;d buy when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, the box lists 22 ingredients (you can see them in one of the product photos above), and the order of ingredients is different than the few ingredients listed above, why the discrepancy?  One of the ingredients on the box is sodium hydroxide (aka \\&quot;lye\\&quot;), which from what i&#x27;ve seen on the web is used in cosmetics as a buffering agent. (Maybe that is why my skin feels irritated.)  At least I can rest assured that it is \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is an excellent product. I have also used  Phyto Peel and have been pleased with the results from both products.  The ingredients are from organic farming and the product is certified organic.  Phyto-Bio ceutical products are made in Switzerland.  Phyto 5 pigmentation cream has the antioxidant Eldelweiss, which of course I know from the movie The Sound of Music. Edelweiss is derived from Edelweiss flowers grown at high altitudes in the Swiss alps. The edelweiss plant contains phytochemicals such a chlorogenic acid (present in coffee) and luteolin which is reported to demonstrate antioxidant activity twice as much as you get from Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this light weight and fresh smelling cream to affected areas twice a day after cleaning your face. I started using only once at night on two sunspots on both my cheek and neck with valid results, in a short amount of time. The sunspot on my neck was the size of a pinkie nail and it has lightened considerably. I do not feel that my skin is either red or irritated after using.  I will wait until the fall to use over my entire face as I assume you need to be careful with this product if you are going to be in the sun, even using sunscreen. Keep in mind that Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is not inexpensive, however, you are purchasing a superior product that delivers and will probably not need to be purchased again.</li>
            <li> This cream from Phyto 5 goes on smooth; the pump dispenses just enough for one application and smells sweet and floral, but not too strong. It goes on smooth, but feels a touch (only a touch) oily going on, which quickly goes away, and your face is left feeling fresh and very smooth. Put this on a fresh, clean face for best results. I&#x27;m quite picky when it comes to what creams and moisturizers I will put on my face, but this one I really like so far: it soaks in nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it oh so smooth! Jury is still out on pigmentation, but I&#x27;ll update this review in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with Phyto products.  It has a light floral fragrance but it&#x27;s not too strong for me and I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances. My skin feels fantastic after apply Phyto 5 and it definitely brightens my skin and looks more luminous.  I put a drop on the back of my hands and my hands are so soft. The amount of cream dispensed when you press down on the top of the jar is the perfect amount. I love this cream!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for four weeks and see zero results. Instructions say that it can take up to 8 weeks but I&#x27;m extremely dubious. The product is nice enough, although the list of ingredients feels overlong and I don&#x27;t understand why it needs perfume... But really it&#x27;s about the results here, and I saw none. Will report back after another 4 weeks if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
