            <li>are working harmoniously together wonderfully on my hair</li>
            <li>I looked on youtube and on amazon for the best bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for twist outs, braids, buns, you name it.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product for the price.</li>
            <li>When I say it was my best twist out ever.</li>
            <li>IT WAS MY BEST TWIST OUT EVER!  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair well moisturized and defines my 4b/c curl pattern perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a difference in my hair with regard to manageability and it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I came across Beautiful textures  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Maybe the product itself is great, but the smell of it is unbearable.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job moisturizing my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Great product for my 4c hair</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>It help moisturize my hair and gave great shine and hold.</li>
            <li>It works great on my twist outs and the price is bomb.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>It was a good size for the price</li>
            <li>I always get complements about how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li>but the bouncy curls pudding has this beat quality and price wise.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good..</li>
            <li>This smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>And my twist is nice and shiny with a good smell.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you&#x27;ll think it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I recommend to use the leave-in conditioner from beautiful textures - it has the same ingredients, but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I have gotten seven day hair from braid outs with this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair moisturized and nicely scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT GREASY, which is amazing because most curls creams are for me.</li>
            <li>Another benefit, the ingredients are excellent for natural hair.</li>
            <li>You would need a sealant or a styler on top before the gel.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>so good&amp;#34;. I wont because I know thats a preference thing, but i will say I love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>I get most of my hair tips from u.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling it leaves in the hair.</li>
            <li>I got so many likes on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a 3c/4a curl pattern and I use this mostly for braid outs and twist outs.</li>
            <li>It was an okay moisturizer I haven&#x27;t used it for twistouts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep it around for twistouts but as a moisturizer I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for one that is better.</li>
            <li>Then I apply the rapid repair on top of that and put the plastic cap on for another 30 mins...clean somemore.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and its a great product hands-down.  </li>
            <li>It tangles and mats easily.</li>
            <li>It is a good all around product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and i found the product very economical</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and its the best product line by far I am biracial</li>
            <li>Once a week rub a mixture of Almond, Jojoba,  Grapeseed, and coconut oils on my hair, I put a plastic cap on and clean the house for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>It is for real curlies, not faux hot roller &amp;#34;curls.&amp;#34; It smells amazing and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is for the most part naturally straight but after putting this in with another product it made my hair moist and curly.</li>
            <li>Really moisturized my natural curl and has a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>The product came in quickly.</li>
            <li>People get paid, and recieve free products for positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product not only moisturizes your hair but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This moisture butter is worth it imo.</li>
            <li>I love that it has Shea butter but is not heavy.</li>
            <li>I prefer the pudding over this because my hair is a sponge for moisture and the pudding is the only thing that can withstand the moisture suckage that is my hair, but this is a good product for smoothing for an updo or just a good refresh for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product for a month and honestly keeps my hair moisturized but only for a day.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to be a bit dry, so this product is great for my natural 4b/c hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Shot out to all of the natural BEAUTIFUL BLACK QUEENS</li>
            <li>I also felt i had to use more of this just to feel the moisture quenching feel that African pride gave me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ll have to see first.</li>
            <li>My first thought was Mizani...</li>
            <li>I make sure there is enough butter on the ends of the twist.</li>
            <li>Between the two i would suggest African pride bouncy curls pudding for very curly fine hair!</li>
            <li>I suffer from alopecia  and have been really trying my hardest to come up with a system to keep my hair moisturized, especially since I use rogaine, which drys my hair even more.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a much cheaper rate for 5.99 from a local beauty supply store off a whim and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of positive reviews on here to, so I decided to go with this brand.</li>
            <li>I really love how it holds the moisture in the hair so that the hair stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable product that comes in a large 8 oz. container.  </li>
            <li>I really like this for my 3 strand twist outs.</li>
            <li>CountyBoiWaver did a review of the BT moisture butter on youtube and it made his hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>I added some of that and real talk</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I have very curly 3b hair type</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I really, really like it.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my bantu knots and it really holds the curls.</li>
            <li>well their butter didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
            <li>Some straight black men want healthy hair too.</li>
            <li>I opted for this since I&#x27;ve tried over 15 products on my 2 yr old son&#x27;s long fine textured spiraled curled hair.</li>
            <li>This is my honest review for people who work too hard for thier money to be throwing it away on BS that dont work ( i know -doesnt work)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this happens way too often when I discover a great product.</li>
            <li>After I did a twist out, the hair is manageable, soft, and the coils and curls are so noticeable!</li>
            <li>I also have been drinking greensmoothies and adding almond oil and  flaxseeds to them and my hair, skin and nails are looking better everyday!</li>
            <li>my hair was sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>(blk/wht) and keeps my hair soft moisturized and tames my frizzy curls</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that you should apply it sparingly so that you don&#x27;t have too much product in your hair.</li>
            <li>I am a naturally curly girl who&#x27;s been natural for 7 years.  </li>
            <li>My curls were moisturized and so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I roll my twists on soft rods...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheaper alternative to some of the more expensive brands like Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>the next day my hair is soft, manageable, and my twists are defined.</li>
            <li>So I have been wearing my hair natural for about 2 yrs, I do try to keep it in proctive styles like braids or flat twist.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally currly and dry, so I wanted to improve on how I was caring for it.</li>
            <li>My hair is left soft and moisturized all day long, not minutes like normally with other products.  </li>

            <li> My hair is naturally currly and dry, so I wanted to improve on how I was caring for it.</li>
            <li> My hair is left soft and moisturized all day long, not minutes like normally with other products.  </li>
            <li> feel coated and dirty which prompts me to shampoo my hair more often.  </li>
            <li> I get the hold I want, but my hair ends up a bit dry.</li>
            <li> but it gets nappy and dry.</li>
            <li> When I take the twist down it has such definition</li>
            <li> I have very dry, course hair and have not had a perm in almost two years.</li>
            <li> I wet his hair and use about a silver dollar sized amount in his hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent triple the price on other products that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> I think he&#x27;s mixed B/W, but not sure.</li>
            <li> BUT...its not better than that product,they are very similar in smell and everything</li>
            <li> I was mad excited yo.</li>
            <li> I spent less than $6 for it at Sally&#x27;s because I had a 15% off coupon.</li>
            <li> She has veerryyy thick frizzy hair and says this is the only brand of products that tames it.</li>
            <li> I have dry, kinky hair that sucks up moisture</li>
            <li> Then I twist my hair with the curly pudding and and moisture butter with a little of the silken oil....</li>
            <li> I usually just use a leave in conditioner and gel.</li>
            <li> I usually reapply every couple of days because my hair is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> I know its hard to trust online reviews.</li>
            <li> and I have falling for at least 5 of the products.</li>
            <li> Im on a budget and 15 bucks for soemthing that ill be using on a regular is unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> But seriously you have to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe tho!</li>
            <li> I transitioned from relaxed hair abt 3yrs ago and until I found this product line my hair was very hard to maintain now</li>
            <li> my African-American behind had some Dominican in me.</li>
            <li> Seriously it&#x27;s disgusting, impossible to stand it for the one who&#x27;s using it and for the one who&#x27;s next to.</li>
            <li> When doing a two-strand twist, the hair looks shiny and this cream doesn&#x27;t leave nasty build up like some other products (</li>

            <li> Best product that I have used over anything.  I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and its a great product hands-down.  My hair is left soft and moisturized all day long, not minutes like normally with other products.  I read the ingredients and the aloe vera, coconut, olive, soy and I&#x27;m a fan of argan oil, shea and mango butter are working harmoniously together wonderfully on my hair and I didn&#x27;t have to spend over $7 to achieve it.</li>
            <li> I really like this for my 3 strand twist outs. I would not use this for Wash and go with eco styler gel or any gel by itself. You would need a sealant or a styler on top before the gel.</li>
            <li> is the truth. Black male with a decent grade of hair, but can definetely get nappy if I dont take care of it. Working on my 360 wave pattern and needed to add moisture so my search began. I looked on youtube and on amazon for the best bang for my buck. CountyBoiWaver did a review of the BT moisture butter on youtube and it made his hair really shiny. I think he&#x27;s mixed B/W, but not sure. I read a lot of positive reviews on here to, so I decided to go with this brand. MAN IM GLAD I DID!!! I knew it was coming todayso i shampooed my hair this morning and when it arrived I put a generous amount in because I knew my hair was thirsty. I also got the shine and silken growth oil (shampoo and leave in) as well. I added some of that and real talk my hair was sooooo soft. Im not even playin, it was instant. People always say products &amp;#34;smell so good&amp;#34;. I wont because I know thats a preference thing, but i will say I love the way this stuff smells. Its hard to describe tho! I know its hard to trust online reviews. People get paid, and recieve free products for positive reviews. I didnt get any of that. This is my honest review for people who work too hard for thier money to be throwing it away on BS that dont work ( i know -doesnt work) lol. This moisture butter is worth it imo. If I notice any negatives I will be updating this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Shot out to all of the natural BEAUTIFUL BLACK QUEENS (coffee w/ cream too) doin reviews on YT about all of this stuff. I get most of my hair tips from u. Dont even trip. Some straight black men want healthy hair too. Yeeainknow!!! Later on</li>
            <li> Maybe the product itself is great, but the smell of it is unbearable. Seriously it&#x27;s disgusting, impossible to stand it for the one who&#x27;s using it and for the one who&#x27;s next to. I recommend to use the leave-in conditioner from beautiful textures - it has the same ingredients, but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Really moisturized my natural curl and has a pleasant odor.  It was a good size for the price and i found the product very economical</li>
            <li> This product does a great job moisturizing my hair and scalp. My hair tends to be a bit dry, so this product is great for my natural 4b/c hair!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling it leaves in the hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s creamy and smells like heaven. I always get complements about how good my hair smells. I use this pudding after deep conditioning and for styling purposes. It&#x27;s perfect for twist outs, braids, buns, you name it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and its the best product line by far I am biracial (blk/wht) and keeps my hair soft moisturized and tames my frizzy curls I absolutely love it!! I transitioned from relaxed hair abt 3yrs ago and until I found this product line my hair was very hard to maintain now I have the curls I&#x27;ve been wanting</li>
            <li> I usually just use a leave in conditioner and gel. I get the hold I want, but my hair ends up a bit dry. I used the moisture butter after the leave in and then used an argan oil serum and topped it with my Eco styler argan gel. This product made my hair soft and moisturized. It&#x27;s NOT GREASY, which is amazing because most curls creams are for me. I love that it has Shea butter but is not heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is for the most part naturally straight but after putting this in with another product it made my hair moist and curly. This was while my hair was about 1 inch long.&lt;br /&gt;I cut ky hair and now I&#x27;m using it as wave cream . It&#x27;s not doing to well haha but that&#x27;s not what this product is made for. I would buy again</li>
            <li> This reminds me of African pride bouncy curls pudding BUT...its not better than that product,they are very similar in smell and everything but i couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair as well with this than the curly pudding.I also felt i had to use more of this just to feel the moisture quenching feel that African pride gave me. I have very curly 3b hair type and it moisturized and smelled well but the bouncy curls pudding has this beat quality and price wise. Between the two i would suggest African pride bouncy curls pudding for very curly fine hair!</li>
            <li> This product not only moisturizes your hair but it smells amazing. I really love how it holds the moisture in the hair so that the hair stays moisturized all day long. I would definitely recommend this product for all naturalistas!!!</li>
            <li> Did not like AT ALL.....can&#x27;t deal with returning it..</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Sally and I did a two strand twist.  And my twist is nice and shiny with a good smell. When I take the twist down it has such definition it&#x27;s not even funny.  Great product for my 4c hair</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for the price. Seriouly! Im on a budget and 15 bucks for soemthing that ill be using on a regular is unrealistic.  It held my twist out for a week. A WEEK. I was mad excited yo. When I say it was my best twist out ever. IT WAS MY BEST TWIST OUT EVER!  I got so many likes on Facebook.  Lol. My hair doesn&#x27;t go in to the fro id like but it gets nappy and dry. It help moisturize my hair and gave great shine and hold. When I wore it up I swore my African-American behind had some Dominican in me. Si.  Haha. But seriously you have to give it a try. P.s its cheaper in the hair store than here.  I got mine for 5.99.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, course hair and have not had a perm in almost two years. I suffer from alopecia  and have been really trying my hardest to come up with a system to keep my hair moisturized, especially since I use rogaine, which drys my hair even more. Well, I can finally say I have found it!!!! I  use this prodict in conjunction with coconut oil as my sealer in between my co wash days and I can say that my hair feels like it just had a nice cold drink. I bought this at a much cheaper rate for 5.99 from a local beauty supply store off a whim and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is for real curlies, not faux hot roller &amp;#34;curls.&amp;#34; It smells amazing and is not greasy.  I really, really like it.  Curls hold but are not crunchy.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I purchased this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty, while looking for an inexpensive moisturizer. I have a 3c/4a curl pattern and I use this mostly for braid outs and twist outs. It leaves my hair moisturized and nicely scented. My hair is shinny and holds for the day. I usually reapply every couple of days because my hair is prone to dryness. Amazingly, I have gotten seven day hair from braid outs with this product. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheaper alternative to some of the more expensive brands like Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair moisturized for a week! It works great on my twist outs and the price is bomb. I&#x27;ve spent triple the price on other products that don&#x27;t do a thing. This and the curl control are boss in my slew of hair products!</li>
            <li> The product came in quickly. However, one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the smell. When you first use it, you&#x27;ll think it smells wonderful but after a while it becomes overpowering. It was an okay moisturizer I haven&#x27;t used it for twistouts so i&#x27;ll have to see first. As for enhancing curls, I can definitely say it does its job; it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to the hair. Another benefit, the ingredients are excellent for natural hair. I&#x27;ll probably keep it around for twistouts but as a moisturizer I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for one that is better.</li>
            <li> Like one of the reviewers mentioned earlier, I too purchased this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and I have to say, this product is a God-send! It moisturizes my 4B tresses without leaving a greasy feel. When doing a two-strand twist, the hair looks shiny and this cream doesn&#x27;t leave nasty build up like some other products (As I Am, Kinky Curly, etc,). After I did a twist out, the hair is manageable, soft, and the coils and curls are so noticeable! The scent is like a tropical, island fragrance. My only suggestion is that you should apply it sparingly so that you don&#x27;t have too much product in your hair. Overall, I would recommend this above all else!</li>
            <li> I am a naturally curly girl who&#x27;s been natural for 7 years.  This product keeps my hair well moisturized and defines my 4b/c curl pattern perfectly.  It does not leave my hair crunchy.  It is a good all around product that I would highly recommend. My only concern is that they will change the formula or take it off the market. Unfortunately this happens way too often when I discover a great product.</li>
            <li> I opted for this since I&#x27;ve tried over 15 products on my 2 yr old son&#x27;s long fine textured spiraled curled hair. It tangles and mats easily. Mixed chicks products are pricey. This stuff smells good..I wet his hair and use about a silver dollar sized amount in his hair. It controls the frizz and defines his curls. I like it!</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good. I used this for my bantu knots and it really holds the curls. My curls were moisturized and so soft and shiny. I&#x27;m going to buy the shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner now!</li>
            <li> So I have been wearing my hair natural for about 2 yrs, I do try to keep it in proctive styles like braids or flat twist. My hair is naturally currly and dry, so I wanted to improve on how I was caring for it. My first thought was Mizani...well their butter didn&#x27;t do much for me at all. I came across Beautiful textures  and I have falling for at least 5 of the products. Once a week rub a mixture of Almond, Jojoba,  Grapeseed, and coconut oils on my hair, I put a plastic cap on and clean the house for 15 mins. Then I apply the rapid repair on top of that and put the plastic cap on for another 30 mins...clean somemore. I rinse all of that out and then wash the hair with the detanling shampoo. I follow up with the leave in conidtioner. Then I twist my hair with the curly pudding and and moisture butter with a little of the silken oil.... I make sure there is enough butter on the ends of the twist. I roll my twists on soft rods... the next day my hair is soft, manageable, and my twists are defined. I have stopped \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair with the exception of this shampoo. If I feel build up, I co-wash(or wash with conditioners) I also have been drinking greensmoothies and adding almond oil and  flaxseeds to them and my hair, skin and nails are looking better everyday!</li>
            <li> Just purchased this product yesterday and I love it.  I immediately noticed a difference in my hair with regard to manageability and it smells wonderful.  This is a very affordable product that comes in a large 8 oz. container.  I would definitely purchase this again.  I spent less than $6 for it at Sally&#x27;s because I had a 15% off coupon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my step sister. She swears by this stuff. She has veerryyy thick frizzy hair and says this is the only brand of products that tames it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the pudding over this because my hair is a sponge for moisture and the pudding is the only thing that can withstand the moisture suckage that is my hair, but this is a good product for smoothing for an updo or just a good refresh for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have dry, kinky hair that sucks up moisture but at the same time cannot retain it.  I purchased this with the hopes that it can help retain moisture.  I have tried this product for a month and honestly keeps my hair moisturized but only for a day.  Plus it leaves my hair feel coated and dirty which prompts me to shampoo my hair more often.  I gave it away to a friend who I hope it works for.  She has a looser hair type than I do.</li>
