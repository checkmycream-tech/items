            <li>Even if you&#x27;re buying it just to look at it, the paint I am not even sure it is that, was peeling and discoloring.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price, awesome</li>
            <li>I also use CHI Silk Infusion, which smells wonderful  and its the only thing I used when straightening.</li>
            <li>Lives your hair silky  with a beautiful  natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>your hair silky  with a beautiful  natural look.</li>
            <li>and I both use it, and we are both 100% natural, and for the price I paid, it is really a great product.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job than my daughters original CHI.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and light,very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>This one she has had no problems and it is easy to use with her hair.</li>
            <li>I liked it because its heat up very fast</li>
            <li>and used it for the first time yesterday, amazing</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener several months ago and it has been a great investment.  </li>
            <li>I tried going the cheap route.</li>
            <li>Get cheap results.  </li>
            <li>and it makes the hair smooth</li>
            <li>Great value, would definitely buy again and recommend.  </li>
            <li>it was a gift, my friend love how fast she do Her hair (curly curly hair)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot so make sure you set the temp at the right place</li>
            <li>Straightens hair easily and fast.</li>
            <li>but this straightener leaves my hair soft and silky and very smooth.</li>
            <li>She did not find the turn dial useful and the lack of a locking mechanism was not a plus.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a scam by how cheap this is selling, but no, its real!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it, everything I expected and more.  </li>
            <li>This item I got for a very good price!It&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
            <li>The inside packaging was a little messed up, but very nice straightener.</li>
            <li>Works good to straighten or curl slightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many flat irons in the past, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Get a better straightener if you actually need one.</li>
            <li>order arrived on time and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely zebra design, controlled temp, and solid ceramic plates.(Less damaging to hair).</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this flat iron performs better than chi.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and hot enough to straighten my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for your mother, daughter, cousin, step sister, sister in law, or anyone with hair really.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I do not know how this straightener sells for $300 on the actual website unless this is a super cheap low grade knockoff.</li>
            <li>I expected it to work better than my 3 year old straightener I bought from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I have long thick, frizzy, wavy hair (almost waist length) and this straightener glides through my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it only takes me about 15 min to get it all straight!!</li>
            <li>bought for my wife, she&#x27;s always wanting a new straightener , but once I bought this...</li>
            <li>that want was fulfilled and hasn&#x27;t wanted a new one since</li>
            <li>It states the straightener as being new.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and she has had a hard time finding a good straightner that can actually straighten her hair.</li>
            <li>She tried to be nice about it, even after telling me it smelled bad, burned unusually, that the &amp;#34;ceramic plates&amp;#34; or better yet &amp;#34;ceramic plating&amp;#34; came off and got sticky and gross.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li>Left her hair very soft.</li>
            <li>However the reason why it lost a star is if I straighten my hair the night before it will need to be straightened again in the morning which puts a major inconvenience in my morning routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes one pass, and leaves my hair soft, silky,shiny,smooth and frizz-free.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my mother, she needed a straightener. She tried to be nice about it, even after telling me it smelled bad, burned unusually, that the &amp;#34;ceramic plates&amp;#34; or better yet &amp;#34;ceramic plating&amp;#34; came off and got sticky and gross. She did not find the turn dial useful and the lack of a locking mechanism was not a plus. I do not know how this straightener sells for $300 on the actual website unless this is a super cheap low grade knockoff. I would not recommend it for your mother, daughter, cousin, step sister, sister in law, or anyone with hair really. Even if you&#x27;re buying it just to look at it, the paint I am not even sure it is that, was peeling and discoloring. Get a better straightener if you actually need one. This is garbage.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Great product!  Straightens hair easily and fast.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!! Love the zebra design! I have really long thick wavy hair and it only takes me about 15 min to get it all straight!! It heats up very fast and is perfect for when I am in a rush!</li>
            <li> Waiting I hope it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> This item I got for a very good price!It&#x27;s unbelievable! I got it 3 days after I bought it.It has everything it said even dual voltage w/c means it can be used for travel. and used it for the first time yesterday, amazing it glides easily and in does a good job even w/ only one swipe.It makes my hair shiny and soft.It is easy to use and light,very ergonomic.I gave it a 4 star because it caught my hair with the tip under the floating iron,it should have been a continuous plate all the way to the circular tip but nope so hair gets caught under the plate like teeth.Even so I am very happy with this purchase it cost $320. in the company and got it for less than $50. including S/H. I&#x27;m a very happy camper, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> 100% ceramic plates it excelent for my hair i have thin hair. Results of this flat iron &#x3D;shine and no frizz its excelent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter when she was in visiting and had forgotten hers.  She absolutely loved it and said it was the best straightener she has ever owned. Left her hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in August 2012, and it still works GREAT!!! My college-aged daughter and I both use it, and we are both 100% natural, and for the price I paid, it is really a great product. I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and hot enough to straighten my fine curly hair. I think if you had coarse thick hair you may need one that gets hotter than 425 or take longer with much smaller sections. Overall for the price, awesome</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy, thick hair but this straightener leaves my hair soft and silky and very smooth. Highly recommend this product. I think it does a better job than my daughters original CHI. My hair is so silky, I am amazed at how good it feels after using this product. I also use CHI Silk Infusion, which smells wonderful  and its the only thing I used when straightening.</li>
            <li> Works great. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> this thing is built to last and to do the job. if you have girls in the house this thing is a hit.</li>
            <li> bought for my wife, she&#x27;s always wanting a new straightener , but once I bought this... that want was fulfilled and hasn&#x27;t wanted a new one since</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener several months ago and it has been a great investment.  I have very thick, curly hair and it is almost impossible to find a straightener that works well for me.  This one did the trick!  It&#x27;s hot so make sure you set the temp at the right place so you don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Ripped through my hair.  Stick with chi. I tried going the cheap route. Get cheap results.  Their curling irons are quality though.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a scam by how cheap this is selling, but no, its real!  This straightens my hair in a shorter amount of time than I have ever been able to do!

            <li> That is my daughter liked it.</li>
            <li> It states the straightener as being new. I got the package on time but when I opened it the straightener and the inside box looked used.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed and Easy to use. Good quality product.  The temperature control is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave lines in your hair. Works good to straighten or curl slightly.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent iron. great price on amazon!</li>
            <li> The inside packaging was a little messed up, but very nice straightener.</li>
            <li> it was a gift, my friend love how fast she do Her hair (curly curly hair) I&#x27;m happy she love Her straightener</li>
            <li> I liked it because its heat up very fast and it makes the hair smooth and it does not stick to the iron even if you use hair spray.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl the way a pyt does</li>
            <li> I expected it to work better than my 3 year old straightener I bought from Walmart. It did not live up to that expectation.

            <li> Great quality for great price</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product. Pulls strands of hair when using. Wish I would have just bought the Chi!! Now I&#x27;m stuck with it because I didn&#x27;t get it returned in time😤. What a waste of $$$!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she has had a hard time finding a good straightner that can actually straighten her hair. This one she has had no problems and it is easy to use with her hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal. I am very pleased with my purchase. This straightener works beautifully. I have long thick, frizzy, wavy hair (almost waist length) and this straightener glides through my hair beautifully. It only takes one pass, and leaves my hair soft, silky,shiny,smooth and frizz-free.In my opinion, this flat iron performs better than chi. It has a lovely zebra design, controlled temp, and solid ceramic plates.(Less damaging to hair). The packaging is beautiful, too. Very high quality product. Well worth the money. I would highly reccommend this flat iron to anyone. I&#x27;ve owned many flat irons in the past, and this one is by far the best. I love it!!!!!</li>
