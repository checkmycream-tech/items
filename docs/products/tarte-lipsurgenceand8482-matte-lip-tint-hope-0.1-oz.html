            <li>it is a great lipstick for me...</li>
            <li>All five of those I have are like skittles bright.</li>
            <li>A good amount of product in the tube lasts me about a month to 3 months depending wear frequency.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a  mission to find a really good lipstick/lip gloss, so</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>A great advantage to this product is that you turn the bottom to get more...</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint flavor, and the product does moisturize the lips!</li>
            <li>It does fade nice and evenly though, and not splotchy.</li>
            <li>Love the color too.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more..</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>but I also put on gloss :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the smell (like peppermint) but not the quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to from this typically outstanding brand.</li>
            <li>I have hope and think it&#x27;s a lovely color.</li>
            <li>love this products...</li>
            <li>i use many colors in the tarte lipsurgence range...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best thing ever, but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone just flat out disliking it.</li>
            <li>Easily blend able  with glosses and liners.  </li>
            <li>I have a legitimate Tarte LipSurgence that came from Sephora and when I compare it to this product I can easily spot the differences.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product, I enjoy the feel of it and the result.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for worry free wear.</li>
            <li>thing I do like very much is it is not as bright as the other Tarte stain.</li>
            <li>I like the matte very much</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>Very cheap package for a $50 lipstick and a dis appointment from a brand such as Tarte which I just was beginning to appreciate.</li>
            <li>it also tingles your lips when you first put it on....</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase ot Tarte Lip Surgence.</li>
            <li>The color is good on my skin tone ( pale with an olive undertone).</li>
            <li>This feels very moisturizing and is lightweight, plus it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel some lip products have.  </li>
            <li>Soaks into the lips faster, and really doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is on your lips at all.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the color payoff  is NOTHING  like what I have seen from real Tarte products.</li>
            <li>I love the other ones, but this one....</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other Tarte lipsticks and they are fine.</li>
            <li>Although I love this lipstick stain, it seems this one is old and dried out.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful when I open it as to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall completely out.</li>
            <li>The feel on my lips is dry with just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>Lipstick only good, but when received has been broken</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same exact color several times before through Ulta.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The reason I like it a little less, is it is definitely more drying.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little lighter than it turned out to be, but I still like it very much.</li>
            <li>It has a very light minty scent, the texture is like a thin coat of lip stick and the color is natural and long lasting!</li>
            <li>This product is much lighter than it should be and the product itself has and odd smell to it.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is loose and comes completely out of the tube.</li>

            <li> Lipstick only good, but when received has been broken</li>

            <li> Although I love this lipstick stain, it seems this one is old and dried out.  I have purchased other Tarte lipsticks and they are fine.</li>
            <li> Love this color. My only complaint is that it was a little dry. Still looks great when you put it on but I also put on gloss :)</li>
            <li> Actually wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted but I like the product</li>
            <li> This product is simply perfect for me! It has a very light minty scent, the texture is like a thin coat of lip stick and the color is natural and long lasting! I&#x27;ll be using this product again!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same exact color several times before through Ulta. Sad to say, the texture and color were not the same as the times before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Tarte LipSurgence Matte Lip Tint.  Excellent colors. Stays on my lips for hours.  Easily blend able  with glosses and liners.  A good amount of product in the tube lasts me about a month to 3 months depending wear frequency.  The feel on my lips is dry with just the right amount of moisture.  I will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Arrived with top broken off; not worth the expense for damaged goods. Color bleeds and does not last long. D</li>
            <li> This feels very moisturizing and is lightweight, plus it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel some lip products have.  A great advantage to this product is that you turn the bottom to get more...no sharpening.  I&#x27;ve been on a  mission to find a really good lipstick/lip gloss, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  This is a good one.</li>
            <li> Love this. Doesn&#x27;t smear but doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. The color is good on my skin tone ( pale with an olive undertone). I highly recommend it for worry free wear.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, I enjoy the feel of it and the result. Personally, I thought the tone would be a little darker. However, I have used this lip tint twice and it has already fallen out of the tube. I wasn&#x27;t rough with it, and I simply opened the cap and out flew the lip tint. I&#x27;ve read several reviews where this has happened to other people as well. Be warned. I took a gamble and it happened to me.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. But I think I got a reject. It has a black mark on the bottom, which is suspicious. The lipstick is loose and comes completely out of the tube. I have to be careful when I open it as to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fall completely out. I have a similar Tarte product I bought from a brick-and-mortar, and never had this problem. Love the color and the smell (like peppermint) but not the quality I&#x27;m used to from this typically outstanding brand.</li>
            <li> I have 5 of the other Tarte Lip Tints and only one of the matte tints. I love the other ones, but this one.... I like. I have hope and think it&#x27;s a lovely color. I was hoping for a little lighter than it turned out to be, but I still like it very much. The reason I like it a little less, is it is definitely more drying.&lt;br /&gt;The staying power is the same as the other Tarte stain, not great. It does fade nice and evenly though, and not splotchy. It also does not settle into the little lines and cracks in your lips. Big plus for me. That&#x27;s usually my number one complaint about lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do like very much is it is not as bright as the other Tarte stain. All five of those I have are like skittles bright. This is a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;Same minty smell and taste (short lived). Soaks into the lips faster, and really doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is on your lips at all. I like the matte very much so I do not wear a gloss over it, this might help with the drying.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it, and will soon be getting the red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like matte lip products, give it a shot. It&#x27;s not the best thing ever, but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone just flat out disliking it.</li>
            <li> it is a great lipstick for me...this color, hope, makes your lips look just as they would if you were a baby...so i guess it gives you baby lips...it also tingles your lips when you first put it on....love this products...i use many colors in the tarte lipsurgence range...</li>
            <li> I have a legitimate Tarte LipSurgence that came from Sephora and when I compare it to this product I can easily spot the differences. This product is much lighter than it should be and the product itself has and odd smell to it. Additionally, the color payoff  is NOTHING  like what I have seen from real Tarte products.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase ot Tarte Lip Surgence. Now I can&#x27;t live without it!  It is long lasting and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Sent it back as the lip color fell out of the pencil casing.... Very cheap package for a $50 lipstick and a dis appointment from a brand such as Tarte which I just was beginning to appreciate.</li>
