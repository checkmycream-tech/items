            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Really nice finish, right color</li>
            <li>it worked great and all of a sudden</li>
            <li>I first found this product through a Mary Kay consultant a year ago, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty okay,</li>
            <li>I have to use like, a special technique to make it work.</li>
            <li>but I got a gift basket with a bunch of different products a while ago and loved getting to try them.  </li>
            <li>and it gives full coverage.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the color ;)</li>
            <li>I love using this foundation mixed with a bit of jojoba oil since I have exfoliation.</li>
            <li>This foundation actually covers up blemishes while feeling super light on my skin.</li>
            <li>- I use a flat kabuki brush to buff in a very small amount and then dust with light powder - this foundation holds incredibly well in caribbean humidity.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and makes my skin feel so soft, never caues break out and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Besides that the shipment was really fast.</li>
            <li>it looks really funky.</li>
            <li>The other tube seemed more liquidy and had a sheen to it.</li>
            <li>I gives you a nice fresh look and revitalizes tired looking skin.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth and stays put!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with the seller is amazing - even got a few small chocolates with my order along with a hand written note!&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li>but this type is new to me.</li>
            <li>it was more like the luminous wear foundation, not very good coverage.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and results.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Mary Kay makeup can be pricey, so I looked for it on Amazon and found it here for an AMAZING price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is well worth a few extra bucks to purchase a Mary Kay foundation brush.</li>

            <li> but, for me at least, it isn&#x27;t matte, it makes fine lines very noticeable if you make facial expressions, and when I try to pat it on my face it gets a weird texture, and if I try to powder on compact like that</li>
            <li> You will not be let down with this foundation.</li>
            <li> Not sure what changed with this product</li>
            <li> but i had been using for past 3yr</li>
            <li> i just started breaking out bad -</li>

            <li> Great price and exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> This foundation is fantastic!  I gives you a nice fresh look and revitalizes tired looking skin.  I love Mary Kay products.  I had always been suspicious about Mary Kay products but I got a gift basket with a bunch of different products a while ago and loved getting to try them.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and results.  This is great for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Product was damaged. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Not sure what changed with this product but i had been using for past 3yr it worked great and all of a sudden i just started breaking out bad - it was almost like my skin wasnt breathing. So i&#x27;ve had to discontinue use. I am now using Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my foundation for years. I ordered a matte-wear but I received a luminous-wear. Besides that the shipment was really fast.</li>
            <li> I first found this product through a Mary Kay consultant a year ago, and fell in love. Unfortunately, Mary Kay makeup can be pricey, so I looked for it on Amazon and found it here for an AMAZING price. You will not be let down with this foundation. JUST A TIP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is well worth a few extra bucks to purchase a Mary Kay foundation brush. It bumps up the performance of any foundation - so it makes this one just that much more amazing, and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what I wanted and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This make is the best. It looks so natural and makes my skin feel so soft, never caues break out and easy to remove.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and glad it&#x27;s still available!! Shipped super fast and they even gave me some candy and Mary Kay primer sample! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! Goes on the whole day and doesn&#x27;t cake and the price is great!!! Very happy purchased 2 just in case I couldn&#x27;t find the color ;)</li>
            <li> Really nice finish, right color</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff! Especially For My Oily Skin. Love the matte look!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this foundation - I use a flat kabuki brush to buff in a very small amount and then dust with light powder - this foundation holds incredibly well in caribbean humidity. Love it! goes on smooth and stays put!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with the seller is amazing - even got a few small chocolates with my order along with a hand written note!&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to buy this again.</li>
            <li> In lovvve with this stuff. It&#x27;s the first foundation that doesn&#x27;t feel thick. This foundation actually covers up blemishes while feeling super light on my skin. A+ Mary Kay:D</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love using this foundation mixed with a bit of jojoba oil since I have exfoliation. This foundation gives me great coverage!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Feels like your not wearing anything,  but the coverage is great. Been wearing Mary Kay foundation for years but this type is new to me.</li>
            <li> Amazing no sticky feeling feel like im not wearing makeup and it gives full coverage. I wear nc30 in mac studio sculpt this was a perfect match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great product love it ...</li>
            <li> Very good product, matte finish.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of this product. I ordered two tubes of the foundation from the seller. One of the tubes was the right consistency, matte wear. The other tube seemed more liquidy and had a sheen to it. it was more like the luminous wear foundation, not very good coverage. Even though the tube says it is matte wear foundation for combo/oily skin, it is not the consistency of the matte wear foundation.</li>
