    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has tea tree oil which is excellent for fighting fungus.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product with a variety of uses.  </li>
            <li>I think it works best because it stays on the nail all day compared to oils which will rub off.</li>
            <li>This is proving to be a very good product for me.</li>
            <li>An Excellent product and a good value...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon reviewers tipped me off to this!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do me any good.  </li>
            <li>I am fungus free!!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it locally; so glad for on line services!</li>
            <li>and it is amazing .I</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use it now twice or more a week to keep it in check.</li>
            <li>Could not remove product from toes; had to wait 3 days before I was able to scrub this product off.</li>
            <li>My nails are almost healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is made with tea tree oil and has no chemical smell like the Sally Hansen one does, however.  </li>
            <li>, I had never had that sensation in all my years of trying so many products.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more bottles and put one in my medicine cabinet, one in my travel case and one on my bedside table.</li>
            <li>Thank YOU LORD for providing an inexpensive product that has brought me relief after so many years of suffering.</li>
            <li>just love it .</li>
            <li>BUT LOVE THE WAY IT COVERS AND STICKS TO THE AREA</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Almost immediately, the itching and burning stopped and the skin around the nails seemed to seal better.  </li>
            <li>Used for a number of more weeks to keep fungus from recurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I can recommend this for many types of rash and blisters.</li>
            <li>Goo goes on smooth and dries quickly, smells pleasant and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I acquired nail fungus from the spines of fresh fish at a grocery store, not once but twice - both thumbs  - and the infection traveled to two more nails!  </li>
            <li>It was great to see my new nail grow out fungus free.  </li>
            <li>It is easy too apply  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>I liked it because it did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>The application is not as smooth with the lack of a nail polish like brush, but I use a q-tip to spread it around and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is way better cost wise than the laser which has gotten mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>I first used it with great skepticism and to my surprise my toenail started to become normal and eventually healed.</li>
            <li>It feels more natural and safe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various over the counter products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it caused a warm sensation in my groin</li>
            <li>Clotrimazole and tea tree oil don&#x27;t typically work well on their own against toenail fungus, but someone thought to put them together into this amazing formula.  </li>
            <li>Probably will need two more months for complete grow out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just use Blue Goo on its own, though:  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any success at all.</li>
            <li>I still have an infection on 2 toenails on my right foot.</li>
            <li>You do need to consistently apply it</li>
            <li>With patience, consistent application and at a fraction of the costs this will solve your fungus problems.</li>
            <li>and I followed directions and was consistent using it as directed.</li>
            <li>Leaves a white residue which doesn&#x27;t make it appropriate for daytime wear though.</li>
            <li>I first bought it in a store .It</li>
            <li>I tried antibacterial gels, hot water Epsom salt baths, lotions -</li>
            <li>The first nail is about 3/4th&#x27;s grown out.</li>
            <li>it becomes dry and leaves a layer on the nail that is white and does not wash away easily like a nail polish but not as shiny and nice</li>
            <li>and im seeing positive results.</li>
            <li>Anyhow... been using it daily for about a month now and the new bottom growth coming in on my toenails looks much better.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and really does the job.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything work this fast.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help much though.</li>
            <li>,I was very discouraged but still hopeful.</li>
            <li>After 20 days and using the entire bottle I was free of this yeast in my groin.</li>
            <li>After many tries and cleaning up as the bottle states, it did nothing at all.</li>
            <li>SO REALLY CAN SAY</li>
            <li>maybe it will take longer to see results but tea tree oil is working better on other toe...</li>
            <li>Stings a little when first applied, but sting is nothing that lasts more than 1 or 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to apply evenly, I use a cotton swab.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a toenail fungus infection for nearly 20 years, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from terbinafine to Vick&#x27;s VapoRub to Zeta-Clear to just tea tree oil, and while some of those have had a slight effect, nothing has worked as well as this magic combination.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much to help, and dries to a weird matte finish...not good for summer feet.</li>
            <li>Dries very fast to a white like film.</li>
            <li>those interested; I have been following this routine while using this product, and it seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use a clear product instead, twice a day, plus an apple cider vinegar and Listerine soak at night before bed.</li>
            <li>When it would dry off it looked like a wall with white clay all over it, made it impossibly to clean the nail.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the only thing that will get rid of fungus on my toenail!!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old bottle</li>
            <li>The people I know in the medical field said they&#x27;ve never seen anything work this fast, either.</li>
            <li>I thought ,with a name like BLUE GOO they can&#x27;t be doing much business and that was probably why I had never heard of them before.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for me and it keeps coming back again after a whole year treatment.</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I was looking at the many products offered by AMAZON when the ad for BLUE GOO caught my attention.</li>
            <li>Apply fresh Blue Goo, covering the entire nail and cuticle.</li>
            <li>Helps dry and heal open-broken blister sores very fast.</li>
            <li>I had a mild fungal infection on my left big toenail, and it is completely gone now, after using Blue Goo for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>Blue Goo is the only thing that worked, and it did it fast.  </li>
            <li>Toe nail fungus is pervasive and no other product I have used has worked as well.</li>
            <li>BLUE GOO WORKS FOR ME.I have suffered with what I now know as a chronic  yeast infection in my groin since I was 15 years old</li>
            <li>Blue Goo Nail Fungus helped me where no other product would.  </li>
            <li>i have tried other products that were way more expensive and didnt do much at all.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I will use this as much as a fungus relief that is clear.  </li>
            <li>I haved used it a few times but find it very messy and it will not be appealing to use with summer sandals.</li>

            <li> BLUE GOO WORKS FOR ME.I have suffered with what I now know as a chronic  yeast infection in my groin since I was 15 years old</li>
            <li> Blue Goo Nail Fungus helped me where no other product would.  </li>
            <li> i have tried other products that were way more expensive and didnt do much at all.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use this as much as a fungus relief that is clear.  </li>
            <li> I haved used it a few times but find it very messy and it will not be appealing to use with summer sandals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shower, scrub feet with anti-bacterial soap, dry feet thoroughly, scrape debris from under the nail, then use rubbing alcohol to remove any left over Blue Goo.</li>
            <li> it may be because I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Thats where I learned about this product after getting rash and heat blisters from my long extensive bike riding.</li>
            <li> Wash and dry the area, apply the Blue goo, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I combine it with Oregon Grape root taken orally in capsules (2 per day at least), and now my 20-year, deeply entrenched, highly resilient infection is 80% gone in just 3 months.  </li>
            <li> She gets sores and rash from sitting so long.</li>
            <li> Remains white deposit on my toes and it is hard to wash, it should be clear and not too sticky like a glue</li>
            <li> but you need to let it dry before putting on shoes or socks.</li>
            <li> Wait for it to dry, sprinkle anti-fungal foot powder in socks.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything with not much success, but since I started using this, I can actually clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li> Not convenient to use because it goes on as a wet paste and, in order to put socks on, you have to wait until it dries which is too long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this product works or not because I didn&#x27;t use it very long - it makes your toenails look like you painted them with whiteout!  </li>
            <li> I tried to protect area with firmly placed bandage but only for temporary relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ever hopeful with continued use that it will finally vanish, but have noted from other posters here that you need to keep using it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I prefer other products like Fungus Stop.  </li>
            <li> I have turned my other family member onto it.  </li>
            <li> After trying it on one toenail I&#x27;ve been looking for this stuff ever since because my other nail is now in need of it.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after reading other&#x27;s reviews</li>
            <li> it also has other uses as specified on the bottle.</li>
            <li> but it leaves your toes a little dry.</li>
            <li> Next day, the swelling was gone and it was hard to tell that I even had a mosquito bite.  </li>
            <li> despite all of the other review claims, I found this to be a freaking mess to use and saw NO effect.</li>
            <li> I like this product, except that it is unsightly on the toes, leaving a thick white film.</li>
            <li> It can take weeks depending on how bad it is, but worth it!</li>
            <li> (I applied about twice a week, less then the bottles recommendations) for about a year.</li>
            <li> I used this  on my nails and saw a slight improvement .But</li>
            <li> The itch stopped when it dried.</li>
            <li> Too messy.</li>
            <li> and that is where it stayed for a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> With very little thought or investigation I ordered one 2 Oz.</li>
            <li> Blue Goo is also difficult to wash off, and that is a must between</li>
            <li> I had a problem so bad that the cuticles completely disappeared on both thumbs and then even opened up providing a cavern toward a visible nail root on one thumb!  </li>
            <li> I did not like this product, it was hard to apply because it was to thick.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working but slowly.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> No more fungus!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, it probably made it worse.</li>
            <li> False advertisement it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The other, which was the worst of all, is clearing up slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Did not clear  uo, seemed to get worst.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on my moms really bad toes &amp; finger.</li>
            <li> I used this product for months and saw no improvement, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> im very disappointed, not done trying, but not got my hopes up with this product</li>

            <li> Seems to be working but slowly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the only thing that will get rid of fungus on my toenail!!  It can take weeks depending on how bad it is, but worth it!</li>
            <li> This product has been helpful in retarding, but not eliminating toe nail fungus. I followed directions and have seen improvement. I use it now twice or more a week to keep it in check.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply without making a mess. Could not remove product from toes; had to wait 3 days before I was able to scrub this product off.</li>
            <li> False advertisement it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Works on nails. Found another use for it. When I get mosquito bites they swell and itch and continue for weeks to bother me. I applied a dab of this product to a bite after everything else I tried had no effect. The itch stopped when it dried. Next day, the swelling was gone and it was hard to tell that I even had a mosquito bite.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse, and I tried for several years to rid my toenail of fungus and nothing worked.  Dr.&#x27;s ordered Rx,  which didn&#x27;t help at all.  Blue Goo is the only thing that worked, and it did it fast.  Wash and dry the area, apply the Blue goo, and let it dry. It lasts all day, and really does the job.  No more fungus!!  I&#x27;m stocking up now for friends and family.  My Podiatrist recommended it because it dries which discourages fungal growth.  Walmart no longer stocks it, so Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about two months and im seeing positive results. toenail fungus is persistant, you have to be diligent. i have tried other products that were way more expensive and didnt do much at all. im going to continue to use Blue Goo. it takes time to get rid of nail fungus.</li>
            <li> An Excellent product and a good value...</li>
            <li> I received the product well ahead of the advised of date. I had been using a different product and saw no results. With Blue goo I saw results within a week! My nails are almost healthy again.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Too messy. Not convenient to use because it goes on as a wet paste and, in order to put socks on, you have to wait until it dries which is too long.</li>
            <li> I like this product, except that it is unsightly on the toes, leaving a thick white film. I prefer other products like Fungus Stop.  Blue Goo is also difficult to wash off, and that is a must between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a clear product instead, twice a day, plus an apple cider vinegar and Listerine soak at night before bed.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased this item probably over a year ago based on the reviews. I had fungus on about 3/4 of my big toe. After one year of use (yes, it does take time for your nail to grow out) I am fungus free!!  I have turned my other family member onto it.  You do need to consistently apply it (I applied about twice a week, less then the bottles recommendations) for about a year. It was great to see my new nail grow out fungus free.  This is way better cost wise than the laser which has gotten mixed reviews. With patience, consistent application and at a fraction of the costs this will solve your fungus problems.</li>
            <li> I am from Trinidad and I visited Florida in 2009 where I bought this stuff.After trying it on one toenail I&#x27;ve been looking for this stuff ever since because my other nail is now in need of it. It has tea tree oil which is excellent for fighting fungus. I first used it with great skepticism and to my surprise my toenail started to become normal and eventually healed. I fully endorse this stuff.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, it was hard to apply because it was to thick.  Maybe I got an old bottle but I have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with Sally Hansen&#x27;s fungus treatment as well.  I love that this is made with tea tree oil and has no chemical smell like the Sally Hansen one does, however.  So if I were to pick just one I&#x27;d definitely go with this one.  It feels more natural and safe.  The application is not as smooth with the lack of a nail polish like brush, but I use a q-tip to spread it around and it works just fine.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon reviewers tipped me off to this!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this product works or not because I didn&#x27;t use it very long - it makes your toenails look like you painted them with whiteout!  How&#x27;s a girl supposed to go to barefoot yoga class looking like that?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get by that, why the name? Anyhow... been using it daily for about a month now and the new bottom growth coming in on my toenails looks much better. Probably will need two more months for complete grow out. No change to the areas that were of an issue, but that is asking for a miracle. It&#x27;s kind of hard to apply evenly, I use a cotton swab. I will update upon final results.</li>
            <li> Clotrimazole and tea tree oil don&#x27;t typically work well on their own against toenail fungus, but someone thought to put them together into this amazing formula.  I&#x27;ve had a toenail fungus infection for nearly 20 years, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from terbinafine to Vick&#x27;s VapoRub to Zeta-Clear to just tea tree oil, and while some of those have had a slight effect, nothing has worked as well as this magic combination.  I don&#x27;t just use Blue Goo on its own, though:  I combine it with Oregon Grape root taken orally in capsules (2 per day at least), and now my 20-year, deeply entrenched, highly resilient infection is 80% gone in just 3 months.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything work this fast.  The people I know in the medical field said they&#x27;ve never seen anything work this fast, either.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to help, and dries to a weird matte finish...not good for summer feet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do me any good.  I was hopeful after reading other&#x27;s reviews but I didn&#x27;t have any success at all.</li>
            <li> works great for nail fungus cant find aney weare else</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with a variety of uses.  Couldn&#x27;t find it locally; so glad for on line services!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for three days but it seems to be working already.  My nails do not look as discolored.  It is easy too apply  but you need to let it dry before putting on shoes or socks.</li>
            <li> Remains white deposit on my toes and it is hard to wash, it should be clear and not too sticky like a glue</li>
            <li> Although claiming to help me with my case, I tried this product following the instructions but saw no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and I followed directions and was consistent using it as directed. Unabtrusive  powder finish. Didn&#x27;t help much though.</li>
            <li> despite all of the other review claims, I found this to be a freaking mess to use and saw NO effect.</li>
            <li> The only over the counter nail treatment I have found that shows signs of reducing nail fungus over time. Walmart quit selling this product leaving Amazon as my sole source. Evidence Amazon is not replacing local merchants just filling a gap they have abandoned.</li>
            <li> used for about 8 months and never seen a difference... maybe it will take longer to see results but tea tree oil is working better on other toe...</li>
            <li> Followed directions and nothing happened.  Did not clear  uo, seemed to get worst.  Bought another type of treatment at drug store and it is now clearing up.</li>
            <li> BLUE GOO WORKS FOR ME.I have suffered with what I now know as a chronic  yeast infection in my groin since I was 15 years old and I am now 75.I have tried everything that anyone suggested and nothing worked,I was very discouraged but still hopeful.A few weeks ago I was looking at the many products offered by AMAZON when the ad for BLUE GOO caught my attention.I thought ,with a name like BLUE GOO they can&#x27;t be doing much business and that was probably why I had never heard of them before. With very little thought or investigation I ordered one 2 Oz. bottle. When it arrived I put it on my bedside table and that is where it stayed for a few days. I finally got around to start using it and I was surprised that it caused a warm sensation in my groin and I thought well it is working, I had never had that sensation in all my years of trying so many products. After 20 days and using the entire bottle I was free of this yeast in my groin. I ordered 3 more bottles and put one in my medicine cabinet, one in my travel case and one on my bedside table. Thank YOU LORD for providing an inexpensive product that has brought me relief after so many years of suffering.</li>
            <li> I used this  on my nails and saw a slight improvement .But it also has other uses as specified on the bottle.It might be my chemistry because others have rated it favorable .Also it may be because I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my moms really bad toes &amp; finger. Leaves a white residue which doesn&#x27;t make it appropriate for daytime wear though.</li>
            <li> I like it but it leaves your toes a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using Blue Goo now for about on month and it is actually drying my nail fungus up!  I have tried just about everything with not much success, but since I started using this, I can actually clip my toenails.  I&#x27;m ever hopeful with continued use that it will finally vanish, but have noted from other posters here that you need to keep using it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use this as much as a fungus relief that is clear.  I haved used it a few times but find it very messy and it will not be appealing to use with summer sandals.</li>
            <li> The clotrimazole product I have ever used .wish they carried it in store I first bought it in a store .It is great it becomes dry and leaves a layer on the nail that is white and does not wash away easily like a nail polish but not as shiny and nice but it does the job and it is amazing .I just love it .</li>
            <li> Regardless of some of the comments about this product, I still decided to try it out and see if it would work. After many tries and cleaning up as the bottle states, it did nothing at all. In fact, it probably made it worse. When it would dry off it looked like a wall with white clay all over it, made it impossibly to clean the nail.</li>
            <li> This is proving to be a very good product for me. I liked it because it did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN GET THIS PRODUCT AT THE DOLLAR STORES FOR UNDER FOUR BUCKS,THIS IS MY SECOND DAY SO REALLY CAN SAY BUT LOVE THE WAY IT COVERS AND STICKS TO THE AREA</li>
            <li> I used this product for months and saw no improvement, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No miracle results here...unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Blue Goo Nail Fungus helped me where no other product would.  I acquired nail fungus from the spines of fresh fish at a grocery store, not once but twice - both thumbs  - and the infection traveled to two more nails!  I tried antibacterial gels, hot water Epsom salt baths, lotions - nothing worked for over 9 months.  I had a problem so bad that the cuticles completely disappeared on both thumbs and then even opened up providing a cavern toward a visible nail root on one thumb!  I tried to protect area with firmly placed bandage but only for temporary relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to go to the doctors but then I read reviews about Blue Goo and figured to give it a try.  So glad I did.  Almost immediately, the itching and burning stopped and the skin around the nails seemed to seal better.  Within days, improvement was noticeable and then within a matter of weeks the problem was controlled.  Used for a number of more weeks to keep fungus from recurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the nozzle to squeeze Blue Goo lotion to affected area along the the edge of nails and squeezed it under skin.  I also massaged the product deeper into the crevices between nail and skin  - contacting nail was unavoidable.  I read concerns about products not to be used on nails but there were no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Goo goes on smooth and dries quickly, smells pleasant and not greasy.  This is a very good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t resolved the issue with my toe nail.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.  Toe nail fungus is pervasive and no other product I have used has worked as well.</li>
            <li> used for three months now, i can tell no difference, i would not buy again. im very disappointed, not done trying, but not got my hopes up with this product</li>
            <li> No toenail problems, but this does help with rash and water blisters and heat blisters. I think its the ingredient Tea Tree Oil that is the miracle worker in this product. Not just for toe nails. I hear it helps with ingrown toe nails as well, to reduce pain and swelling and infection. But I can recommend this for many types of rash and blisters. Helps dry and heal open-broken blister sores very fast. Stings a little when first applied, but sting is nothing that lasts more than 1 or 2 seconds. Dries very fast to a white like film. Not greasy at all. Great for any area with itch from skin irritation or skin discomfort. I know on lady at work, sits at a PC all day, and is over weight. She gets sores and rash from sitting so long. This she swears heals and relieves those problems. Thats where I learned about this product after getting rash and heat blisters from my long extensive bike riding. IT WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with nail fungus for awhile now. This is the only product that seems to work. I&#x27;ve tried various over the counter products, and this one is by far the best. I think it works best because it stays on the nail all day compared to oils which will rub off. I had a mild fungal infection on my left big toenail, and it is completely gone now, after using Blue Goo for about 4 months. I still have an infection on 2 toenails on my right foot. The first nail is about 3/4th&#x27;s grown out. The other, which was the worst of all, is clearing up slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested; I have been following this routine while using this product, and it seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower, scrub feet with anti-bacterial soap, dry feet thoroughly, scrape debris from under the nail, then use rubbing alcohol to remove any left over Blue Goo. Apply fresh Blue Goo, covering the entire nail and cuticle. Wait for it to dry, sprinkle anti-fungal foot powder in socks. Also, remember to trim your nails once a week and trim them as short as possible.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for me and it keeps coming back again after a whole year treatment. No use. It&#x27;s waste of money and time.</li>
